the absorption of radiant heat by gases and vapours, arrived,
on some points, at very different results. Other investigators
also have devoted time and trouble to this investigation, and
in particular to the absorption of heat-rays by aqueous vapour,
without being able to arrive at any final decision.
   The difficulty of the observations in question, perhaps on few
other questions of experimental physics so great, as on this,
hardly permits the employment of a method entirely free from
objection; hence the explanation of the fact that hardly ever
do we meet with such differences, and even contradictions, as
here.   Thus, for example, Tyndall f finds that a layer of pure
dry air of 1:22 metre thickness transmits        the rays       all

    the contrary, finds that a layer of air 275 millims. in thick
    ness is sufficient to absorb 11 per cent. ; and, lastly, Buff"
    believes he has observed an absorption of 40 per cent. by a layer
    only 45 millims. in thickness. It is remarkable that these
    results are in inverse proportion to the length of the absorb
    ing layer, and so illustrate only the more strikingly the inex
    plicable difference in the results of such excellent experi
     menters.

     the present investigation.  If it should lead to the conclusion
     that the question can hardly be decided by absolute measure

     furnish definite starting-points for       decision.   Further,     its

   Without entering into details, we may remark that Tyndall
has shown that, with the source of heat in the experimental
space, currents of air and conduction of heat are unavoidable;
and this source of error is obvious.  Moreover, so far as the
literature of the subject is known to us, Magnus does not
                                                             º
return to this question; so that apparently he has himself
recognized this source of error.
    Buff endeavoured to avoid this error by rapid heating of
the surface which serves as source of heat; but the duration of
the experiment is always much too great, and, especially, cur
rents of air and conduction are not avoided. The most striking
proof of this is found in Buff’s tables, since the greater deflec
tion always takes place after the heating has been
for some time, which could not have been the case if the heat
radiated by the heated surface had been the sole cause of the
 deflection, as is required by the conditions of the experi
 ment.
    Garibaldi moreover employed a concave mirror to concen
trate the heat-rays; and we suspect that in this is to be found
 the reason of the incredible result which he obtained of an
 absorption of 92 per cent. by aqueous vapour.
    Tyndall", as is well known, first employed the second
 method. Since the space containing the gas is closed and
 yet must be open to heat-rays, the tube employed must be
 closed on both sides by diathermanous substances.           Tyndall
 employed plates of rock-salt.        Dr. Franzt had previously
 employed glass plates, which, in consequence of the great
 absorption which glass exerts upon dark heat-rays, must
 clearly lead to very fallacious results.     Tyndall's method was
 also employed by Wildf in determining the absorption of
 aqueous vapour; but since the arrangement was precisely the
 same as Tyndall's, the results must be open to the same
 objection.
    Since the perfect diathermancy of the plates which close the
 tube can never be attained, there must always remain a source
 of error in this arrangement. And even if the original objec
 tion of Buff’s, that rock-salt and air are of similar colour for
 heat-rays, is not confirmed, it is at any rate clear from Tyndall's
 own researches $ that rock-salt absorbs 16 per cent. of the ra
 diation from a lampblack surface, and indeed, as he expressly
 maintains, in opposition to Melloni and Knoblauch, that rock
 salt does not transmit        all
                            rays      equal proportion.
                                      in
    Buff has maintained that Tyndall found           absorption pro
                                                     no

4         MM. Lecher      and Pernter on the Absorption
same rays in almost exactly equal proportions.     The diather
mancy of rock-salt has always been examined in air, and then
the diathermancy of air between rock-salt plates.          This
objection is completely justified in the employment of Tyn
dall's method ; and it is necessary that the diathermancy of
rock-salt should be examined in vacuo. But our experiments
made without rock-salt plates have shown that Tyndall’s
numbers, so far as they relate to air, are perfectly correct".
...The employment of rock-salt plates may therefore be allowed
in experiments with dry gases, since the percentage of rays
          does not appear to be materially influenced by the
imperfect diathermancy of the rock-salt.
   The case, however, is altogether different with vapours.
Tyndall's numerous replies to the objection made by Magnus,
that on the walls of the polished tube and on the inner sur
faces of the rock-salt plates vapour-adhesion must take place,
are by no means convincing.
    We wish from Magnus's deductions from particular expe
riments, according to Tyndall's own data, to collect a convin
 cing proof of the magnitude of vapour-adhesion.       Tyndall
has remarked     that it may not be a matter of indifference
whether the interior of the tube be polished or not.         He
recognized that exact investigation alone can set at rest the
doubt whether the results will remain in the same proportion
 amongst themselves if the tube be blackened instead of being
 polished. It would have been the safest to make similar
experiments with similar tubes, in the one case polished and
 in the other blackened, and to take special care that all other
 conditions remained unaltered. . But Tyndall blackened only
 the half of the tube, and, in the experiment with this last,
 employed only a vapour-pressure of 0-3 inch, whilst in the
 experiments with the polished tube 4 feet long the vapour
   ressure was 0-5 inch.
    With such an inequality in the conditions, it can be only a
 chance that the numbers given in Tyndall's table for the ab
 sorption of the vapours examined are in the same proportion
 for the blackened and for the polished tube. Tyndall finds
 that it is only necessary to multiply the numbers found for
 the blackened tube by 4-5 in order to obtain
                                         -     the numbers for
the polished tube.
   Moreover the numbers given do           not agree so very well
together. Table     XVIII.f     contains nine substances, for which
the numbers are     as   follows:–

be closed and the other opened, communication is made between
M and the large tube, and the vapour contained in M expands
throughout the whole tube. This process may be repeated as
often as desired; and so the tube may be            filled with
continually increasing quantities of vapour.        The ratio in
which the vapour contained in M expands when it comes into
the large tube may be obtained from the cubic contents of the
latter, which Tyndall gives incidentally as 220 cubic inches.
For the sake of clearness, we will take an example (that of
ether-vapour) in Tyndall's own words. Let us assume that
M contained rºoo cubic inch:—“The vapours, on entering
the tube, have only the tension corresponding to the tempera
ture of the laboratory, viz. 12 inches.   This must be multiplied
by 2:5 in order to give the atmospheric pressure.           then,             If,
the 1000 cubic inch, whose absorption,        shown, can  asmea                be
sured, expands into    spacea     220 cubic inches,

    To examine the accuracy              of
                              this method, we will choose                             as

holes like a sieve; so that l is continually exposed to a current
of water, which flows over the edge of h and runs off by the
tube s. It need hardly be remarked that the temperature of
the water was observed from time to time.        In the course of
months a slight change occurred ; but during the time
occupied by an experiment the temperature was absolutely
constant.
    After the temperature of the whole has become uniform,
the little plate a is suddenly to be increased in temperature by
a certain amount. We sought to accomplish this by suddenly
directing a current of steam against a. In the arrangement
of the heating-apparatus it was necessary above every thing
to consider that the thin copper plate a in a series of experi
ments mustalways be equally heated. But since, in consequence
of the close neighbourhood of the large quantity of cooling
 water, the loss of heat by conduction was considerable, it was
only possible to secure equality in the radiation towards the
 thermopile (which was to be suddenly set in action) by always
 directing upon a equal quantities of vapour with equal velocities,
 and also in the same direction and at the same distance from
 a. Hence it was necessary that equal quantities of vapour
 should be generated in equal times.      Hence, when ebullition
 commences, there must always be nearly the same quantity
 of water in the apparatus M, employed for the generation
 of steam, and the flame should always be of the same size.
 The first object was attained by employing the arrangements
 for keeping M filled with water to the same level represented
 in the plate. The flask K, about five sixths full of water and
 inverted over the funnel T, has two tubes, passing air-tight
 through an india-rubber stopper, which dip below into the

 water in the funnel, and which terminate at different levels
 inside the flask, one just inside the stopper, the other reaching
 into the air in the upper part of the          This arrangement,
 as is well known, secures a constant level in the water in T.
    Each time, on beginning to heat the vessel M, the tube was
 closed at o by means of a clamp, which was opened again at
 the end of the experiment.     In order to have a constant source
 of heat under M, a manometer, m, containing petroleum, was
 used to measure the pressure of the gas supplying the burner
                                                      º
 2, the current of gas being regulated by means of the screw
 clamp y. Another manometer, d, indicated accidental excess
 of pressure in M. The production of vapour was allowed to
 become so rapid that the steam issued briskly from the
 end of the tube v.    This tube began and ended in glass tubes
 which were connected by a piece of caoutchouc                 and
 the whole was   wrapped   round with linen to  prevent premature

     The method of conducting the experiments was as follows:-
After the quantity of water in the heating-apparatus and the
         of the gas had been adjusted and the water made to
  oil rapidly, one           observed the galvanometer, whilst the

observer    atthe galvanometer the steam-tube was put into                                            its

versal-points besides were noted.            The whole observation
occupied about             1%
                      minute. We believe that             this way we                in

18            MM. Lecher and Pernter          on the Absorption
gas-holder, and this moist air then passed through several
wash-bottles into the experimental space, but with the same
negative result.  This result was so much the more surprising,
since all experiments show absorption of the heat-rays of the
sun by the atmosphere, which, since it cannot be ascribed to
the pure air, has universally been put down to the account of
the aqueous vapour.
   In opposition to this result is that obtained by Tyndall,
who found an absorption of 4–6 per cent. * with a source of
heat at 100° C., as also at higher temperatures.
   It was shown above that vapour-adhesion must take place
on the rock-salt and on the polished inner walls of the tube.
To this we have nothing more of importance to add ; only the
remark may be allowed that Tyndall himself does not con
sider his experiments in air, without a tube, decisive, and
that the reflectors of the thermopile were allowed to remain,
thus partially replacing the tube—an objection which applies
also to Hoorweg's f work.
   We would express in the form of a question a thought
which has frequently occurred to us during the study of this
subject.   Why did not Tyndall take the simplest way of
setting aside the objections of Magnus, and simply use a
blackened tube provided with diaphragms instead of the
polished one?     Why did he content himself with making one
experiment (in a case so readily open to objection) with a half
blackened tube, and then take his stand upon the proportion
ality of the action ? The matter seems so simple that we have
never been able to understand why Tyndall did not experiment
with blackened tubes.
     A   statement which     will possibly be quite convincing we
leave     till further on.
    In what follows we give the results of our experiments on
gases and vapours.
    As far as the first are concerned, our numbers differs very
little from those of Tyndall ; whilst with vapours we have
almost always obtained different values.     Many of them were

aqueous
              yº.  at a temperature of about 12°C. he gives 5% per cent.
Hoorweg (Pogg. Ann, clv.) found also an absorption for aqueous vapour,
though only about half as much as Tyndall gives. The method of allow

measured with the same minute accuracy and care as the two
already given, since we hoped to draw conclusions on the rela
tion between pressure and absorption. Nevertheless, from the
experiments with ether vapour, carbon dioxide, &c. this much
may be concluded with certainty, that the well-known law of
absorption                             J   = 100e-dº
does not apply here, since the coefficient a always becomes
smaller as the thickness d of the layer becomes smaller. Hence
the absorption is selective even with a source of heat at 100°C.
    The results will be discussed at the end of this paper.

the research of Jacques.)      The discrepancy will be still
further increased by the improbable assumption that absorp
tion takes place only in the part of the spectrum investigated,
and that therefore the percentages of absorption found are
distributed over the whole higher portion of the spectrum
without undergoing increase there.
      When, therefore,              Tyndall finds for any medium an absorp
          of a per        cent. by use  of a source of heat at 270° C., the

of the solar radiation.
  With the question thus simplified,       the discussion of the
meteorological results becomes very simple. The most accu
rate measurements are those of Violle", who, as is well known,
made experiments on the intensity of solar radiation on the
                                         foot,                its

summit of Mont Blanc and at                      the Glacier des
Bossons.    He obtained       absorption     an  per cent.   the     of                                 in

   We can easily calculate from this what absorption one metre

26          MM. Lecher                 and Pernter on the Absorption
cent., will appear altogether unintelligible (Hoorweg finds
1.5 per cent., and Garibaldi even 92 per cent; this last, it is
true, at a lower temperature); and still less intelligible the
constant reference to the absorption of the sun's rays by the
action of aqueous vapour—a fact which Secchi", for example,
amongst others, supports.   It is true that Tyndall employed
aqueous vapour of much higher tension than could be present
on Mont Blanc.
   The weight of vapour present in the layer of air between
the Glacier des Bossons and the summit of Mont Blanc may
be calculated by means of a formula given by Hannf. The
data required are the difference in height h =3610 metres,
and the tension of the aqueous vapour po, in millimetres, on
the Glacier des Bossons, which, according to Violle's measure
ments, was 5.3 millims. ; also the temperatures of the upper
and lower stations ti and    which, accordingtº, Violle's data,                   to
were 1* C. and 9°5 C.

certainly made up of many portions, possibly compensating
each other.     On this account the results obtained in physical
experiments are not applicable to the explanation of any mo
lecular condition of matter whatever, and in future the inves
tigation of absorption-spectra must be extended to the domain
of heat-radiation.
    These considerations induce us to attach but little value to
the connexion between chemical composition and absorption
which we have pointed out in this investigation.
     Hence it follows that a comparison of the absorption-coeffi
 cients of different substances is only possible at equal pressures.
 Since, as already said, in no one of the cases examined was
 there any regular connexion between pressure and absorption,
 we chose a graphical method, in which we represented the
 pressures as abscissae and the absorptions as ordinates. . The
 absorption-coefficients of the substances examined, which be
 longed to the fatty series (containing nearly equal numbers of
 molecules) were, for the radiation of a source of heat at 100°,

     Whilst the absorption of the substances placed in any one
  line            to us nearly the same (with exception of the
           .
 probably not quite pure acetic acid), the absorption appears to
 increase rapidly with increasing percentage of carbon; and,
 further, the absorption appears to be essentially dependent on
 the number of carbon atoms directly combined with each other
 by simple linking. Thus, for example, benzol, in spite of             its
 six carbon atoms, exerts only     very small absorption, pro
                                             a

    II. A       Relation between the Melting-points of the Elements
          and their Solid Binary Compounds and the Heats of Forma
          tion of the latter.  By THOMAS CARNELLEY, D.Sc., and
          L. T. O'SHEA, Firth College, Sheffield".
           HE    numerous determinations which have been made by
               Berthelot and Thomsen of the heat evolved in various
 chemical reactions have led us to compare the numbers so
 obtained for the solid halogen compounds of the elements with
 their melting-points and those of their constituent elements,
 as it appeared not improbable that some interesting relations
 might be detected between these physical constants.
     n the present paper are detailed the results which have
 been obtained by such a comparison.
    (1) In any chemical reaction such as
                     Ags + Cl2=2AgCl-H heat evolved,
the sum of the energies on one side of the equation is equal to
the sum of the energies on the other side. The chemical
energy of a body is measured by the inverse of the heat ne
cessary to separate the atoms constituting the molecule—or,
in the case where the molecule consists of but one atom, of
unlocking in that atom the affinities which mutually saturate
one another.   Therefore the inverse of the heat necessary to
separate the two atoms of silver + the inverse of that required
to separate the two atoms of chlorine = twice the inverse of
the heat required to separate one atom of silver from one atom
of chlorine + the heat evolved.
   (2) After many attempts to obtain a numerical measure of
the chemical energy of a molecule of any substance, we finally
came to the conclusion that it might be approximately repre
sented by the melting-point of the body in such a way that
the chemical energy of a molecule of any solid substance is
inversely as             its
                  melting-point measured from the absolute
 zero       (–273°C.).
    Before proceeding further, we wish expressly        state that        to
 the inverse    the melting-point

   From the above table it is seen that, by dividing the expe
rimental heat of formation (N) by the number in the second
column (M), a nearly constant number is obtained, which is
given in the last column.                                                     The mean of the numbers for                                                                 §
=2:46 or about 2.5, which latter has been assumed as correct.
On multiplying M by this number 2.5, we obtain the calculated
heats of formation as shown in the third column; and these
agree fairly well with the experimental heats of formation in
the fourth column. The bracketed numbers in the last column
represent those values of N which have been used in finding
the constant

     Inthe following table are given the percentage differences
between the calculated and experimental heats of formation:-
first (column I.), as referred to the experimental numbers given
in brackets in the last column of the preceding table; and
second (column II.), to the nearest extreme experimental
number, when the calculated number is either greater or less
          in all
than       the experimental numbers.      For comparison, there                                                                                                           is

employed in each calculation, thus rendering the latter liable
to three sources or error.
   (2) That the size of the molecules in the solid state, both of
the elements entering into the reaction and of the compounds
produced, are in most cases quite unknown.
   (3) That many of the melting-points employed are subject
to considerable uncertainty; thus those for Ba vary between
                         É.
450° C. and the melting-point of cast iron, those for Cube
tween 950° and 1330°,         for Ag between 916° and 1040°,
for Mg between    433° and 750°, those for Al between 600° and
above 890°, for  Cd between 228° and 325°, for Zn between
360° and 450°,   for Pb between 320° and 335°, for Sn between
220° and 24.6°,  and for Sb between 425° to 621°.
   (4) That the  high average difference between the calculated
and experimental heats of formation is chiefly due to large
errors in a comparatively few cases; for only about one third
(14 out of 38) of the whole number of instances give differ
ences above the average, and in 6 out of the 14 only one expe
rimental determination of the heat of formation has been made,
whilst in four of the remaining 8 the difference between the
experimental numbers themselves is very great. Further, in
8 of the 14 instances in which differences above the average
occur, the determinations of the melting-points of the metals
differ by as much as 100° to 400°C., and in the case of Ba
even about 1200°.
   On the other hand, in some cases it is only by adopting
molecules of a size different from that usually ackowledged
that numbers agreeing with our theory are obtained.     Also in
                                       in
calculating the ratio
                        §. we have          a few instances   used that
heat of formation most favourable to the theory.
   In the tables we have given       all
                                     the examples   which our
                                                         to

relation does exist     ornot requires confirmation           in

                                                     in   a

act directly   each other;
                        is     other words, we can show that

                                                                                             a
    in which some conclusions of mine relating to the explanation
    of gravitation, or the general phenomena of approach, under
    the kinetic theory of the aether, are noticed.
       Although some of the objections cited by Mr. Browne do
    not appear to me to be of much weight, and some will, I think,
    be found to be answered in my previous paperst,               will never      I
    theless comment      upon   a few  points  here.
       First, on page 440, a difficulty originally brought forward
    by Dr. CrollS, in a notice of my papers, is alluded to, relating
                      §
    to the porosity of matter required by the kinetic theory of
    gravity.    It should be observed, however, that this difficulty
    was considered by me (Philosophical Magazine, Feb. 1878),
    and a means suggested for surmounting it<U+017F>|.
       Secondly, Mr. Browne concludes, apparently rather gra
    tuitously, on page 441 as follows, viz.:-‘‘Hence our concep
    tion of the gravity-gas must practically be that of an indefinite
    number of                   small particles moving in          directions         all
    with  indefinitely   high   velocities—a   conception    from which                               it
    hardly seems safe         draw any definite conclusion whatever.”
                                  to
      It     scarcely necessary
            is                         add that the number
                                                   to               particles          of
    in  unit    volume, their dimensions, and mean" velocity, are
                 of
     not actually assumed            me    by     indefinite (but strictly
                                                         to       be
    finite).   Any   finite  values,  however    great,  are still       unli                an
    mited distance from indefinite values.                                             -
       Thirdly,       page 442, the fact
                       on                     seemingly overlooked that,
                                                             is
    according      the vortex-atom theory (alluded
                      to                                        the context),    to

                    W.       Implicational and Equational Logic.
          By HUGH McColl, B.A., University of London".
         ROF. JEWONS, in his new work, “Studies in Deductive
        Logic, of which he has kindly sent me a copy, refers
to my papers in ‘Mind’ and in the ‘Proceedings of the London
Mathematical Society’ in terms which might give rise to
some misapprehension as to the real nature of my symbo
lical method. He says that                             “I
                                        reject equations in favour of
implications,” and in so doing “ignore the necessity of the
equation for the application of the Principle of Substitution.”
    Now, it is quite true that I reject equations in favour of
implications in those classes of logical problems (and they are
very numerous) in which implications lead to the simplest,
 shortest, and most elegant solutions;            but there are other
 classes of problems, especially in mathematics, which necessi
 tate the equational form of statement; and in these I do not
 hesitate to adopt            The simple truth
                                     it.               that my method            is,

denote a statement, as in my system, or else each letter must
in both forms denote a quality or thing, as in Prof. Jevons's
system.   On the supposition that each letter denotes a state
ment, my notation exhibits clearly the very remarkable fact
that in the syllogism (a : 8)(8: y) : (2 : y), the very same
relation which connects a with 8, and 8 with y, connects also
the combined premises (2 : 3)(3 : y) with the conclusion 2 : y.
On the assumption that each letter denotes a statement, Prof.
Jevons's notation (as I have shown) could only show this co
incidence of relation in a very clumsy and roundabout manner;
while, on the assumption that each letter denotes a thing or
quality (as in his system), his notation could scarcely be used
in this extended way at all.
   The same remarks apply to many other useful and symme
trical formulae, which, so far as I can see, are altogether unin
terpretable   on Prof. Jevons's hypothesis      that each letter
should denote a thing or quality; while on my hypothesis,
that each letter should denote a statement, every formula con
veys a clear and precise meaning, which it is scarcely possible
to misunderstand.    Take, for example, the formulae:—
(1) (A : a)(B: b)(C: c)... : (ABC... : abc...);
(2) (A : a)(B: b)(C: c)... : (A + B+C+...: a +b+c+...);

                                                 c) w) =
     :  :

(5)           (b:a) a)     +... (abc...: w),
                               a)+     (c   :               :
(6)              + +
                  b)+(a
                         (a:
                            +...:        +b+c+...).
                                                                in of (a

                      to a paper by Prof. Exner, read before
                                                                       º,

number of their “Transactions’ for that year. This paper will
also be found reprinted in this year's April number of Wiede

   As then, this paper has been deemed of sufficient import
ance to be printed at least three times; and as the reasoning
employed in it is of so plausible a nature as to mislead a casual
reader, and to give him erroneous notions on the subject of
contact electricity, we have thought it worth while to draw
attention to the inaccuracies it contains.
   The calculation given in the Phil. Mag. for 1851 by Sir
Wm. Thomson of the electromotive force of a Daniell's cell,
based on the principle of the conservation of energy, is of
course well known.        The method employed, which was due
to Dr.  Joule,  is as follows:—The work done by a quantity of
electricity Q passing between two points at a difference of
  otential E is EQ. Now if this electromotive force is pro
#.      by a Daniell's cell, the preceding quantity of work must
be  equal  to the energy-equivalent of the chemical changes
that take place in this cell when a quantity of electriciy
Q passes through            And since this latter can

of the heats of combustion. This, however, as we think may
be gathered from Dr. Wright's paper, does not in the least
disprove the accuracy or detract from the utility of Sir Wm.
Thomson's, or rather Joule's, theory, but merely shows that

 *    Prof. Exner says that since the time      Kohlrausch “only isolated of

those even carried out                 by
                            Kohlrausch himself with metals appear       dis                                    to
agree with those    Prof. Exner, while they agree with the results obtained
                           of
by  other experimenters, Prof. Exner might consistently have included
Kohlrausch's name      his sweeping condemnation.

     Our results  given above by Prof. Hoorweg are in terms
                         as
of   a volt, and notin terms of the electromotive force of a
Daniell’s cell, which is the standard employed by the pre
                                                 º
vious observers.   To reduce our numbers to the same stan
dard, they must be diminished by about 10 per cent. They
become then :—

    From these numbers it will be seen that while Kohl
rausch, Hankel, and ourselves, although making the experi
ments in quite different ways, and with necessarily dif
ferent specimens of the metals, have obtained fairly consistent
results, those of Prof. Exner, with the exception of the
first, stand by themselves.           Nevertheless                          all
                                                            his results agree
with     surprising     accuracy   with the numbers required               his                   by

metallic connexion with the condenser.

 used, in which the ordinary water between the zinc and copper
 plates is replaced by glass, paraffin-wax, mica, shell-lac, &c.",
 or by dry metallic salts, such as have recently been employed
 by Prof. Hoorweg.         Mr. Brown's experiments, however, must
not be regarded as confuting Pfaff’s work of 1829.
    V. We are therefore reluctantly compelled to conclude that
 Prof. Exner's experiments described in his first paper are                                     in
accurate, and that their striking agreement with his assump
tion is due to a fortuitous combination of errors.           And it may
be observed in passing, that the same kind of conclusion has
been arrived at by Prof. Young, of Princeton, regarding the
result communicated to the Vienna Academy of Sciences, that
thermoelectricity is also due to oxidation, since he has recently
shownf experimentally that the thermoelectric power of metals
is the same in air at a millionth of an atmosphere as at ordi
nary pressures.

he reasons:—“The contact theory requires that the electro
motive force of a Smee's element should begin with a value
0.73 of that of a Daniell's cell ” [this is derived from the
heat of combustion of zinc in oxygen, the combination of the
 oxide with sulphuric acid, minus the energy required for the
decomposition of an equivalent quantity of water] “and then

or about what Exner found it for a dilute sulphuric-acid
Smee's cell".
    Secondly, as regards the variations of the electromotive
force of a Smee's cell, Sir Wm. Thomson calculatedt from Dr.
Andrews's experiments that, if we consider the oxidation of the
zinc and the combination of this oxide with strong sulphuric
§.
acid, minus the energy necessary to decompose the equivalent
  uantity of water, we obtain as the electromotive force of a
         cell 2,056,200 British absolute units, which corresponds
with 0-82 Daniell [with more modern data Exner gives 0.73],
since the electromotive force of a Daniell's cell as determined
experimentally by Joule is 2,507,100 British absolute units.
Sir William adds:—“It is to be remarked that the external
electromotive force determined for a single cell of Smee accord
ing to the preceding principles, by subtracting the chemical
resistance” [this latter being due to the evolution of hydrogen
upon the platinized silver] “from the value Jée, is the perma
ment working external electromotive force.        The electrosta
tical tension which will determine the initial working external
electromotive force depends on the primitive state of the plati
nized silver plate. It could never be greater than to make
the initial working force
Daniells   according

                                x 1670x e, or 5,444,500 " [2:17
                      to the above reduction], “corresponding to
the combination of zinc with gaseous oxygen, and of the oxide
with sulphuric acid. It might possibly reach this limit if the
platinized surface had been carefully cleaned and kept in oxy
gen gas until the moment of immersion, or if it had been used
at the positive electrode of an apparatus for decomposing
absorbed, by the liquid &c., and will always be noticed if the measuring
apparatus be only sufficiently delicate.    Such differences have nothing in
common with the great discrepancies referred to at the commencement of
this note, on the results obtained by Prof. Exner and by other experimen
ters for the electromotive force at the contact of metals, since the latter is
fairly constant at a constant temperature, so that any great discrepancies
in such measurements can only arise from errors in experimenting.
   * We are unable, from our results at present published, to calculate
exactly the electromotive force of Smee's dilute-acid cell, since, as
regards liquids, it was only with distilled water and with strong acids
values of the electromotive force of a Smee's

that the electromotive force of contact of platinum was measured in our
experiments. We can, however, from these latter approximate to limiting
                      the contact electromotive forcesof
                                                                 cell; that

water immediately before being connected with the zinc plate;
and then it could only reach it if the whole chemical action
were electrically efficient, and if there were no chemical resist
ance due to the affinity of the platinized surface for oxygen.
    “It is also to be remarked, that the permanent working
electromotive force of a galvanic element consisting of zinc
and a less oxidizable metal immersed in sulphuric acid can
                                .
never exceed the number 2,056,200, derived from the full
thermal equivalent for a single cell of Smee's, since the che
mical action is identical in        such cases, and the mechanical
value of the external effects can never exceed that of the che
                                      É.i.
mical action. In a pair consisting of zinc and tin, the electro
motive force has been found by                      to be only about
half that of a pair consisting of zinc and copper, and conse
quently less than half that of a single cell of Smee’s.”
    The alteration in the electromotive force of galvanic cells
|.roduced by gas dissolved in the liquid has been known for a
       time, indeed before the experiments of De Fonville, De
 Lerain, Marié-Davy, referred to by Prof. Exner; and we may
draw attention to some experiments of our own, which show
  "º.
 that the polarization phenomena in voltameters are wonder
fully influenced by the state of the platinum plates and the
liquid as regards absorbed gas".
                     Exner states that the contact theory requires
that the   permanent    electromotive     force of a Smee's should
depend on the nature of the negative plate, while the chemical
theory requires that it should be independent of the negative
metal; further, that his experiments agree with the latter con
clusion and disagree with the former. Now the first part of
this statement is wrong; for the contact theory does not require
per se that the electromotive force should, or should not, de
  end on the negative metal.       What the contact theory tells us
is that the electromotive force of the cell will depend on the
electromotive force of contact of every pair of dissimilar sub
stances in the circuit, and therefore will depend, among other
things, on the contact difference of potentials of the negative
metal with possibly a gas, the gas with the liquid, the liquid
possibly with another gas, the gas with the positive metal,
and the positive metal with the negative.          Further, the con
clusion itself to which Prof. Exner has arrived, viz. that the
working electromotive force of a Smee's cell does not depend
on the negative plate, has, like his other conclusions, been
disputed.     For Beetzt has recently published the results of

effect         on    the initial electromotive force; we are, however,
astonished that Prof. Beetz should find such great differences
in the columns headed “closed.”    Our impression has always
been that when the negative metal becomes sufficiently coated
with hydrogen, the contact between the thin conducting-layer
 ofgas and the metal was almost like that     pair     metals;                          of    a             of

and almost any negative metal would eventually act like con                                                       a

of temperature, by the passage from the liquid to the solid or
even gaseous condition, by mixture with other liquids, or by
solution, or even (within certain limits) by changes of che
mical combination.
    In regard to changes of temperature, however, it was
observed at the very commencement            that there was “some
influence, arising wholly or partially from dispersion,”"
which interferes with the exactitude of the law. In order to
obviate this, if possible, the calculations were made for the
least-refrangible limit of the spectrum, according to the
formula of Cauchy.        But it was found that these gave results
little, if at all, more exact than those for the line A of the
                                                                                                         I

solar spectrum. In our subsequent work, Mr. Dale and
did not consider it worth while to go through the labour of
this calculation; and my observations are always reckoned,
if            for the line A, whilst Landolt has preferred the a
of hydrogen gas, which is identical with the solar line C.
    In regard to the passage from one state of aggregation to
another, the few cases that have been directly observed are
fairly in accordance with the law f.
    In the case of mixtures of liquidsf, the conclusion that the
specific refraction of a mixture of liquids is the mean of the
specific refractions of                its
                              constituents       near approximation,

  It        found

    1st. Differences              of
                           other optical properties.—It        happens                     so
that   among    the bodies which     display  the  phenomena       cir                             of
cular polarization, there are several isomeric groups, and that
different members         these groups differ from one another
                                  of                                                                        in
their effect          on
                   the polarized ray.     Thus with respect         the                              to
different terpenes, C10H16, some                            of
                                           them rotate the plane                                            of
polarization       the right and others
                      to                        the left, and that  to                                      to
different   degrees;   yet  they have      practically   the same spe

this are to be found among the essential oils, as shown in the

are the mean of ten different specimens, for the citrenes of
twelve specimens, and for the cedrenes of eight specimens,

    The terpenes and citrenes show a constant though not a
large difference in specific refraction ; but the polymeric
bodies of the same series seem to have so nearly the same
specific refraction as the terpenes that the differences may be
attributed to impurities or experimental error. The refraction
equivalents of the three groups are of course very nearly in the
proportions of 2, 3, and 4.
    3rd. Differences of chemical properties.—In the cases already
mentioned it is possible that the differences of physical pro
perties depend upon some difference in the arrangement of
the ultimate atoms; but there are other cases in which this is
perfectly well known to be the case. Isomeric bodies of this
nature are more strictly termed metameric. Delffs showed,
as far back as 1850<U+017F>, that such pairs as formic ether and acetate
of methyl, both of the ultimate composition C3H,02, had the
same refraction ; whilst the papers of Landolt, and the more
recent ones of Brühl $, abound in instances. Among the
observations in my notebook, hitherto unpublished, occur the
following:—

  Though identity of ultimate composition will generally pro
duce identity of specific refraction, there are certain cases in
which isomeric (or, rather, metameric) bodies differ widely in
their power of retarding the transmitted ray. The earliest of
those observed was the case of aniline and picoline, C.H.I.N.;
and as Dr. Thorpe has kindly lent me his specimen of picoline,
I am able to confirm the previous determinations.

    The difference      this pair was originally attributed
                               in                                  the                                        to
fact that the two bodies “are constructed very differently;”
and     insubsequent papers        was pointed out that, when the

Brühl, with similar results, and form one of the striking cases
on which his theory depends.           The refraction-equivalent of

a great increase of dispersion. It was pointed out some years
ago that the aromatic bodies have a great dispersive power",
and that “ dispersion, as well as refraction, increases very
rapidly with the number of atoms of carbon that are not com
bined with at least two of hydrogen or their equivalent.”f
Evidence of this is to be found both in the older and the more
recent researches, whether in this country or on the Continent,
".
and is always accumulating.           Confining our attention to the
figures given in this paper, it will be observed that in cases
       the carbon is normal the specific dispersion is expressed
by low figures (the highest of which                               is,

above 0400.
   2nd. Where isomeric bodies have the same                  nearly the        or
same specific refraction for the line

   In explanation of Table I. it is to be borne in mind that the
numbers refer to one atom of the metal in the form of oxide,
in order to obtain comparable numbers.        Many of the numbers
are taken from the latest   papers  of Nilson and Petterson *, and
are found to   give  values for specific volumes somewhat smaller
than those derived from older observations.
   We only give the above values as approximate ones, be
cause the material to work upon does not allow of great
accuracy; and we only take the first seven groups into con
sideration, because the specific gravities of oxides of the eighth,
with the formula RO, are not known.
                                                -
   A glance at the table shows us that the specific volume
increases steadily along the horizontal as well as down the ver
tical lines. The difference between the even and the odd series
is particularly well defined.     Some of the “typical elements,”
especially Li, Be, Na, and Mg, can be used as representatives
          º
of both series. The specific volume of an oxide, where it is
at present unknown, can be calculated from data obtained
from the values surrounding
                                    at it.

           the oxides which are     present known, that    lithium     of
            the smallest specific volume, the metal having the
 east atomic weight.      On the other hand, uranic oxide, UOs,
has the   largest atomic volume, uranium possessing the greatest
atomic weight.

6:525 (Boullay), and the other 3779 (Playfair and Joule)t.
Accordingly the specific volume   either      42.
                                             is            25   or
  It appears likely that two similar modifications   other                 of
oxides exist—of bismuth, for example, and   uranium oxide,   of
the second one possessing the specific volume about 30.

extend from 4:0 to 5:456; and accordingly the atomic volume
varies from 28°1 to 38-3. An oxide of barium of sp. gr. 6-4,
giving sp. vol. 24, might be expected to exist.
   Some interesting numbers are obtained if we calculate the
volume which one atom of oxygen possesses in the various
oxides. To commence with, we suppose that the metal does
not alter in volume when it combines with oxygen, we sub
tract the specific volume of the metal from that of the oxide.
We quote the values from Lothar Meyer’s ‘Modern Theory of
Chemistry,’ 4th edit. 1880, p. 141. To take an example,

Or                         –252 for 0,          and so on.

     We deduce the following :—
     1.         bases the oxygen possesses a negative volume.
          In strong
      In the oxides of the heavy metals and metalloids the
     2.
volume of the oxygen is positive.
   3. The earth-metals unite with oxygen without any appre
ciable change of volume; and on this account they form a
connecting link between acids and bases.
   4. The higher the specific volume of the metal in the oxide,
the more negative is the specific volume of the oxygen com
bined with it; for instance
                             Sp. vol. K=45.4,
                             Sp. vol. O =55'4.
The lower the specific volume of the element, the more
positive is the specific volume of the oxygen in the oxide ; for
example
                        Sp. vol. C= +3-6,
                        Sp. vol. O= +21-2.
   Mendelejeff has published some very interesting obser
vations of this kind in his Russian ‘Principles of Chemistry,’
pp. 856–859. He gives a very beautiful hypothesis of the
mechanical theory of the act of combination.       It is not, how
ever, suitable to enter upon these discussions here.
   When we observe the above arrangement in Table II, we
notice the following —The more strongly electro-positive the
base which an element forms with oxygen, the greater is
the negative value for the volume of the oxygen.        It appears
as if the negative  maximum were reached with caesium.         On
the contrary, the maximum of positive values is probably
attained in the vicinity of fluorine. From this one perceives
that the value representing the atomic volume of the oxygen
in the oxides can, to a certain extent, be looked upon as the
amount of affinity of the metal for the oxygen.
   In the same manner that, in the horizontal series of the
periodic system, the electro-negative character increases with
the atomic weight, the volume of the oxygen changes from
negative to positive. The opposite appears to be the case
in the vertical groups—at           all
                                  events,         as
                                               regards the even
elements.       In
                 this matter new researches upon the metals
and their oxides would be of considerable interest.

               By     Bohuslav BRAUNER, Ph.D., of Prague”.
      question whether beryllium is divalent (Be"=9:1) or
THEtrivalent  (Be"'> 1365) is still a matter of interest for
chemists, although Nilsont states that this question may be
regarded as completely settled in favour of trivalent beryllium.
                      3.
   As this point is a vital one as regards—the truth of the
periodic law,                  I
                    venture to ask attention to the following
remarks.
   The history of this question will be found in the papers of
Nilson and                   as well as in that of Humpsidges;
and here         I
             will mention   only the most important points.
   In the  year  1878 Messrs. Nilson and Pettersson found the

66                  Dr. B. Brauner on the Atomic
earths  and their sulphates ; and they find therein a further
confirmation of their views respecting beryllia.
   The first part of the paper of Messrs. Nilson and Pettersson
has been thoroughly discussed by Professor Lothar Meyer",
who showed that from their own experiments a conclusion
     ...; "...##".
opposite to that of the above-named authors may be drawn,
viz. that beryllium is a dyad, inasmuch as it belongs to a class
                                                  i.
of                                  heat increases with the tem
perature, but in which the increment for 1% C. regularly dimi
nishes, the opposite of this being the case with metals obeying
the law of Dulong and Petit.              Meyer concludes there
from that beryllium is a dyad, Be"=9:1.
   The aim of the present communication is to discuss the
second part of the researches of Messrs. Nilson and Pettersson.
These experimenters find that beryllia possesses a molecular
heat and molecular volume nearly equal to those of the other
rare earths; and they go on to state that, if the formula BeO
for beryllia be accepted, values for the above relations are ob
tained which are without analogy in the whole range of the
SC lence.
   On this point I would beg to remark:—
   (1) If we consider beryllia as BeO,      molecular colume        its                               is
83. And        the oxides
              if             arranged according
                                   be              the periodic                    to
law (see the preceding paper), this number exactly corresponds
to  the position        dyad beryllium.
                        of   a            For beryllium thus
stands between lithium and boron. The same           the case                          is             if
we consider the vertical  groups

    Ifwe consider the specific volume           beryllia, compared  of
with the same quantity      oxygenof   that contained    as  alumina,                       in

   Let us consider the molecular volumes, i. e. the relative
volumes of the single chemical molecules and their relations
to the unit volume, i. e. the inverse values of molecular volumes
if we assume the highest volume as a unit. If we compare
these values with the inverse values of the molecular heats
obtained in the same way, the several groups exhibit very
closely corresponding numbers, e. g. in the third group:-

Although the last numbers are not absolutely identical in both
columns, yet there can be no doubt that these relations are not
due to mere chance.     It is evident that the smallest molecular
heat corresponds to the smallest molecular volume. Perhaps
some relation may be found between these facts and Mende
lejeff’s hypothesis on the structure of molecules.
   Hence it is clear that the relations between
        molecular volume are approximately
                              pp         y =

constant = 1.66; and it is strange that the variations are not
larger with such different experimental material.

  (5) The same alteration of atomic heat is observed in the case
of the oxygen contained in the oxides.      Nilson has already
pointed out that the oxygen combined with metals, having
small atomic weight, also exhibits a small atomic heat. If we
arrange the values so obtained, as far as the insufficient mate
rial allows, we get the following relations:—

    Thus we see that the atomic heat     oxygen increases with                       of
the atomic weight, exhibiting   minimum       the upper corner      a                         in
on the left.   Therefore we can calculate that value     be for                                                             to

THE
  1. “On Remains of a small Lizard from the   Neocomian Rocks
of the Island of Lesina, Dalmatia, preserved in the Geological
Museum of the University of Vienna.”     By Prof. H. G. Seeley,
F.R.S., F.G.S.
  2. “On the Beds at Headon Hill and Colwell Bay in the Isle
of Wight.”  By Messrs. H. Keeping and E. B. Tawney, M.A.,
F.G.S.
   The authors criticised the views put forward by Prof. Judd in his
paper published in the Q. J. G. S. xxxvi. p. 13, and supported those
established by the late E. Forbes and the publications of the Geolo
gical Survey. At the west end of the island, viz. at Totland and
Colwell Bays, the authors stated that there is only one marine
series, the Middle Headon, which they traced continuously through
the cliffs—identifying it bed by bed at various points—the result
entirely corroborating the sections of the Geological Survey. The
section at the N.E. end of Headon Hill was described in detail, and
Prof. Judd's interpretation of this part of the section analyzed.
Prof. Judd places the marine Middle Headon at this point at the level
of the sea, maintaining that 250 feet (the altitude of the Bembridge
limestone-quarry) of beds intervene between the Bembridge lime
stone and the sea-level.   The authors maintained that the top of the
marine series is about 105 feet above the sea-level, that thickness
of beds intercalated above the Middle Headon having no existence
in fact, also that the Brockenhurst bed does not exist below the
Bembridge quarry, where it is supposed to be (concealed by gravel)
by Prof. Judd, and stated that there is no gravel at that spot
to conceal any thing, and that the beds which do exist there are the
freshwater Osborne and Upper Headon beds as described by E.
Forbes. They then adduced fossil evidence confirmatory of the
stratigraphical; thus out of 57 species collected this summer at
Colwell Bay they found 53 at Headon Hill. (2) The sections at
Whitecliff Bay and the New Forest (Brockenhurst) were next
described.   At Whitecliff Bay the 90 feet of beds which constitute the
Middle Headon of the Survey section have been renamed “Brocken
hurst series” by Prof. Judd. The authors maintained that the Broc
kenhurst bed, identical as to   its
                                  fossils and position with that  ofthe
Whitley Ridge cutting, represented
                        is                 by
                                           the lower   feet only, imme

Whitecliff Bay contains lower zones than any developed       the Middle

Headon of Headon Hill; for the Brockenhurst bed is entirely absent
from the west of the island.         The authors maintained that Prof.
Judd has assigned a false     position  to this bed in his vertical section
of New-Forest beds, and that instead of being higher than the
Venus-bed horizon, it is plainly below            since                  it,
                                                             Whitley Ridge               at                              it
lies   on
        the Lower    Headon,  being  succeeded   by  the Venus-bed and then
by   the Upper Headon. The palaeontological evidence was then dis

the   question.                In
                      opposition     his statistics theto  authors  maintained
that the Brockenhurst bed has about 48 per cent.                 species which                 of
pass       up
           from the Barton beds, while the Venus-bed series              either                                of
 Colwell Bay       Headon Hill have only 29 per cent., suggestive

                themselves alone than either of them have              common                             in
with the Brockenhurst                   bed.           The       palaeontological             evidence     is      there
fore     accord with the stratigraphical;
           in                              they both occupy     higher                                         a
zone than the Brockenhurst     bed, which,  when  developed,  occupies
the base     the Middle Headon. The authors therefore reject Prof.
                 of
Judd's term Brockenhurst series, and revert     the classification and              to
nomenclature      the Geological

  diameter    retain their angularity for a very long period indeed,
  remaining, under ordinary circumstances, unrounded; but they are
  much more rapidly rounded by the action of wind.                It is thus
 probable that rounded grains of this kind in some of the older
  rocks, as, for example, certain of the Triassic sandstones, may be
  the result of aeolian action.

 NOTE   ON   MR. BROWNE's PAPER “ON ACTION AT A DISTANCE.” By

     PETERHOUSE, CAMBRIDGE.
 IN certainly

                   appears    to
                                    Mag. for December 1880, Mr. Browne
                                 establish the proposition that we cannot
 explain    the   phenomena      of cohesion &c. in a satisfactory way by
 means of the direct         impact    of bodies; and then he goes on to
 deduce from this that action at a distance (a very small distance
 indeed, but still finite) must exist in these cases, and therefore may
 be equally well allowed in the case of bodies at a great distance, as
 the earth and sun. Now it appears to me that in reality very
 much is gained in the scientific explanation of phenomena when
 they are transferred from the region of action at great distances
 to action at distances such as intervene between the particles of
 solid bodies.     I  cannot explain this better than by quoting the
-words of Clerk Maxwell, who has himself done so much in the
 direction of getting rid of action at a distance by his explanation
 of electrical and magnetic phenomena by means of stress in the
 medium which fills the electrical or magnetic field.
     “When we see one body acting on another at a distance, before
 we assume that the one acts directly on the other we generally
 inquire whether there is any material connexion between the two
 bodies; and if we find strings or rods, or framework of any kind
 capable of accounting for the observed action between the bodies,
 we prefer to explain the action by means of the intermediate con
 nexions, rather than admit the notion of direct action at a distance.
     “Thus, when two particles are connected by a straight or curved
 rod, the action between the particles is always along the line join
 ing them ; but we account for this action by means of a system of
 internal forces in the substance of the rod. The existence of these
 internal forces is deduced entirely from observation of the effect of
 external forces on the rod; and the internal forces themselves are

generally assumed to be the resultants of forces which act between
particles of the rod. Thus the observed action between two dis
tant particles is in this instance removed from the class of direct
action at a distance by referring it to the intervention of the rod;
the action of the rod is explained by the existence of internal forces
         its
       substance; and the internal forces are explained                                                     by

 ON    THE ABSORPTION                       OF SOLAR RADIATION                           BY THE CARBONIC
        ACID OF OUR ATMOSPHERE.      BY DR. ERNST LECHER.

according to which a pretty considerable absorbing-power for radiant
heat is possessed by carbonic acid, the author has attempted, in the
above investigation, to extend those observations, and to apply them
to the atmospheric absorption of the solar radiation. This view is
at variance with the generally accepted assumption that the aqueous
vapour of our atmosphere is the true absorbent of the sun's radia
tion—an assumption the groundlessness of which the author has
demonstrated in another place.
   First, the radiation of a gas-lamp provided with a glass cylinder
was investigated; and it was found that carbonic acid in a length
of

of the incident radiation.
  Further experiments (which, for the sake of the pure air, were
made out of Vienna, at Greifenstein) show that the solar radiation
also suffers a considerable weakening on passing through carbonic
acid gas.   A layer of this gas of one metre thickness absorbs about
13 per cent. when the sun's altitude is 59°; this number lessens in
the same proportion as the sun descends.        This proves that the
absorption of the solar radiation by carbonic acid is a selective ab
sorption, and that the thicker the atmospheric layer through which
the rays have already passed, the scarcer do the absorbable wave
lengths become.     The author calculates from his experiments the
proportion of carbonic acid contained in the atmosphere, and finds
it to be 327 parts by volume in 10,000, which number agrees so
well with the data given elsewhere, and based upon chemical ana
lysis, that there is the best prospect of determining in this way the
carbonic-acid content of the atmosphere, together with          varia       its
tions and changes, accurately and also      heights where direct mea

     IV. The phenomenon seems to result chiefly from an action upon the
surface of the receiver; for its intensity greatly depends upon the
nature of the surface. Every operation that diminishes the reflect
ing-power and augments the absorptivity of the surface influences
the phenomenon; roughened,

                                      tarnished, oxidated surfaces are the
most suitable.
     The intensity of the phenomenon is considerably augmented
when the surface is coated with certain black substances, in powder
or not, such as bitumen of Judea, platinum-black, and especially
lampblack; but this effect is not particularly sensible unless the
coated plates are very thin : thus, if the thickness be from about
 I'm   to    <U+017F>º,  millimetre, remarkable effects are obtained.

FQ.  the comparison of the resistances of short wires Sir
  W. Thomson't has given a method founded on an arrange
ment which is a modification of the Wheatstone bridge.
Another method which may serve for the same purpose is in
many respects more convenient, and, as it appears, not inferior
in accuracy; it is based on the employment of a differential
                                   ãº
galvanometer, the windings of which can be set so that a cur
rent flowing successively
of the needle.
                                    them produces no deflection
                  If a circuit be formed out of the two resist
ances to be compared, and a battery, and the two wires of the
differential galvanometer be inserted as secondary closings to
them, and if the resistance of one of these wires be varied till
deflection of the needle vanishes, then the ratio of the resist
ances to be compared will be equal to the ratio of the resist
ances of the galvanometer-wires, provided that the above
indicated setting has been given to the windings.           now       If
such resistances be added to the galvanometer-wires that de
flection of the needle again vanishes, the ratio of the added
resistances will also be equal to the ratio of those to be com
pared   f.

     If
     the resistance p can be theoretically expressed by the
conductivity and the dimensions of the conductor in question,
if these dimensions have been measured, and if P and the
 atio of the resistances w/—w and W’—W are known, that
conductivity can be calculated.
  An essential basis of the above-instituted considerations was
the assumption     that the electrode surfaces are surfaces of equal
potential. An electrode surface having this property can be
found if electricity be brought to the conductor through a sur
face of which the dimensions are infinitesimal compared with

In deducing this result it          is sufficient to calculate twice the
sum of four terms.
     The derivation of the given expression for p rests upon the
assumption that the      ratios; and               ;   can be regarded as                  infi
nite; in fact, however, very moderate values of these ratios
suffice to make that expression very nearly correct.                              It       is so
even  in the case that

In this case the value of p is particularly easily ascertained.

         trum, known by his name, in 1814. Many efforts to
 determine their origin followed. One of the most ingenious
 and carefully considered was that of Professor Forbes, in 1836f.
 He concluded that, if their origin is in the solar atmosphere,
 the light from the limb must exhibit stronger lines than that
                                                                       i.
 from the centre. His method was to examine the spectrum
 before and during an annular eclipse; as he found no recog
 nizable change, his deduction was “that the sun's atmosphere
 has nothing to do with the production of this singular
 menon.”
      The point was again touched upon by Sir David Brewster
  and Dr. Gladstone in a joint study of the spectral lines, pub
  lished in 1860<U+017F>.       Here “each of the authors came indepen
  dently to the conclusion that there is no perceptible difference
  in this respect between the light from the edge and that from
  the centre of the solar disk.”
       In 1867 Angström$ repeated the experiment with negative
  results. Lockyer's|| efforts also, in 1869, were attended with
  no better results.

to his views, these particles are the sources of the continuous

stumblingblock in the way of accepting Kirchhoff's expla

first principle are fully met, the sun being the origin of the
daylight. That we do not see absorption-lines is due, then,
alone to the lack of necessary brilliancy iu the daylight.
      Thus much premised, we can frame a theory which explains

   Having stated the theory, we will now apply it to the four

   From the nature of the condensation, the granules or cloudy
masses must be very transparent, because the condensation is
confined to elements which have very high boiling-points, and
because such elements can be but a portion, perhaps but a
small portion, of the whole matter contained in the upward
currents.
    It is not & priori improbable that we receive light from
many hundreds of miles below the general outer surface of the
photosphere.       Since these cloud-like sources of intenser radia

100                 Mr. C. S. Hastings's Theory of
coming from the sun is radiated by solid or liquid particles of
carbon just at the point of vaporization, let us see if the facts
of observation fulfil the implied conditions.
   As a first consequence, we see that the temperature and
light of the photosphere are defined as those of solid carbon
at the point of volatilization.      In the electric arc there is a
very small area of the positive carbon-pole at this high tem
perature. Though this area is in a very disadvantageous
position for observation, and can consequently have but a dis
proportionally small share in producing the total effect, the
splendour of the electric light might almost tempt us to believe
the guess a valid one.       Another consequence implied, how
ever  (namely,   that the   spectral  lines proper to simple carbon
are absent in the solar  spectrum),    is doubtless better adapted as
a crucial test of the     hypothesis    than a study of the electric
i.
light. There has been evidence recently offered that carbon
         º
lines are present in the solar spectrum. Granting this, we
  erceive that the photosphere contains solid or liquid particles
        than carbon vapour, and consequently not carbon.
     I
     am then inclined to suspect that the photospheric material
may be silicon, which, though denser in the gaseous state than
carbon, is not improbably more abundant.                ereis also good
reason to suppose that carbon is precipitated at a higher level;
and the                but less common, element boron may add a
minor effect.
   In the explanations which            I
                                        shall give of the remaining

 this point, there exercising a marked general absorption which
 would betray itself as a spot. At this place the suspended
 particles would sink to lower levels with constantly increasing
 temperature, until finally, heated to intense incandescence, they
 would revolatilize. Thus the floor or substratum of every spot
 must be a portion, depressed it is true, of the photosphere.
 All the spectroscopic phenomena of spots, which have proved
 so perplexing, are thus naturally and easily explained.
       n the immediate neighbourhood of a spot the centripetal
  currents bend down the ordinary convection or granule-pro
 ducing currents so that they are approximately level.              Before,
 the latter cooled       suddenly    by    rarefaction in their    upward
 course ; now they cool mainly by the much slower process of
 radiation : thus, while before the locus of precipitation was
 restricted, it is now greatly extended.           This is the cause of
 the great elongation of the granules in the penumbra, a real
 elongation,   I  imagine, and not merely an apparent one.
    Finally, concerning the close duplicity of certain lines, we
 may reason thus:—If we could surround the sun by a stratum
 of gas hotter than the photosphere and much rarer than that
 producing the corresponding Fraunhofer lines, we should, as is

As  these currents move upward, they are cooled, mainly by
expansion, until a certain element (probably of the carbon
group) is precipitated. This precipitation (restricted, from the
nature of the action) forms the well-known granules. There
is nothing which has come under my observation which would
indicate a columnar form in these granules under ordinary cir

    The precipitated material rapidly cools, on account of                                                             its

  this I believe to be erroneous.                          I

                                                                          º
  protest; for it is there asserted that with unlimited plates, “in
  order to produce results similar to those produced with limited
  plates, the gas between the two plates must maintain a greater
  steady pressure on the plate Hº (the hot one) “ than that
  which it exerts on the colder plate C.”              I wish Prof. Rey
  molds had mentioned what result with any plates could
  be explained by such an absurd supposition.                  If
                                                               he means
  that such a supposition would be necessary to explain a repul
  sion between the plates and between them and the sides of the
  containing vessel, he has not sufficiently considered the prob
  lem.     Icannot believe that he is unable to see that if the gas
  between the plates is in a state of stress, such as he himself
                                      j."; I
  afterwards shows it might be, in which the pressure of the gas
  on each plate is the same, but greater than the pressure on a
  plane at right angles to the                        say, this were the
  state of the gas, it is evident that the pressure on the cold
  backs of the plates might be this less pressure, and so less than
                                                           º
  that on their opposed surfaces, and they would tend to recede
  from one another. Whether the gas between the plates would
  actually be in this state is another question; but to suppose it
  such is not absurd in the same manner as to suppose action
 and reaction unequal though opposite.               It is hardly worth
 while, pointing out that his whole illustration by means of
 batteries is beside this question, and that the                    of the
 plates to separate is proportional to their area.
     In § 60 Prof. Reynolds acknowledges that stresses in the gas,
 which turn out subsequently to be different pressures indifferent
 directions, cause the phenomena he is investigating, although
 in a letter to “Nature’ (Jan. 17, 1878, p. 220) he denied that
 such a condition of stress can have any thing to do with the
 cause of Mr. Crookes's results.        It is this change in his views
 that makes his theory practically the same as the one he was
 then combating.          ºftreference to the remaining paragraphs
 of this section      I
                      have  nothing    but congratulations to offer,
 the introduction of the “mean range” being in every way
 admirable and a notable advance in the methods of treating
 the subject. The assumption he makes as to the character of
the motions of the molecules          is, like the analogous one          of
 Clausius, not only probable    in itself, but justified       in   its
                                                                  results,
and, from these, seems sufficient       as
                                        a     first approximation.

that on one drawn in another direction at the same point. It
is this difference that Maxwell uses to measure the stress at a
point.   Prof. Reynolds always measures it by the difference
of pressure on two parallel planes drawn at different points.
For instance, on p. 830 equation (131) is
and    p.-po          was got by integrating                     % and must consequently
be the difference of pressures on two planes both perpendicular
to a at two different points.           Notwithstanding this, Prof.
Reynolds proceeds to compare his with Maxwell's measure of
the stress, and seems to talk of them as the same.           That both
measures of the stress may exist there is no doubt; but it is
equally certain that Maxwell’s might exist though Prof. Rey
nolds's vanished.      For instance, in the case          have already               I
mentioned at the beginning of this paper, of gas between two
parallel plane solids, the pressure would of course be the same
on     all
        planes parallel      them, and    toProf. Reynolds's measure
                                                                 so
of  the stress would   vanish;   while the pressure          plane per               on   a
pendicular           to
                the solids   might                       be

and so Maxwell's measure of the stress would not vanish. As
they ought                    be
                     both equal       the case Prof. Reynolds con

    In  addition to this, Prof. Reynolds has not noticed the
action of the tangential stresses in the case of the radiometer.
That they play an important part in the phenomena is evident.

 differing but slightly in form, viz.:-

     The calibration of the necks by the method usually employed
 in calibrating thermometer-tubes was impracticable on account
  of the large diameter of the tubes. The method resorted to
  was as follows:—The dilatometer having been inverted and
  the neck at the bent portion stopped up, equal amounts of
  mercury, carefully weighed, were poured down the neck; and
  the height of the mercury column, after the addition of each
   º
  such portion, was measured with the cathetometer.           In this
  way a very satisfactory curve of cross-section areas was ob
           and the capacity of each millimetre of the neck tabu
   ated.
      The solution within the dilatometer during each experiment
  was kept under constant pressure by means of the adjustable
  mercury-tube T, which was pushed up as fast as the mercury
  rose within the neck. The liberation of gas from the solution,
  which would inevitably have followed any considerable de
  crease of pressure, was by this means prevented.
      The thermometers used were four in number:-
                   Baudin 7310, 7313, and 7315;
  and
                   Golaz.
      The variation of each of them from the air-thermometer was
   determined, and is given in our tables of observations.       The
   Golaz thermometer showed an almost constant difference from
   the air-thermometer, while in the case of the Baudin thermo
   meters this difference varied for different parts of the scale.
   In the bath, water was used for ordinary temperatures; and
   between 0° C. and -20°C. we employed the usual freezing
   mixture of common salt and ice.

   To obtain with accuracy the temperature of a large bulb,
by means of a thermometer in the bath outside, two precau
tions must be taken. The bath must be continually stirred,
and after each change of temperature it must be kept at a
constant temperature until the entire contents of the bulb shall
have assumed that temperature.       We found, by a series of
preliminary trial; the time necessary to this end to be thirty
minutes after a 1° to 2° change of temperature, and thirty-five
minutes after a 5° change.
   In our determinations five different solutions of ammonia
gas were used. The specific gravity of each solution as ob
tained at the time of filling the dilatometer with the same,
together with the strength of the solutions, appears in Table I.

  We thus find that in the case of aqueous solutions of ammonia
the freezing-point and point of maximum density are lowered
by the presence of the gas in solution f.     Before the law of
this change can be given, many more experiments, covering a
much greater range of temperature, will have to be made.
                                                 ...
The only attempts to freeze aqueous ammonia, of which we
have found record, are those of Fourcroy and Vauquelin in
17974.
   Their statement, which still finds place in our chemical text
books and dictionaries, is that a                   solution (bien
saturde) freezes at -40°C.         Since the freezing-point is a
rapidly changing function of the amount of gas in the solu
tion, this statement is of little use without a knowledge of the
strength of the solution in question. An examination of the
curves in fig. 2 leads us to suspect that the solution frozen by
Fourcroy and Vauquelin was the ordinary commercial solu
tion of about 16-per-cent, strength.
   Just as the determination of the freezing-point had, up to
the time of the present work, been confined to observations
upon a single solution, so with the study of the coefficients of
expansion; we find but a single research on this subject
(by Prof. Munke of Heidelberg, in 1828$). His observations,
which extended to a variety of liquids, were made with the
  reatest care and exactitude; his study of aqueous ammonia,
  owever, was confined to a single solution; so that no general
conclusions concerning the influence of the strength of a solu
tion upon      its
               behaviour could       drawn.be

            Mechanical Action of Induced Currents.           ‘’’,
   Crookes, as is well known, has discovered a new mechanical         ºf
action of the rays issuing from the negative electrode, and
has succeeded in setting in motion a little wheel with vanes
upon an inclined plane by their action. The question pre
sented itself whether these induced currents would be suffi
ciently powerful to produce a similar mechanical action. For
this purpose a vacuum-tube made by Götze was employed.
This tube, whose length was 18 centims. and breadth 4 cen
tims., was furnished with a radiometer in the middle, and had at
one end an aluminium electrode so placed that the vanes of the
radiometer would be struck by the rays issuing from this elec
trode when made the negative pole, and would thus be set in
motion. The second electrode at the other end of the tube
is surrounded with a glass tube extending 2 or 3 centims.
beyond the aluminium electrode, and then bent at a right
angle towards the side of the vacuum-tube. When this elec
trode is connected with the negative pole of the induction
coil, the rays issuing from it can no longer impinge upon the
 vanes of the radiometer,       which therefore is not set in
motion. But in this case the radiometer is easily put into
motion in either direction by touching one point or another
of the glass wall with a conductor. The rotation is easily
 explained by the production of induced currents on connect
ing the exterior surface of the glass with the earth. Cur
rents are produced which radiate from the surface correspond
ing to the point touched in straight lines into the vacuum-tube,
and thus strike the vanes of the radiometer and put it into
motion in a definite direction.     If then the tube be touched
at another   point so that the currents thus produced strike the
             .
other half of the radiometer, we have motion in the oppo
site direction produced.
    This mechanical action may also be shown with an ordinary
 Crookes's radiometer coated at two points of the exterior sur
 face with tin-foil, as already described, when the coatings are
 connected with an induction-coil.
                       Action of the Magnet.
    In order to investigate the action of the magnet on these
currents, the vacuum-tube described above with the aluminium
CrOSS Was                  Whilst the primary induction-current
passed through the tube, the induced currents were excited

 126                    Dr. K. Domalip                 on Alternating
 by connecting the upper surface of the side tube with the
 earth. Then, as we know, these currents are propagated in
 straight lines from the surface touched and strike the opposite
wall, producing a fluorescent surface. The production of this
 fluorescent surface much facilitates the investigation into the
 action of the magnet, since it is only necessary to observe the
motion of the fluorescent surface in order to infer the motion
 of the current producing                             In
                                              some cases the rays issuing
                                            it.
 from the     points   touched are     visible;   but     other cases they
                                                                      in

     The action        of
                        the magnet          the equatorial position was
                                                      in
                   Jº
first investigated.         For this purpose the tube was             placed            so
between the                   of
                              the    magnet    that the line    joining  the
 point touched with the fluorescent surface                    the opposite  on
wall was      at    right angles                to,
                                         and bisected, the line joining
the two poles. When the magnet was excited, the fluorescent
 surface, and with           the current producing
                             it                                would move     it,
upwards      or downwards      according       the polarityto    the magnet.      of
    oser examination showed that the deviation could be deter
 mined by assuming that the negative current moved                                            in   a
 straight line from the point touched              the opposite wall, and
                                                                to
 that consequently the positive current                 propagated   is  the                 in
 opposite direction.         Hence, applying Ampère's rule, we can
 easily explain the motions observed.
    Next, the magnetic action was investigated when the cur
rent was      ºaxially:             the tube was moved along             the                 in
axial position,         sothat the current was first over the one
pole; then,        on  moving the tube further,             came into the
neutral    point,   and then over the other      pole.                    In it

motion       of the fluorescent      surface,   and   consequently       the                 of
current, could           predicted from Ampère's rule.

under the influence of the magnet easily, the tube should be
slowly brought near to the magnet, from a distance.       From
what has been said, it follows that these currents possess the
ordinary properties of currents, since their deviation is the
same as of any conductor whatever conveying a current in
the same direction.   The action of the magnet upon these                            in
duced currents agrees  completely with the action of the magnet
upon the direct current in a highly exhausted space", as                              I
have previously found.
                          Electrodynamic Actions.
    Goldstein, in the research already quoted, describes certain
phenomena     which are obtained when the tube is connected at
two or more points with the earth. In this case the surfaces
of light are not necessarily opposite the points touched, the
position of each light-surface is dependent on the magnitude
and relative position of the surfaces touched.
    These and  allother similar phenomena are easily explained                        by
the mutual    electrodynamic     action     the currents produced by
                                                    of
connecting the different points           the glass surface with the
                                                   of
earth.    We have fact deal with the same action
                          in         to                          would    as
 be   exerted upon each other         by   currents traversing solid
movable conductors.         As with these,      also with the induced
                                                         so
currents, we observe that similarly directed currents attract
each other, and oppositely directed currents repel each other.
These experiments were varied            different ways; but
                                                   in              the         all
phenomena are easily explained by the electrodynamic mutual
action  of  the currents produced.            will therefore,
                                                    I             what    in
follows, only describe one            two experiments which will
                                              or
justify what has been said.
    The vacuum-tube with the aluminium cross was again em

tube from the     coil,  the aluminium wire         being the positive

       the Philosophical Magazine, commenting on my paper
upon “Action at a Distance,” seem to demand some reply
on my part.     But                 I
                       may be permitted to observe that the
gist of that paper lay in a few short pieces of purely physical
reasoning, designed to prove that certain known facts not only
were not, but could not be explained on the hypothesis that
action at a distance was impossible.       Now not one of my
three opponents has pointed out a flaw in these reasonings. In
fact, they         all
               appear      imply that    to
                                          some    them    least       in          of                 at

ever.
I         come lastly           to       Dr. Lodge, whose note, though imposing

                   Mr. W. R. Browne on Action at a Distance.                                                131
in appearance,       contains so many errors that            can hardly               I
believe        I
              have read it     aright.    In the first place, he con
siders my paper as valuable in pointing out metaphysical
difficulties, whereas my only allusion to metaphysics was in
repudiating the metaphysical notion that action at a distance
is a priori inconceivable.
   Secondly, he is fatally wrong in his statement of the prin
ciple of the conservation of energy. The work done on a body
B is not “measured by the product of the force exerted into
the distance moved through in the direction of the force;” on
the contrary, it is measured by the product of the resistance
into the distance moved through against that resistance. Sup
}.     we have a weight A of 1 ton acting on a smaller weight
   over a pulley.       Will Dr. Lodge assert that the work done
by A, when it has fallen through 1 foot, is precisely the same
whether the weight of B is 1 cwt. or 19 cwt.”
   Thirdly, Dr. Lodge talks of equal and opposite forces, and
of equal and opposite works. What he means by these terms,
except that the motion due to such forces or works is in oppo
site directions,             I
                       am unable to divine; and yet that is the
point he is trying to disprove. That there can be no transfer
of energy due to motion of two bodies in the same direction,
is shown in a moment.           First, let the velocities of the two
bodies be equal, and impress upon them a velocity equal and
opposite to this common velocity.          This,      the second law of
motion, will in no way affect the case. But the two bodies
                                                                      º,
are now reduced to rest; and Dr. Lodge will not assert,                                                       I
presume, that any transfer of energy is taking place between
them. Secondly,                   let
                            the velocities     different, and let them
                                                                 be

the question why only a few liquids are suitable                                      for the pro
duction of thin films, while most of them are totally unsuited
for that purpose.        According to his view, two properties of
liquids play an essential part therein—the tension and the
viscosity of their surfaces. The investigation of this second
property is the aim of the present memoir.
   As is well known, what is designated as the viscosity of a
liquid is        its
                 deviation from the state           perfect fluidity, and

another.        From experiments which are subsequently                                            to   be
more    fully   communicated, Plateau inferred that the amount
of  this frictional resistance varies according             the motion       as                         of
the parts takes place                                the nearest vicinity

essentially different from the friction in the interior of a liquid".
Here also a similar view might be taken—namely, that the
friction-coefficient in the interior of the first liquid has a con
stant value, rapidly changes on approaching nearer to the
boundary surface, and on the other side again assumes that
                                                                                                                -
value which belongs to it for the second liquid.
   These considerations show that the superficial viscosity is
absolutely incompatible with the notions we have hitherto
entertained of the nature of liquids.              Whether it actually
exists, and therefore whether it is justifiable to assume a dif
ferent value of the coefficient of friction at the surface from
that in the interior, can of course only be decided by expe
riment.
   2. Plateau's fundamental experiments on surface-viscosity
consisted in observing the time taken by a magnetic needle to
fall back from a deflection of 90° to the magnetic meridian.
For this different times were necessary, according as the
motion of the needle took place in the free surface or in the
interior of the liquid.       If the time in the first case was greater
than in the   second,   Plateau inferred a greater—if the contrary,
a less  viscosity  in the surface.      Thus, according to Plateau,
water, aqueous salt-solutions, glycerine, and especially solu
tions of albumen and saponine in water are liquids in which
the friction at the free surface is greater than in the interior.

employed the following method, which, on the whole, satisfies
the requirements above stated.   Suspended by two fine, well
annealed platinum wires, a brass cross hangs bifilar, carrying
a small mirror for the observation of the oscillations with scale
and telescope.    The two horizontal arms of the cross are fur
nished with screw-threads, on which suitable weights can be
shifted, so that the oscillation-period can be varied at pleasure.
   To the descending part suitable bodies can be fastened,
which are destined to execute oscillations within the liquid

   This assumption can easily be tested. It follows therefrom
that oscillation-period and decrement are independent of the
amount of the amplitude. This is not precisely correct; only
the oscillation-period is constant, while the decrements dimi
nish slowly with the magnitude of the amplitudes.                 have             I
not pursued the more precise law of this decrease further; the
knowledge of the mean value of the decrements suffices per
fectly for the decision of the question put; and I have taken
care to arrange the experiments so that the decrements corre
spond to average amplitudes.
   If  the margin of the plate projects above the free surface,
i.
another disturbing circumstance comes in : the surface between
the plate and the glass side is perceptibly curved, and in
  eneral raised somewhat above the level.         During the oscil
          this elevation is no   longer   the same on both sides;
 consequently attractive, and sometimes also repellent forces
                                               º
appear, which lengthen or shorten the oscillation-period.
 Here, however, with small amplitudes the oscillation-period is
independent of their magnitude; so that the supervening
 forces must be regarded as proportional to the angle b. The
 alteration of the oscillation-period is an excellent means of
 measuring accurately the forces mentioned. I have instituted
 a series of experiments in this direction, which            intend to    I
 communicate in a     separate  paper.    Lastly, if in the surface a
 thin layer which (according to                       assumption) is
 elastic were present, a displacement or bending of it must at
 all events produce also      resistance, which,        first approxi

   5.    I communicate first thoseexperiments which concern the
testing of the method employed. As was remarked above, it
was requisite to determine how far the oscillation-period and
the logarithmic decrement are dependent on the quantity of
the amplitude. The following table (Table I.) contains the
results of three series of experiments. The above-described
apparatus having been set oscillating, and having already
executed a series of oscillations, the turnings towards both
sides were noted, and therefrom the initial amplitudes deter
mined; at the end of four oscillations the final amplitude was
obtained in the same manner: both numbers are given in the
first column.    From them the decrement A was calculated.
At the same time the periods of the four oscillations were
.
ascertained and the mean taken, which is returned under T.
Here the above-described rectangular vessel was employed, in
which the movable plates faced each other at a distance of 15
millims.   The vessel was filled with distilled water, into which
dipped a rectangular brass plate 100 millims. long, 5 millims.
       and 0.5 millim. thick.     During series A the plate was
entirely in the interior of the liquid; during B the upper edge
exactly intersected the free surface, while during C it projected
0.5 millim. above. The oscillation-period T is given in seconds.
The quantity A is the difference of the ordinary logarithms.

   As we see, the oscillation-period (the determination of which,
as the mean of only four oscillations, was not very exact)
is constant in each individual series—i. e. independent of the
magnitude of the amplitude.       It increases, when series A, B,
C are compared, with the projection of the upper edge out of
the free surface.   There can be no doubt that this is to be
ascribed to the action of attraction-forces in consequence of
the curvature of the surface.            The decrements slowly lessen
when the      amplitudes    become     smaller;  and this diminution is
pretty uniform in                   all
                           the series.    have therefore not attempted

   The first two series show a small increase of the resistance
º
in the interval of an hour; in the last series it remains con
stant. After a period of 24 hours the resistance has become
so great that it could not be determined by the method em
           After stirring, however, it falls back to only a little
 ess than the initial value. Although, therefore, it cannot be
disputed that longer contact with the air increases the resist
ance, just as little can it be doubted that a special surface                                     :
resistance is present immediately after the formation of the
free surface.    Hence we must conclude either that a very
great surface-resistance belongs to the free water-surface, or
that a pure water-surface in contact with the air has no exist
ence at all.   We should then have, in the method of observa
tion  employed,  a fine means of judging of the condition of a
water-surface.
   While in water and aqueous salt-solutions the increase                                    of
resistance at the surface is very considerable, the decrease                                 of
the same in the other liquids is proportionally small.                                       It

   The behaviour of the last liquidis (as was previously found
to be the case) abnormal in consequence of the strong evapo
ration ; so that a proportionally large diminution cannot be
surprising.     In the rest of the liquids, moreover, the resistance
at the surface (contact with it by the upper edge of the plate)
is always still greater than on the motion of the plate at a
greater distance from the free surface.       Hence    do not think             I
we are entitled to infer from these experiments a diminution
of the coefficient of friction at the surface.
  In     solutions of water in alcohol we get:-
           At the sp. gr. 0-9708, increase 9.8 per cent.

  From this it follows that even a trifling addition of alcohol
to water considerably lessens             its
                                characteristic property, while
on   afurther addition the mixture behaves nearly

 Elements     of Astronomy.     By Robert STAwell, BALL, LL.D.,

OF pass,
   the text-books of Science published by Longmans none sur
         and we question whether any equal, this in the essentials
of an elementary text-book, namely, clearness of diction, simplicity
of exposition, abundance and excellence of geometrical figures and
illustrations. These features, in our opinion, make this the text-book
par excellence for beginners. The author of a work on Astronomy
naturally presupposes a certain amount of mathematical knowledge
on the part of his readers, but nothing more than a sixth-form boy
would in the ordinary course of things possess.        Even without this
knowledge, there is sufficient to instruct and interest the general
reader. We readily and cordially agree with Mr. Ball, that the
book is adapted for the use of students in Public and Science
Schools; but that it will be adopted we very much doubt.            For,
owing to some reason best known to Head Masters, Astronomy has
never been permitted to take root in Public Schools as part of the
curriculum.      It is only of late years that the desire for scientific
instruction has been properly recognized. Thousands of young
pupils spend several hours a week for years together over Euclid
without either interest or profit. This             doubt,      measure is,   no             in

(many better and few worse than the one now before us), the raison
d'étre of an English edition of M. Petersen's work is not very ap
parent.     It consists of 72 pages, and contains 228 exercises, the
latter being unquestionably the best part of the book, certainly as
regards quality, if not quantity.          Could the accomplished and
amusing author of “Euclid and his Modern Rivals' have seen
it before publishing his work, he would certainly have found mate
rial for his piquant criticism.                                                            all

are two Archaean groups, the slaty and the gneissic; (2) the slaty
is composed of slates, shales, limestones, grits, conglomerates, and
 chloritic schists, in which at present a definite order has not been
 ascertained (the gneissic group is composed of the following, in
descending order—granitoidite,       chloritic and hornblendic schists,
grey gneiss, quartz-schist, and halleflinta); (3) the slaty series is
 occasionally foliated, but is usually in a partially altered state; the
gneissic group is thoroughly metamorphosed; (4) the slaty series
 has closer lithological affinities with the St.-David's volcanic group,
 the Charnwood rocks, and the Lilleshall series than with the Bangor
 group; (5) the slaty series is undoubtedly Pebidian, the gneissic
series may, with some probability, be referred to the Dimetian.      The
microscopic structure of the principal varieties of the rocks men
tioned in the above paper was described by Prof. Bonney.

Esq., D.Sc., F.G.S.
   This paper gave the result of an examination of the vicinity of
Durness and Inchnadamf, where Lower-Silurian fossils occur in a
limestone, as discovered by Mr. C. Peach.       At Durness the only
evidence of the limestone  underlying  the schist is the asserted fact
of the dip being in the same direction; for          all
                                                  admit the junction
 to   befaulted one. The author showed that while the flaggy (upper)

schists dip uniformly to N.E., the limestone dips in a very variable
manner E.S.E., E., and but rarely N.E., any dip N. of E. being ex
ceptional and then only at a distance from the schist. Again, the
Smoo mass of limestone, cut off from the Durness area by a faulted
strip of gneiss, dips either E.S.E., or even more to S. After discuss
ing the relation of the quartzite and gneisses, the author passed to
the Assynt district, and pointed out that the relations of the
limestone and the quartzite are by no means satisfactorily established,
that their conformity is rendered dubious by a marked discordance
of strike, and that the limestone lies in a synclinal basin, so that
its dip in one place is in the opposite direction to that of the
quartzite.    From the above considerations the author holds that in
these districts there is no proof of the Lower-Silurian age of the
quartzite and newer series of flaggy gneiss and schist.
    3. “On a Boulder of Hornblende-Pikrite        near Pen-y-Carnisiog,
Anglesey.”     By Prof. T. G. Bonney, M.A., F.R.S., Sec.G.S.
    The boulder described had been originally about a cubic yard in
 volume; and the fragments lay in a field to the left of the road from
 Pen-y-Carnisiog to Bwlyn. The ground-mass consists of hornblende
 and serpentinous products, with a littlemica. In this are crystals, often
 # inch long, of brown hornblende with enclosures of altered olivine.
   The author doubted whether this hornblende is not a paramorph after
 augite; some of that in the ground-mass is certainly of secondary
 origin.    He compared the rock with a pikrite from the Lleyn penin
 sula and two described by Prof. Geikie from Fifeshire.         It differs
 from all these, but has a singular resemblance to a pikrite from
  Schriesheim (Odenwald), except that it is rather more altered. He
 called attention to the rock in hopes that some geologists may dis
 cover it in situ, as it will be of much value in deciding in what
  direction the ice has moved over Anglesey.

ON   THE MOTION OF AN INCOMPRESSIBLE WISCOUS FLUID IN THE

        To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,                         Halle a. S., Dec. 29, 1880.
IN    the November number of the Philosophical Magazine (vol. x.
   No. 63), pp. 342–357, is a paper by Dr. Thomas Craig, of Wash
ington, communicated by A. G. Greenhill, Esq., “On Steady
Motion in an Incompressible Wiscous Fluid.” The second part of
that paper treats of the motion of the fluid in the vicinity of a
sphere.   In the year 1875, in Borchardt's Journal für reine und
angewandte Mathematik, vol. lxxxi.,               I
                                       discussed the same question:
I place at your disposal the enclosed copy of my paper. You will
easily convince yourselves, by the perusal of § 2 (pp. 68–74) of the
same,    that:—
    (1) Mr. Craig and        I   have set and discussed exactly the same
problem;
   (2) There is a close correspondence between the transformations
and calculations in the one paper and in the other (I mention
especially that Dr. Craig likewise makes use of a theorem of Bor
chardt's, Monatsberichte der Berl. Akad. 1873, in the same way as
I had done);
   (3) Of course our final results are identical.
    Itherefore venture to hope that you will give as early insertion
as possible to this in the Philosophical Magazine.

ON      THE MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTROMOTIVE                    FORCE OF THE
                    PILE. B.Y. M. J.-B. BAILLE.
    The relative electromotive force of the pile is usually                deduced
from Ohm's laws and the examination of the intensity of the cur
rents produced by      it.

on the density of the earth led me to think that this apparatus, the
construction and regulation of which are so simple, might be put in
action by the weakest forces and give very precise measurements.
    The precautions necessary for obtaining good oscillations con
sist in avoiding some perturbations which present themselves,
always the same, and the relative influence of which would be
the greater the more delicate the phenomenon to be studied.
    Among those perturbations, M. Cornu and             I   have already
  ointed out electric influences and      trepidations   of the ground.
   hese are   completely  eliminated  by   surrounding    the apparatus
with a metallic case attached to the    ground,   and  setting  it up in a
very quiet place upon solid pillars.
    I have been exposed to another very serious disturbing cause
—the influence .# heat. It makes itself sensible upon the tor
sion-thread, and upon the air of the case which surrounds the lever.
These two effects are easily distinguished from one another. When,
the thread alone is heated or cooled, the oscillations are quite irre
gular and disordered; if the air alone is subjected to the action of
 the heat, the oscillations remain nearly pendular, but the point of
static equilibrium about which the oscillation takes place is more or
less quickly displaced, always in the same direction, while the dura
tion of an oscillation is slightly increased.   I protected myself from
these very tenacious perturbing influences by surrounding the ap
 paratus with a thick layer of wood-shavings.
    The apparatus which I employed was composed of a long torsion
thread (270 centims.) of annealed silver, and a lever 50 centims.
in length, carrying at each end a ball of gilt copper of 3 centims.
 diameter. Similar spheres were fixed to the vertices of a rectangle
 of 20.5 metres, and communicated with each other in pairs diago
 nally.    The lever, placed at equal distance from the fixed spheres,
 communicated, through the intermedium of the torsion-thread, with
 the positive pole of a determined pile P, the other pole being to
 earth.
    The charge of the lever was not so constant as           I could have
 desired; for piles always undergo variations difficult to define.
 I  was also obliged to measure this charge at each observation.         I
 connected the positive pole of the pile P simultaneously with the
 lever and a pair of fixed spheres, and took the resulting deflection;
 I  recommenced by taking the deflection on the other side, and so
 on alternately four times.
     The pile to be measured, X, was composed often equal elements;
 and    I put one of the poles of this pile into communication with
 the fixed balls, while the lever remained in contact with P, and the
 other pole of X was to earth; then
 lever a second time.
                                        I  measured the charge of the
     The deflections were read by means of the reflection of an illu
 minated glass scale placed at 3.5 metres from the lever. All the
 elements of the measurement were known; and Coulomb's static

       A    STUDY ON SPECTROPHOTOMETERS.                      BY M. A.    CROWA.

     In the most general case Sturm's theorem leads to the con
 clusion that all the rays which constitute an extremely delicate
 pencil, reflected or refracted a certain number of times by plane
 surfaces, meet two indefinitely small straight lines contained in two
 rectangular planes.
     Excepting the case of the minimum of deviation, therefore, a
 simple prism always gives an aberration which can be represented
 by that of a cylindrical lens, convergent or divergent according to
 the case, the axis of which is parallel to the refracting edge; this
 aberration can be corrected by means of a cylindrical lens suitably
 arranged.      Direct-vision prisms are often affected by an aberration
 of the same kind, so that clean images can only be obtained in two
 directions, parallel or perpendicular to the refracting edge, by dif
 ferent degrees of drawing-out of the telescope of the spectroscope".
     I ascertained this aberration by substituting for the slit a reticule
 formed of two rectangular strokes traced on a coat of silver and
 illuminated by monochromatic light.                   I
                                                have been able to correct it
 by intercalating between the dispersing-prism and the telescope a
system of two cylindrical lenses, plano-convex and plano-concave,
of the same curvature: if the two curved parts are in contact, the
 system constitutes a medium with parallel faces; on being separated
to a suitable distance they operate like a cylindrical lens whose
focal length, variable at pleasure, can be calculated as a function of
the distance between the two lenses.
     The employment of prisms with total reflection introduces, into
the polarized ray which they reflect, a difference of phase between
the two principal components, and gives at the emergence an
elliptically polarized ray.         I
                                   have measured this difference of phase
in the      apparatus     Iuse;  the ellipticity produced by it may de
tract from the     accuracy   of the photometric measurements obtained
by means of a rotating Nicol. This elliptical polarization by total
reflection can be completely suppressed by substituting for the
simple prism two prisms with total reflection, superposed, in con
tact, whose two right sections are rectangular, or a single prism
suitably cut, producing the effect of the two prisms of which have                I
 just spoken.
     With this disposition, the slit may be placed vertical, which is
more convenient.         After the two total reflections undergone by the
light in this prism, the plane of polarization has rotated 90°, and
all   difference     phase between the two principal components has
                     of
vanished, the reflected ray preserves the rectilinear polarization.
    These principles can       beutilized         in
                                              the construction     spectro   of
photometers, and,         Iexpect, will permit more rigorous measure
ments     to    obtained.—Comptes Rendus

 senting three regions:–1. A middle one, extending from the
 boundary of the blue and green to a little beyond the violet;
 in this region the argentic iodide is blackened.       2. Below
 this, and extending from the boundary of the blue and green
 to the inferior theoretical limit of the prismatic spectrum, is a
 region strongly marked, in which the action of the daylight
 has been altogether arrested or removed, the daylight and the
 sunlight having apparently counterbalanced and checked each
 other.   3. A similar protected      region occurs beyond the
 violet; this, however, is very much shorter than the prece
 ding. The sketch annexed to Herschel’s paper represents these
 facts as well as they can be by an uncoloured drawing.

 corresponding to the blackened region of the photograph.

trum formed by a reflecting grating having 17,296 lines to
the inch, and was not a little surprised to see that from the
blue to the red end of the spectrum there is an energetic ex
tinction of the light, and darkness is produced.                  repeatedI
this with other       gratings,    and under varied       circumstances,
and always found the same effect.
    Now, considering the exceedingly small amount of heat
available in this case, and considering the intensity of the
 effect, is there not herein an indication that we must
attribute this result to some other than a calorific cause ?
   I   endeavoured to obtain better information on this point by
 using the rays of the moon, which, as is well known, are very
 deficient in heating-power.         Many years ago had obtainedI
 some     phosphorographs         of that object.       With the more
 sensitive   preparations     now acessible, and with a telescope of
 11 inches aperture and 150 inches focus, there was no difficulty
 in procuring specimens about 1:4 inch in diameter.                  These
 represented the lunar surface satisfactorily.          At half-moon an
 exposure of three or four seconds was sufficient to give a fair
 proof. But, on insolating a phosphorescent tablet, and causing
 the converging moon-rays to pass through the red glass
 which  I   commonly use as an extinguisher, no effect was pro
 duced by the red moonlight on the shining surface.
   I
       º
       repeated this experiment, using a lens 5 inches in diameter
 and 7 inches focus, so arranged that the moon's image could
 be kept stationary on the phosphorescent tablet.              That image
 WaS           # inch in diameter.      Then, insolating the tablet, the
  moon-rays, after passing through a red glass, were caused to
  fall upon    it.  The exposure continued ten minutes; but                               no
  effect was   produced     on  the shining surface.     The lunar image
  was  so brilliant that when the red        glass  was removed, and
  non-shining phosphorescent           surface was exposed                     to   it,   a a
  bright image could       be produced     in  single second.

  wave-length but also the proper amplitude                of
                                                         vibration.    This

  experiments.       In   my memoir         the negative

168         On the Phosphoragraph                of a Solar Spectrum.
    This brings us to Captain Abney’s recent researches, which,
by the aid of the grating, carry the investigation referred to
the prismatic spectrum as far below the red as the red is
below the yellow. They are not to be regarded as an ex
tension of exploration in the infra-red region (for they really
do not carry us beyond my own observations in 1843), but
as seeuring the resolution of these lines or bands into their
constituent elements.             I
                           had never regarded them as really
single lines; the breadth or massiveness of their photographs
                         wº
too plainly suggests that they are composed of many
associated ones.   The principle of decreasing refrangibility
with increasing                       incapacitates file prism from
separating them; but the grating (which spreads them out
according to their wave-length) reveals at once their composite
character.
   In Captain Abney’s map, after leaving the red line A, we
find three groups —(1) ranging from about 8150 to 8350;
(2) from 8930 to 9300 ; (3) from 9350 to 9800. These, ad
mitting that the lines of the subsequent grating-spectra have
been excluded, are then the resolution of a, B, y.
    I suppose that care has been taken to make sure of that,
either by absorbent media or by a subsidiary prism.               If the
grating had been ruled in such a manner as to extinguish the
second spectrum, inconveniences would arise from the charac
teristics thereby impressed on the first.
    In the phosphorographic spectrum on luminous paint, this
vast multitude of lines is blended into a mass which probably
can never be completely resolved into                             its
                                                                                    to on
                                                 elements,     account
of  the propagation       phosphorescence from particle
                             of                                particle.
I  have resolved        into two
                        it             three constituent groups, and
                                           or
                                                        its its

                                                                    us   to

in the B.A. unit of 0-00888=0.888 per cent. in deficiency.
   Weber's determinations, on the other hand, indicate that

The E.M.F. E.--CR representing this amount of work is

    58. Very many experiments have been made during the last
 thirty or forty years on the values of e under varying condi
 tions, on a somewhat closely allied thing, viz. the E.M.F.
 existent between the electrodes of an electrolytic cell after
 rupture of the current", and on the E.M.F. of gas-batteries
 (and especially those with hydrogen and oxygen as gases)f.
 From these researches it results that, other things being equal,
the counter E.M.F. set up during electrolysis increases with
the current-strength as the size of the electrodes is diminished
and as the temperature is lowered, at least within certain limits.
The observations made have almost invariably been performed
with currents of moderate or considerable magnitude; with
such currents in no case has a value for e been obtained less
than the E.M.F. corresponding to the decomposition into the
final products, whilst with powerful currents much larger values
have been obtained: thus with water,          values       registered            all                ofe
 to lie
    above 1:50 volt, and sometimes exceed       volts (when reduced               3

  60. Various determinations have been made of the E.M.F.
which a Grove’s gas-battery can generate under various con
ditions.   When the gases are oxygen and hydrogen, it has
uniformly been found that the E.M.F. generated is less than
1:50 volt, the value representing the work done in the union
of ordinary gaseous oxygen and hydrogen to form liquid
water, which is the end result of the action taking place in
such a cell when it generates a current. . Recently Osgood
Pierce (Wied. Annalen, viii. p. 98, 1879) has found numbers
varying from 766 to .926 Daniell cell ('84 to 1:02 volt),
according to the temperature, the nature of the liquid present,
the purity of the oxygen, &c.      Cateris paribus, increasing
the temperatures  lowers the E.M.F.; Morley has recently

jointly with Prof. W. C. Roberts, has shown (Chem. Soc.
 Journal, 1873, p. 112) that the specific heat of the portion of
 hydrogen first occluded by palladium is much greater than
 that of the later portions, the limiting values being near to
 9 on the one side and 34 on the other—or values respec
 tively representing a condensation to something approaching
 the liquid state (judged by analogy with liquid bromine, the
 product of the combining number and specific heat of which
 is near 9), and a condensation but little exceeding that due
 to ordinary atmospheric pressure.             Presumably when a film
 of  gas  is attracted to the surface of a solid, the portions first
 attracted are very highly condensed, the next ones less so, and
 so on, a kind of atmosphere or aura surrounding the body
 being thus produced of density varying from the maximum
 amount of condensation to the minimum, i. e. the pressure of
 the surrounding atmosphere.            The total quantity of gas thus
 condensed is not inconsiderable : thus an ordinary porcelain
 or, better still, a platinum crucible, if ignited and cooled in
 dry air, will weigh less by from one to several milligrammes,

 182          Dr. C. R. A. Wright on       the Determination of
      In  accordance   with the ordinarily received views as to the
 atomic and molecular constitution of matter, it would seem
 to result from the fact that the maximum counter E.M.F.
 set up during electrolysis of water exceeds 3 volts, that the first
 action of the current is to break up the water (and similarly
 for other electrolytes) into free atoms of the components,
 which atoms then rearrange themselves into molecules either
 as a secondary action or under the condensing action of the
 electrodes, or both ; whence it would seem that the sum of
 the heat of condensation of hydrogen atoms to molecules together
 with that of org/gen atoms to molecules earceeds that of the union
 of the hydrogen and or/gen atoms together to form molecules of
 liquid water.
     66. The phenomena connected with “subsequent polari
 zation ” (§ 58, footnote) are just as readily explained by the
 theorem as those relating to the counter E.M.F. set up
 whilst the current is passing. When visible decomposition
 has taken place for some time, so that the electrodes are sur
 rounded respectively with a saturating aura of hydrogen and
 of oxygen, varying in density from the highest to the lowest
 possible value, and when, in addition, there are in the vicinity
 of the electrodes more or less of the “nascent " products of
electrolysis, the counter E.M.F. set up during the passage of
the current, and therefore representing the polarization at the
instant of rupture, is (§ 61)
             e=E,-- [X4(1–n)H}–X(nh)—S(H)]x.J.
After the lapse of a given interval of time (however small),
more or less of the “nascent” products have spontaneously
changed       into the final products, viz. oxygen and hydrogen,
thereby diminishing the value of >{(1–n)H}, and conse
quently lessening the value of e, the “polarization.”              Even
after sufficient time has      elapsed  for the whole of the “nascent
products” to have thus transformed themselves, the diffusion
of water containing dissolved oxygen to the hydrogen elec
trode from the other, and of water containing dissolved
hydrogen from the hydrogen electrode to the other, will still
cause, by chemical action, a continual removal of portions of the
aura of attracted gas round each electrode, thereby causing a
continual increase in the mean value of X(nh)", and hence a
further diminution in the value of e : finally the polarization
must become 0, when
                  {X(nl)+S(H)}XJ=E1=1:50 volt.

 which is impracticable in experiments in which it is essential
 that the current should not sensibly vary during long periods
 of time;-and, secondly, enables the value of an extremely
 minute current to be determined with as much accuracy as
 that of a much stronger one, and even with greater accuracy;
 for whilst the current from a given electrometer is diminished
 by throwing more and more resistance into circuit, the differ

 into circuit is not only not decreased but is even increased.

   It  is evident from these numbers, specimens of many similar
 experiments, that the predictions from the general theorem

to saturate as far as possible, not only the liquids surrounding the
electrodes with the gases respectively evolved on the electrodes,
but also the interior of the foils with occluded gases. The elec
trodes were then rapidly removed, rinsed with recently boiled
just cool acid to remove adherent solution of hydrogen or
 oxygen, and dipped into a U-tube containing the same recently
boiled just cool acid. On connecting the two pieces of foil with
a quadrant-electrometer a considerable potential difference was
at once indicated. The two pieces of foil were then connected
by a shortcircuiting wire for a short time (ten seconds usu
ally); on removal of the wire, the foils being still connected
with the electrometer, the spot of light moved regularly for a
considerable time, indicating a gradual increase in the E.M.F.
of the voltaic arrangement thus produced, from 0 at the mo
ment of removal of the shortcircuiting wire up to a maximum,
which was maintained for some time, after which the E.M.F.
fººl        fell, precisely as in the experiments just described.
  tis evident that this development and rise of the E.M.F. set up
was due to the formation and increase of an aura of gas round
each electrode, the source of which was clearly the gas occluded
internally in each respectively, the which gas now passed out
wards by a reversal of the process by which it formerly passed
inwards. The following three sets of readings (averages of

   In these three cases the maximum E.M.F. was attained
respectively after about 3–7, 7–10, and 7 minutes. The value
of the maximum was much higher in the second case than in
the first, indicating a much greater amount of gas occluded,
as might be anticipated, since a much more rapid current
flowed during the period before the electrodes were discon
nected from the battery, the current being near to 000001
and 000020 weber during these periods in the first and
second cases respectively.    Notwithstanding, however, that a
still more   rapid  current (about 000025) flowed in the third
case, the maximum attained was scarcely higher than that in
the second, because the smaller surface of the electrode caused
the rate of loss of aura by solution in the unsaturated sur
rounding fluid and diffusion away of the solution thus formed
to another part of the U-tube to be relatively larger in this
case; consequently the rate of fall after the maximum had
been reached was considerably more rapid.
   73. A curious effect is sometimes produced by the gradual
passage outwards from electrodes of occluded gases and the
formation of an aura round each, thus virtually setting up a
kind of Grove’s gas battery.           If

a voltameter till the liquids surrounding the electrodes were
saturated with oxygen and hydrogen respectively, for which
purpose a battery of two Minotti cells was used. One Minotti
cell was then excluded from the circuit, a resistance of 50,000
ohms being included therein (the current being measured by
determining the difference of potential set up between the ends
of this resistance, as described in § 69), and the voltameter
plates shortcircuited for a few seconds.    After removing the
shortcircuiting wire, the current passed at a rapidly slackening
rate in the direction due to the Minotti cell; but in a very
few minutes it ceased to flow altogether, and then began to
flow in the opposite direction. The shortcircuiting of the vol
tameter-plates was then repeated for two minutes, after which
the current flowed in the normal direction at a gradually.
slackening rate: after one hour the current still flowed in the
normal direction and had a value of +0.0000034 weber; but
soon it became reduced to zero again, and then flowed in the
reverse direction, having a value of –0.0000017, weber after
two hours had elapsed since the second shortcircuiting.            After

polarization then existent being governed by the proportions
of “nascent" hydrogen and oxygen that were being evolved
the instant previously and the mean densities of the aurae,
i.e. by the values of n, and nº and hi and he in the expression
    e=E1 + (1–ni)H1–nihi + (1–ng)H2—nghs—X(H)}XJ
(§ 61). After the lapse of a given time, however, more or less
of the “nascent” hydrogen and oxygen have rearranged
themselves, and more or less of the original aura round each
electrode has become reconverted into water by the effects of
diffusion (bringing oxygen-containing fluid to the hydrogen
electrode and vice versa); so that from these causes n, and nº
have increased, each of these changes diminishing the value
of e, the polarization.  Simultaneously, however, each aura
has been more or less reinforced by the passage outwards of
occluded gas from within, each of these changes tending to
increase e. Presumably the greater the extent to which the
aura was wasted, so to speak, by diffusion, the more rapidly
would this outward passage of occluded gases take place; so
that finally the rate of fall of polarization is gradually re
tarded, first because as the “nascent” hydrogen and oxygen
become expended by spontaneous rearrangement this source
of fall of polarization regularly diminishes, and secondly
because the greater the fall the more energetic is the restoring
influence of the outward passage of the occluded gases, at
least until the amount occluded becomes materially reduced in
quantity.    When the amount of fall is such that the rate of
outward passage of occluded gases almost balances the rate of
wasting of aura through diffusion, the rate of fall of polarization
becomes almost insensible, at any rate for periods of time not
too prolonged.      This point was reached in many of the ex

periments, in particular those with the “largest " voltameter
and polarizations of values not exceeding a few tenths of a
volt (§ 71). Ultimately, however, the occluded              become
exhausted and the aurae diminish to inappreciable quantities,
the value of e diminishing to a quantity too small to measure.
This result requires an enormous length of time to bring
it about by the action of diffusion only ;             if,

quantity diminishes, the effective E.M.F. of the voltaic couple
formed by the plates also diminishes.
    If through leakage of the apparatus, or other causes, at
 mospheric air obtains access to the liquid surrounding the
 —electrode, the dissolved oxygen thence resulting will of course
 tend to reduce the aura of hydrogen by a chemical action of
 a kind akin to the “local action ” of an ordinary voltaic
 element, i. e. not contributing to the work done by the
 current generated.      In this case the rate of fall of the “sub
 sequent polarization ” (the electrode not being connected by
 a wire so as to produce a current) will be more or less en
 hanced above the rate due to diffusion only, as above described
 (§ 70); whilst if the electrodes are connected and a current
 is made to pass, the E.M.F. of the voltaic couple thus produced
 will diminish more rapidly than would be the case were no
 dissolved oxygen present in the liquid round the hydrogen
 plate, just as the zinc of an ordinary cell wastes more rapidly
 when there is local action than it does when there is not, other
 things being equal.
 XXV.      On Copying Diffraction-gratings, and on some Pheno
    mena connnected therewith.       By LORD RAYLEIGH, F.R.S.,
    Professor of     Eaperimental    Physics   in the University of
     Cambridge.”
     N  the  Phil. Mag. for February and March 1874 gave anI
       account of experiments in the photographic reproduction
 of  gratings   ruled with lines at a rate of 3000 and 6000 to the

  unexplained. The present communication is thus to be re
 garded as supplementary to the former.
    Some years ago Prof. Quincke described an unphoto
 graphic process by which he had succeeded in copying en
                         º
 graved glass gratings. . He began by depositing a thin
 coating of silver by the chemical method upon the face of the
 grating.    The conducting layer thus obtained was then trans
 ferred to an electrolytic cell, and thickened by the deposit of
 copper, until stout              to be detached from the glass
 substratum. In this way he prepared an accurate cast of the

glass surface, faced with highly reflecting silver.     Since, the
optical depth of the lines is increased some four times, these
gratings usually give much brighter spectra than the glass
originals.
   Prof. Quincke was kind enough to send me some specimens of
his work, giving extremely beautiful spectra.         found, how                     I
ever, that, though carefully preserved, these gratings deterio
rated after a time, apparently either from insufficient thickness,
or from imperfect adhesion of the silver layer. In my own
attempts          I
             endeavoured to remedy this defect by not allowin
the silver to dry before transference to the electrolytic cell,
                             º
and by commencing the electric deposit with a silver instead
of with a copper solution.                           I
                                   did not, however, succeed in
finding a thoroughly satisfactory plating-liquid.          In the
ordinary cyanide solution the silver was at once loosened from
the glass.    In other solutions the grating could be immersed
                                                                                    º
with impunity, but the film began to strip as soon as the
current passed.     Using acetate of silver, however,     was able                       I
 to obtain a certain degree of thickening.         also found ad               I

thickness,            its
                edges were dipped       melted paraffine; and in                                     it
was then transferred          the usual acid solution
                                           to                    copper.                 of

                          had then tried (6000 to inch).          In the
                             *
summer of 1879 an opportunity afforded itself of submitting
the matter to the test of actual trial through the kindness of
Mr. Rutherfurd, who presented me with a beautiful glass
grating containing               12,000 lines, ruled at the rate of
17,280 to the inch.        The copies, taken with suitable pre
cautions to secure a    good   contact, were completely successful,
so far as the spectrum of the first order is concerned.          Indeed
careful comparison showed no appreciable difference between
the defining-power of the original and of the copies; and with
respect to brightness some of the copies had the advantage.
On a former occasion *                I
                                   have shown that the theoretical
resolving-power in the orange region of the spectrum is
equal to that obtainable from a prismatic spectroscope with
12% per cent. of “extra dense flint;” and                  I
                                                     have no reason to
think that the actual    resolving-power     fell far short. This is a
considerable result to obtain with a photograph which may
be taken in half an hour at a cost of two or three shillings.
   The case is different, however, when we turn to the spectrum
of the second order.         Used in this way the original gives
magnificent results; but they are not reproduced in the copies.
Some parts of the photograph will sometimes show a faint
spectrum of the second order; but it is usually traversed by
one or more dark bands, whose nature will presently be ex
amined more at length.
   As a rule, glass (or at any rate transparent) originals only
would be used for purposes of reproduction; but as a matter
of curiosity   I tried what could be done in copying an original
ruled on  speculum-metal.        The specimen experimented upon
was similar to my own, both as to the total number of lines
and as to the degree of closeness, and belongs to Mr. Spottis
woode, to whom           I
                        am indebted for the loan of                    it.

to the inch, and with reasonably flat glass as support to the
photographic film, these bands rarely invade the first or second
spectrum. When, however, we come to 17,000 lines to the
inch, it requires pretty flat glass and some precautions in
printing to keep even the first spectrum free from them.
   It was obvious from the first that the formation of these
bands was a question of the distance between the ruled surface
of the original and the sensitive film ; but it is only within
the last year or so that       I
                             have submitted the point to special
experiment.     For this  purpose       I
                                      substitute for plane-parallel
glass as a substratum for the sensitive film the convex surface
of a lens of moderate curvature. As in the experiment of
Newton’s rings, we obtain in this way an interval gradually
increasing from the point of contact outwards, and thus
upon one plate secure a record of the effect upon the copy of
varying degrees of closeness.     When a spectrum of any order
is thrown upon the eye, those places upon the grating where
the spectrum in question fails appear as dark rings.        My first
experiment of this kind was made with the Rutherfurd grating,
in order principally to find out how close a contact was really
necessary for copying.      From the diameter of the first dark
ring, in conjunction with a rough estimate of the curvature
                I
of the lens, concluded that the interval between the surfaces
 should nowhere much exceed roºoo of an inch. It appeared
at the same time that the chance was remote of obtaining
a satisfactory performance in the spectrum of the second order.
About this time the theoretical views occurred to me which
will presently be explained, and
by more careful measurements than

the course of last  summer,   however,     found Iaccidentally  that
Fox Talbot had made, many years ago", some kindred ob
servations; and the perusal of his account of them induced me
to alter somewhat my proposed line of attack. It will be
convenient to quote here Fox Talbot’s brief statement:-
   “About ten or twenty feet from the radiant point, I placed
 in the path of the ray an equidistant grating f made by
 Fraunhofer, with       its
                        lines vertical.     then viewed the light

  radually back until something distinctive was seen ; and the

riorates, and is worst at a distance of 33. In this position the
proper period ('0104 inch) is lost, but subordinate fluctuations
of brightness in shorter periods prevent the formation of a
thoroughly flat field of view.      As the distance is further             in
            e definition   appears   to improve, until at distances

the measurements were ever repeated, it would be advisable
to use a collimating lens as well as a more accurate grating.
   The problem of determining the illumination at various
points behind a grating exposed to a parallel beam of homo
geneous light, could probably be attacked with success by the
usual methods of physical optics, if it were assumed that the
grating presented uniform intervals alternately transparent
and opaque.    Actual gratings, however, do not answer to this
description, and, indeed, vary greatly in character.      have                    I
therefore preferred to follow the comparatively simple method,
explained in my book on Sound, §§ 268, 301, which is ade

      Taking the axis of
                       2 normal to the grating, and parallel to
the original direction of the light, and the axis of a perpen
dicular to the lines of the grating, we require a general ex
pression for the vibration of given frequency which is periodic

contact to be too close, though      I  do not remember to have
met with this in practice; and theoretically it is what would
be expected when we consider that the original does not act
by opacity. According to this view a different result should
be obtained in copying an opaque grating ; and such            I have
                                                I
found to be the case. For this purpose employed a copy of
|. andW.
the same 6000 Nobert, taken some years ago on a tannin
                        the photographic film on the same lens as
  efore.       hen the resulting photograph was examined, the
spectra of the first three orders showed bright centres. The
diameter of the first dark ring in the first spectrum was 44
inch—smaller than before.
    With the 3000 Nobert in place of the 6000 the ring-system
is formed on a larger scale. The centres for the first four
spectra are black, with the exception of the actual place of
contact, where evidently the collodion film was impressed
mechanically.      The diameter of the first dark ring in     }.  first
spectrum is 90 inch, not quite the double of 54 inch, although
   e same lens as before was used.          In the second spectrum
the diameter of the first dark    ring  is '56 inch, and in the third
spectrum 40 inch.
    Interesting as these bands may be in theory, they are to be
avoided as much as possible in the practical reproduction of
gratings, not merely because a part of the area is lost, but
also on account of the reversal which takes place at every re
vival of brightness. Without having examined the matter
                I
very closely, had generally found the performance of gratings
which showed these bands to be inferior; and now it would
seem that the explanation is to be found in the above-men
tioned reversals, which could not fail to interfere with the
     ºf
resolving-power.
             my early experiments it happened once that in the
course of printing an accidental shifting took place, leading to
the impression of a double image.         A more perfect result was

afterwards obtained       by intentionally    communicating to the
 Slates a   slight  relative twist in the middle of the exposure.
  When a spectrum from such a grating is thrown upon the
       parallel bars are seen perpendicular to the direction of
the             but the number and position of these bars de
pend upon the order of the spectrum.            In one case twenty
five bars were counted in the first       spectrum,   and twice that
number in the second.        But it is unnecessary to dwell further
upon these observations, as they correspond exactly to what
the ordinary theory of gratings would lead us to expect.

XXVI.     On the Formation and Decomposition of Carbonic Acid.
                    By   J.   B. LAwEs, F.R.S.*
N    O facts in science have been more clearly established
                         º tº.
        than those which relate to the decomposition of carbonic
acid  by  the green parts of plants (resulting in the fixation of
the carbon and the return of the liberated oxygen to the atmo
sphere) and the part            by animal life        combustion in
again uniting the carbon with the
                                             ..".
   The vast quantity of carbon locked up in coal and other
                                                        that, at one
carbonaceous deposits leads to the
period of the earth's existence, the amount of carbonic acid
must have been larger than it is at the present time; but
since the period when accurate determinations of carbonic acid
were first made, no appreciable difference in the quantity has
been shown to exist, although it would appear probable that
the great increase of animal life, the destruction of forests, and
the combustion of coal would tend to increase the amount.
   The Rothamsted experiments which have heen carried on
for so long a period, while they clearly establish the fact that
the atmosphere is the main, if not the exclusive, source of the
carbon fixed by plants, at the same time point to conclusions
which differ somewhat from those generally received, with
regard to the action of man and animal life on one side, and
that of plants on the other, in maintaining the equilibrium of
the atmosphere.
    Ipropose to take stock of the soil and atmosphere resting
upon Great Britain, with the assumption (fortunately for us
not a true one) that our atmosphere is as much a fixture as
our soils, and is not constantly being exchanged with the
atmosphere coming from other parts of the globe.
   The sources of the carbon given                off
                                             into the atmosphere             as
carbonic acid are three:–
   (1) Those derived from the consumption            coal; of
   (2) From the      imported  products   used     food  as for comor
            bustion;
-
   (3) From the products             of
                                 our own soil.
   The agricultural statistics make the area             of
                                                    Great Britain            to

me through the kindness of Mr. Robert Hunt, of the Museum
of Practical Geology; and although they somewhat exceed two
tons per acre per annum,        I have based my calculation on that
amount.
    The figures relating to imports are based upon the larger
articles of food (such as live animals, meat, sugar, potatoes)
and combustible substances (as tallow, petroleum, &c.).
    With regard to the carbon given off by the consumption of
home produce, so far as relates to the 33% million acres which
constitute the cultivated area, my estimates are formed upon
            i.
what     I believe to be the average yield of the land; upon the
remaining area, consisting of mountains, heath, and waste,
the only           for calculation is to be derived from the rental
value of such land, and the amount of stock which it will
carry.
                                                        I
    Without going into the detail of the figures, have given
in the following table a summary of the whole.
   Carbon given off     as Carbonic Acid per acre per annum in
                            Great Britain.

     We find, according to the more recent estimates, that the
 amount of carbon, as carbonic acid, resting upon an acre of
ground is equal to about 14,000 lbs. Now the amount given
off by the sources which I have mentioned above would more
 than double the carbonic acid in our atmosphere in three
years, provided that no compensation took place!          I propose
 to examine into what is the probable extent of the compensa
tion which may come in to limit this large increase.
     With regard to coal and imported products, there is very
 little compensation possible; but will the products grown
 upon our own soils, there is a continuous exchange going on
 between the atmosphere and the plant; and the question is on
 which side the balance lies.
     I am disposed to think that, upon arable land (when kept in
 a uniform state of fertility), the amount of carbonic acid, fixed
 and exhaled, would be nearly the same, but that, wherever
 the fertility of the soil was diminished, there the carbonic acid
  given off would be in excess of that fixed.
     In the ordinary case of a farmer selling a certain amount
 of the products of his land and consuming the residue, the
 saleable products, consisting of corn and meat, are burnt into

carbonic acid, while the straw and other residue slowly assume
       º
the same form.        But the food sold is derived from fertility
stored up in the soil, accumulated by vegetation in ages long
past,       thus goes also to swell the amount of carbonic acid
contributed by the soil to the atmosphere.
    This is made perfectly clear by long-continued experiments
at Rothamsted, which show that crops raised on unmanured
land, as also upon land receiving the mineral food of plants
but no nitrogen, derive their nitrogen from the store in the
soil; and as this nitrogen exists in combination with carbon,
the latter is given off in the form of carbonic acid.            Further,
as  agriculture   is generally   attended with more or less exhaus
tion of the soil, there             is,

 reached the eye, and the light of the room did not reach the
  surface of paint.      Besides these reasons for observing through
  a small  hole,  it is better to do so, because the light given off
 by the illuminated tissue, seems to vary with the angle at
 which it is observed, and the readings would not be constant
  if the eye were not in a fixed position. Experiment showed
 that the diffused light in the box from the illuminated tissue
 paper was not enough to have any effect on the phospho
 rescent paint. Both the paint and the tissue were observed
 through a solution of cupric sulphate, and blue glass; this
 did not, as far as       I  could see, cause any alteration in the
 colour of the    paint.   If the blue glass alone was used, the tissue
 looked pink in comparison with the paint; and with the cupric
 sulphate solution alone it looked green ; but with the two
 the colour was so nearly imitated, that when the intensity of
 the light was the same          I  could only distinguish the two
 surfaces   by  their  positions.
     The illumination of the tissue was estimated by the distance
of the burner from the tissue ; this assumes that the light
given off by the tissue varies directly as the light striking it
 on the reverse side.         Bright sunlight was reflected onto the
the   painted  surface   by   a mirror; and after it had acted for a
few   seconds,   the room was darkened, with the exception of the
light of the standard burner. For five minutes before this time,
I   took the precaution of hiding my eyes, so that no light could
get at them. As soon after this as possible, observations were
taken. Two slightly different methods were employed.                 At
first the burner was placed at a definite distance from the
tissue, and the time was noted at which the paint and tissue
first appeared to be equally bright, and also that at which
they first appeared to differ again in illumination; the mean
of these two times was taken as the time of equal illumination.
The burner was then moved away to a further fixed position, and
another observation taken in the same manner.                After five
observations had been taken in this         way,   the rate of decrease
of the light became very slow, and this method did not work
well. The distance of the burner to obtain equal illumination
was then found by moving it backwards and forwards, and
noting the position at which the illumination of the two sur
faces appeared the same ; this was done four times as rapidly
as possible, two before and two after the time at which an
observation was wanted. The following table gives the mean
of two series taken in this manner. The first column gives
the illumination of the paint: the light given off by the tissue
when the burner was nine inches from it is taken arbitrarily
as 100; and the other illuminations are calculated accordingly

    The truth is that, so far as it is possible to lay down any
general law at all, the definition depends rather upon the area
than upon the eaternal diameter of the aperture.       If A be this
area, the illumination at the focal point, where    the secondary                   all
waves concur      phase,

                                       is               by
illumination   being  taken      unity.      as

Hence     if     A'    be
                  the area over which       illumination      would  an                           I

in some sense the area      the diffraction-pattern, may

              Mr. S. T. Preston on Action at a Distance.              219
he assumes, ea<U+017F>plains gravity.         Gravity as we know, is found
to vary as the square of the distance (and not in some other
ratio).       This peculiar circumstance is supposed by Mr.
Browne to be explained by merely stating it to be a fact.
What would be thought of any one saying that the “law” of
light, which also varies in intensity as the square of the
distance, were explained, without considering the existence of
the aether, or the physical basis of light—without reflecting on
the fact that the area of the spherical wave over which the
energy is spread varies as the square of the distance (and not in
some other ratio). By a knowledge of the
                                                    ###".
determining light, the fact that the intensity of light varies
 as the square of the distance admits of being predicted before
hand.      So the “law'” of gravity will admit of being pre
 dicted beforehand from the determining physical conditions,
 as soon as these are known.            This capability of prediction
 beforehand, by a knowledge of the physical conditions, is one
                 swallowº
 test of the explanation of a physical fact. Yet some would
 teach us to                                           gravity varies as
 the   square   of the  distance, as an  explanation.     The same may
 be said of      magnetism     (which will never be      explained   until
                                                     º
  the determining physical conditions are known)".                  Surely
  no argument is necessary to establish such points as these,
  which (as matters of scientific principle) should really permit
 no difference of opinion, were it not for the absence of the
  “ competent faculty of thinking,” so strongly insisted on by
  Newton,       or absence of due reflection. It is needless to lay
 stress on the fact that an intellect which on the whole may be
 more competent.than another, may yet be                           incom
 petent in some given direction (and perhaps in this one).
 For minds are so differently constituted.
     Finally, Mr. Browne appears to find difficulty in realizing
 the fact that if we take ultimate atoms, and if we suppose the
 atoms of a bar of iron to be elastic (as according to the
  modern theory of matter, for example), and, finally, if these
  atoms be of open structure (say something of a ring form),
  then they can obviously bend when the bar is compressed;
  so that it is not necessary to assume the constituent atoms of
  the bar to be normally at a distance from each other, in order
  to explain the contraction of the bar (within certain limits)
  under an applied pressure.          It is so far evident that me
  chanical considerations are independent of scale, and atoms of
    * It seems to have been overlooked by Mr. Browne, that no doubt is
  now entertained by competent judges as to the essentially physical nature
 of magnetism, as it appears that there are grounds for believing that the
  velocity of propagation of the magnetic influence has been approximately
  determined.

open structure might be conceived to be in contact, and yet
the whole capable of compression (much like a system of
elastic springs in contact).

ON SOME EXPERIMENTS INSTITUTED TO SUPPLY ALL THE LINES
  TERMINATING AT THE CALCUTTA TELEGRAPH-OFFICE WITH
  CURRENTS TAPPEL FROM THE MAIN CURRENT PRODUCED BY
  A DYNAMO-ELECTRIC   MACHINE.  B.Y. LOUIS SCHWENDLER,
  ESQ., M.I.C.E., ETC.
MR.theSCHWENDLER        gave an outline of his paper explaining
        latest experiments he had made in order to prove the
practicability of his new method of supplying signalling currents.
This method was published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society,
part 2, vol. xlix. 1880, and in the Philosophical Magazine, No. 52,
December 1879, Supplement.           After certain incidental delays, the
final trial came off on Sunday the 29th August, 1880.
   One of the dynamo-electric machines employed for lighting the
sheds at Howrah Railway-station, produced the required strong
main current; and the signal currents were conveyed from Howrah
to the Calcutta Telegraph Office by an ordinary telegraph-line
about 2 miles in length.
   In  alleleven long main circuits were supplied with telegraph
currents      this manner, viz. the lines
               in                            Bombay, Madras, Kurrachee,
                                                              to
and  Rangoon.      The currents sent from Calcutta and the currents
received     the out-stations were measured; and
               at                                         the satisfactory     by
                                                                                it
result was established that           all the lines, even
                                                   in        the longest,             in
the tapped          or
                  machine currents were considerably stronger than the
currents produced                by
                          the ordinary signalling-batteries        present                     at
lin use,                                  -
  The trial lasted for three hours, under the direct supervision                                        of
Mr.    C.     Gordon, the Superintendent
             B.     P.                         the Bengal Division,      of
who carefully watched the working     the office.   The traffic was

despatched with regularity      the ordinary manner.
                                               in
   At the beginning       the trial the main current was produced
                                     of
through         an
              iron wire     0.21" diameter, offering
                                       of                resistance                  a                  of
1-5 B.A. unit. This main current was carefully measured, and
found      to equal
                be     36801 milliorsteds. At the end
                                to                            the trial                       of
the main current was produced through the arc            electric lamp,        of    an
giving    light
           a             of
                   about 6000 standard candles when measured under
 an angle        of
               45° with the horizon.                           In
                                            this latter case the main
current amounted       457.06 millioprsteds
                                to                                  “.
   The total current tapped from the main current (when all the
eleven lines were simultaneously sending) equalled 129 milli
orsteds, quite            an
                    insignificant fraction     the large main current.
                                                                   of
   Mr. Schwendler stated that this practical trial       the method had             of
shown that       was  perfectly
                     it          reliable, and      practical  telegraph  no
engineer would doubt that        was very convenient

                                the Calcutta office.    Mr. Schwendler
concluded his paper with some suggestions for utilizing the larger
portion    the current not required for telegraph-purposes, saying:—
            of
  *  One oersted    equal isone weber per second.
                                       to                                           One millicersted    is

“The useful work for the main current at night would most conve
niently take the shape of an electric light to illuminate very efficiently
the Signal-office.  The electric light would produce at least 50 times
less heat than if the same quantity of light were obtained by com
bustion; and this is no doubt a great advantage in a hot climate
like that of India. During the day-time the main current might
be used for pulling the punkhas, lifting messages, or, more generally,
for working a pneumatic system of despatching messages between
the head telegraph-office and local centres in Calcutta.      If Calcutta
had the good fortune to possess a colder climate, it might be sug
gested to use the heat developed by the main current in a coil of
 iron wire for warming rooms. It would then only be necessary to
lead the wire along the walls in a manner similar to that in which
rooms are often heated by hot-water pipes; only the electrical
 method would be far more economical.         The quantity of heat given
 out by such a wire is by no means small. In one case it was equal
 to 20473 () ergs per second, equal to 488 grim. degree-centigrade
     second.   This is about equal to the heat produced by an ordinary
É. erman stove consuming 6 lbs. of coals per hour, supposing that
the loss of heat when coals burn under a steam-boiler is about four
times greater than when they burn in a German stove.           It appears
therefore that the heat   emanating   from the wire should suffice to
keep a moderate-sized and ordinarily ventilated room at a comfort
able temperature even when situated in the highest latitude.”—

DETERMINATION OF THE COLOURS CORRESPONDING TO THE FUN
   DAMENTAL SENSATIONS BY MEANS OF ROTATING DISKS.                       BY
   M. A. ROSENSTIEHL.
   As Maxwell has shown”, rotating disks permit us to determine
with great precision the laws of colour-vision.                I
                                                         am going to fur
nish fresh proofs of that fact by showing how with their aid one
can find exactly the position occupied in the chromatic circle by the
three colours which, according to the theory of Young, correspond
to the fundamental sensations.
     Ihave taken as starting-point a chromatic circle executed on
sheets of paper with covering colouring-matters.         The whole forms
a continuous succession of seventy-two colours, in which the red,
the yellow, the blue are at equal distances from one another, and
the intervals are filled by colours also as equidistant as possible to
the eye, with the same height of tone, and             all
                                                     equally clear.

well chosen. The blue sector extinguishes the yellow of the orange
and forms white; the red alone remains.    The measure of the two
resulting sensations is given by the angles of the red and white
sectors.       I
            found
               140° orange +220° blue =281° red +56° white.
All the colours of the circle have been thus studied with respect to
two pairs of complementary colours—yellow and blue, red and the
fourth green (the first three because they are the primary colours

   The chromatic circle was thus found to be divided into four sec

                                                 the red by the fourth green.
    The following are the results obtained”:—
    1. The line which represents the proportion of the extreme sen
 sations in the intermediate colours is a straight line; therefore the
intermediate colours are, to the eye, rigorously equidistant.
   2. The line representing the sensation of yellow reaches its cul
minating point upon the ordinate which corresponds to yellow.
   3. This case, which                   I
                           thought must be general for the four lines,
forms, on the contrary, the exception: for the other colours things
take place in a different manner. The sensation of red goes on
increasing in a straight line, from the blue to the red; and beyond
this it continues to rise without deviation till it comes to the orange,
where it attains               its
                        culminating point,       sink afterwards tillto                              it
reaches the yellow, where         zero.      it   is
  In   like manner the sensation      green attains its maximum
                                                        of           the                        in

         CONFIRMATION OF THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS.
                 BY PLINY EARLE CHASE, LL.D.
   Herschel's “subsidence” hypothesis is corroborated by the fol
 lowing extensions of Laplace's satellite-harmonics, from Jupiter to
Earth:-
   1. Earth's accelerated rotation : the acceleration by condensation
to  a centre of linear oscillation :: Jupiter's radius of accelerated
rotation : Callisto's (Sat. IV) radius of accelerated rotation.

   Searle gives 16-689 for Callisto's period; Newcomb and Holden
give 167535524.

according to Stockwell): Callisto's mean distance from Jupiter : :
Jupiter's mass : Earth's mass.

  If we take g=32,088 feet, Earth's isochronous radius (satellite

The equation, m*x isochronous radius =p, gives

ON    THE CHOICE OF THE UNIT OF FORCE IN ABSOLUTE ELECTRIC
                 MEASUREMENTS.        BY M. LIPPMANN.
     It
      is known that the electric measurements called absolute rest
upon the choice of the three units employed to measure the times,
lengths, and forces; and it will be remembered that in 1863 a
Committee of the British Association proposed to take for the unit
of force the dyne—that is to say, the force capable of impressing on
the mass of 1 gram, at the end of 1 second, a velocity of 1 centim.
per second.     Is the dyne in every respect the most advantageous
that could have been chosen? Without wishing to discuss here
that complex question completely,

 these are the only absolute units represented by standards. There
 fore the unit of force might be varied at pleasure; and the ohms
 and microfarads at present distributed to the laboratories would no
 less preserve their value.

to  those   of

suppose the acceleration       taken        to

the electromagnetic system thought it necessary to measure the
forces in dynes.         The reason is simple: it is because, for the
purpose of determining the couple of the forces exerted by the
earth's magnetism upon a magnetized needle, those physicists have
employed the method of oscillations.             When this method is em
ployed, what is found by experiment is an acceleration; it is then
natural to take the accelerations for the measurement of the forces
which produce them.           The dyne has the advantage of greater sim
plicity in the case of the oscillation-method, and in that case only.
Now it is very necessary to remark that the oscillation method
is only an indirect means; for to measure a static couple it would
have been more direct to employ the bifilar suspension of Gauss,
or, more generally, a static method. But then no acceleration
occurs: one has only to weigh the magnetized needle; the amount
of the force is deduced from this weight, and is obtained directly in
grams. It is circuitous and a complication to express it in dynes.
    The dyne system moreover complicates considerably the trans
formation-formulae; in what concerns the measurement of lengths
it causes the advantages of the decimal system to vanish. Elec
tricians have employed as the unit of length, some the metre, others
the centimetre or the millimetre. Let us suppose one wishes to
pass from one of these units to the other.            In the dyne system, or,
 .
more     generally,   in the     systems   in which the force is defined by
means of an      acceleration,    the units of intensity and electromotive
force    depend    on the    square   root and the # power of the unit of
length; so that one is obliged to divide by a factor which must be
calculated, and which is either the square root or the ; power of a
          of 10. If, on the contrary, a weight or any other force                             in
   ependent of the unit of length be taken, the unit of intensity is

230       Mr.    J. J. Thomson      on the   Electric and Magnetic
   § 2. The first case we shall consider is that of a charged
sphere moving through an unlimited space filled with a medium
of specific inductive capacity K.
   The charged sphere will produce an electric displacement
throughout the field; and as the sphere moves the magnitude
of this displacement at any point will vary. Now, according
to Maxwell's theory, a variation in the electric displacement
produces the same effect as an electric current; and a field in
which electric currents exist is a seat of energy; hence the
motion of the charged sphere has developed energy, and con
sequently the charged sphere must experience a resistance as
it moves through the dielectric. But as the theory of the
variation of the electric displacement does not take into account
any thing corresponding to resistance in conductors, there can
be no dissipation of energy through the medium; hence the
resistance cannot be analogous to an ordinary frictional resist
ance, but must correspond to the resistance theoretically ex
perienced by a solid in moving through a perfect fluid.        In
other words, it must be equivalent to an increase in the mass
of the charged moving sphere, which we now proceed to cal
culate.
     Let a be the radius of the moving sphere,     the charge on
                                                             e
the sphere, and         let   us

   Comparing these expressions with those given by Ampère
for the magnetic force produced by a current, we see that the
magnetic force due to the moving sphere is the same as that
                                            .
produced per unit length of a current whose intensity is
pe Vp” +7°--r”, situated at the centre of the sphere, the direc
tion of the positive current coinciding with the direction of
motion of the sphere.     The resultant magnetic force produced
by the sphere at any point is opesin e<U+017F>pº, o being the velo
city of the sphere, and e the angle between the direction of
motion of the sphere and the            vector p drawn from the
centre of the sphere  to the point;  the direction of the force is
perpendicular both to the direction of motion of the sphere
and the radius vector from the centre of the sphere to the
point; and the direction of the force and the direction of motion
are related to each other like translation and rotation in a
right-handed screw.
   It may be useful to form a rough numerical idea of the
magnitude of the greatest magnetic force which could be pro
duced by a ºxing charged sphere.    The greatest value of the
force = u KVao/p”, where a is the radius and V the potential
of the sphere. Now if F be the greatest electric force which
:
can exist without discharge, the greatest value of V is Fa.
According to Mr. Macfarlane's experiments F          roughly        is,

The result we have just obtained (viz. that a moving body
charged with electricity produces the effect of an electric cur
rent) shows that Prof. Rowland's experiments on electric con
vection are in agreement with Maxwell's theory.
     § 4. The fact that a moving body charged with electricity
produces a vector-potential in the field through which it is
moving, suggests a possible theory of the cause of the green
phosphorescence observed in vacuum-tubes at the places where
the molecular streams strike the glass, different from that put
forward by Mr. Crookes. It will be seen from the above work
that the moving particle produces a vector-potential whose
value depends on the velocity of the moving body. Now,
when a particle strikes the glass directly,              velocity    itsreversed      is
and the     vector-potential     changes    sign;    thus during the short
time occupied               by
                          the collision the vector-potential must                                    be
changing very rapidly.            But any change           the vector-poten

tial produces         corresponding electromotive force, and thus
                      a

law, could not produce aluminous phosphorescence.
   It may be useful to form a rough estimate of the electro
motive force which could be produced by a moving particle.
   By equation (1) we see, if the particle be moving parallel
to the axis of a with velocity p, that the greatest value of F
at a point distant R from the centre of the particle is

which these electromotive forces diminish with the distance,
we will take the case of a particle stopped by a screen at a
distance of Tºo of a millimetre from the glass, and compare
the electromotive force at the glass with the electromotive
force which would be produced at the glass if there were no
screen. By substituting in the formula giving the electromotive
force, we find that the electromotive force at the glass when
 the screen is present is only about Tokoo of what it is when
 the screen is away; and as the intensity of the phosphorescence
 will vary as the square of the electromotive force, we see that
 when the screen is present the phosphorescence is quite im
 perceptible. This explains an experiment of Goldstein's, in
 which he coated the glass with a layer of collodion whose
 thickness he estimated at a few hundredths of a millimetre,
 and found the glass behind quite black.

   It will be useful to endeavour to calculate the magnitude
of this force on a particle of air moving in a vacuum-tube;
although our knowledge of the magnitude of several of the
quantities involved is so vague that our result must only be
looked upon as showing that the force is of an order great
enough to produce appreciable effects, and must not be looked
upon as having any quantitative value.
   Let us suppose that the mass of a molecule of air is 107*
(C.G.S. system); that a, the radius of the molecule,      10-7;                    –
that, as before, e=K x 3 × 10*a*= Kx 3 × 10-" (this quantity
is probably enormously underrated); and as we know nothing
about the velocity of the charged particles, let us assume it to
be the mean velocity of the air-molecules, viz. 4 × 10-". We
shall suppose the vacuum-tube placed in a magnetic field
 whose strength is 10°. Then, by the formula, the accelera
tion of the particle of air when the magnetic force is at right

 into an attraction by means of their motion, their velocities
 must exceed V3c; hence we should expect the molecular
 streams in a vacuum-tube to repel each other, as we could not
 suppose that the velocity of the particles forming these streams
 is as great as that of light; and Mr. Crookes has, in fact (see
 Phil. Trans. 1879, part ii.), experimentally determined that
 they do repel each other.
     t is remarkable that the law of force between two movin
 charged particles, which we have deduced from Maxwell’s
 theory, agrees with that assumed by Clausius, in his recent
 researches on Electrodynamics (see Phil. Mag. Oct. 1880);
 but it differs from Weber's well-known law materially.                   Ac
 cording to Weber's law, the force does not depend on the
actual velocities of the particles, but only on their velocity
 relative to each other, whereas, according to the laws we have
 investigated, the forces depend on the actual velocities of the
 particles as well as on their relative velocities: thus there is
a force between two charged particles, moving with equal
velocities in the same direction, in which case, of course, the
relative velocity is nothing.    It must be remarked that what
we have for convenience called the actual velocity of the par
ticle    is,  fact, the velocity
               in                    the particle relative

 rid of.        I
             have adverted above to two modes in which a dis
turbance at A may be rectilinearly transmitted from A, so as
to have effect at any point P. In the first it was stated that,
                                                       id:
as matter of experience, the effect takes place independently
of any particular conditions under              the fluid was dis
turbed at A ; in the other the fluid is assumed to be disturbed
 in a particular manner, and under certain conditions. The
former of these modes may be called, for distinction, free or
spontaneous motion, and the other constrained or arbitrary
 motion. Now, in the received analytical theory of hydro
dynamics, the determination of the rate of propagation is made
to depend on the conditions of the arbitrary mode of dis
turbance, whereas, as matter of fact, the propagation and rate
of propagation are both independent of <U+017F>º particular form of
disturbance. This contradiction of the theory by experimental
 facts sufficiently accounts for the reductio ad absurdum,
 which, consequently, signifies that the theoretical reasoning
is at fault and requires to be rectified. To show how this is
to be done is the purpose of the following investigation.
    The problem to be solved is to account for the fact of a
rectilinear transmission of effect from a disturbance made at
a certain point A to any point P in the surrounding fluid,
without reference to any assigned mode of disturbing the
fluid.    Since there are no arbitrary initial conditions of the
motion, it follows that the kind of motion must be indicated
by some general analytical circumstance.           It will here be
supposed that the required analytical circumstance is that the
differential function uda + ray-H war is an exact differential
in   all
will be
        cases. On this supposition

           and Spontaneous   Diffusion of Sound and Light.    253
motion at P applies to every portion of the fluid surrounding
A. Here, then, is the explanation of that diffusion of the effect
of any disturbance which it was proposed to account for.
    The rate of transmission of the effect of the disturbance has
to be calculated from the laws of the elementary motions, with
out respect to any arbitrary mode of disturbance. This           I
have done by the solution of Proposition XIV. in pages 214–
224 of my treatise on the Principles of Mathematics and
Physics, obtaining thereby the result that the theoretical
value exceeds the observed value by 17.5 feet. The excess
may with probability be ascribed to the circumstance that
the air is not, as supposed in the theory, a simple fluid of
perfect elasticity, but composite and loaded with vapour.
    It would appear from the foregoing argument that the
method of determining velocity of propagation in an elastic
fluid from assumed conditions of the motion of the fluid, which
was first adopted by Newton, and afterwards virtually fol
lowed by Lagrange and Poisson, is defective in principle,
and that the exact method must be derived from the general
 equations of fluid-motion.      Also it seems that the rapid
 alternate  generations   of heat and cold in a series of aerial
 vibrations does not, as has been generally supposed, sensibly
 affect the rate of propagation.
    The results above obtained relative to the diffusion of sound
 by aerial vibrations equally pertain to the diffusion of light
 by aetherial vibrations, on the hypothesis, which   I  adopt, that
                                        º,
 the aether is a  perfect fluid defined by  the  equation  p-a"p,
 a” being absolutely constant.
    The motion of the air defined by the series for the function
 $, obtained in the manner              stated, is required for as
 certaining the character of spontaneous, aerial vibrations
 pertaining to the phenomena of sound, and for obtaining the
 laws of the harmonic series which is applied in the theory of
7must C.
   The motion of the aether defined by the spontaneous series
for f, obtained as before stated, together with that for b, is
necessary for ascertaining the character of a ray of light, the
laws of transverse vibrations and of polarization, and the mode
of derivation of a polarized ray from a ray of common light.
   Ithink it right to mention here that the assertion that the inte
  rability of ude +rdy + wilzindicates rectilinear motion, which
                      lºs.
   made at an early stage of my hydrodynamical researches,
is adverted to by               Stokes in his Report on hydro
                               recently  published ‘Mathematical
dynamics contained in his
and Physical Papers, vol.         i., with good reason objected
                                                                 ofto

                             at                at the conception

 254       Prof. H. A. Rowland        on Magnetic       Attractions,
the important distinction, indicated in the present communi
cation, between spontaneous motion and motion produced
under arbitrary conditions. The above assertion applies only
to spontaneous motion. The recognition of this distinction
suffices to meet completely Professor Stokes's objections.
   At the end of a communication to the Philosophical Maga
zine for June 1880,         I
                        stated that I did not expect to have
occasion to discuss   any  additional questions in Theoretical
Physics.    The  importance  and novelty of the present com
munication respecting spontaneous fluid-motion, the views
respecting which have only very recently occurred to me,
       I
may, think, be considered sufficient to justify my recurring
once more to the subject of the Analytical Principles of Hydro
dynamics.

XXXV.     On the new Theory of Magnetic Attractions, and the
 Magnetic Rotation of Polarized Light. By H. A. RowLAND".
IN     a note published in the “American Journal of Mathe
      matics,’ and also in the Philosophical Magazine for
             I
June 1880, showed that the new action of magnetism on an
electric current, recently discovered by Mr. Hall in my labora
tory, was essentially of a rotational character, and    showed   I
also that it was probably of the same nature as the rotation of
the plane of polarization of light.            I
                                        have since p blished a
paper in the “American Journal of Mathematics'—“On the
 General Equations of Electro-magnetic Action, with Appli
 cations to a new Theory of Magnetic Attractions, and to the
 Theory of the Magnetic Rotation of the Plane of Polarization
 of Light"—in which the subject is treated in full, and Max
well's formula for the magnetic rotation of the plane of polariza

tion deduced from the newly discovered action of magnetism.
   Mr. Hopkinson has recently drawn attention f to the fact
that Maxwell has inserted a certain “Rotatory Coefficient’”
in his equations of resistance (‘Electricity,’ art. 303). Max
well further states that the coefficient            be found, if
anywhere, in magnets, or, of course, in any magnetic field, as
it has now been found. But I believe Maxwell nowhere con
nects this quantity with the rotation of the plane of polariza
tion of light; and hence I think it may be well to give here an
abstract of this
                 portion of my paper.
   In the ‘Note” before referred         to,
                                         thought that      would it

          and the Magnetic Rotation of Polarized Light.                                             255
were rotated around the lines of force in the same way as the
electric currents are rotated in metals; but      now find that                I
this is not necessary, but that we only have to apply the
rotation to the displacement currents of Maxwell, and we get
a complete explanation of the magnetic rotation of the plane
of polarization of light.
   As Sir W. Thomson has shown that the latter effect must
be due to some rotation in the magnetic field, so by connect
ing the new discovered action with the old, we prove that it
also is due to rotation in the field.  For Maxwell's equations
merely express the facts of the case, and give no explanation.

                                         to          light, we must            of
assume that the same action which takes       place       conductors                in
with reference      conducted currents, also takes place
                            to                                      di                             in

get the value where the index varies, we can use the principle
of the superposition of small quantities. Every plane-polarized
ray can be supposed to be made up of two circularly polarized
rays; and to say that the plane of polarization is rotated
simply means that one of the circularly polarized rays travels
faster than the other; when one ray gains A on the other, the
plane of polarization is rotated through the angle 27t.  Hence
if V is the velocity of one and W" of the other, we have
                              v=v ( 1 +                         *       j
where D is the distance in which the plane of polarization is
rotated through the angle 27t.
   But this effect will be augmented by the dispersion of the
body, seeing that the velocity affects the wave-length, and
hence the index of refraction will be different for the two com
ponents. This further action can be taken into account by
multiplying    \, by   .;     and we then have

   To examine the direction of the action, we must see what the
relative direction of the currents and magnetism are in the
equations, as  I  have not taken the signs with respect to any
system.
   Let the positive direction of the current be the direction in
which the positive electricity moves, and the positive direc
tion of the magnetic lines of force be the direction in which
the north pole tends to move; then we easily find that our
equations are on the right-handed screw system, the right
handed screw being such that, if we turn it in the direction of
the hands of a watch with its face towards us, it will move
away from us. According to this system, Mr. Hall has found
that the value of c is positive for gold and some other dia
magnetic substances, and negative for iron. Hence a mag
netic force in the positive direction will cause the ray to be
rotated in the positive direction in diamagnetic substances,
and in the negative direction in magnetic ones, which is
exactly what has been observed.
    To compare the numerical amount of the revolution with
observation, we can take the constants as observed by Mr.
Hall for gold, and thus find at least whether it is of the proper
order of magnitude.
    From more recent observations than those published, Mr.
 Hall finds that in the field of his magnet he can cause the
lateral electromotive force to be at least as great as gºod of
 the force along the strip. According to the system of units
used in this paper, the new electromotive force will be (in the
case of conduction, the current passing along Y and the mag
netism being in the direction .."2)

The length of the substance in which the ray is rotated a com
plete revolution, or 360°, will then be
where it is to be noted that Xois the length of a complete wave.
Taking the wave of Tokoo centim. length and the index of re
fraction 4, we find, supposing            *    =0,
                      D=240 centims, nearly.
  We do not know the magnetic force used by Werdet; but it
was evidently of the same order of magnitude. He found D
to be about as follows—300 for heavy glass, 700 for flint glass.
Hence the rotation calculated for gold is of the same order of
magnitude as the rotation observed in some common sub
stances.
   Thus the new electromagnetic phenomenon explains in the
most perfect manner the magnetic rotation of the plane of
polarization of light; and we are almost in the position to
pronounce positively that the two phenomena are the same.
Should this preliminary theory of the subject stand the test of
time, it hardly seems to me that we can regard it in any other

light than a demonstration of the truth of Maxwell's theory of
light; for the rotation of the plane of polarization is thus a
necessary consequence of the            of electromagnetism, and
this, added to the other facts of the case, raises Maxwell's theory
almost to the realm of fact.

electrolysed the weight of substance decomposed is sensibly
proportionate to the quantity of electricity passing. Still, not

Similarly Buff found that currents capable         depositing                                    of

       Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive   Force.     263
 from .009 to 113 gramme of silver per 100 hours (.000022
 to 00027 weber) evolved quantities of hydrogen usually only
 differing by less than .05 cubic centim. from the quantities
 calculated from the current passing when air-free solutions
 of Glauber's salt, dilute sulphuric acid, or distilled water
 were electrolysed for from 4% to 26 hours, so that from 0-11
 to 1-09 cubic centim. were collected, the hydrogen pole being
 a Wollaston      point; whilst a just visible evolution of
 hydrogen was noticeable from a Wollaston point with a yet
 smaller current, capable of depositing 001 gramme of silver
per 100 hours, and hence equal to 0000024 weber.              Whilst
these experiments indicate that conduction without electrolysis
did not take place to any appreciable extent during the elec
 trolysis of the silver salt used, they are yet scarcely precise
enough to establish with certainty the same point in the case
of water, although they clearly point in that direction.
Accordingly the following experiments were made with a
view to supplementing Buff’s work in this respect.
    78. Voltameters were constructed like the one represented
in Pl. III.  fig. 1. A U-tube, AB, was drawn out and cut off
in the middle of one of the limbs, and the drawn-out part passed
through an indiarubber cork, C, smeared internally with
melted rubber to make an air-tight joint.          Over this cork
 (similarly smeared outside) was fixed a calibrated capillary
tube widened into a sort of thistle-funnel or bell-mouth D,
at the part into which the cork fitted ; this tube was bent to
a double right angle, so that the part used for measurement,
EF, pointed downwards, the lower end passing through an
indiarubber cork, H, into a second U-tube, G, the other end
of which was closed by another rubber cork through which a
stout glass rod, I, passed. The upper U-tube was provided
with electrodes, K and L, of platinum-foil of measured size
fixed to platinum wires fused through the glass (or sometimes,
in the case of the longer limb, supported, as represented in
the figure, by a loosely fitting cork in the open mouth of the
tube), by means of a platinum wire sealed through a drawn
out glass tube, M, which, being filled with mercury, served as
a mercury-cup.       In order to fill the instrument, the corks
supporting       I,and also H, were loosened, and recently
boiled, still hot, dilute sulphuric acid poured into the
longer limb of the U-tube,     W.      This acid rapidly filled this
U-tube, and then passed over through the capillary tube,
DEF, into the lower U-tube, G, also filling        it.   A   certain
                                        through  the whole instru
         as of

three cases the values of the      limiting  currents are  evidently
 in the order of the facility with which diffusion would go on—
the column of fluid between the electrodes being respectively
 13, 6, and 17 centims. long, the first being widest and the
last narrowest, whilst the current values are respectively 4.0,
5-0, and 1.5 microweber. The relatively larger value for the
limiting current of voltameter No. 2 is explained by the fact
that it contained a more dilute and consequently less viscid
acid, 100 cubic centims. containing only 1-0 gramme of H, SO,.
    The amount of current due to imper<U+017F>ect insulation of the

ment was determined as follows:—The voltameter having been
arranged and the current turned on at a noted time, the differ
ence of potential set up by the current passing between the ends
of a known resistance (corrected when necessary for tempera
ture) was determined by means of the quadrant-electrometer;
and hence the current passing was known. During the first two
or three hours the current usually diminished somewhat, owing
to the increasing counter E.M.F. set up in the voltameter;
but subsequently it remained sensibly steady, under suitable
conditions as to battery-power, temperature, &c.     By means
of numerous observations the   average currents passing in each
of various successive periods of time were known; and hence
the average current for the whole time was known.         Thus,
for example,  the  average currents in one experiment   were as
follows:—
                        Period.                                     Average current during period.

to the current passing in the present experiments are also
erroneous in the same ratio. In the majority of the experi

of hydrogen, according as the B.A. unit is assumed correct,
or as being +0.5 or even + 1 per cent. in error, is less than
the error of measurement of the gas collected, together with
the error due to the rate of “diffusion discharge" not being
absolutely constantly equal to the values given above, owing
to unavoidable fluctuations of temperature. .

according closely together; thus, for example, the observed
    uantities of hydrogen collected in the experiment cited in
§ 81 were as follows (voltameter No. 1 used):—

 difference between the two quantities being only 0.0002 milli

effect of which is to eliminate the effects of “polarization ”
 as completely as in Kohlrausch's method of determining con
ductivity by means of alternating currents, the products of elec
trolysis being reunited, so to speak, by the action of the reverse
 current before they have time to escape. Since the nett chemical
 action is nil, the work done by the currents appears solely as
 heat ; but it does not therefore follow that electricity passes
 through the liquid without causing electrolysis, any more
 than in Kohlrausch's experiments.

272        Dr. C. R. A. Wright on the Determination of
“polarization ” of the voltameter increases until it differs
from the    E.M.F. ofthe electromotor by only a very minute
quantity.   With boiled acid, and especially in voltameters
so constructed that neither the oxygen evolved at the +
electrode nor the external air can reach the       electrode –
(saving by unavoidable diffusion), the rate of the diminution
of the current is much greater than is the case when these
conditions are not fulfilled.     On trying experiments of this
class, however, it was found that even with the most carefully
constructed voltameters the current never became too small
to measure, even after many weeks; it gradually subsided to
a limiting value, below which it never sank (i.e. as long as
the E.M.F. of the electromotor and the resistance of the
circuit remained the same). No trace of gas, however, was
evolved at either electrode ; which was evidently due to the fact
that, owing to “diffusion discharge,” the hydrogen and oxygen
evolved by the current became reconverted into water just as
rapidly as they were generated by the current; so that the
particular final steady current attained with any given ap
paratus measured the rate of diffusion discharge with that
apparatus under the particular conditions of the experiment.
   84. On comparing such results with different electromotors,
it was at once perceived that when the resistance in circuit re
mained the same, the greater the E.M.F. of the electromotor the
greater was the value of the final steady current that passed,
although as long as the E.M.F. of the electromotor did notexceed
a certain limiting value (different for each form of apparatus)
no visible evolution of gas took place in any case ; pari passu
with the increase in the strength of the current, the counter
E.M.F. set up was found to increase; that              is,

with currents less than this amount none was obtained.            Since
the values of the counter electromotive forces set up by
these currents were considerable, especially when the current
was near the limiting value of four microwebers, it results
that the hydrogen which combined with the oxygen diffusing
to the        –
              electrode, and the oxygen combining with the
hydrogen that diffused to the + electrode, was the gas oc
cluded within or condensed upon each electrode respectively,
and not that produced by the electrolysis reoxidized pari passu
with its formation ; for in the latter case the nett work done
as electrolysis during the passage of this current would be
nil, and hence e would = 0. The action of the “diffusion
discharge” is therefore precisely like that of dissolved air
present in the fluid electrolysed in the first instance ($ 76),
comparable with the “local action " of an ordinary cell.              In
any given experiment the value of e will rise (the current re
maining constant) until the rate of diminution of aura at each
electrode due to this cause just balances the rate of increase
through electrolysis. As this latter rises when the current is
 increased, so will the mean aura-density rise, and the amount
 of aura dissolved away from the electrode by the surrounding
fluid in a given time, and consequently the rate of diffusion
 discharge, until the aura is at                       its

ever, the value of e was found to be very sensitive to causes
which would act on the equilibrium of the aurae surrounding the
electrodes, especially to changes of temperature which would
increase the normal effect of diffusion discharge by setting up
heat-convection currents; so that the constant E.M.F. due to
the original current was often not absolutely (but only ap
   roximately) arrived at until after the lapse of some hours.
}.    this reason too, the counter E.M.F. observed was often less
by 1 or even 2 or more per cent. in such cases when determined
in the afternoon (in the warmest part of the day) than when
determined the first thing in the morning—partly because the
actual rise of temperature diminished                 its
                                                  value, but more
   articularly because of  the increased effect             of

  whence acid of 27:0 grammes per 100 cub, centims. would
  have a specific resistance of 1:47 x 10° at 18°.
     The value obtained by Paalzow for acid represented by
  H,SO, 14 aq. (Pogg. Ann. cxxxvi. p. 489, 1869), was 14157
  times the resistance of mercury at 19°. This acid contains
  28.0 per cent. of H2SO, representing 33.7 grammes per 100
  cub. centims., possessing the specific resistance 1:34 × 10°, or
  about 8 per cent. higher than that found by Kohlrausch and
  Nippoldt.
      §. the whole the specific resistance of acid of the strength
  used, viz. 27 grammes per 100 cub. centims, may be taken
  as 1.4 ohm at 18°, whence the values of R for the four vol

would therefore make it n° times as sensitive were its resist

    Combining this result with the former, we obtain the result
that the change of electric resistance exhibited by the cell of
linear dimensions n, under the influence of a given quantity
of light distributed uniformly over                    surface, will             its                      be   nº

themselves being reckoned small).

 that will reflect the effective rays will be less than that of the
 90° cone, and hence cannot gather as much light.
     One advantage possessed by such a mirror cone of the
 form specified above over any other form, parabolic or other
 wise, is that           all
                       the rays meet the sensitive surface              the  of
 cylinder   at normal incidence, and the loss                     by

 be therefore      minimum.

   (8) The theorems enunciated above concerning the advan
tages of enlarging the size of the selenium-cell can readily
be put to experimental test with cells such as described.
There is of course a practical limit beyond which further
increase of size will be of no advantage—such a limit being
determined in particular cases by the resistance of the tele
phones and of the telephone-circuit, and by the other condi
tions, electrical and optical, of the experiment.

of A D, Q that of D C (P and Q include the resistances added
to the ends of the bridge-wire), A F the resistance R to be
measured, F C the standard S with which R is to be com
pared.  At K in the battery circuit is a key.
            l.
   In one position of the key the battery-current has to pass
through      resistance p ; in the other the ends of the coil p
are connected, and it is thrown out of the circuit.
   The experiment is as follows:–Place the key so that the
resistance p is shunted, and adjust the position of D until
there is no current through the galvanometer.         Raise the
key, and so throw p into the battery circuit; then the galvano
meter-needle is considerably deflected, if the other resistances
be small compared with p.
   The experiment may of course be conducted in the reverse
way, the position of equilibrium being found when p is in
circuit.   On depressing the key and shunting p the needle
is deflected.
   The deflection in this case is much greater than in the
former; but then the battery-current is increased many times
by the operation, and the apparatus therefore is rendered more
sensitive; so that part of the effect may be due to a slight
error in the original position of D.
   The effect was reversed by changing the direction of the bat
tery-current. This last fact showed that it could not spring from
any heating of the coils.    Moreover any heating-effect would
:
be due to the             in the temperature-coefficients
                    difference                             of
R and S or P and Q respectively; but R and S were    through
      as nearly as possible       equal and similar, as also were         P
and Q.

   But it is well known that a thermoelectric effect is produced
by the contact at D. This, as will shortly be shown, will ex
      the phenomenon; and the effect may be made a means of
measuring, approximately at least, the electromotive force set
up at the junction. For          let

   With the view of testing the truth of this explanation,       I
made a series of experiments, using a wire bridge and various
small resistances.
   The resistance of the bridge-wire in the experiments was
'08 ohm ; the wire was a metre long, and graduated to milli
metres.
    Different observations for the value of P agree to a fraction
of a millimetre of the bridge-wire, while the differences in
the values of P’ never amounted to more than 4 millimetres,
and were usually much less. The value of p was 150 ohms.
In some of the experiments Leclanché cells were used, in
others Daniells.      The E.M.F. of the Leclanché cells was
found    by the potentiometer  method to be about 1:25 Daniell.
   In the results given in the table, the E.M.F. of a Daniell
cell is taken as 1 volt. The battery resistance is neglected
compared with the 150 ohms interposed.

          Thus the mean value of e as given by the experiments with
       the Leclanché cells is 77.6 × 10–7 volt, while that as given
       by the Daniells is 61.5 x 10–7 volt.     The wire of the bridge
       and the contact piece are    platinum-iridium,   the other wires
       are copper.
          The closeness in the values of e would appear to show that
       the assumption of some action at this junction will account for
       most of the phenomena; while the constancy of the effect
       shows that, if due to a difference of temperature between the
        ºwie
       Inul CIl.
                    and the contact piece, that difference cannot vary
          The hand of the experimenter was separated from the metal
       of  the contact piece by a cap of wood. The effect of main
       taining contact for some time after finding the equilibrium
       position was tried without result.                          If
                                                  the junctions A and C
       of the   platinum-wire  and the    battery   circuit be heated, the
       effect is decreased ; if they be cooled, it is increased.      Thus
       the effect, if thermoelectric, is due to heating at D.
          In making measurements of resistance, this effect can
       of course be eliminated in various ways; it appears,
       however, to be worth while to call attention to its existence.
       One method frequently adopted to correct for this thermo
       electric effect is given by Prof. Chrystal and Mr. Saunders
       (Report on the Standard Units of Resistance, B.A. Report
       1876, p. 13). , They made contact with the sliding piece
       before making the battery-contact, and waited until the thermo
       electric current had attained a steady value and the galvano
       meter-needle come to rest in a position slightly disturbed from

the coils used have any appreciable self-induction.
   Another method is to reverse the battery-current.
   Let P, Q, be the values of PQ when the current is in one
direction,    P, Q, when it is in     the other.     Then the true value

   A third method, applicable to coils with no self-induction, is to
interchange the battery and the galvanometer.                  The thermo
electromotive force is then        superposed    on that of the battery,
and the condition PS=QR holds.               The most serious objection
to this seems to be that the whole current must pass through
the sliding junction, which may thus get considerably heated,
the others.

   If the weight and specific gravity of the ball be taken when
cold, we have, with the ordinate on the diagram at the moment
of immersion, sufficient data for determining the density of
the fluid metal ; for
the volumes being equal.                        And, remembering that
             W (weight of liquid)= W’ (weight of ball) + æ
(where w is always measured as a +ve or —ve floating effect),
we have

   The following table shows the results of six experiments
to determine the density of fluid bismuth made by the authors
in the laboratory of the Royal Mint. The bismuth was kept

definitely settled.

      GENTLEMEN,
IN     the last number of the Philosophical Magazine Dr.                                                    J.
      W. Draper describes his                         of the solar
spectrum, and incidentally             my map of the infra-red
region of the solar spectrum under review. From the date of
his communication (Dec. 1, 1880), am under the impression        I
that his observations were based on a photograph of the map
which          I
            had the pleasure of sending him, and not after a
perusal of the paper in the Phil. Trans. for 1880, a copy of
which          I
           also sent him more recently.       Since Dr. Draper's
remarks may cause a false impression in some respects,       wish                                   I
 to make a comment on one or two points which he has raised.
    Dr. Draper says that the investigations which have carried                       I
on “are not to be regarded as an extension of exploration in
the infra-red region (for they really do not carry us beyond
my own observations in 1843), but as securing the resolution
of these lines" or bands into three constituent elements.” In
the paper already referred           will               to,
                                             seen that the know

    The second point to which         wish to call attention is in
regard to the cause of the reversal of photographic image.
In a recent number of the                      Magazine      I
                                                            gave a
detailed account of some     experiments  made in connexion with
the subject, showing that oxidation was the cause of most
reversals, though in some instances it might be produced by a
           ºil.
secondary action. The instance which Dr. Draper quotes
 (where            destroyed a daguerrean image by red light,
 and was enabled to use the plate again) as showing that
 oxidation was not the cause of reversal, is in reality corrobo
 rative of my observations.     In the “Photographic Journal’ for
 1879  I have shown that where an image is destroyed by oxi
 dation, whether by an oxidizing agent or by the action of
 light of low refrangibility, the plate is ready for a fresh ex
 posure to the image formed in the camera; and           Ibelieve it
 is a common practice since that time for photographers to de
 stroy fog (or the effect of light on a plate) by using an oxidi
 zing solution.      I
                     may remark that the amount of oxidized
 matter is as small as that forming (what is called) the latent
 image itself, and is totally undistinguishable by any chemical

 analysis; and therefore it is not surprising that Claudet failed
 to find any alteration chemically in the sensitive film.        am
                     I
 not quite sure if understand Dr. Draper to mean that W.L.
 10,750 is           the theoretical limit of the spectrum.            If
 he  does,  I think he will see that it is in reality when the
W.L.    is infinitely large—that   is,when       =0, according         to
Cauchy.
                                            º
   The plan     ofusing phosphorescent material for viewing the
infra-red rays  I   have frequently tried with success, and can
quite confirm Dr. Draper's remarks. Mr. Warnerke was first
    the field with these observations; and
                                                                       of to

was immersed in turpentine at 8° C.         There was a great
and sudden fall in the resistance.   The temperature was then
gradually raised. In passing from 8° to 24° the resistance
steadily increased; from 24° upwards it rapidly diminished.
For this cell, therefore, the resistance is greatest at 24°C.
Five other cells were afterwards submitted to the same opera
tion; and their resistance was found to be greatest at tempe
ratures of 23°, 14°, 30°, 25°, and 22° respectively.
   It should be noticed with regard to the cell whose tempe
rature of maximum resistance is 14° (8°lower than any other),
that it was prepared by very slowly cooling melted selenium
from a temperature of about 250° §. Its surface is coarsely
granular;       its
               resistance  comparatively low; and
                                  is                   not very                    it    is

      E   used at Cambridge, “in the consulship of Plancus,” to
         divide “articulate speaking’ men into two classes—those
 who understood the Differential Calculus, and those who did not.
 Such a division still holds good; and possibly the relative magnitudes
 of the two divisions are still the same, though Todhunter has, since
 the epoch to which we refer, brought out his valuable books on
 the two calculi.      An English student has still no great choice if he
 confines his     reading  to works in his own language. De Morgan's
 treatise remains still a vast repertory which repays occasional ex
 ploration; but who could take it as an ordinary text-book? Tod
 hunter's works referred to above present the subject in a very
 clear light to students, and are enriched by a choice collection of
 exercises.     Putting the four American text-books we have at hand
 (which are mainly founded on the English text-books and Bertrand's
 classical work) on one side, the only serious rival to Todhunter is
 the work before us. That its merits are of a very high order, and
                                                                                                         in as its

 remainder in Lagrange's series in the form of a definite integral.
 This result, which seems to be due to M. Popoff, is given here in
 the way in which it is demonstrated by M. Zolotareff. The next
point to which we would call attention is in connexion with the
 interesting subject of the areas of roulettes, to the study of which
 Steiner has contributed so many beautiful results. The additions
are to what is now well known as Holditch's theorem, first pub
 lished in the ‘Lady's and Gentlemen's Diary’ for 1858, in the
appendix to which volume an elegant extension of the theorem
was given by the Editor, Mr. Woolhouse.              For the substance of
the recent extension our author is again indebted to Mr. E. B.
Elliott, whose paper appeared in the ‘Messenger of Mathematics’
for February 1878.          This paper was fruitful in results, as it
suggested further extensions by Mr. Leudesdorf and Mr. Kempe.
In our text we have Kempe's “singularly elegant” theorem;
but it strikes us that full justice has hardly been done to Mr.
 Rempe, or a part only of his results is given; this oversight
can easily be remedied, should the author see fit, in his next issue".
The whole subject is just now occupying attention : we have
noted a paper by M. Darboux in the Bulletin des Sciences Mathéma
tiques et Astronomiques,      and some short notes by Prof. Minchin.
This latter   gentlemen,   we believe, is preparing an extended paper on
the   subject of roulettes;  and Mr. Elliott is prosecuting his researches
in the direction of kinematics on a sphere.         But we have exceeded
our limits, and must refrain from referring to the additions in the
last two chapters. Mr. Williamson still excludes the “change of
the variables in a multiple integral;” perhaps in a future edition he
may say something upon this matter, and bring forward to notice
the method employed by Mr. McColl (cf. his paper on the “Calculus
of Equivalent Statements and Integration Limits,” in the Proceedings
of the London Mathematical Society, No. 124, and questions in the
‘Educational Times’). The admirable manner in which the more
ordinary parts of the subject, and notably the chapters on the geo
metrical applications, are handled thoroughly merits the approbation
it has received; and we take our leave of Mr. Williamson, wishing
his work bon voyage and himself “more power” still to write his
promised       (if
                we mistake not) treatise           on
                                                Differential Equations.

Dr. Oberbeck calls attention to the fact that in my paper the same
problem is proposed for solution that he investigated in vol. lxxxi.
of Crelle's Journal.                     I
                            obtained the number of Crelle referred to,
and was struck by the similarity of the process in the latter part
of my paper, which relates to the motion of a sphere in the fluid, and
the method and results in Dr. Oberbeck's paper.          For the method
adopted, however, a reference to page 349 of my article will show
that       I
          did not claim absolute originality;         merely amplified a         I
solution given by Mr.                    J.

ings’ of the London Mathematical Society. The fact of having
of necessity employed the methods of spherical harmonics, and also
of having employed Borchardt's theorem, produces the only resem
blance that exists in the two papers. As to Borchardt's theorem,                                                 I
can merely say that

DETERMINATION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL COLOUR-SENSATIONS BY
   THE STUDY OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPLEMENTARY
   COLOURS IN THE CHROMATIC CIRCLE.            (SECOND NOTE.)     BY
   M. A. ROSENSTIEHL.
      1.   in In
           studying the distribution     the red, yellow, green, and
                                                                  of
blue     the chromatic circle,    have found that there are
                                                   I             that                                     in
circle three colours which,     relation     our   in

properties;     they possess the characters of the fundamental sensa
tions of Young.           I   am about to demonstrate that they are also the
only ones to which these qualities belong.
    It is by no means sufficient, as Helmholtz says", that when mixed
in suitable proportions they produce the sensation of whitet.
Stated in these terms the problem is indeterminate; but from their
definition itself two other properties are deduced which singularly
contract the limits between which the choice can be made. (1) When
mixed two by two, they produce all the intermediate colours (even
those which, like purple, do not exist in the spectrum); (2) they
fulfil this condition without at the same time producing the sensa
tion of white—or, more exactly speaking, producing it less than
any other colours which could be chosen in their place.
    These two conditions, are precisely the opposite of those fulfilled
by the complementary colours, which on being mixed two by two
do not give rise to any intermediate colour, and, when mixed in
suitable proportions, produce only the sensation of white.                        By
their properties these two sorts of colours reciprocally limit one
another; hence it follows that the study of the distribution of the
complementary colours in a chromatic circle permits the determi
nation of the points of that circle which correspond to the funda
mental sensations.
    2. With the aid of rotating disks               I  have sought, for each colour,
its complementary; the following table gives the result (the nota
tion employed being that of M. Chevreul):—

    *  Optique Physiologique, p. 384, § 20.
    t  I do not say “white          light,” because lights of the same appearance
 may not be identical from the physical point of view: there are white
 lights of which the compositions differ, but the eye cannot distinguish
 them one from another.
    f Between two consecutive colours of the first column of this table
 there are in reality intercalated five colours, designated by the numbers 1-
 to 5; so that six equidistant colours correspond to each name.

of the complementary colours: the intervals are very variable (from
1 to 19); and it seems impossible to deduce from them any im
portant consequences.           Helmholtz” also, who specially studied
their distribution in the      spectrum,   could not trace any law. This
irregularity will disappear when the results are discussed, if we
take as our guide the preceding definitions.             The chromatic circle
upon which my experiments were made consists of three sections,
the limits of which are formed by the red, the yellow, and the blue.
These three sections are not necessarily equidistant from one an
other; but the twenty-four colours of which each is formed fulfil
that condition, as         I
                         have demonstrated in the first Note.
    The following discussion, based on the assumption of equidis–
tance, will not give rigorously exact results unless it be referred to a
single section only. With this aim                     I
                                             select that which extends from
the yellow to the blue, passing through the green, because in this
portion of the chromatic circle the greatest number of complemen
tary colours are assembled.         The green, placed between the yellow
and the   blue,  which   by  their mixture produce only the sensation of
                                                                                                    of fix
white, necessarily corresponds to a fundamental sensation. To
 its  exact position (for we have the choice among eighteen colours
 that name),   I    remark that with          second colour,
                                                       a           present un       at
known, but certainly situated between the red and the orange
 yellow, and with third colour, situated between the blue and the
                        a
violet–blue,   it must give the whole                   of

circle, at  the same time producing the least possible sensation                                    of
 white.   It   will therefore             be
                                   situated                 of at

    At the first glance might   it       believed that the question, being
                                               be
 stated in  such wide terms, would admit                         of
                                                     several solutions.                        It   is
 nothing   of  the kind.      The   complements                       of

forated in two diametrically opposite places.            The upper opening
communicates with a small        glass  tube that can be closed by a cock;
the lower with a somewhat         longer  glass tube, descending vertically,
which    during  the  experiment    dips  in a vessel containing a coloured
fluid. The fluid stands some centims. higher in the tube than in
the vessel.
   In front of one of the rock-salt plates, in a line with the glass
tube, is a source of heat, say the gas-flame of an argand burner;
between the flame and the tube a diaphragm about 4 centims. wide
and a double screen of sheet metal are placed: the latter can be
quickly drawn back and pushed forward.
   Now the experiment is made in the following manner:—The
height of the liquid in the manometer having been observed while
the screen shut out the heat-radiation, the screen is quickly with
drawn; by the absorption of rays which now takes place on the
part of the gas enclosed in the apparatus the gas is heated, in con
sequence of which the manometer shows a sudden increase of pres
sure, which, after some time, reaches a maximum. The increase,
especially that which takes place at the first moment, is very dif
ferent with different gases—comparatively slight with air, while it
is considerable in the case of the strongly absorbing illuminating
gas and ammonia.
  If    the screen be then again pushed between the flame and the
glass tube, the pressure diminishes, in correspondence with the
cooling of the gas—at first quickly, afterwards slowly.
   The phenomenon           is,   on
                                the whole, tolerably complicated, because,

 each of the openings    in the rotating disk and closed by  a thin plate
of glass.
     Behind these notches the absorption-apparatus was either fixed
 or held free in the hand; in this experiment it had a length of 12
 centims.; the manometer was replaced by a short glass tube of
  1 centim. diameter, over which was pushed a wide caoutchouc tube
 that led to the ear of the observer and was inserted in it as deeply
as possible.
     The rays penetrated into the absorption-apparatus every time an
 opening in the rotating disk came in front of the rock-salt plate;
 the interruption of this was effected by the unnotched parts of the
disk.
     At the commencement the apparatus was filled with air; on rota
                 I
 ting the disk could not perceive any tone, perhaps because, on
 account of the rotation &c., too many extraneous noises were still
present.      The affair, however, took quite another shape when
 illuminating-gas was substituted for air; the tone could be heard
with extraordinary distinctness, and might almost be compared to
the whistling of a not too strong wind.       Its height varied with the
velocity of the rotation; and the tone vanished only when the rota
tion became very rapid. The strength of the tone varied percep
tibly with the time during which the cube was exposed; but the
tones ceased directly if the rays were intercepted by an impervious
body (as the hand, a small wooden board, or a hardgum plate) held
before the disk.
                          I
     With ammonia gas likewise obtained distinct tones; while dry
hydrogen and oxygen behaved like atmospheric air.
     The explanation of these experiments is not far to seek; it has
already been intimated above.       We have not to do with any new
property of the rays; the heating and expansion produced by ab
sorption, and the subsequent cooling and contraction of the absorb
ing body, are the causes of the phenomena. That the gas really
played the chief part in my experiments, and not the glass, upon
which likewise the rays fell, follows even from this—that only the
                                                    I
strongly absorbent gases emit audible tones; and found direct proof
of it by so directing the rays, in some experiments, by means of
a third lens and a diaphragm, that they passed merely through the
rock salt and the gas, without anywhere coming into contact with
the glass wall of the tube: the effect was substantially the same
 : s with the simple irradiation.
     A solution of alum placed in the path of the rays caused an
instantaneous cessation of the tone; on the contrary, scarcely a
weakening could be observed when the rays had passed through a
layer 10 centims. in thickness of solution of iodine (in sulphide of
carbon).      Consequently it is the less-refrangible rays which are
most operative, at least upon illuminating-gas and ammonia.
    I  purpose investigating the behaviour of aqueous vapour, in the
hope of furnishing in this way a contribution to the decision of the
question whether it to any considerable extent absorbs heat-rays or

        RESEARCHES ON THE SPECIFIC MAGNETISM OF OZONE.
                           BY M. HENRI BECQUEREL.
    In the course of my researches on the magnetic rotatory powers
 of the gases”, oxygen presented some remarkable anomalies, which
 have induced me to resume the study of the magnetic properties of
 that gas, discovered by my fathert, and to evaluate the specific mag
 netism of ozone.
                            I
    For that purpose fixed above the large electromagnet of the
 Museum a torsion balance enclosed in a vertical test-tube of glass,
 in which a vacuum can be produced and into which various
 gases can be introduced.             The torsion-thread employed was a
 very fine gold wire 32 centims. in length, sustaining a small
 glass bar consisting of a tube filled with air, and closed at both
 ends. A microscope was directed towards a mark traced upon the
 bar, and permitted the latter to be at any time brought back to a
 fixed position, at about 45° from the line of the poles of the elec
 tromagnet.
    When this was magnetized, the small bar was attracted; and by
 a suitable torsion of the gold wire the attraction was balanced, so
 as to restore the bar to its initial position.      We know that in these
 circumstances, in virtue of a principle analogous to the principle
 of Archimedes, the attraction measured is the difference between
 the action exerted upon the bar and that exerted upon an equal
volume of the ambiant gas.             On measuring the attraction in vacuo
 we have the effect produced on the bar alone; and the difference
 between the torsion thus obtained and that which is observed in
different gases measures the action exerted by the magnet upon
 the gas.       It was moreover verified repeatedly, by determining
the periods of the oscillations of the small bar under the influence
 only of the torsion of the thread, that the elasticity of the latter
had not changed during the experiments.
    The ozonized oxygen was prepared by passing pure and dry
oxygen through an effluvia-apparatus like that prepared by M.
Berthelot; and the gas was collected over sulphuric acid under a
glass bell furnished with a glass cock. Thence it passed, through
pipes entirely of glass, into the test-tube, in which a vacuum had
been previously made.
    Notwithstanding        these precautions, perhaps by reason of the
presence of traces of organic matters (grease, resin), the ozone in
the test-tube was rapidly decomposed, and it was not possible to

ascertain the precise composition of the ozonized mixtures to which
the measurements correspond. The progressive augmentation of the
attraction of the bar also permitted the decomposition of the ozone
                                              I
to be traced. The various analyses which have been able to make,
show only that the mixtures studied contained proportions of ozone
which varied between 0.02 and 0:10 by volume. The results ob
tained are nevertheless sufficiently interesting, and may be, in the
mean, summed up as follows:—
                 pº
     The small glass tube, when attracted in vacuo, was brought back
to its original            by a torsion of 14° 22'. In oxygen at the
temperature of 10° and pressure of 760 millins. of mercury, for
the same magnetic intensity the torsion was not more than 3° 52',
 which gives, for the effect produced upon oxygen alone, an attrac
tion of 10° 30'.
     Under the same experimental conditions, on substituting for
oxygen a mixture ozonized by passing very slowly through the
 effluvia—apparatus   at 10° temperature and atmospheric pressure,
 the torsion was 2°29'; the attraction exercised upon the gaseous
 mixture was therefore represented by 11° 53', or an increase of
 0.13 above the specific magnetism of oxygen.
     By placing the effluvia-apparatus in a refrigerating mixture of
 ice and sea-salt a gaseous mixture richer in ozone is obtained. This
 mixture, under the conditions of experiment which have just been
 specified, manifested an increase of 0:23, or nearly 3, above the
 specific magnetism of oxygen.
     Ozone is therefore more magnetic than oxygen; and, in spite of
  the uncertainty which exists respecting the actual composition of
 the ozonized mixtures investigated (an uncertainty which does not
  permit the precise number for ozone, supposing it isolated, to be
 given at the present moment), it is easy to see that the ratio of the
 specific magnetism of ozone to that of oxygen is notably greater than
 the supposed ratio of their densities.     The specific magnetism of
 ozone is therefore   greater   than that which would correspond to the
 amount of    oxygen   it contains. This phenomenon is interesting in
 that it  may  be compared     to those presented by certain magnetic
 bodies, which in different states of condensation give magnetic
 effects increasing much more rapidly than the ratio of the den
 sities.
      I am having an apparatus prepared, however, which        I expect
  will permit me to ascertain the exact quantity of ozone formed at
  the moment of each experiment, and to give the true value of the
 specific magnetism of this remarkable body.—Comptes Rendus de

extensive Geodetic Survey operations of the Imperial Staff, the
Academy thought that       #:    Döllen's report by itself should
hardly be considered conclusive, and resolved to defer the

        had then the opportunity of assuring the Academy that
   quite agreed with         Döllen's opinion in every essential
respect, and only differed from him somewhat as to the im
           of certain details. After my remarks on these had
  een submitted to the Class, the matter again underwent mi
nute discussion, as the result of which the Academy passed
the resolution that no action need be taken on General Schu
bert's proposal, and that Herr Döllen's report and my sub
sequent remarks on it should be arranged in the form of an
essay, in order to bring the grounds for this decision into
general notice.
    In executing this task we feel ourselves obliged to refrain
from criticism upon the further contents of the above-men
tioned paper of   *...     Schubert's, as not directly appertaining
to the subject, and will therefore confine ourselves simply to
the consideration of the proposal in question.
    Herr von Schubert expressly states that the Russo-Scan
dinavian arc, as it is now presented to the scientific world,
might till a few years ago truly lay claim to the title of
a completed work, and that it is only the appearance of the
English book mentioned below" (marking, as it does, an era)
that has materially altered the state of the case. The next
 thing, therefore, is to ascertain in what respect the state of
 the case is altered by the appearance of this work.          It ranks
 unquestionably among the most important publications of
 our time in the region of geodetic literature. The care and
circumspection evinced in this work, in the preparation of
 the data of observation which have been collected during the
last three quarters of a century, and in the deduction of re
 sults as well for the English arc in particular as for the figure
 of the earth in general, fully entitle it to rank as a model.
    As regards the arc, one material difference between this
 work and others is pointed out in the work itself, viz.
 (p. 742) that not, as is usual, has a selected triangulation,
 following as closely as possible the direction of the meridian,
 been alone considered, but the entire network of triangu

direction of the plumb-line.      do not share this opinion
with him :  nay, we consider such correction for this purpose
not even
   In order to present these differences of opinion in a clearer
light, we must examine more closely the nature of the chief
problem of geodesy—namely, the determination of the figure
of the earth, and the effects of local attraction. At my in
stance Herr Döllen has undertaken this introductory presenta
tion of the argument; and                    I
                                think it best to give his own
words, as his statements contain many thoughts which may
be new to even experienced geodesists, and which certainl
deserve consideration.   At the conclusion of his
will add a few remarks on my own account, in order to con
firm what he has said.
   Herr Döllen says:– “Let us for the present set aside the
question of the linear dimensions of the earth ; then the
problem before us, of determining the figure of the earth, in
the sense in which alone it is regarded in all researches of the
higher geodesy, will be none other than this: To determine
THE RELATION OF THE DIRECTION OF GRAVITY TO THE LOCALITY
at any place upon the surface of the earth; or, in other words,
to determine THE LAW ACCORDING TO WHICH THE DIRECTION
OF GRAVITY WARIES WITH CHANGE OF POSITION ON THE SURFACE
OF THE EARTH.
   “It is essential to grasp this definition in full significance,
and especially      make clear

                                             to                     to its

and are therefore also better fitted for the determination of this

vious that our willingness to allow the said correction to hold

good in this case is in no way founded on any confidence in
the assertions and deductions furnished by geology, but on
the latitude on the other side of the mountain, and on the fact
that, as the outcome of the whole investigation, a correct value
has been found for the mean density of the earth; this is pre
cisely what was demanded by the condition stated above, only
in reverse order.        Two further remarks, however, present
themselves here to our mind, which seem to us
worthy of notice to permit a short interruption of the strict
course of our argument.         In speaking of the correct value of
the density of the earth, we regard it as if it were known from
 other sources, whereas we are perfectly aware, not only that
 the determination of the same was the especial object of these
 very observations, but also that it was precisely these observa
 tions on Schehallien that gave the first conception of the
 earth's density. The fact                      is,
                                    however, that           only the con      it   is
 firmation which this determination           the  density   of  the earth                of
 has since received,        means   by  the decisive experiments with

                                      seen when similar efforts made
 upon Chimborazo and Mimet are remembered.                  For       clear                    it   is
 that this method        determining the density
                               of                          the earth lies      of
 open  to  the same objection which we make              the justification    to
of   correction     latitudes. Indeed,

be 6'-52, and on the southern side 5’-14.    We have signified
above our assent to the employment    of corrections to the ob
served latitudes corresponding to these deflections, viz. 6'-5
and 5'-1, should they be used to deduce the figure of the earth;
relying on the fact that the value 4-7 resulting from these
same numbers for the mean density of the earth agrees
pretty closely with the value

                                     by repeated and entirely
independent experiments with the torsion balance; namely,
5:48 according to Cavendish, 5.48 and 5:58 by the two ex
periments of Reich, 5.66 according to Baily. Although it
cannot be doubted that by the application of these corrections
the individual latitudes are brought notably nearer to the
mean, yet the figures themselves show that, even in this case,
the accuracy so attained is only moderate.  For if 8=5:5                                                    in
stead   of the aforesaid 4.7, we have                               |-048,          and therefore a
deflection on the northern side 5'-6, on the southern side 4"4;
or together only 10"-0, instead of the observed amount 11”66.
The missing 1"-66 must be assigned (together with actual
errors of observation) to disturbances unknown to us; and we
 º
have not the slightest reason to divide this amount between
the two points in the same proportion as the attraction of the
mountain, as we really do if we apply the corrections 6'-5 and
                      º
5''-1. Is it not clear now that we gain quite as much, and
          more, for the determination of the figure of the earth,
  y adhering           to the directly observed latitudes, without
any corrections whatever? and will it not always be                only                              so,

     2. But the agreement                 of

       greater than that             of
                                  the uncorrected.
     3. On the other hand, the agreement will                       none the           be

Through it direct evidence would be gained of the existence
of some natural connection, for the possibility of which we
contend, of the visible disturbances with each other or with
unseen counteractions.         The immediate consequence of this
would be, that it would be necessary to decide in each case how
far the contouring should be carried ; for this question could no

positions which are in themselves highly unlikely, and in any
case entirely unproved.   Such correction could be admissible
only in the case where the disturbances are recognized as
entirely accidental and independent.          The decision as to
whether they are so in general must be a matter of experience.
If  stress might be laid on experiments made up to the present
day, they would decide against the view to which we object;
but in fact they will bear no such strain. Meanwhile the
purpose which these corrections are meant to serve, namely
to raise the value of arc-measurements in determining the
mean figure of the earth, may be attained with incomparably
less trouble and to a much greater extent, in a perfectly un
objectionable way : we have merely to determine more lati
tudes.    This might be gathered from what has been said ;
but it is clear of itself when it is remembered that we have to
do with the mean figure of a body which is certainly irregular,
which figure can only be ascertained by observations taken
at as many points as possible.
    “From among the foregoing remarks we think we may
commend to further attention our objection to special deter
minations of the mean density of the earth, as well as the
suggested expediency of an increase in the frequency of
stations of observation.
    “Finally, we must not neglect to defend ourselves expressly
against the conclusion that because we regard the repeatedly
 mentioned levelling as of no avail for the purpose of aiding
in the problem of the figure of the earth, we therefore
think them altogether useless.         So little is this the case,
that we do not hesitate rather to count these and similar
 labours, and the solution of problems connected with them,
 amongst the most important features of the higher geodesy.
 It is only the application which it has been thought might
be made, in this direction, of particular materials, and the
 opinion thence derived that such researches belong especially
 to the essentials of arc-measurement, which is erroneous.
 It would be going too far to attempt at present to describe in
 fuller detail the aims which, in our opinion, ought to be the
 principal ones; but we are glad, in reference to this question,
 to be able to give our entire and unqualified assent to a re

bance, and that an unconditional employment of such correc
tions might lead to most erroneous conclusions.             We therefore
  rotest most decidedly against the opinion advanced by Gen.
             that the Russo-Scandinavian arc is inconsistent with
the present state of science because the ground in the vicinity
of astronomical stations has not been minutely contoured.
   In the next place, Döllen's argument sets forth clearly that
the said contouring is of quite subordinate interest in the
geodetic problem of determining the mean figure of the earth,
and proves that greater frequency of astronomical deter
 minations offers much more certain and efficacious means of
rendering innocuous the influence of local disturbance of the
plumb-line upon the desired result. On the other hand, how

that the    inquiry     into local attraction should          prosecuted be
only   at arc-stations. That this has been the case                 Great          in

by recourse to extended levelling combined with inquiry into
the subsurface conditions, to reach some conclusion as to the
extent to which the anomaly is represented by the configuration
of the actual surface-strata.  Under instructions from head
quarters, Prof. Schweizer, the director of the observatory at
Moscow, has for several years been occupied with the first
of these duties, and we may shortly expect a publication of
the desired results.      So far as we are aware, these operations,
interesting as they are, do not progress, on account of insuffi
cient means, with either the accuracy or the rapidity which-
their importance would seem to demand.
   Another striking anomaly seemed a few years ago to be de
tected on the shores of the Ladoga Sea, at the town of
Navoya-Ladoga, the longitude of which, deduced geodetically,
differed notably from the astronomically determined value.
The attention of the Pulkova Observatory was consequently
directed to this point particularly, by reason of            neighbour                       its
hood. The       difference,   however,    has been found much less
 by  more recent determinations, which have shown that the
former result was             great extent due, partly

      º           Prof. O. Reynolds on certain Dimensional
of the Royal Society,    1879.   Mr. Fitzgerald courteously put
               in the form of questions, expressing the hope that
     would answer them. I was prevented by other work from
    reparing any thing in time for insertion in the April number;
         now ask your space for a few remarks.
     The objections taken by Mr. Fitzgerald to my work may be
summed up as                 three:–
  (1) That by dividing space into eight regions have adopted                              I
a method which is at once inelegant and unnecessarily elabo
rate.
   (2) That            I
               have omitted terms which,                                         if   retained, would
have altered the results.
     (3) That          I have
                          changed my views and adopted the theory
 which   I  had   previously    combated.
    To   all these accusations          would most emphatically plead
                                                I
 not guilty.     And       would further suggest,

 retained; and it was only after it was found that these did not
 in any way affect the results as a first approximation that they
 were neglected.       The terms    I have neglected are, as far as          I
 perceive, the same as those neglected          i.  Professor Maxwell;
 and such was the care taken in this matter (which is of funda
 mental importance) that I am very confident that there is no
 mistake. On the other hand, it is difficult for me to see how
 Mr. Fitzgerald can have failed to see that the residual term,
                                            I
 which he instances as showing that am wrong in saying that
 my equations show that there is no force in the case of parallel
 flow, is distinctly of the second order of small quantities.              But
 even to this term he has no right; for in order to obtain results
 to such an order the variations of s would have to be considered.
 It seems that Mr. Fitzgerald is of opinion that the parallel flow
 of heat does cause stresses in the gas, and that he has been trying
 to find that I have not disproved the possibility of such stresses.
 If he confines his attention to stresses of the same order of
 magnitude as those now shown to exist in the case of conver
 ging or diverging flow, he will find that both Professor Max
 well and I have proved the impossibility of their existence;
 but if he goes, as he appears unwittingly to have done, to a
 higher order of small quantities, then I have nothing to say,
 except that he has no inconsiderable task before him.
    Lastly, as regards the charge of having changed my views
 and having adopted a theory which is practically the same as
that which     I  had been previously combating,         I  can only say
that  against    no theory    have  I said a word of which         I  do not
maintain the truth.         I  have never asserted that the variation
of pressure in the direction of the flow of heat, which have          I
consistently maintained to be necessary to the production of
the phenomena of impulsion, may not be attended by a differ

   I think that now Mr. Fitzgerald will reconsider his protest
against $ 53; for while maintaining, on the one hand, a theory
fundamentally different from that in my paper, he can hardly
maintain, on the other, that there are no such theories, and
that they have not found supporters. But, in truth, the
remark in art. 53 was not applied to the theory which Mr.
Fitzgerald seems to be supporting; and as am sure that he                       I

 the pointer and the pointer directing the cart, and thus origi
nate the logarithmic curve.
     If  A is moved along a wave-line symmetrically placed with
 respect to the axis of 4, the cart draws another wave-line a
 quarter of a wave-length behind the first in point of time.                                            If
the first line represents the varying strength of an induced

electrical current, the second shows the nature of the prima

    . 5).
             6 shows the application of the machine to the deter
mination of the area of a closed curve.
    The rules for finding maxima and minima and points of
inflexion are rendered obvious by manipulating the machine.
By no means can the cart be made to trace a maximum or a
minimum unless the pointer A cross the axis of a ; nor can
it pass a point of inflexion unless A pass a maximum or a

    An indefinite integral requires the addition of a constant;
but on integrating                  limits this constant goes out.
This is illustrated by the fact that the cart may be started on
any level on the board, but the ascent made is the same.
    Not only does the machine integrate y da', but if the plane
of the front wheel of the cart is set at right angles instead of
parallel to    AB,         then the cart finds the integral                         of        and thus
                                                                                         #.
solves problems such, for instance, as the time occupied by a
body in moving along a path when the law of the velocity at
different parts is known. This is evidently true; for if a line
be drawn perpendicularly to AB through B, it will cut e e at
a point distant from the axis                   of   a    by an amount equal to                         4,

and therefore               inclination    is   such that                      tangent     is   equal   to
1                                               -
 +.       As the cart travels down              instead          of            for positive values
of    its descent instead of its ascent must be taken.

 that as little as possible of metals &c. capable of being acted
on by nascent electrolytic oxygen was present, they were used
 as + electrodes for several days in the electrolysis of dilute
 HASO, such a current being employed as to keep a con
tinuous evolution of gas at the rate of some 50 to 100 cubic
centims. of hydrogen per day. The superficial area of each
electrode (measured by scale and compasses, and making no
allowance for increase of surface due to the carbon being
slightly pitted and not smooth) was 3.9 square centimetres.

                                 the four curves thus obtained,—
 those marked 1 and 3    being  the curves obtained with acid of
27-0grammes per 100 cubic centims., and with carbon and gold
electrodes respectively; and those marked 4 and 6 the curves
obtained with acid of 1-0 gramme per 100 cubic centims.,
with carbon and gold electrodes respectively.          The other
two curves traced, marked 2 and 5, are put in for comparison,
being respectively the mean curves obtained as above described
with acid of 27-0 and 1-0 grammes per 100 cubic centims. with
  latinum electrodes.    In each case the weaker acid gives the
  igher counter E.M.F. for a given rate of flow of electricity
per square centimetre of electrode surface; but the effect
produced by the variation in the strength of the acid is small
compared with that produced by substituting platinum for

    It should be noticed, however, that it is highly probable
that the counter E.M.F. observed with the carbon electrodes
is somewhat diminished, at any rate for the smaller currents,
§.
by the circumstance that electrolytic “ nascent * oxygen is
capable of attacking carbon, forming CO and CO, (Beetz,
         Annalen, 1878 [2] v. p. 1; also Phil. Mag. 1879 [5]
vii. p.  1); the effect of this would of course be to diminish e
by a quantity equivalent to the heat evolved in the oxidation
of the carbon (reckoned per gramme-equivalent of water de
composed).     With currents of the minuteness of only a few
microwebers it was not found practicable to prove directly
the formation either of CO or CO, ; but the circumstance
that the observed values fore fell slightly below 1:50 volt with
the voltameter containing acid of 27 grammes per 100 cubic
centims., and with currents of from 5 to 10 microwebers, or
slightly above the current equivalent to the “diffusion dis
charge” found with the same voltameter substituting platinum
electrodes for carbon ones (viz. close to 4.0 microwebers),
 together with the circumstance that with platinum and gold
 electrodes the value of e was never below 1.5 volt when the
 current exceeded that equivalent to the “diffusion discharge,”
 would seem to indicate that the values of e for these currents
 found for the carbon electrodes were actually slightly below
 the values that would have been found had no oxidation of
the electrode taken place.

 on altering the current-strength to some value previously
 experimented with, the value of e always immediately altered
 to something very close to the value it previously was found
 to possess for the altered current, which could not have been
 the case had the increase in value of e found for a stronger
 current been simply due to the increase in the value of h/
 owing to the accumulation of copper sulphate solution round
 the + electrode.
    Very little difference in the value of E was noticed when
 gold was substituted for copper as the negative electrode
 (the dimensions and the positive electrode remaining un
 changed), the curve deduced by plotting the values of E–CR
 as ordinates and the rates of flow per square centimetre as
 abscissae being nearly, though not quite, the same whether
 the  –   plate were copper or gold; what little difference did
 exist was of such a nature that the gold — electrode curve lay
 slightly above the copper one. On substituting platinum for
 copper, the curve was very distinctly depressed; i.e. the values
 of E–CR for a given rate of flow and a constant copper posi
tive electrode were smaller with a platinum electrode than with a
copper one, and smaller with a copper one than with a gold one.
Whether the values thus registered by the aid of the quadrant
electrometer are strictly comparable, or whether they are
complicated by a difference of contact action taking place
between the electrode and the brass quadrant of the electro
meter (by means of the connecting-wire),            however, openis,
 to  discussion       Admitting that the contact action does not

                                         electrodes would indicate

                            n,   is

the  order,  platinum  greatest, then copper, and lastly gold. As

                                           is                                         to

    93. Decomposition of Copper Sulphate with Copper Elec
trodes, and of Zinc Sulphate with Zinc Electrodes.—The vol
tameters used consisted simply of U-tubes filled with the hot,
just boiled, solution of zinc or copper sulphate employed, and
then closed by india-rubber stoppers through                            passed
glass tubes with platinum wires through the drawn-out ends,
 so as to make mercury-cups, and keep the solution from access
 of air; to the platinum wires were soldered the electrodes,
 consisting of well-brightened strips of metal of known size,
the solderings and platinum wire being covered over with
gutta percha. By introducing a known resistance into the
circuit, composed of voltameter and electromotor (one or
more De la Rue, or other analogous cells), the current could
be regulated and measured, and hence the value of e=E-CR
determined. In this way the following numbers were ob
tained. With the copper-sulphate voltameter (which contained
a nearly saturated solution of the salt, containing 7.84 grammes
metallic copper per 100 cubic centims., the formula CuSO,
36H, O requiring 7.80) the value of R was found to be close
to 110 ohms at the average temperature of the observations—
this number being calculated from the dimensions of the
                     j
column of fluid between the electrodes, and the specific resist
ance of the fluid determined by a new method which will be
described in detail in a future paper.               Similarly, the value of
R for the     zinc-sulphate       voltameter was calculated to be close
to 250 ohms.
   The following numbers were obtained with copper-sulphate
and copper electrodes:—

greater than h’ + (1–ni)H1–nihi. In such a case negative
work must be spent (or work will be gained) during the de
composition; the cell is then termed an electromotor, and
constitutes an ordinary galvanic element.    When this is the
case, Es-Ely-as, for instance, when the + electrode is zinc

trode) are positive even with very small currents, and increase as
the current increases. It hence results that the numerical value

  however, physicists generally are under the impression that
  the diminution in E.M.F., or “polarization ” of the cell, thus
  produced is practically inappreciable : thus, for instance,
  within the last few months a determination of the value of v
  has been made in Sir W. Thomson's laboratory by R. Shida,
  by measuring the E.M.F. of a gravity Daniell, first, in elec
  trostatic units (no current being generated), and then in elec
-                 units (a moderately powerful current being set
  #         e which method evidently can only be applied if the
  difference in the E.M.F. according as a current is generated
  or not is negligible (Brit. Assoc. Reports, 1880, p. 497). The
  same kind of remark applies to several other investigations
  published during the last few years.
      96. Decomposition of Dilute Sulphuric Acid with a Zinc
  Positive Electrode.—On trying experiments with a zinc (amal
  gamated) positive electrode and a platinum electrode in the
  same wayas those described in $92, it was found that the nume
  rical value of e was uniformly negative and decreased as the cur
  rent increased.     So long as the current remained of a constant
  value the nature and dimensions of the external battery were
                 i.
  immaterial; so that the same value for e was obtained whether
  an eaternal battery was actually applied, or whether the zinc
  platinum couple was the sole electromotor in circuit, provided
  that, by suitably adjusting the total resistance in circuit, the
  current was made the same.             Thus the following average
  numbers were obtained with a cell containing dilute sulphuric
  acid of 10 grammes H, SO, per 100 cubic centims., the plates
  each exposing 8-6 square centims. of surface, and being con
  tained in a                     like those above described, of 1:1
  square centim. bore, the centres of the plates being 13 cen
  tims. apart; so that, as the specific resistance of sulphuric
  acid of the strength used is close to 29 ohms at 18° (from
  Kohlrausch's numbers, loc. cit. supra), the value of R was
             TIT =34 ohms:—

     In   these experiments the correction             CR is only approxi
  mate,    it being   impossible   to calculate the precise value of R
  with any great degree of accuracy; but evidently, except in
  the last one or two determinations, even a large error in the
  value of R would make no appreciable difference in the end
  result, viz. that the E.M.F. of a Daniell cell regularly decreases
  as the current produced increases, but not at so rapid a rate.
     During the time that these observations were being made,
  the changes in the E.M.F. of the cell due to “running
  down" and variation of the density of the solutions sur
  rounding the two plates respectively, were too small to be
 capable of measurement.           After making an observation with
 a larger current and reducing the current to a smaller value
 or to nil, sensibly the same value was always obtained whether
 at the beginning or end of the series of measurements, which
 lasted some two or three hours in each case. If, however,
 observations were made one day and then repeated a day or
 two after, concordance was rarely noticeable between the
 results : the later experiments always showed a more rapid
 rate of fall in the numerical value of —e with the current
 increase than the earlier ones, and also generally indicated a
 perceptibly lower value when the current was nil. Apparently
this result was due to the deposition of copper on the surface
of the zinc plate, owing to diffusion.
    Experiments are now in progress in which the true value
of R for any given cell is determined by a new method : so
far these have given results entirely confirming those above
described. The highest values hitherto obtained for the E.M.F.

ments    and of the valuations of the E.M.F. of a Daniell cell
made by previous observers, and of the bearing on the discre
pancies between these valuations of the point just substan
tiated (viz. the dependence of the E.M.F. on the current gene
rated) will be resumed in a future paper. It may be noticed,
however, that even with a not very enormous rate of current
flow per unit area, the diminution in E.M.F. amounts to several
per cent. of the highest value, a quantity quite sufficient to
vitiate observations in which the E.M.F. is assumed to remain
constant.
    98. Similarly the E.M.F. of a Grove’s cell is not wholly
independent of the current generated, although the effect is
somewhat less marked than with a Daniell cell.                      The end
result of the chemical changes taking place in this cell are
expressed by one or other of the equations
         Zn+ H, SO, +2 HNO3= ZnSO, +2 H2O+2NO,
       2Zn4-2H, SO, +2HNO2=2 ZnSO, +3H, O+ N2 O3,

so that,    in addition to the production of gases (more or less
completely absorbed by the nitric acid), dilution of the nitric
acid takes places in the proximity of the platinum plate, thereby
 causing h’ (the correction for the effects of differences in the
 density of the fluids surrounding the electrodes) to have an ap
 preciable value. It is therefore to be expected that the
 of a Grove’s cell will, like that of a Daniell's or an ordinary
 voltaic circle, decrease with the current generated.               That this
 is  actually   the case is indicated      by the    following  figures,  ob

suppression by chemical action.      When the amount of sup
pression due to this cause is determined and added to the

exactly with the quantity of electricity that has passed.
    3) In the electrolysis of acidulated water, until the sources
of loss of hydrogen other than “diffusion discharge" are
eliminated (viz. solution in the fluid, condensation and absorp
tion by the electrode, and action of dissolved oxygen originally
present in the fluid), the counter E.M.F. set up when a given
steady current traverses a given voltameter is short of                                                   its
maximum value for that current; simultaneously               deficiency              a

after correction for diffusion discharge); whilst             breaking                on

    hemore nearly completely the sources          loss are eliminated,of
the more nearly does the counter E.M.F. set               approach              up                        its

   The values of e depend on the material of which the elec
trodes are made.       Other things being equal, carbon gives
higher values than platinum, and platinum than gold.
   #. the case of acidulated water, rendering the solution
more dilute increases the value of e.
    From former observers’ work it results that increasing the
temperature decreases e.
    (6) The above formula, in conjunction with experimental
determinations of the variations in the values of eunder various
conditions, explains coherently and quantitatively the leading
facts connected with counter E.M.F., polarization, and the
E.M.F. of gas-batteries, and accounts for the possibility, under
certain conditions, of decomposing an electrolyte with a less
battery E.M.F. than corresponds to the work done in splittin
it up into the final products—and also indicates that the E.M.F.
of a Daniell cell is not constant, but is less the greater the
current it generates, to such an extent that with currents of
not very great magnitude a diminution in E.M.F. to the
extent of several per cent. is brought about, and that, in con
sequence, certain of the methods in use for determining the
E.M.F. of cells and their internal resistance are, at any rate
for certain kinds of cells, incorrect, as they are based on the
assumption that the E.M.F. of the cell is constant.

determinations of the causes which make e to vary, &c., infor
mation can be deduced as to the amount of energy with

this determination with the determination of the methods for
finding the E.M.F. corresponding to the energy requisite to
break it up into the final products (described in Parts I. and
II.), information can be deduced concerning the affinity of
the constituents of the electrolyte, and the variations of that
affinity according as the constituents are “nascent” or in
their ordinary free state.    For instance, the energy given out
in the transformation of nascent hydrogen and oxygen into
the ordinary free gases exceeds      §.   energy that would be
developed   by   the union of these gases to form liquid water,
i. e. exceeds the energy equivalent to 34100 gramme-degrees
or to 1:50 volt.

gases and vapours enclosed in sealed tubes, he was able to
produce musical tones from the substances".               It was thus
proved that vaporous bodies as well as solids were able to
convert thermal undulations into sonorous ones. Other expe
rimenters have extended these observationsf. The important
result of these experiments is that the molecules of eertain
bodies possess the power of transforming the undulations of
short period which fall upon them into those of long period.
Expressed briefly, some bodies are capable of transforming
inaudible undulations into audible ones.              Now refractive
bodies have the power of transforming non-luminous calorific
rays into luminous ones; and this passage from the one state
into the other is called calorescence.      Again, when the ultra
violet  rays  are  permitted   to fall upon certain substances they
render the substance luminous. In other words, the substance
has transformed the non-luminous undulations into luminous
ones.    To this change the term fluorescence has been applied.
Thus we have:—
   Fluorescence—change from more rapid into less rapid              un
      dulations.
   Calorescence—change from less rapid into more rapid              un
      dulations.
    In the new phenomena we have again a change from more
rapid into less rapid, which is very similar to that which occurs
in fluorescence. To the change which takes place in this case,
             I
therefore, venture to propose the term “Sonorescence.”                A
body such as hard rubber, in which it was first noticed, would
be called a sonorescent body, just as sulphate of quinine is a
                                                º:
fluorescent body. The points of similarity between the three
phenomena are sufficiently evident; the
ence are the following:—

    (1) The change in sonorescence is greater in magnitude
and is different in kind from that in the other two cases.           In
fluorescence and calorescence the particles oscillate in every
case across the direction of propagation, but in sound we
believe them to move in the direction of propagation. Thus,
in the new phenomena we have a change of direction and also
        i.
a change in frequency of the oscillations.
    (2)      fluorescence and calorescence the result is in both
cases to produce luminous undulations from non-luminous
ones.     In sonorescence, on the contrary, we produce sonorous

word proposed, however, has so decided a meaning that no one
can imagine it to mean a production of luminous undulations,
but will immediately recognize it as meaning the production
of sonorous ones.

     AM indebtºd to your courtesy for space to conclude (at

fine myself to a very few words as to the points at issue be
tween myself and Dr. Lodge.
   The difficulty of understanding each other's position has
arisen from our employing the word Work in different senses.
Dr. Lodge, following modern works on Dynamics, defines
Work done as equivalent to Energy exerted, and as measured
by the product of the moving force and the distance through
which       point

by the law of the Conservation of Energy, the two “Works,”
or the two products of force and distance moved through,
must be equal and opposite.          It then proceeds:—“Since the
forces (F) are    equal  and   opposite,  and the works (Fs) are also
equal and opposite, the distances (s) must be equal but not
opposite; that                  is,
                      the two bodies must move over precisely the
same distance and         the same sense; which practically asserts
                                       in
that they move together and are                contact,      long     in

   The term Ampère is here used to designate the B.A. unit
of quantity corresponding to the ohm (the B.A. electromag
netic unit of resistance), the volt (the corresponding unit of
electromotive   force), the weber (unit of current), and the
farad (unit of capacity).   The electrostatic units of the B.A.
series might with great advantage be called the static-ampère,
static-ohm, static-volt, and static-farad.
   4. Units like the above, whether of the metric or of the
B.A. series, of which three are fundamental, and all others
derived from them in such a way as will exclude unnecessary
coefficients from our equations, are called systematic units.
In forming the existing artificial series of systematic units, it
has been usual to regard the units of length, time, and mass
as fundamental, and the rest as derived; but there is nothing
to prevent our regarding any three independent members of the
series as fundamental, and deriving the others from them. It is
the aim of the present paper to point out that Nature presents
us with three such units; and that if we take these as our
fundamental units instead of choosing them arbitrarily, we
shall bring our quantitative expressions into a more conve
nient, and doubtless into a more intimate, relation with Nature
as it actually exists.      I
                          will then approximate to the values of
the units of length, time, and mass belonging to this, which is
a truly natural series of physical units.
    5. For such a purpose we must select phenomena that pre
vail throughout the whole of Nature, and are not specially
associated with individual bodies.     The first of Nature's quan
tities of absolute magnitude to which I will invite attention is
that remarkable velocity of an absolute amount, independent
of the units in which it is measured, which connects         syste   all
matic electrostatic units with the   electromagnetic   units    the        of
same series.     I shall call this velocity V1.       Ifwere taken
                                                           it
as  our unit velocity, we should     at
                                      one stroke have           an

                                                   the whole range
of   electric phenomena, and probably into our study          light   of
and heat.
   Again, Nature presents         with one particular coefficient
                                                                                in of

that we might thereby lay the foundation for detecting wherein

electrolysis, with a single definite quantity of electricity which

this clear I shall express “Faraday's Law” in the following

each chemical bond which is                               ruptured within an electrolyte                a    cer
tain quantity of electricity traverses the electrolyte, which is the
same in all cases.   This definite quantity of electricity     shall                                    I

of molecular phenomena.
   Hence we         very good reason to suppose that in W1, Gl,
and E, we have three of a series of systematic units that in an
eminent sense are the units of nature, and stand in an intimate
relation with the work which goes on in her mighty laboratory.

will presently endeavour to evaluate E1. V1 has been variousl
determined by experiment as 3.10 metre-eights per second,
2.82 metre-eights per second, 2.88 metre-eights per second,
and may be assumed to be not far from 3 metre-eights per
second.   Accordingly we may put

388               Dr. G. Johnstone Stoney on the
atmospheric temperatures and pressures is somewhere about a
unit-eighteen (10*).       Hence the number of molecules in a
litre .#   be about a unit-XXIV. Now, a litre of hydrogen
at atmospheric pressures and temperatures weighs, roughly
 speaking, a decigramme. Hence the mass of each molecule
of hydrogen is a quantity of the same order as a decigramme
divided by a unit-XXIV, i.e. a XXVth gramme. The che
mical atom is half of this. Hence the mass of a chemical
atom of hydrogen may be taken to be somewhere about half a
twenty-fifth-gramme.       There is no advantage in retaining the
coefficient half in an estimate in which we are not even sure
that we have assigned the correct power of 10; and              will              I
therefore, for the sake of simplicity, take the XXVth gramme
as being such an approach as we can attempt to the value of
the mass of an atom of hydrogen.

every ampère of electricity that passes, ninety-two sixth
  rammes (i.e. ninety-two millionths of a gramme of water) are
  ecomposed (see Brit-Assoc. Report, 1863, p. 160).

THEtended to check experimental inquiry in relation to the
mechanical cause of gravitation, as it has hindered investiga

action was supposed to propagate itself in some mysterious
way across space without the intervention of matter; so that

     sº  not analogous considerations apply to gravity (still
regarded by some as the result of a mystic “action at a dis
tance ’’), and which, as an actual fact, now remains as the
last remnant of spiritualism to be expelled from physics. In
<U+017F>º
relation to this subject, Sir William Thomson, in an important
development of Le Sage's theory of gravitation, published in
the Philosophical Magazine for May 1873, makes the follow
ing suggestive remark, viz. that, assuming certain possible
conditions to exist, “crystals would generally have different
                   in different directions, and would therefore
  ave different weights according to the direction of their axes
relatively to the direction of gravity.     No such difference has

extremely small. Hence the constituent atoms, if aeolotropic
as to permeability, must be so but to an exceedingly small
degree '' (page 331)f.
     int    not this point be worthy of experiment? Although
the discovery of some such minute specific differences would
not, in point of principle, be necessary to the establishment of
the truth of the earistence of an explanation for gravitation, yet
a discovery of this kind would be highly interesting as a con
firmation of the truth of the particular explanation afforded
by the kinetic theory of gases (which depends on the permea
bility of gross matter by a gaseous aether, whose minute com
ponent particles have an extremely long mean path). The

bodies, with a view to determine if certain small specific
variations may not have escaped notice, owing to their not
haring been searched for, on account of the bias of preconceived
ideas, and the lethargy produced by the influence of preformed
theories. Crystalline bodies of birefracting properties &c.
which, in relation to the luminiferous aether, are permeable to
light with different velocities in different directions, may spe
cially suggest themselves for experiment.
     Since the successful pursuit of a research of this kind,
where specific differences of a very minute character are in
question, would no doubt entail considerable experimental
resources, with refined and delicate apparatus, which might
 not be at the disposal of every one, the more therefore does it
 become desirable to attract general attention to the subject.
 The comparative dearth of discovery of any great physical
 principle (of a fundamental character at least) within the last
 few years would seem, if any thing, to call for additional zeal
in experimental enterprise. Although a negative result to the
 investigations would not be decisive one way or the other in
 regard to the validity of the explanation of gravity afforded
 by the kinetic theory (for, of course, it is well conceivable
 that such specific variations in gravific effect, if they exist,
 might be too minute for detection with the appliances at our
 command), yet a positive result would be so highly interesting
 and important, that even a small prospect of success would
 amply repay the labour of a careful trial, and enlist usefully
 the skill and ingenuity of experimenters.

           THE EFFECT OF GREAT COLD UPON MAGNETISM.
                           BY JOHN TROWBRIDGE.
         investigation upon the magnetic condition of steel and upon
 AN the       magnetic permeability of iron is now in progress in the
 Physical Laboratory of Harvard University. The preliminary ex
 periments are interesting, since they show that very low tempera
 tures exercise far greater influence on the magnetic condition than
 has been noticed by previous observers.
    It is stated by Wiedemann" that the cooling below the tempe
 rature at which steel is magnetized enfeebles the magnetic condi
 tion.    A bar which was magnetized at 6°C. or 8° C. gave at 4°C.
 and —25°C. intensities represented by 5.08 and 4.90. This re
 presents a loss of less than 4 per cent. In my experiments the
 magnetic bar magnetized at 20°C., when subjected to a tempera

            ON THE GALVANIC     CONDUCTIVITY OF HEATED GASES.
                             RY M. R. BLONDLOT.                               *
      Gases are generally considered incapable of transmitting the
  current furnished by a pile consisting of only a few elements. A
  single exception has been pointed out by M. E. Becquerel"—that
 of gases brought to red heat. M. Beequerel ascertained that at
 this high temperature different gases, among others air, permit the
 current of a pile to pass, and even that of a single Bunsen element.
 He found, however, that the resistance of gases followed very dif
 ferent laws from those which have been established for solids and
 liquids: it depends on the intensity of the current, the number of
 the pile-elements, and, between two electrodes with unequal sur
 faces, on the direction of the current.           The singularity of these
 laws has not only caused them to be called in question, but even
 the existence of the conducting-power            of gases to be contested.
 G. Wiedemann’t        supposes   that in M.  Becquerel's   experiments the
 current    may    have been     transmitted,   not  through   the gas, but
 through the cements used for sealing the electrodes, they having
 become conductive in consequence           of the rise of temperature : in
 support of his opinion he cites a negative experiment of Grove'sf.
                                                     I
     In view of these divergences have thought it would be useful
 to place beyond dispute the existence of the conductivity of gases, by
 means of an experiment in which every part of the apparatus would
 be constantly accessible to observation.          For that purpose      had                            I
 recourse to the following arrangement:—
     Into a circuit the sulphate-of-copper cell and a capillary electro
 meter are introduced.         The circuit is interrupted at one point;
 and each of the extremities of the wire is attached to a platinum
 disk of about 3 centims. diameter; the two disks are kept vertical,
facing and parallel to one another, by means of long pipe-stems                                              in
sulated at the lower part. The distance of the disks being regu
lated at 2 or 3 millims., it is clear that the circuit is interrupted by
the interposed air, and that the electrometer remains motionless.
    The experiment is commenced by closing the electrometer upon
itself by means of a bridge annexed to              Then, with the aidit.                                     of
 an   enameller's blow-pipe, the two platinum disks are made red
hot: during this operation the electrometer remains constantly                                                at
zero, since         closed
                       it   is       by
                                the bridge. The flame        then removed,               is
and,     moment after, the bridge; the mercury

 platinum disks, at a distance of 40 centims., is sufficient for demon
 strating the passage of the electricity.   The mean temperature of
 the gas is in this case so little elevated that a person can hold his
hand in it; a thermometer placed there shows a mean final tempe
rature of from 60° to 70°.       The interposition of a screen or the
agitation of the air hinders the phenomenon.         The lamp can be
replaced by an incandescent body, such as a stout glass rod made
red-hot; consequently atmospheric air itself is susceptible of
becoming a conductor.                 I
                              have observed that if the two platinum
disks are heated unequally, considerable electromotive forces are
produced: the hotter disk constitutes a negative pole with respect
to the other. The direction of this phenomenon is the same as that
observed by M. Becquerel in the flame itself.-Comptes Rendus de

 ON AN ACOUSTIC PHENOMENON NOTICED IN A CROOKES TUBE.
                               BY CHARLEs                R.   CRoss".
     A short time since, while experimenting with a Crookes tube,                                         I
 noticed a phenomenon which was quite striking, and so evident
 that it hardly seems possible that it has not frequently been observed
 before ; but as no allusion to the effect in question has come to my
 notice,   Iventure to call attention to                  it.
     In working with the tube,              in

    Now, according to the molecular vortex theory of magne
 tism, magnetic force is due to vortex motion in a fluid filling
 space, and the magnetic force at any point is equal to the mo–
 lecular rotation of the vortex at that point.                   et a, 8, y be
 the  magnetic   force at   any    point.    Let    F,  G,   H be the compo

Mr. Hall’s               leads to the same expressions for the

draw is that the effect discovered by Mr. Hall is the same or due
to the same cause as the rotation of the        of polarization of
light.” The previous investigation,                    I

identical with his. For let us put
                    p=2',           q=3,          r-Y;

of condenser there can be electric absorption even in                             the case
of homogeneous bodies. Hence the problem was to                                   test the
electric absorption of a crystal, in the case of an infinite plate
              .#

ciple of Thomson.
    The crystals which could be obtained in large and perfect
plates were quartz and calcite. These were                    rather irre
gular form, about 35 millim. across and                    millim. thick,
and perfectly ground to plane parallel faces. There were two
                              º
quartz plates cut from the same crystal perpendicular to the
axis, and two cleavage-plates of Iceland spar. There were also
several specimens of              ground to the same thickness; the
  lates were    by   perfectly transparent, with polished faces.

The fact that there are two        species

 electric  absorption       some degree.

    The copper ring, d, was suspended by three silk threads
 from the brass disk, f, which in turn could be raised and

   In comparing the glass with the crystal plates, the electro
meter was rendered as little sensitive as the ordinary arrange
ment of the instrument without the inductor-plate would allow.
The electric absorption of the glass plates for a charge in the
battery of two or three sparks from the Harris unit-jar then
sufficed, after 20 or 30 seconds contact with the battery and
5 seconds discharging time, to give a deflection of about 200
scale-divisions, which were millimetres. The quartz and cal
cite plates were then alternately substituted for the glass, the
same charge and the same intervals of contact being used, and
the resulting deflections noted—two plates of each substance
of the same thickness being used.
   The results of the measurements are given in the following
Tables, the effect of the glass being called 100.

                     Electric Absorption of Crystals.                    419
   These Tables seem to prove beyond question that calcite in
clear crystal has no electric absorption.      Quartz seems to
have about    , that of glass; but we have remarked that quartz
is not a  good  substance to test the theory upon.
   Some    experiments   were made with cleavage-plates of sele
nite, which are always more or less imperfect, as the laminae
are very apt to separate. These gave,               effects about
§ or + those of glass.
   In order to test still further the absence of electric absorp
tion in calcite, the electrometer was rendered very sensitive,
and the calcite plates were tested with gradually increasing
charges, from that which in glass gave 200 millim. after 1
second contact, up to the maximum charge (ten sparks of the
unit-jar) which the condensers were capable of carrying.       In
these trials, the calcite still showed no effect, even with
S.
30 seconds contact.      During these experiments glass was fre
          substituted for the calcite, to leave no question but
that the apparatus was in working order.
   It is to be noted that the relative effects of the quartz and
the glass were different for dried plates and plates exposed to
the atmosphere.      This was possibly due to #. glass being a
better insulator, and thus retaining     charge better when dry
                                           its
than in   itsordinary condition.

 Ohm’s         Law, and the Hypothesis of Resultant Displacements.
1.             HE
                doctrine known as Ohm's law states that the
             simplest form of motion by which definite musical
  itch is defined to the ear is the pendulum-vibration.            It may
  e extended as follows:–In all cases in which Ohm’s law
holds, the ear resolves any complex of two or more simulta
neous pendulum-vibrations into the original pendulum-vibra
tions of which they consist, and hears them as distinct and
independent sounds.
     Irest my belief in Ohm's law mainly on ordinary pheno
mena, not on refinements or difficult observations; and                                                             I
shall endeavour to make this my course throughout.

             know that    simple   harmonic vibrations must           pro                                    be

                              in

I wish to point out the important bearing, on the theory, of
the direct determination of the interval which separates the
region in which two notes are heard only as resultant dis
placements, from that in which they begin to be heard sepa
rately, in accordance with Ohm's law.

mostly conducted by means of my enharmonic organ, in which
I have a collection of notes separated for the most part by
single commas.
     he results, so far as                   I
                             have gone, are:–1. The critical                                                in
terval, at which two notes begin to be heard beside their beats,
or resultant displacements, is about two commas, throughout
that medium portion of the scale which is used in practical
music. 2. This critical interval appears not to be exactly the
same for        all
              ears.       my own case two notes two commas
                                    In
apart are not heard distinctly beside the beats.          the case                           In
of Mr. Parratt, who has kindly examined the point with me,
two notes two commas apart are distinctly heard beside the
beats.   In both cases the beats alone are heard with an                                                    in
terval     of
           one comma, and the two notes are quite clear beside
the beats with an interval of three commas.
I    propose      undertake further experiments, with the view
                       to
                                                                                                       So

   11. The relationship of these resultant displacements to the
  henomena in the general case, is most conveniently studied

†.    instrument in my possession has a rather restricted
number of change-wheels; and one of my first tasks in the
St. John's College laboratory has been to cut additional change
wheels for this instrument, for the purpose of illustrating this
subject graphically". (See Plates          to VII.) <U+017F>º
    12. The examination of the curves leads us to the following
conclusions.
    In every case, whether of beats of unisons, or of beats of
imperfect consonances, the examination of the curves shows a
portion of a harmonic curve lying through the vertices of the
single resultant vibrations, which portion corresponds in du
ration to the beats as given either by Smith's rule or the ordi
nary rule for beats.
  #.     durations of these harmonic curves are different in dif
ferent cases. Three principal types may be distinguished:—
    Let E, F be the amplitudes; p : q the ratio in lowest terms
 of the exact consonance whose small variation is considered
 (q >p).

   <U+017F>º
                    -      -
         If  E | p is considerably, less than F | q, there are q
 complete harmonic curves both at top and bottom, and the
 duration of each is q times that of the Smith's beat.
    (2)  If   E | p = F | q, there are p + q complete harmonic
 curves which may be called external, passing both top and
 bottom, and the              of each external curve is p + q times
 that of the Smith's beat; also there are q-p internal curves,
 which lie nearer the middle; the duration of each internal
  curve is q—p times that of the Smith's beat.
     (3) If  E | p is considerably greater than F | q, there are p
 harmonic curves both at top and bottom. They are not com
 plete, but appear to form portions of curves of long period.
     13. In     all
                cases the curves which correspond        the beats,  to                as

424                     Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet                   on the Beats
in a system         in which the forces are proportional to the displace
ments.
     15. In the present case, if we find a term present whose
  whole period is that of the Smith's beat, it must therefore
  arise by transformation, i. e. through the presence of terms of
  higher orders than the first. We shall use generally the ex
  pression “transformation ” to signify the                       on a systemºft.
  of terms higher than the first in the expression for the forces.
 This is substantially Helmholtz’s explanation of the difference
 tone, which is identical with the lowest beat-note of König.
     16. We shall show that                          all
                                              König's beat-notes can                                       be

426               Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet                      on the Beats
   19. We may notice here incidentally that it is necessary
that the resolved primaries should be uniform and steady, in
order that the beats exhibited in the resultant forms ma
retain their regularity. Those who support the Young-and
Smith theory generally have a sort of confused idea that the
primaries are modified when superposed into their resultant.
   20. How, then, do the beats of mistuned consonances arise?
They may be regarded as springing from interference of new
notes, which arise by transformation, in the passage of the
resultant forms through the transmitting mechanism of the ear,
before the analysis by the sensorium.

                                   I
tinuously and quietly, began to follow the course of König's
experiments at the point where he deals with the combina
tions of the note C, following his form not accurately, but
with such divergences as the difference in the apparatus sug
 ested.  After going through one or two sets in the way
                                   I
  ereinafter described, concentrated my attention on the ana
lysis of beats, and specially on those of mistuned consonances
of the form h : 1. It will be seen that after a time    entirely                  I
discarded resonators, having convinced myself that, so far as
they were concerned, the beats of mistuned consonances, other
than unisons, with the beat-notes, difference- and combination
tones of    all
             orders, and,   fact,   that had

                  of Consonances of the Form h :   1.            427
Some of these are probably due to the imagination; others
probably exist in small intensity. , And        I am satisfied that
there still exists a large field of work in the further prosecu
                                                    I
tion of this subject. But of the main result have no doubt
whatever; and that is:—
    24. The beats of mistuned consonances of the form h : 1,
where h is nearly some whole number, consist mainly of vari
ations of intensity of the lower note when the beats of the
harmonics are eliminated.
    25.  I  was prepared for this result in the case of the octave
by my preliminary experiments. (Phil. Mag. viii. p. 293),
          lº.
                                      I
 but did not proceed further till had verified it and got m
 ear to              it readily under the new conditions, whic
 required two or three days.       I then got Mr. Parratt to come
 and listen.      He was much disturbed by the trifling noises
                                      I
 from the engine, belts, &c.; and blew the bellows myself for
 a time.       Eventually he came to the same conclusion, but
 with an amount of hesitation and difficulty which showed me
 what an important element practice is in these observations.
     26.  I  then started these observations with the mistuned
 twelfth, proceeding in the same way. I seemed to have the
 same difficulty as before in seizing the phenomenon; and when
 I  eventually decided that these beats were also on the lower note,
 it was not in pursuance of any preconceived conclusion; for
 1 had no idea at that time of the explanation       I now give, and
 certainly none of the presence of the second difference-tone,
 or its identity with one of König's beat-notes.
     27. Having got so far,      I  found the remaining verifica
 tion, of the beats of the mistuned double octave, somewhat
 easier.    These are also on the lower note when they are
            I  have never heard the beats of a mistuned conso

 nance with any widerinterval, with the notes      I  employ, as clear
  and unmistakable      phenomena.      Such beats   may be discern
  ible by more acute ears, or with notes of a more powerful
  quality, as they were discerned by König.        But in such cases
   .
  it will be incumbent on the observer to purge the beats from
       suspicion of containing the beats of
    One.
                                                           as
     28. Mr. Parratt subsequently convinced himself, as before,
                                                               I have
  that the beats of the twelfth and double octave were all heard
  on the lower notes.     I endeavoured, as far as possible, to make
  his observations independent by avoiding communicating my
  conclusions to him beforehand.
     29. The elimination of the beats of the harmonics depends
  on the following considerations. The notes employed were
  examined, with and without resonators, as to the presence of
  harmonics. These, so far as they are objective, are readily

 428           Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on the Beats
detected with resonators.     The beats of the harmonics, where
they existed objectively, were also examined with resonators.
After a little practice the sound of these beats became familiar
enough to prevent their being confused with the beats of the
low notes, and the two sets of beats could be observed inde
pendently.
   30. The only harmonic that exists in these notes in sensible
intensity is the twelfth; and this does not appear to originate
in the same manner as the principal note. It is heard sepa
rately, as it were, and as if it had an independent origin.                                    It
seems probable that it arises in connexion with the move—
ments of the air about the mouth-piece, and not by resonance
in the cavity of the bottle, like the principal note. At all
events, whatever the cause may be, the effect is that the pre
sence of this note is readily distinguished and allowed for,
and there is no risk of        its
                            being mixed      with the restupthe                           of
phenomenon.
   31. The notes employed are        moderate strength.
                                      of                        seems                It

   The beats in question were only heard in the first case.
   33. In the few experiments hitherto made with notes of
higher pitch, the beats of mistuned consonances of the form
h: 1 were not heard when the beats of the harmonics were
eliminated, unless the power of the notes was very greatly   in
creased.   In this region, however, König’s own observations
are very  full and complete.
   34. We notice at once the decrease in the range within which
the phenomena are heard as we rise in the scale. This is at
once accounted for on the hypothesis of transformation, by the
consideration that the displacements to which the higher notes
give rise are much smaller than those of the lower notes.     If
we knew the law of the decrease, we might obtain a relation
between the coefficients of the different terms in the expres
sion for the character of the transforming mechanism.     König
has  attempted  to formulate a law of decrease;          I
                                                and have done
so on a previous occasion; but this part of the subject is as
yet too hypothetical to admit of satisfactory treatment.

   35. On beginning work endeavoured, in the first instance,
to ascertain what evidence resonators are capabable of fur
nishing as to the nature of binary combinations. There are a
few points connected with their use which require attention.
   36. I  have always found difficulty in getting results of a
definite character with resonators, whether applied directly to
one ear in the manner described by Helmholtz, or connected
with one ear by means of a flexible tube, as practised by others.
There are three difficulties which occur: (1) pressing the tube
or orifice into the ear is apt to close the inner passage of that
organ; (2) if the tube or orifice is applied lightly, it does not
completely occupy the passage, and external sound comes past
it into the ear; and (3) it is impossible so to stop the unused
ear as to prevent the external impressions from arriving there
and causing confusion.
   37. The method       I
                        ultimately adopted was as follows:—A
copper tube of 4 inch diameter was bent into a semicircle, the
diameter of which was nearly 8 inches. At the middle of the
tube, and at right angles to     its
                                  plane, another copper tube was
   Phil. Mag. S.   5.Wol. 11. No. 70. June 1881.          2I

430          Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on the Beats
inserted, 2 inches long, which tapered down to an orifice # inch
in diameter; this served to communicate with the interior of
a resonator by means of a small flexible tube. The extremi
ties of the semicircle were turned inwards and upwards; and
into them two brass tubes were inserted, # inch long and , inch
 in internal diameter, screwed on the outside.      Over each of
 these was fitted a brass tube, screwed inside, carrying an ivory
 nipple, such as is used for ear-trumpets.        I
                                                generally covered
             with a couple of thicknesses of thin india-rubber
  ºnipple
 tube.
    38. When used, the semicircle is passed under the chin with
                  .
the resonator-attachment projecting in front. The nipples are
                                              kºi
at first screwed back as far as possible, brought opposite the
orifices of the ears, and then screwed
             They             gradually
                                                        until they enter
the ears.           are then             advanced until the passages
are closed to external sounds.          Something      depends on the
way the tube is held. With practice it is possible to hold it
so that the passages are closed to external sounds without
screwing the
                          in very tight. When they are screwed
very tight, it is rather unpleasant, and even painful.            But it
is necessary constantly to be on one's guard against being
      *
deceived by an occasional entrance of external sounds if the
nipples are not quite tight.        This instrument was made for
me some time        ago  by  Mr. Walters of Moorgate Street; it
has              been described (Proc. Mus. Assoc. 1879–80,
p. 18).
    39. The resonators      I employ are bottles fitted with corks
having apertures of various sizes.            Isometimes tune them
with   water,   in the same    way   as the  bottle-notes;    sometimes
I  insert tubes into the apertures to lower the pitch. A bit of
small glass tubing passed through the cork is connected by an
india-rubber tube with the above-described ear-piece.
    40. By means of these arrangements                 I
                                                       some time ago
examined the nature of the        ordinary  first difference-tone,   and
convinced myself that it is not capable of exciting a resonator
 (l.c. p. 20). This conclusion has also been arrived at by
others".      In short, the difference-tone of Helmholtz, or first
beat-note of König, as ordinarily heard, is not objective in                its
character.   It      therefore subjective.
                      is                        (See Helmholtz, Ton

 sounds; otherwise the external notes will penetrate through,
the difference-tone will appear, and the completeness            the cut

                 of Consonances of the Form h                  : 1.              431
    41. When beginning the regular course of experiments
according to the general outline of König's work,              was           I
careful, in the first instance, to examine the various masses of
sound presented, with resonators arranged as above indicated.
In examining, for instance, the intervals made by the note C
with the various notes of the octave above it (up to c), first               I
fixed the resonator at some one pitch, and then ran the mo
vable note up through the octave.       Then, as this did not seem
                                      I
a good process for analysis, set the mistuned octave beating,
or any other combination it was desired to examine, and ran
the pitch of the resonator up and down with water to see if
anything could be detected. And here came across an ob     I
servation that puzzled me for some time.
    42. Suppose the mistuned octave C : c was sounding, and
I  examined the lower note with the resonator: sometimes it
appeared loud and steady, at other times as if beating power
fully.    On removing the resonator-attachment from the ear,
the lower note was always heard to beat powerfully.            The
explanation was simple. When the nipples of the resonator
attachment fitted tightly into the ears, nothing reached the
ear but the uniform vibrations of the resonator sounding C.
 But if there was the slightest, looseness between the nipple
and the passage of either ear, the second note (c) of the com
bination got in, and gave rise to the subjective difference
tone (first beat-note of König), by interference of which with
the C  I   explain the beats on that note. These beats are there
fore   subjective.
    43. A considerable number of combinations, including ex
 amples of the principal forms of beat, rattle, or roll, were
 examined in this way; and when the precautions above indi
 cated were attended       to,
                             the results were         casesin nega
                                                                all         to
 tive the objective existence         of
                                     forms all            of
                                              beats, and beat-notes
or   difference-tones,   except the beats which arise from the
 interference   of  approximate unisons, which beats arise from
 both notes     actingon   the resonator simultaneously.    This                   of
 course includes the beats produced by objective harmonics.

434          Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on the Beats
of beats per second.      Then the mistuned octave is n :  2n+m;
the mistuned twelfth is n : 3n+m; and so on.
   49. Beats of the mistuned octave,
                              n: 2n+m.
Number of beats = m.
   m variations of intensity of the lower note (n) are produced
 by interference of notes n and n-Em; and n+m is the first
 combination-tone (difference-tone of form p-q), of the        pri
maries n and 2n+m.
   This rests chiefly on the observation that the beats, when
the octave harmonic is eliminated, consistentirely of variations
 of intensity of the lower note.
   The existence of the first combination-tone in question
 (p—q) is well known. . It is easily demonstrated in the neigh
bouring case of intervals not far removed from the fifth, when
the beats of the first two combination-tones are specially pro
minent (secondary beats of König).
   50. Beats of the mistuned twelfth,
                             n: 3n+m,
Number of beats = m.
   m variations of intensity of the lower note (n) are produced
by interference of notes n and n+m. And n+m is the second
combination-tone (difference-tone of form 2p–g) of the pri
maries n and    3n+ m.                *  *  *
   This rests also chiefly on the observation that the beats,
when    the third partials are eliminated, consist entirely of
variations of intensity of the lower note.
   The existence of the second combination-tone in question
(2p–q) is demonstrated in many cases by König. It is easily
heard in the case of intervals near the octave high in the
scale.   It is also easily detected by the secondary beats which
it forms with the first combination-tone in the case of inter
vals near the fifth–also less easily by the secondary beats
which it forms with the third combination-tone in intervals
near 2:5, at which point the second and third combination
tones coincide.
   51.  Beats  of the mistuned fifteenth or double octave,
                             n:4n+m.
Number of beats = m.
   m variations of intensity of the lower note (n) are produced
by interference of notes n and n+m. And n + m is the third
combination-tone (difference-tone of form 3p–4) of the pri
maries n and    4n+m.
   This rests also chiefly on the observation that the beats, when

the fourth partials are eliminated, consistentirely of variations
of intensity of the lower note.
    The existence of the third combination-tone in question
(3p–4) is demonstrated in many cases by König. It is heard
not so easily as the lower combination-tones, in the case of
intervals near the twelfth high in the scale.       It is also less
easily detected by the secondary beats which it forms with
the second combination-tone in the case of intervals near
 2 : 5, at which point the second and third combination-tones
coincide—also much less easily by the secondary beats which
it forms with the fourth combination-tone in the case of inter
vals near 2:7, at which point the third and fourth combination
 tones coincide.
    52. Beats of the mistuned tierce (two octaves and a major
third),
                                       n:   5n-Em.
   These beats are much less easily detected in pure notes of the
ordinary strength than any of #. foregoing. They are re
corded by König; but              I
                           have never heard them clearly.     As
it is certain that König’s notes were not perfectly pure, and
he does not analyze the beats, we cannot tell whether the
variations of the lower note were produced in his experi
ments.        If
             they were, they are to be accounted for in a similar
manner.
   Number of beats = m.
   m variations of intensity of lower note (n) are produced b
interference of notes n and n+m. And n-Em is the fourt
combination-tone (difference-tone of form 4p–4) of the pri
maries n and 5n-Em.
   The existence of the fourth combination-tone in question
(4p–4) is demonstrated directly by König in the case of
intervals near the double octave c’” :                    cy.

direct and palpable evidence of beats of mistuned consonances
higher than 1:4, or of the existence of combination-tones
higher than the third (3p–4) in recognizable intensity.             Up
to this   point the  phenomena    are   quite  clear;  and there is no

   When the expression for the relationship contains a change
of sign in the index, it may in certain cases be equivalent to
a relationship of a lower order; but when the index does not
contain a change of sign, the relationship cannot be equivalent
to one of a lower order.      The third column contains the
general meaning, and the fourth column the particular mean
ing when the relationship is supposed irreducible. The first
reducible relationships are cº- and e-'", which may reduce
to 1. The relationship cº-" may reduce to c ; cº-" may reduce
to cº-", which we have seen may further reduce to 1. Con
sider the relationship cº-"; the reducible forms are cº-º-º-º,
c(*-*)-(*-*), and so on, until one of the numbers is reduced
to 0. Hence a relationship of an odd order can reduce only
to one of an odd order, and a relationship of an even order
only to one of an even order.
    t is not difficult to conceive how this table of relationships
(fully developed) may be useful to legislators in a case where
an exact and comprehensive view of relationships is required,
as, for example, in making a consistent and logical alteration
of the laws of marriage. How many are the ways in which
questions of comparative nearness of relationship arise, and
how important to have a simple and ready means of settling
them             If
             this table does not classify relationships according
to their nearness, it at least provides the means for such a
classification. The principles which have to be settled are—
Supposing the distance of c to be measured as 1, what ought
to be the value assigned to cº-", and what the value to c-1412
The former of these makes a relationship collateral, and the
latter makes a relationship one of affinity. According to the
method of reckoning degrees adopted by the Greek Church
(which is very elaborate) cº-" is reckoned 2, and c-141 is
reckoned 0.
   These general relationships are broken up into more specific
relationships by the introduction of symbols to denote sex.

any man A who are also children of any niece or daughter of
the man     A are  none.

as  follows:—
    I.   For the direct line,

where p may be any number.            This means that the children

    II. For the collateral line,
                  Xc,. c2(cº-  + cº- + cº-º), A=0.
This expresses that the children of any man               A  must not be
the children of any niece, sister, or aunt of A.
    III.   For the direct line with one affinity,
           Sc.. c.4(cº-c-º)e-tº-c-º'(cº-c-º)}.A=0.
This     means that the children of any man A must not             be the
children of    any  female descendant or ancestress of           any wife
of A, nor the children of any wife of any descendant or an
cestor    of A.

Xen    - c,4(cº- + clil +cº-º)e-1- +c-1+1(cº- + clº-l +cº-")},A=0.
This means that the children of any man A must not be the

children of any wife of any nephew, brother, or uncle of A.

    As the result of my investigations, am led to consider
the Analysis of Relationships a special branch of the Algebra
 of Logic, that the processes of that method as described in m
 work “Algebra of Logic’, apply to this subject, and that we
have special laws in addition, such as those mentioned above.
 In 1879 Dr. Halsted expressed his opinion” that little
 cosmos had not yet been brought out of the chaos of Rela

  After the electric energy has done enough work on the
analyzer for    the action to be visible, time is seen to exert no
influence in    determining the magnitudes of the distributions.
Thus in 6       minutes and 60 minutes respectively, identical
distributions    were recorded by similar analyzers, other cir
cumstances     being   the same.     But the magnitudes of the dis
tributions registered by an analyzer of given dimensions vary
with every condition which may be supposed to alter the che
mical or physical state of the electrolytic medium, as tempe
rature, proportion of water, and electric quantity.
   When at ordinary temperatures the analyzer is placed with
its length perpendicular              to

determining with ease and precision, first, physical differences
in parts of an electrolytic field; and, secondly, the direction in
which the energy is being transmitted relatively to either side

     II.Demonstration of the Direction in Electrolytic Fields.                                                        –

It follows from the generally received views of electric                                                           con
duction that, in every part of a homogeneous electrolytic field,
the energy is transmitted perpendicularly to the electrodes.
The electrochemical           shows, at least, that the direction
in this case is everywhere  identical. Also it follows that, in
certain parts  of non-homogeneous   fields, the direction is                                                       cur
vilinear. A direct experimental proof of differences in direc
tion in a non-homogeneous field was furnished by the analysis
of one of considerable dimensions.             In a line joining the centre
of the electrodes in this          experiment     and in another at right

        LX.       On the Law of Force          between       Electric Currents.
              By H. W. WATson and S. H. BURBURy".
1.         HE laws of mutual action between electric currents, or
           between separate elements of electric currents, have
been   investigated   by Ampère, and, following him, by F. E.
Neumann, Weber, Helmholtz, Clausius, and others. Their
object has been to discover a law of force between the ele
ments which should give results in accordance with facts
established, or supposed to have been established, by experi
ment. Ampère's experimental data are given by Professor
Tait in his work on Quaternions, second edition, p. 250, as
follows, using his own words:—
   “I. Equal and opposite currents in the same conductor
produce equal and opposite effects on other conductors;
whence it follows that an element of one current has no effect
on an element of another which lies in the plane bisecting the
former at right angles.
     “II. The effect of a conductor bent or twisted in any
manner is equivalent to that of a straight one, provided that
the two are traversed by equal currents, and the former nearly
coincides with the latter.
     “III.  No closed circuit can set in motion an element of a
circular conductor about an axis through the centre of the
circle and perpendicular to      plane.  its
    “IV.      In
               similar systems traversed                     by
                                             equal currents the
                      º
forces are equal.”
      To   these canons,       deduced         from experiments              of   Ampère,
may now be            added:–

as the expression for the whole potential energy of a mass of
matter, we appear to obtain the energy only of the mutual
actions of each pair of particles, and not that of each particle
on itself. But if the matter have at every point finite density,
it is easily seen that the above expression gives us the whole
potential.
     In likemanner, if the current u or idw be conceived as
flowing, not through an infinitely thin line, but through a
tube of finite section, so that the density, so to speak, of the

            Radiation of Low Refrangibility through Ebonite.                                       467
 opaque matter.   An exposure of three minutes was given; the
 exposed half of the slit was then closed and the other half
 opened, and a spectrum taken through a solution of bichromate
 of potash <U+017F>o inch thickness. This bichromate was used to
prevent the too energetic action of the more refrangible rays,
which illuminated the prism and would have caused a veil over
the plate.    Half a minute's exposure was given. The plate,
on development, revealed that rays of very low refrangibility
had passed through the ebonite, commencing at W.L. 12,000
and extending as far as W.L. 7500; the point of maximum                                             in
tensity was situated at about 9000. The photographs were on
a small scale, but sufficed to show the absorption of the ebonite.
On the next day we had intended to repeat the experiments
with two or three prisms; but the wind had shifted, and
the solar spectrum was absorbed as far as about 9000,
showing the presence of aqueous vapour. It was therefore
useless to experiment further with the sun as a source of radia
tion; so we used the water of the positive pole of an electric                                           .
light as a source.      It will be seen that the spectrum through
ebonite extends to about W.L. 15,000, and then terminates.
   The next point to determine was as to the quality of the
beam coming through the ebonite.                This we determined as
follows—first by placing a piece of ebonite in contact with
            i.
the photographic plate and throwing an image of the points
on      it,
       and thus getting                  an

electric discharge             ordinary vacuum-tube (of simple cylindrical
                                in

 The number            the stratifications varies not only with the density

   number, however, is always the same, not varying either with the
   nature of the gas or its density, nor with either the dimensions of
   the tube or the position of the electrodes. There are always four
  layers of the kathode light: the first is of a chamois-yellow colour;
  the three outer ones are blue. Like the layers of the positive light,
  those of the negative light expand as the pressure decreases. When,
  at pressures of less than 1 millim., the negative light extends through
  the whole tube and plays upon the opposite wall, it excites there
  phosphorescence, of colour depending on the nature of the glass.
  Thus the German glass commonly used for vacuum-tubes phospho
  resces with green light, the intensity of which increases as the pres
  sure decreases; while at the same time the optical intensity of the
 kathode-light itself decreases until at last the eye can scarcely per

kathode, we have a broad space filled by molecules which are not in
collision with each other. Only when the molecules come into col
lision with each other beyond this space do they become luminous,
so that the space surrounding the kathode is non-luminous.       Obser
vation, however, shows that this space is not non-luminous, but
emits light of a deep blue colour, to produce which the extremely
small quantity of gas present must possess a high emissive power.
Moreover, immediately surrounding the kathode there exists, as
already noted, the first layer of a bright yellow colour.      Further,
Dr. Goldstein observes that molecules thus driven off from the
kathode could only in special cases pursue a rectilinear path, since

(Sitz. Akad. Wien, xlix. 2, p. 229) and by Beetz, using a modifica
tion of the method of compensation (Pogg. Ann. cxlii. p. 581, 1871).
Apparently, however, physicists generally are under the impression
that the diminution in E.M.F., or “polarization” of the cell, thus
produced is practically inappreciable: thus, for instance, within the
last few months a determination of the value of v has been made
in Sir W. Thomson's laboratory by R. Shida, by measuring the
E.M.F. of a gravity Daniell, first, in electrostatic units (no current
being generated), and then in electromagnetic units (a moderately
powerful current being set up); the which method evidently can
 only be applied if the difference in the E.M.F. according as a cur
rent is generated or not is negligible (Brit. Assoc. Reports, 1880,
p. 497). The same kind of remark applies to several other inves
tigations published during the last few years.”
   With reference to the above remark on my paper, have to state    I
that  I knew quite well that the calculation of an E.M.F. may be
vitiated by “polarization” (a well-known phenomenon), but that
when the external resistance is great compared with the internal
resistance of the cell, as was the case in the determination of the
E.M.F. of a Thomson gravity Daniell, described in my paper, the
alteration in the E.M.F. due to “polarization” is so small, if
any thing, as to be negligible.    It would have been better, however,
      I
had not omitted to mention that what             I
                                             really depended upon was
the measurement     (performed   both  electromagnetically  and electro
statically) of the E.M.F. of the cell while the current was actually
   wing through the tangent-galvanometer.         The result confirmed
perfectly the calculation according to “Ohm's law” on the sup
position of constant E.M.F. and constant resistance, which          gave I
in my  paper, and which     I
                            adopted  only  after this confirmation.
     ON   THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CONSERVATION OF ELECTRICITY,
                         BY G. LIPPMANN".
   The quantity of matter and the quantity of energy are not the
only magnitudes which remain constant: the quantity of electricity
enjoys the same property.             If
                                     we consider any (electrical) pheno
menon in its entirety, we perceive that the distribution of the elec
tricity may change, but that the sum of the quantities of free elec
tricity never varies. If the electric charge experiences a positive
variation at certain points, it experiences at other points a negative
variation; and the algebraic sum of all the simultaneous variations of
the charge is always zero.     The sum of the quantities of free electri
city is then constant, since           its                 always equal
                                                                             it of to
                                       total variation         is
zero. This law, which   I      call the principle         of
                                                        the conservation
electricity, extends over       all
                                  the phenomena hitherto studied;

                                                        which the mention
is sufficient.   Thus, in   the case     the sharing
                                           of              charge between

redistribution   as before.     It  the same

ON A NEW FORM OF GALVANOMETER FOR POWERFUL CURRENTS.
By PROFESSOR C. F. BRACKETT, CoLLEGE of NEw JERSEY.
  The very powerful currents produced by large dynamo-machines
are not easily estimated by the appliances usually found in the
physical laboratory.
  The various forms of the electro-dynamometer, the cosine-galva
nometer, and some other special forms of apparatus may of course
be employed with satisfactory results.      None of these instruments
being in the collection at Princeton, it was determined to construct
a galvanometer which should obey the law of tangents and yet not
be so large as to be unwieldy.      In order to do this, recourse was
had to the differential principle.    The construction is as follows:—
   Two stout hoops of copper or brass of different diameters are
very exactly turned in the lathe. They are then each cut open at
one point and joined to each other concentrically, by soldering with
hard solder, between the ends on one side of the cut, a piece of
metal having the same cross section as that of the hoops, and of
suitable length.    At several other points are inserted between the
hoops pieces of hard rubber of proper thickness, which serve to
keep them truly concentric.
   The free ends of the system thus arranged, and set upright on a
proper base-board, are joined to binding-screws.
   It will be seen that the differential action on a needle placed at
the centre, or on the axis of the hoops pasing through their centre,
depends on the different distances of two equal and opposite cur
rents.   It is evident also that the instrument may be used   -
                                                                   as a
simple tangent-galvanometer.
  Thus, if we call the free ends of the hoops A and B respectively,
and the point of juncture C, by joining up a circuit through A and
B we get the differential action; but by joining up through C and
A or B, the action is that of a simple tangent-galvanometer.           r                If
and r' represent   the radii of the outer and inner hoops  respectively,
the ordinary formula becomes
                                       - ——
                                          rr'

for us that a molecular motion of a particular kind produces
the rotation of the fly. That this is the true explanation of the
phenomena has been abundantly proved by the experiments
of Mr. Crookes and others. Now, as the luminiferous aether
is all-pervading, and is therefore present in the exhausted
cases of the radiometers, we ask where does its influence come
in in the phenomenon 2 Does not the acceptance of this
 theory virtually ignore the existence of the aether?                Only one
 way out of the dilemma is left, viz. to say that the aether is
 there, but that it does not affect the motion of the molecules
in the least. Here, as in every other case where                    influence                       its

pressure varies so as to be always less the greater the velo
city,” and the velocity is greatest towards the bright side;
and hence the pressure is greatest towards the blackened side.
Moreover, “atoms immersed in such a current will be dyna
mically acted on;” and in consequence of this action the vane
is pushed on the blackened side. But if the molecules of the
blackened side of the vane are pushed, so also are the residual
molecules of air which are leaving that side in their passage to
the cooler.    Now the essential point in the production of
Crookes's force            is,
                      that the molecules which leave the heater                                      do
 so with greater velocity than those which leave the cooler,

aether  therefore,     exertingby  this dynamical    action, retards and
resists the motion              of
                        these molecules.      We are thus bound                                      to
assume that the cause producing Crookes's force              sufficiently               is
powerful one         overcome the resistance which
                          to                                  offered by             is a

These experiments may therefore      taken    prove that for red        be              to
light the molecules   the crystal are  symmetrically
                                        of             arranged

around two lines in the crystal, while for violet light the ar
rangement is only around one such line. (It does not make any
difference, so far as this is concerned, whether we consider the
aether or the molecules concerned in the transmission of the
light.) Now we are thus brought face to face with one of
two things, viz. either the different vibrations of the two kinds
of light produce differences in the molecular arrangement of
the crystal, or the molecular arrangement itself is different for
red to what it is for violet light.   That a change takes place
in the arrangement of the molecules when the different kinds
of light fall on the crystal is most unlikely; and thus we are
left with the second alternative. The intermolecular aether,
then, must be so constituted in these crystals as to be capable
of vibration for long waves (red light) in one way, and for
short waves (violet light) in another. How is this constraint
 brought about?     We are told by the presence of the mole
cules of mundane substance whose molecules are scattered
about in this acther just as the stars are in space.               It is con
trary to our notions of nature to imagine that the mere pre
sence of the molecules is going to affect the elasticity of the
substance in this complicated manner.
                                                                    If,

                          we must make         slight  aadditional assump
tion, viz. that different groups                  of
                                             molecules are concerned                                    in
the transmission             of
                           different kinds         light. Then we have
                                                             of
that the groups concerned                   in
                                      the transmission         the red waves   of
are   differently  arranged     from   those  which    transmit    the violet.
                                                                                                       i.
Thus   in  the case       theofcrystal   cited we have that the groups
of  molecules   transmitting      the red are symmetrically arranged
around two axes, while those transmitting the violet are
arranged around one axis only.

484                               Mr. E. H. Cook on the
action of the molecules of material bodies upon the aether, an
addition which makes a greater strain upon the imagination.
It is necessary not only to assume that the proacimity of the
aether-particles to those of the crystal causes a difference in
the elasticity of the aether, but also that there is no “abstract
geometrical relation ” between the shape of the crystal and
the axes of elasticity produced by it in the aether. Now,
as it is certain that the arrangement of the molecules of the
crystal in the particular shape gave rise to the axes of elasti
city in the aether, we are shown a body whose shape produces
a certain result, which result bears no relation to the shape
that produced           the imprisonment
                                  If                                    of
                         of it.

the molecules         body   produces

  (d) The molecular refracting-power of the acids of the fatty
             +6, where n is the number of atoms of carbon
series is 7.6n
in the acid.   But if the increase in molecular refracting
power for H, is equal to 2-6, that for H will equal 1-3. Thus
we get a number which gives us the atomic refracting-power of
one atom of H in these compounds. In the same way the
atomic refracting-power of carbon is found to be 5, and that
of oxygen 3. Knowing these numbers, the molecular refract
ing-power of a body of known composition can be calculated.
For example, take ethylic acetate, C, HsO2: by calculation we

By actual experiment d is found to be '8977, n = 1-3715, and
M=88; thus again giving 36-4. These results have been
obtained from the researches of Gladstone and Dale and
Landolt.    Recently the subject has been taken up with
marked success by Brühl (Annalen, vols.                   cc.

the spaces filled                    by
                     the aether are larger than       another, then                       in
we should have that the freedom of the aether             vibrate                                  to              is

refractive powers are different.     Now we know from experi

gravity          of

in some cases.     For example, the specific gravity          allylic                                    of
alcohol    '8709is  0°C., and that

chemical elements united        the same proportions, these mole
                                                      in
cules have the same density. The difference            density must                           in
therefore arise from     difference     the mean distances apart

instituted some       experiments      to determine whether the effect
is to be attributed to heat or to light. He concludes that the
effect is due to the action of light and not to that of heat, and
that the variation of the resistance is proportional rather to
the square root of the intensity of illumination than to the                                              in

deduced.     Dr.Werner Siemens confirmed Lord Rosse's results,
and, in addition, proved that the electrical properties are modi
fied by the temperature at which the selenium has been pro
ducedf.      His experiments lead him to the conclusion that the
effect of the light upon the selenium is to produce a change

 Combination-Tones arising from Terms of Orders higher than
       the first, in the Transforming-structure of the Ear.
57.
      HPºlº                 pointed out the way in which the
                hypothesis of asymmetry in the transmitting
mechanism of the ear gives rise to the combination-tone of
the first order, which he called the difference-tone.        This
                                            i."
asymmetry was represented in his investigation by a term
of the second order in the force called into play by a given
displacement.        Helmholtz further              the tones to
which the existence of terms of the third order gives rise,
and pointed out that tones of the fourth order &c. would give
rise to other combination-tones not further specified.
   58. In specifying those combination-tones which arise from
the terms of the third order, Helmholtz pointed out that one
of them was a combination-tone of the second order “in the
sense indicated by Hallström.”         This is also the sense in
which the expression “combination-tone of the second order”
is used by Helmholtz himself in the text of his work; and it
means    apparently a combination-tone which arises from a
combination-tone or combination-tones of the first order when
combined with any other notes present, or with each other,
according to the law of combination-tones of the first order.
   59. It is clear, however, that the principal combination
tones which arise from the terms of higher orders in the trans
mitting mechanism of the ear, are derived directly from the
primary tones, and are not materially influenced by the second
ary series of tones. This is obvious, on the one hand, since
all the resultant tones, according      the principles
                                       to                  of
                                                           their
origin, are  ofthe nature    small quantities compared with the
                            of
primary tones, and,    on  the other hand, because the tones
derived from the terms   of  higher orders are    fact produced
                                                   in

                   of Consonances of the Form h       : 1.             493
 with the greatest intensity when the tones derived from terms
 of lower orders are weak or evanescent.             This fact has been
 used    by König   as  one  of the  most powerful     objections to the
 theory of combination-tones as hitherto expounded; and
 indeed, the objectionable character of some of the hypothetical
 derivations by combination given by Helmholtz” must have
 struck many readers independently.
     60.  I shall now examine Helmholtz's hypothesis of asym
                                           I
 metry in a little more detail; and think it will appear that
 it leads, by tolerably simple mathematical treatment, to the
 development of the combination-tones of the higher orders
 under the circumstances under which they actually exist, and
independently of the combination-tones of the lower orders.

the nature of springs tending to resist the departure from 0,

any appearances corresponding to pendulum-curves having
the period of the Smith's beat, except in a very small number
of cases, the conditions for which can only be fulfilled by acci
dent; (2) that the increases and diminutions of the maximum
displacement which form what we have called the bows of the
harmonic curves, correspond in duration with the Smith's
beat, but not in the period of the harmonic curves of which
they form part.

(3) that the variations of maximum displacement which are
represented in these figures by the bows of the harmonic
curves, give rise by transformation to pendulum-vibrations
having the same frequency as those variations—these being
the notes which König calls beat-notes, and Helmholtz differ
ence-tones of various orders; and (4) that the actual beats
of mistuned consonances of the form h : 1, as heard by the ear,
are given rise to by the interference of these beat-notes or
difference-tones with the lower note of the combination.

THEbefore
      motives    which we
          us with one eye are the following:—
   1. The outlines of the more distant objects are covered by
those of the nearer, where they meet.    It is this circumstance
which causes the difficulty we have in recognizing the fact
that the image projected by a convex lens or a concave mirror
is nearer to the observer than the lens or the mirror.
     2. The object which throws a projected shadow upon any
surface is situated always before that surface. These first
two motives are very rarely overpowered by any other ones
—as, for instance, by stereoscopic combination. This is easily
demonstrated by Dove's pseudoscope, an instrument contain
ing two rectangular prisms, and showing to each eye a reflected
image inverted from right to left. It produces an inverted
stereoscopic effect if there are no projected shadows, and no
outline covered by the outline of a nearer body.
   3.  Ifthe head is moved to the right or the left, upwards or
downwards, the direction of the eyes remains steady if the
object observed is infinitely distant, but is altered the more the
nearer the object                 is.
                            the head      brought nearer
                                         If                 is the                          to

backwards, the convergence diminishes.
   We may call the peculiarity          the eye producing these

 the incongruence between the degree of convergence and the
 parallax of motion is perceived with great accuracy.
    The easiest way to see them is the following:—Look to a
                                         º
 papered wall, the pattern of which is regularly repeated at
 distances not much greater than the distance between your eyes
 (between 60 and 70 millim.). You know that it is possible
to make your eyes converge either to a nearer or to a more
distant point than the              of the paper; so that in your
binocular field of vision two images get corresponding posi
tion, which do not belong to the same part of the paper, but
to two different copies of the pattern. You see, then, a ste
reoscopic image of the pattern, either more distant and of
greater apparent size, if you diverge your eyes, or nearer and
smaller, if you converge. But the appreciation of the appa
rent distance of this pattern is not very precise.            you                 If
try to bring a pencil to the apparent place of the nearer pat
tern, you will find that the point of convergence is far nearer
than the apparent place of the pattern,

 of the rolled metals might give rise to the action; but this
was  disproved  by the following experiments:—
   Some  crystals of silver prepared by electrolysis were placed
in the open end of a piece of glass tubing slightly constricted,
and then immersed in silver chloride heated in a crucible by
a Bunsen lamp. In about half an hour the crystals were
found to have grown in a net-like mass from their original
position to a point about half an inch higher in the tube.
This experiment was repeated with crystals of silver which
had themselves been deposited from the fused chloride by
means of metallic silver. A similar result was obtained.
   We were then led to the conclusion that the change de
pended upon the unequal heating of different parts of the im
mersed metal, or rather of the salt in which it was immersed.
It is evident that upon the contact theory of voltaic action,
there will be a difference of potential between the metal and
the liquid chloride with which it is in contact; and it is in
accordance with analogy to suppose that this difference of
potential will vary according to the temperature. Now, under
 the conditions of the experiment, it cannot be supposed that
 all parts        of
               the fused chloride                  in
                                            contact with the immersed
metal were always equally heated; and we have therefore the

the deflection.
   In corroboration of the theory above stated, it should be
borne in mind that the chlorides of silver, copper, zinc, and
iron, when fused, are electrolytes. The liquid chloride of tin
is not an electrolyte; and it was found that on immersing tin
in this liquid no deposition of crystals was observed when it
was so arranged that one part of the liquid was kept at the
heat of boiling water and another at the ordinary temperature
for two days; nor was there the least action on a galvanometer
when arrangements were made for testing by that instrument.
   These experiments form a good lecture-table illustration of
the conversion of heat into electricity and chemical force.
They also seem to have a bearing on the theory of voltaic
action, since, from the nature of the substances employed, it
is difficult to imagine that chemical action in any way initiates
the current.                                             -
LXVIII.     Upon the Production of Sound by Radiant Energy.

IN     a paper read before the American Association for the
      Advancement of Science last August,       described certainI
experiments made by Mr. Sumner Tainter and myself which
had resulted in the construction of a “Photophone,” or a
paratus for the production of sound by light f ; and it will be
my object today to describe the progress we have made in the
investigation of photophonic phenomena since the date of this
communication.
   In my Boston paper the discovery was announced that thin
disks of very many different substances emitted sounds when
exposed to the action of a rapidly-interrupted beam of sunlight
The great variety of material used in these experiments led me
to believe that sonorousness under such circumstances would
be found to be a general property of       matter.         all

upon the supposition that the molecular disturbance produced
by the light was chiefly a surface action, and that under the
circumstances of the experiments the vibration had to be trans
mitted through the mass of the substance in order to affect the
ear. It was therefore supposed that, if we could lead to the ear
air that was directly in contact with the illuminated surface,
louder sounds might be obtained, and solid masses be found to
be as sonorous as thin diaphragms. The first experiments made
to verify this hypothesis pointed towards success.     A beam of
sunlight was focused into one end of an open tube, the ear
being placed at the other end.       Upon interrupting the beam,
a  clear, musical tone was   heard,  the pitch of which depended
upon the frequency of the interruption of the light, and the
loudness upon the material composing the tube.
    At this stage our experiments were interrupted, as circum
 stances called me to Europe.
    While in Paris a new form of the experiment occurred to
 my mind, which would not only enable us to investigate the
sounds produced by masses, but would also permit us to test
the more general proposition, that sonorousness, under the      in
fluence of intermittent light, is a property common to all matter.
    The substance to be tested was to be placed in the interior
of a transparent vessel, made of some material which (like
#.      is transparent to light, but practically opaque to sound.
   nder such circumstances the light could get in, but the
sound produced by the vibration of the substance could not
get out. The audible effects could be studied by placing the
ear in communication with the interior of the vessel by means
of a hearing-tube.
    Some preliminary experiments were made in Paris to
test this idea; and the results were so promising that they
were communicated to the French Academy on the 11th of
 October, 1880, in a note read for me by M. Antoine Breguet".
 Shortly afterwards                I
                        wrote to Mr. Tainter, suggesting that he
should carry on the investigation in America, as circumstances
prevented me from doing so myself in Europe. As these ex
periments seem to have formed the common starting-point for
a series of independent researches of the most important
character, carried on simultaneously, in America by Mr.
Tainter, and in Europe by M. Mercadier t, Prof. Tyndallf,

H.                                         I have
    “DEAR MR.         TAINTER,-....                  devised   a method    of
                 sounds by the action of an intermittent beam of
  ight from substances that cannot be obtained in the shape
of thin diaphragms or in the tubular form ; indeed, the method
is specially adapted to testing the generality of the phe
 nomenon we have discovered, as it can be adapted to solids,
liquids, and gases.
     “Place the substance to be experimented with in a glass
 test-tube, connnect a rubber tube with the mouth of the test
 tube, placing the other end of the pipe to the ear. Then
 focus the intermittent beam upon the substance in the tube.
 I  have tried a large number of substances in this way with
 great success, although it is extremely difficult to get a glimpse
 of the sun here, and when it does shine the intensity of the
 light is not to be compared with that to be obtained in
 Washington.           I got splendid effects from crystals of bichro

  repeat these experiments and extend the results,” &c. &c.
      Upon my return to Washington in the early part of January f,
  Mr. Tainter communicated to me the results of the experiments
  he had made in my laboratory during my absence in Europe.
      He had commenced by examining the sonorous properties
  of a vast number of substances enclosed in test-tubes in a
 simple empirical search for loud effects.               He was thus led
 gradually to the discovery that cotton-wool, worsted, silk, and
  fibrous materials generally, produced much louder sounds than
 hard rigid bodies like crystals, or diaphragms such as we had
 hitherto used.
      In order to study the effects under better circumstances, he
  enclosed his materials in a conical cavity in a piece of brass

closed by a flat plate of glass.  A brass tube leading into the
cavity served for connexion with the hearing-tube. When
this conical cavity was stuffed with worsted or other fibrous
materials, the sounds produced were much louder than when
  test-tube was employed.     This form of receiver is shown in
* ure 1.
  4.    Tainter next collected silks and worsteds of different
colours, and speedily found that the darkest shades produced
the best effects.  Black worsted especially gave an extremely
loud sound.
   As white cotton-wool had proved itself equal, if not superior,
to any other white fibrous material before tried, he was anxious
to obtain coloured specimens for comparison.         Not having
any at hand, however, he tried the effect of darkening some
cotton-wool with lampblack. Such a marked reinforcement
of the sound resulted that he was induced to try lampblack
alone.
     About a teaspoonfulof lampblack was placed in a test
tube and exposed to an intermittent beam of sunlight. The
sound produced      was much louder than any heard before.
    Upon smoking a piece of plate-glass, and holding it in the
 intermittent beam with the lampblack surface towards the
 sun, the sound produced was loud enough to be heard, with
 attention, in any part of the room.               With the lampblack
 surface turned from the      sun,  the sound was much feebler.
    Mr. Tainter repeated these experiments for me immediately
upon my return to Washington, so that                              I
                                                      might verify his
 results.
    Upon smoking the interior of the conical cavity shown in
 figure 1, and then exposing it to the intermittent beam, with
                lid  position       shown, the effect was perfectly

 an  ear placed  closely against   the end        the hearing-tube.
    The  sounds,  however,    were   sensibly  louder when we placed
some smoked wire       gauze         in
                                   the  receiver,     illustrated   as

allowed    to come gradually            rest. An extremely feeble

sound produced varied         the most interesting manner. Minor

receiver (B) was also 5 centimetres; and the distance between
the two was 40 metres, or 800 times the diameter of the trans
mitting diaphragm. We were unable to experiment at greater
distances without a heliostat, on account of the difficulty of
keeping the light steadily directed on the receiver. Words
and sentences spoken into the transmitter in a low tone of
voice were audibly reproduced by the lampblack receiver.
   In fig. 3 is shown a mode of interrupting a beam of sunlight
for producing distant effects without the use of lenses. Two
similarly-perforated disks are employed, one of which is set in
rapid rotation, while the other remains stationary. This form
of interrupter is also admirably adapted for work with artificial
light. The receiver illustrated in the drawing consists of a
parabolic reflector, in the focus of which is placed a glass
vessel (A) containing lampblack or other sensitive substance,
and connected with a hearing-tube. The beam of light is inter
rupted by          its
                passage through the two slotted disks shown                                       at

influence the intensity                  of
                               the sonorous effects.      The loudest
sounds are produced from substances            loose, porous, spongy
                                                            in   a
condition, and from those that have the darkest         most absorbent        or
colours.

duced are cotton-wool, worsted, fibrous materials generally,
cork, sponge, platinum and other metals           spongy condition,in a
and   lampblack.
    The loud sounds produced from such substances may perhaps
 be  explained      the following manner.

516            Prof. A. G. Bell on the Production of
and consequently expand, causing a contraction of the air
spaces or pores among them.
    Under these circumstances a pulse of air should be expelled,
just as we would squeeze out water from a sponge.
    The force with which the air is expelled must be greatly
increased by the expansion of the air itself, due to contact
with the heated particles of lampblack. When the light is
 cut off, the converse process takes place.        The lampblack
particles cool and contract, thus enlarging the air-spaces
among them, and the enclosed air also becomes cool.        Under
these circumstances a partial vacuum should be formed among
the particles, and the outside air would then be absorbed, as
water is by a sponge when the pressure of the hand is removed.
    I  imagine that in some such manner as this a wave of con
 densation is started in the atmosphere each time a beam of sun
light falls upon the lampblack, and a wave of rarefaction is ori
ginated when the light is cut off. We can thus understand how
 it is that a substance like lampblack produces intense sonorous
vibrations in the surrounding air, while at the same time it com
municates a very feeble vibration to the diaphragm or solid bed
wpon which it rests.
    This curious fact was independently observed in England
by Mr. Preece; and it led him to question whether, in our ex
periments with thin diaphragms, the sound heard was due to
the vibration of the disk, or (as Prof. Hughes had suggested)
to the expansion and contraction of the air in contact with
the disk confined in the cavity behind the diaphragm.       In his
 º";     read before the    Royal  Society  on the 10th of
    r. Preece describes experiments from which he claims to
                                                           March,
have proved that the effects are wholly due to the vibrations
 of the confined air, and that the disks do not vibrate at all.
    I  shall briefly state my reasons for disagreeing with him in
 this conclusion.
    1. When an intermittent beam of sunlight is focused upon
a sheet of hard rubber or other material, a musical tone can
be heard, not only by placing the ear immediately behind the
part receiving the beam, but by placing it against any portion
of the sheet, even though this may be a foot or more from the
place acted upon by the light.
    2. When the beam is thrown upon the diaphragm of a
“Blake transmitter,” a loud musical tone is produced by a
telephone connected in the same galvanic circuit with the
carbon button (A), fig. 4. Good effects are also produced
when the carbon button (A) forms, with the battery (B), a
portion of the primary circuit of an induction-coil, the tele
phone (C) being placed in the secondary circuit.

                   Sound by Radiant Energy.                       517
   In   these cases, the wooden box and mouth-piece of the
transmitter should be removed, so that no air-cavities may be
left on either side of the diaphragm.
   It is evident, therefore, that in the case of thin disks a real
vibration of the diaphragm is caused by the action of the inter
mittent beam, independently of any expansion and contraction
of the air confined in the cavity behind the diaphragm.
   Lord Rayleigh has shown mathematically that a to-and-fro
vibration, of sufficient amplitude to produce an audible sound,
would result from a periodical communication and abstraction
of heat; and he says:—“We may conclude,             I  think, that
there is at presemt no reason for discarding the obvious ex
planation that the sounds in question are due to the bending
of the plates under unequal heating ” (“Nature, xxiii.
p. 274).     Mr. Preece, however, seeks to prove that the
sonorous effects cannot be explained upon this supposition ;
but his experimental proof is inadequate to support his con
clusion. Mr. Preece expected that if Lord Rayleigh's ex
planation was correct, the expansion and contraction of a thin
 strip under the influence of an intermittent beam could be
 caused to open and close a galvanic circuit so as to produce a
 musical tone from a telephone in the circuit.     But this was
 an inadequate way to test the point at issue;        for Lord
 Rayleigh has shown (Proc. of Roy. Soc. 1877) that an
audible sound can be produced by a vibration whose ampli
tude is less than a ten-millionth of a centimetre; and cer
tainly such a vibration as that would not have sufficed to
operate a “make-and-break contact” like that used by Mr.
Preece. The negative results obtained by him cannot, there
fore, be considered conclusive.
    The following experiments (devised by Mr. Tainter) have
given results decidedly more favourable to the theory of Lord
Rayleigh than to that of Mr. Preece:–
    i. A strip (A) similar to that used in Mr. Preece's experi
ment was attached firmly to the centre of an iron diaphragm
 (B), as shown in figure 5, and was then pulled taut at right
angles to the plane of the diaphragm. When the intermit
tent beam was focused upon the strip (A), a clear musical
tone could be heard by applying the ear to the hearing-tube
( C).
   hi.  seemed to indicate a rapid ea<U+017F>pansion   and contraction    of

tended the inquiry to a number of other gaseous bodies, ob
taining in every case similar results to those noted in the
memoirs referred to.
   The vapours of the following substances were found to be
highly sonorous in the intermittent beam         water vapour,
coal-gas, sulphuric ether, alcohol, ammonia, amylene, ethyl
                                                                       –
bromide, diethylamine, mercury, iodine, and peroxide of
nitrogen. The loudest sounds were obtained from iodine and
peroxide of nitrogen.
  I  have now shown that sounds are produced by the direct
action of intermittent sunlight from substances in every physi
cal condition (solid, liquid, and gaseous); and the probability
is therefore very greatly increased that sonorousness under
such circumstances will be found to be a universal property
of matter.
      Upon Substitutes          for Selenium in Electrical                    Receivers.
   At the time of my communication to the American Asso
ciation, the loudest effects obtained were produced by the use
of selenium, arranged in a cell of suitable construction, and
placed in a galvanic circuit with a telephone.         Upon allowing
an intermittent beam of      sunlight   to fall upon  the selenium, a
musical tone of great intensity was produced from the tele
phone connected with              it.

  is more or less obstructed by the vibration of the opaque

                      Sound by Radiant Energy.                   525
    Upon the Nature of the Rays that produce Sonorous Effects
                        in Different Substances.
     In  my paper read before the American Association last
                                      I
 August, and in the present paper, have used the word “light”
  in its usual rather than its scientific sense; and   I   have not
 hitherto   attempted  to discriminate the effects produced   by the
 different constituents of   ordinary light—the  thermal, luminous,
 and actinic rays.     I  find, however, that the adoption of the
 word “photophone” by Mr. Tainter and myself has led to the
 assumption that we believed the audible effects discovered by
 us to be due entirely to the action of luminous rays. The
                                    º
 meaning we have uniformly attached to the words “photo
 phone” and “light” will be obvious from the following pas
 sage, quoted from my Boston              :—
    “Although effects are produced as above shown by forms of
 radiant energy which are invisible, we have named the appa
ratus for the production and reproduction of sound in this way
 the ‘photophone,’ because an ordinary beam of light contains
 the rays which are operative.”
    To avoid in future any misunderstandings upon this point,
we have decided to adopt the term “radiophone,” proposed by
 M. Mercadier, as a general term signifying an apparatus for
the production of sound by any form of radiant energy, limit
ing the words thermophone, photophone, and actinophone to
apparatus for the production of sound by thermal, luminous
or actinic rays respectively.
    M. Mercadier, in the course of his researches in radiophony,
passed an intermittent beam from an electric lamp through
sº
a prism, and then examined the audible effects produced in
             parts of the spectrum (Comptes Rendus, Dec. 6th,
1880).
    We have repeated this experiment, using the sun as our
source of radiation, and have obtained results somewhat dif
ferent from those noted by M. Mercadier.
    (1) A beam of sunlight was reflected from a heliostat (A,
fig. 12) through an achromatic lens (B), so as to form an image
of the sun upon the slit (C).
    The beam then passed through another achromatic lens (D)
and through a bisulphide-of-carbon prism (E), forming a spec
trum of great intensity, which, when focused upon a screen,
was found to be sufficiently pure to show the principal absorp
§
tion-lines of the solar spectrum.
    The disk interrupter (F) was then turned with sufficient ra
         to produce from five to six hundred interruptions of the
 ight per second, and the spectrum was explored with the

 526                 Prof. A. G. Bell on                 the    Production          of
 receiver(G), which was so arranged that the lampblack surface
 exposed was limited by a slit, as shown.
     nder these circumstances sounds were obtained in every
  part of the visible spectrum, excepting the extreme half of the
  violet, as well as in the ultra-red. A continuous increase in
  the loudness of the sound was observed upon moving the re
  ceiver (G) gradually from the violet into the ultra-red. The
  point of maximum sound lay very far out in the ultra-red. Be
|
  yond this point the sound began to decrease, and then stopped
  so suddenly that a very slight motion of the receiver (G) made
  all the difference between almost maximum sound and complete
 silence.
    (2) The lampblacked wire gauze was then removed, and
  the interior           of
                the receiver (G) was filled with red worsted.
                                                                                                             be in re

  the green,     that part
                      at   where the red worsted appeared                                               to
  black. On either side      this point the sound gradually died
                                            of
  away, becoming inaudible         the one side     on

bands.      Of course, the ear cannot for one moment compete
with the eye in the examination of the visible part of the spec
trum ; but in the invisible part beyond the red, where the eye
is useless, the ear is invaluable. In working in this region of
the spectrum, lampblack alone may be used in the spectro
phonic receiver. Indeed the sounds produced by this sub
stance in the ultra-red are so well-marked as to constitute
our instrument a most reliable and convenient substitute for
the thermopile.       A few experiments that have been made
may be interesting.                     -
     (1) The interrupted beam was filtered through a saturated
solution of alum.
     Result. The range of audibility in the ultra-red was slightly
 reduced by the absorption of a narrow band of the rays of
 lowest refrangibility.     The sounds in the visible part of the
 spectrum seemed to be unaffected.
     (2) A thin sheet of hard rubber was interposed in the path
 of the beam.
     Result. Well-marked sounds in every part of the ultra-red.
 No sounds in the visible part of the spectrum, excepting the
 extreme    half of the red.
     These experiments reveal the cause of the curious fact al
 luded to in my paper read before the American Association
 last August—that sounds were heard from selenium when the
 beam was filtered through both hard rubber and alum at the
  same time.     (See table of results in fig. 14.)
      (3) A solution of ammonia-sulphate of copper was tried.
     Result. When placed in the path of the beam the spectrum
  disappeared, with the exception of the blue and violet end. To
  the eye the spectrum was thus reduced to a single broad band
 of blue-violet light. To the ear, however, the spectrum re
  vealed itself as two bands of sound with a broad space of
  silence between.     The invisible rays transmitted constituted
  a narrow band just outside the red.
      I       I
        think have said enough to convince you of the value of
  this new method of examination; but         I do not wish you to
  understand that we look upon our results as by any means
  complete. It is often more interesting to observe the first
  totterings of a child than to watch the firm tread of a full
                      I
  grown man; and feel that our first footsteps in this new field
  of science may have more of interest to you than the fuller
  results of mature research.   This must be my excuse for having
  dwelt so long upon the details of incomplete experiments.
      I recognize the fact that the spectrophone must ever remain
  a mere adjunct to the spectroscope; but I anticipate that it has
  a wide and independent field of usefulness in the investigation
  of absorption-spectra in the ultra-red.

       BROWNE'S letter of last month scarcely calls for a
 M R. reply ; but it may be well, without opening up any
fresh points    of controversy, to indicate the errors in his state

any desire to import personal animus into the controversy.

   Now, my first contention is this, that any one who admits
my, statement of the conservation of energy", and also the
ordinary statement of the equality of action and reaction, is
bound to admit my conclusion.
   And my second contention is that, whether my statement
is identical with that of the “text-books’’ or not, it is a
reasonable and true statement, that it is just as axiomatic as
any other, and that it ought to be accepted.                   -

cussion.
           I
   Now, have pointed out in section 84 of my little book on
Mechanics, and on page 280 of the Phil. Mag. for 1879, that
the two fundamental forms of energy correspond to the two
factors in the product work. A body exerting force pos
sesses energy, and a body moving through space possesses
energy, the first form being            potential, or dynamic, or
static, the second being called kinetic ; but a body is not
doing work unless it is both exerting force and moving through
space ; and in this case it is losing energy and transferring
it to the body upon which the work is being done, the energy
at the same time being always transformed from kinetic to
potential, or vice versá.
   Consider, for instance, the earth and a stone (or any other
“attracting” bodies) supposed at rest in space, and separated
from each other against whatever it be that is called their
mutual attraction. A common mode of stating the condition
of affairs is to state that the stone possesses potential or pos
sible energy, which will become actual when it is allowed to
fall, the sum of the possible and actual energies remaining
constant during the whole time of fall, until, in fact, they are
knocked out of the body by the blow. This, however, is the
very commonest mode of stating the matter ; and           suppose        I
nearly every one will agree that the phrases actual and possible
energy are little better than nonsense, or, at any rate, that
any law of conservation of energy founded upon such notions
must be utterly meaningless.

       *sential               points        on    which  I         wish          to   lay stress are
 these      :—
       1st. That       impossible
                       it    is         have     force without
                                                   to             abod                          a
 which      exerting that force, and also without another body
            is
  on which the force        exerted, and which
                                   is                 exerting     equal    is                  an
 counter force.
    2nd. That          not the force which does work, but the body
                       it    is
 which      exerting
            is          the force that does                        it.
    3rd. That the thing which does the work must possess the
 energy, and, hence, that energy,             existent      all, must
                                                             if                       at                    be
 possessed        bybody.
                       a
    4th. That work          always done
                                   is                         by
                                               one body upon another,
 the second    body    gaining    the  energy   which the first loses;
 whence, since they exert                     on
                                     each other equal opposite forces,
 they must both move together over the same distance, i.e.
 they must touch during the action.
    5th. That this latter argument may             worked with greater be
 ease   conversely,  and instead       proving    of
                                                 that universal contact
 action holds wherever energy              conserved, one may prove
                                                   by
 the conservation          energy of                 is
                                         assuming universal contact
 action.

   The other method consists         exposing   in known volume        a                             of

the amount of change suffered by the lime- or baryta-water.
Sometimes the amount of the insoluble carbonate is weighed,
and sometimes the diminution of alkalinity is noted ; and the
characteristic of this method is that the point to be observed
is the change in the reagent, and not in the volume of the gas.
     In carrying out these measurements of the carbonic acid in
the air the manipulation is of the simplest description. The
air is contained in a large stoppered flask or bottle, the capa
city of which has been measured. The stopper is taken out,
the baryta-water is poured in, and the stopper is replaced.
Then the bottle is shaken up for a sufficient                         of time;     <U+017F>ºft
and ultimately the operator takes the              stopper    out,   and deals
with the carbonate         of  baryta  or  the baryta-water       in  the well
 known manner.
     Now       let    suppose that the chemist had
                     us                                          measure the         to

claims two notelets—xxxv. “On the        application  of Barycentric Per
spective to the Transformation of Structures” (Nov. 1853), xxxvi.
 “Principle of the Equilibrium of Polyhedral Frames” (Feb. 1864).
Naturally in this division we find, xxix. “On the exact Form of
Waves near the Surface of Deep Water,” xxx. “On Plane Water
lines in two Dimensions,” xxxi. “Elementary Demonstrations of Prin
ciples relating to Stream-lines;” but we do not meet with “On Stream
lines” (Phil. Mag. 1865), nor “On the Mathematical Theory of
 Stream-lines” (Phil. Trans. 1871). We have not ventured to take up
 space with any detailed analysis of Rankine's work, as this has been
 already admirably done by Clerk-Maxwell(“Nature, vol.xvii. p. 257),
 Prof. Tait, and Prof. Osborne Reynolds. The editor informs us that
 his aim has been to print “such papers as are most characteristic
 of their author in his capacity of a scientific and mathematical
 inquirer.” He truly remarks that our author was not a popular
 writer; but “all his writings are marked by a power of statement
 so clear and logical, that the reader, even should he fail entirely to
 follow the demonstrations, cannot but be benefited in the attempt
 to master them.”        Rankine takes a place amongst the three
 “mighties” who may be said to have been the creators of the
 science of thermodynamics. “Thomson had the start; [it] was neck
 and neck between Rankine and Clausius.          But, from the practical
 point of view, Rankine was alone. And in this respect these
 papers, as indeed        all
                         his others, have     value both intrinsic and
                                              a                             as

 moir, though somewhat brief, gives          usvery good presentment        of

some distance above the outcrop                of   the   Kirklinton Sandstone.    As,
in    addition,
              the shales             underlying
                                     the St.-Bees Sandstone are
gypseous, both near Carlisle and at Barrowmouth, close to St. Bees
Head, the author classed the (Upper) Gypseous Shales as Permian,
and the Kirklinton Sandstone as Bunter.    Resting unconformably
on the Kirklinton Sandstone, in the district between Carlisle and
Rirklinton, are the Marls seen on the Eden between Stanwix and
Beaumont, and on the Line between Westlinton and Cliff Bridge,
Kirklinton. Their unconformity is shown by the fact that on the
Line they rest on the lower, or red, beds, and between Stanwix and
Beaumont on the upper, or white, beds of the Kirklinton Sandstone.
The Marls have therefore been classed as Keuper. So far as the
evidence goes, they appear to be very thin and to extend but a very
small distance south of the Eden.    Lastly, the Lias appeared to the
author to be unconformable to all the beds below, and to rest
partly on the Gypseous Shales, partly on the Kirklinton Sandstone,
and partly on the Keuper Marls.     Of the existence of Rhaetic beds
there was no evidence, all fossils hitherto found having been de
termined by Mr. Etheridge (our President) to be Lower-Lias forms.
But the Lias-sections are so small and few in number, and the

  material of this, bordering the river-valleys, and at greater eleva
  tions expanding over the higher parts of the plateau and moun
  tains. At Mount It-ga-chuz they are 5270 feet above the sea. The
  author considers that the higher terraces can only be explained by a
  general flooding of the district.      Some of the wide trough-like
 valleys of the plateau contain a silty material which the author
  regards as a glacial mud.
     North of the 54th parallel and west of the Rocky Mountains
 similar evidence of glaciation is obtained; erratics are found in the
  Peace and Athabasca basins. The fjords of British Columbia are
 extremely glaciated, the marls being generally in conformity with
 the local features; terraces are scarce and at low levels.    The Strait
 of Georgia was filled by a glacier which overrode the S.E. part of
 Vancouver's Island; evidence is given to show that this ice came
 from the neighbouring mountainous country.            Queen Charlotte's
 Island shows evidence of local glaciation. Boulder-clays and strati
 fied drifts are found, with occasional arctic shells.
     The author considers that the most probable explanation of the
 phenomena of the whole region is to suppose the former existence
 of a great glacier mass resembling the inland ice of Greenland, and
 that the Glacial period was closed by a general submergence, during
 which the drifts were deposited, and at its close the terraces cut.

     1. “The Upper Greensands and Chloritic Marl of the Isle of
 Wight.” By C. Parkinson, Esq., F.G.S.
    In this paper the author described the Upper Greensand as ex
posed at St. Lawrence and along the Undercliff.        At the base of the
 St.-Lawrence cliff there are hard bands of blue chert from which
 Astaciform Crustacea have been obtained; and quite recently, in a
large boulder of the same material lying on the beach, there were
found the remains of a Chelonian, referred by Prof. Owen to the
family Paludinosa, and named by him Plastremys lata. The pre
sence of these freshwater organisms was thought to imply a connex
ion with the Wealden continent.          The chert-bed, 2 feet thick,
was regarded by the author as marking the boundary between the
Gault and the Greensand. Above it the author described 56 feet of
compact red and yellow sands, of which the first 20 feet are un
fossiliferous, the upper 32 feet show traces of organic remains;
between them there is a fossiliferous zone 4 feet in thickness, con
taining Ammonites inflatus, A. auritus, and species of Panopaea,
Cucullaea, Arca, and Trigonia, and immediately below this a separate
band containing an undetermined species of Ammonite. These sands
are followed by 38 feet of alternate beds of hard chert and coarse
greensands, having at the bottom 6 feet of inferior building-stone,
surmounted by 5 feet of freestone.      The latter contains Ammonites
rostratus, and the cherts various fossils, chiefly bivalves. Clathraria

Lyelli also occurs at this level. Above the greensands come 6 feet of
chloritic marl:—the upper 33 feet fossiliferous, with a base of hard
phosphatic nodules containing crushed specimens of Pecten asper;
the lower 24 feet compact, with darker grains and few fossils. The
author compared the sections of this series given by Capt. Ibbetson
and Dr. Barrois; his own views closely correspond with those of the
latter writer.
   2. “On the Flow of an Ice-sheet, and its Connexion with
Glacial Phenomena.” By Clement Reid, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author considers that the Boulder-clays have been formed
beneath an ice-sheet, and consequently there must have been
formerly a huge mass of ice, which would have to flow 500 miles
on a nearly level surface, and then to ascend a gentle slope for nearly
another 100 miles. He does not think a great piling up of the ice
at the north pole can be assumed to account for this motion. This
he explains by the gradual passage of the earth's heat through the
mass of ice raising the temperature of the whole instead of lique
fying the surface-layer.    As the heat passes upwards it raises the
temperature of a particular layer, causes it to expand, and so to put
a strain upon the layer above, and then to rupture         The broken          it.
part spreads out, reunites by regelation, and then, receiving the heat
from the layer below, again expands, and ruptures the layer next
above.   Thus the movement        from the base upwards, rather than
                                             is
from the surface downwards.
   The author estimates that the ice-sheet     Norfolk was only about
                                                                   in
 400 feet  thick, because   Boulder-clay does not appear above that
level, but only coarse Boulder-gravel;      North Yorkshire extends
                                                            in                            it
up   toabout 900 feet. The author considers that the shell-beds                                             of
Moel Tryfaen were not deposited under water, but thrust          hill by                    up
this advancing ice-sheet.

jars into an air-thermometer suitably arranged.
   Therefore, besides the ordinary external discharge of the jar,
there is another in its interior, which                          I
                                            will call internal, to distin
guish it from the former.      It takes place along the sides of the
condenser where they are destitute of coating; and it is appreciable
by the light and heat which accompany              On measuring the    it.                                        in

     This table shows that the average maximum effect of the astro
 nomical causes involved in perihelion longitude and eccentricity
 never can exceed 5° F. in the northern hemisphere, and barely ex
 ceeds 1°F. in the southern.              At particular localities, where there
 is a great range of annual temperature, the effect may be somewhat
 greater.     For example, at North Grinnell Land the range becomes
  6°5 F. It will be seen how little benefit this would confer upon
  that locality, when it is remembered that the present mean annual
  temperature of North Grinnell Land is 2°42 F. below zero, and
  that by the secular range it could be raised to 0°-21 F. above zero,
  or depressed to 6°29 below zero.
     At Discovery Harbour, Tertiary plant-beds were found by the
  Arctic explorers, which indicate a July temperature greater than
  63°7 F.; the present July temperature of Discovery Harbour is
  37°2 F. above zero, or only five degrees above the freezing-point of
  water. How is this remarkable change in climate to be accounted
                                                        *
  for? Geologists cannot much longer evade answering such ques
  tions as these.
     * By this is meant the temperature of the                  layers of the atmo
