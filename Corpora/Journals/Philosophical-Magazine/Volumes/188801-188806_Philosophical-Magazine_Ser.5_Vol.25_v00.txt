I. On a Method of Discriminating Real from Accidental
   Coincidences between the Lines of different Spectra; with some
   Applications. By E. F. J. LovE, M.A., Demonstrator of

IN investigating problems the solution          of which depends
      on the coincidence of the lines belonging to different
spectra, e.g., in determining the presence of any particular
substance in the Sun’s reversing layer, it is usually considered
sufficient to demonstrate a close agreement between the
wave-lengths of a number of lines in the spectra. That
this method, however, taken by itself, does not suffice to give
us a reliable result was shown by Schüsterf, who demon
strated that, in accordance with the Theory of Probability, a
certain number of coincidences between the lines of two
spectra might be expected to occur, even if the spectra be
quite unrelated; and showed how to calculate the maximum
number of coincidences possible on the assumption that no
relation exists between them. If no greater number than
this is found, the coincidences must be looked upon as
probably accidental. The method as given by Schüster is
employed to determine whether the lines of a spectrum are
harmonically related; but it could obviously be quite as well
applied to examine the relations between two different observed
spectra. It demands, however, a considerable amount of
rather troublesome computation. Further, cases may occur

2      Mr. E. F. J. Love on a Method of Discriminating
in which approximate equality obtains between a great number
of lines in two spectra, one or both of which is so crowded
with lines that the question arises, What difference of wave
length between the lines is admissible as a coincidence?
This difficulty especially meets us when we are dealing with
certain parts of the solar spectrum—especially those obtained
from portions of the sun's surface near to, or including, a
spot; and Schüster’s method gives us no hint towards its
solution.
   While engaged in preparing a report on Grünwald’s” recent
investigations into the relation between wave-length and
specific volume, the present writer was led to a simple method
of comparison, based on the Law of Error. In accordance
with this law, the errors of observation of a single quantity
group themselves about the mean value of the quantity in
such a way that the number of observations in which the
errorS are £ than some small quantity v is greater than the
number in which they lie between a and 2r, this again is
greater than the number between 2x and 3.x, and so on; the
equation between the number of observations and magnitude
of error being, as is well known, of the form
                            y=ae-*.
   Now since the various spectrum-lines of a substance in a
given physical condition are connected by an invariable
relation, it seems allowable to assume that observations of
the several lines in one spectrum may be regarded as different
observations of one phenomenon, viz., that spectrum; as a
consequence it is here assumed that, if the differences of
the wave-lengths of corresponding lines in spectra really due
to the same substance, but determined by different observers,
and under different conditions (e.g., the substance as examined
by one observer being on the earth; and as examined by the
other, on the sun) be compared, they will accord with the
Law of Error.      The method thence derived is as follows:–
The differences between the wave-lengths of the lines com
pared are arranged in groups, each group containing those
observations the errors of which lie within certain narrow
limits. The number of observations in each group is then
plotted as an ordinate of a curve, the average error of the
group being the abscissa. If this curve be then compared
with the curve given by the Law of Error, any serious diver
gence from the form of the latter curve is at once made
manifest. It should, however, be borne in mind that the Law
of Error admits the possibility of errors of every conceivable
      * Astr. Nachr. Bd. 117; Phil. Mag. [5] xxiv. p. 354, 1887.

        Coincidences between the Lines of different Spectra.    3
magnitude, and assumes the number of sources of error to be
practically infinite; as a result we should expect the curves
actually obtained to be steeper if anything than the theoretical
curve in the portion near the y-axis.
   It is obvious that the method can only be applied to spectra
which contain a considerable number of lines, and that
measurements of all the coincidences observed must be in
cluded, otherwise the method will not give a correct result;
it might under different circumstances cause us either to
underrate or overrate the probability in favour of the coinci
dence. On the other hand, in dealing with the solar spectrum,
with the aid of Angström's map, it must be borne in mind
that the map is very incomplete, many lines being omitted;
as a result we must not expect to find all the lines of any
substance in the map, even if these lines exist in the sun.
   We may illustrate the method by means of the curves
shown in figs. 1–5 (Plate I.). Fig. 1 is the Theoretical Curve
 of Error; fig. 2 that actually obtained by comparing the values
 of 21 lines in the arc-spectrum of iron, observed by Angström,
with their values obtained by Cornu; fig. 3 is the curve ob
 tained on comparing Kirchhoff’s measurements of the spark
 spectrum of cerium (27 lines) with those of Thalén. The
agreement in form between these curves is obvious, and,
considering the somewhat small number of lines included,
rather  £          the greater steepness of the two latter curves
 (owing to the finite number of sources of error) is also well
marked. Fig. 4 contains a comparison of the arc-spectra of iron
and nickel (19 lines) between wave-lengths 4850 and 5890;
and fig. 5 a comparison of those of iron and titanium (34 lines)
between the same limits. The divergence of these from fig. 1
is, as we should naturally expect, very marked; so far as
any curves '. be said to represent the results, the best
would be straight lines nearly parallel to the w-axis.
   Having given these instances as illustrations of the degree
of accuracy of the results to be obtained from the method, we
will proceed to examine its bearing on two problems of con
siderable interest: (1) The existence of cerium in the sun;
(2) Professor Grünwald’s recent investigations.
                         Cerium in the Sun.
   The existence of cerium in the sun's reversing layer was
indicated as probable by Professors Liveing and Dewar” in
1882; and in the following year the same observerst pub

4      Mr. E. F. J. Love on a Method of Discriminating
lished a map, extending from F to b, showing among others
the arc-spectrum of cerium, and the spectra of the lines seen
widened in two sun-spots at Greenwich in 1881. The spec
trum of cerium exhibits numerous coincidences with widened
lines, though comparatively few with lines given in Ångström's
map.     On the other hand, Messrs. Hutchins and Holden",
who have re-examined the evidence for the existence of certain
substances in the sun, with the aid of photography, remark,
 “So numerous are the lines [of cerium, molybdenum, ura
 nium, and vanadium] that often on the photographs the total
 space occupied by them is greater than the space not so
 occupied. . . . Evidently coincidences between these and solar
 lines cannot fail to occur as matters of chance and therefore
 prove nothing. One can easily count a hundred or so such
 coincidences without the slightest conviction that the con
 nexion is other than fortuitous.”
    As a complete map of the arc-spectrum of cerium has not
 yet been published, the writer has been obliged to fall back on
 the evidence given by Liveing and Dewar's map, mentioned
 above. It is briefly as follows:—Of the 34 lines included in
 the map 20 coincide with solar lines which are not already
 assigned or possibly assignable to other metals; of these solar
 lines 6 only are represented on Angström’s map, and the whole
 have been observed to be widened, most of them very con
 siderably, in sun-spots, though not all in the same spot. This
 fact by itself considerably strengthens the case for the
 existence of cerium as a constituent of the sun, since it
 demonstrates a connexion between these lines. Let us apply
 the method to these twenty coincidences. The differences
 between the wave-lengths of the cerium and solar lines are
 given in the following table:—
          Between 0-0 and 0.1 Xth metre, 12 coincidences.

 These numbers when plotted give the curve represented in
 fig. 6. This curve closely resembles figs, 1, 2, and 3,
 except in respect of its greater steepness; the latter, so far
 from being an objection, testifies to the fewness of the

       Coincidences between the Lines of different Spectra.     5
sources of error affecting the wave-length measurements.
The evidence afforded by the method appears then to supply
a substantial confirmation to the reality of the coincidences,
so far as the material for investigation goes.
              Professor Grünwald’s Investigations.
   The most important verification of his theory put forward
by Grünwald is that afforded by the close agreement between
the wave-lengths of the lines in the spectrum of water, as
deduced by him from those of the hydrogen spectrum, and
their values as obtained by observation. So far, 58 of the
predicted lines have been observed by Prof. Liveing; and
the remainder occur in a part of the spectrum not yet sub
mitted to examination. The wave-lengths are given in
Grünwald’s” paper; the differences between the observed and
calculated values are given here:—

These when plotted give the curve fig. 7, which agrees almost
exactly with the formula for the Theoretical Curve of Error,
as tested by taking points. On the other hand, four of the
points do not agree so well with the smooth curve as those in
the cases £ examined; and           until further measurements
are obtained, the method only warrants us in asserting that
the balance of probability lies on the side of the reality of the
coincidences.                                -
   The curve shown in fig. 8 is extremely interesting; it is
plotted from the comparison, in Grünwald's paper, between
the spectrum of one of his hypothetical constituents of
hydrogen, termed by him “b,” and the nearest solar lines, as
given in Angström's map. The number of lines included
is 41. The differences are as follows:

Here again two points are very much out; but an over
estimation of "oth of a Xth metre (a quite possible mistake)
in reading off Angström's scale at three different places would
replace these two points in the curve; we may therefore fairly
consider that the method affords support to Grünwald's
hypotheses.
   A curious point in connexion with figs. 7 and 8 lies in the
fact that in both the first experimental ordinate, instead of
being the greatest, is smaller £ the second. Is it possible
that this may indicate a systematic error in Grünwald's cal
culations? £ robability of this seems increased by an
examination of the errors with regard to sign; for, in the
comparison of the hydrogen and water spectra, the average
positive error (obtained by dividing the sum of all the errors
in which the predicted exceeds the observed value by the
number of such errors) is   1:    = 0.6 Xth metre; while the
average negative error is #=0.5 Xth           metre.    Since a
constant arithmetical error is highly improbable, the only
explanation of this seems to be a small systematic difference
between Hasselberg's scale of measurement for the hydrogen
spectrum (from which Grünwald's water lines are obtained
by halving the wave-lengths of the hydrogen-lines) and
Angström's scale. As it would seem to be very difficult
to detect such a difference of scale in any other way, this
example adds another to the purposes to which this method
may be applied.

II. On the Mean Height of the Surface-Elevations, and other
   Quantitative Results of the Contraction of a Solid Globe
   through Cooling; regard being paid to the existence of a level of
   no strain, as lately announced by Mr. T. Mellard Reade and
   by Mr. C. Davison. By Rev. O. FISHER, M.A., F.G.S.*
IN    an article which was published in the ‘Philosophical
      Magazine' for February last, I calculated the mean
height of the elevations '. might have been formed b
the cooling of a solid earth upon the “too highly favourable”
hypothesis that the whole cubical contraction of the crust was
thrown into the vertical dimension, and that each elementary
shell consequently retained its original horizontal extension,
which, rendering it too large to fit its new position due to the
contraction of the matter interior to it, caused the compression
by which that particular shell contributed its share towards
the surface-elevations. Upon summing these, the resulting
mean value appeared to be too small to account for the
existing elevations having been caused by contraction of
the crust through cooling merely.
   Mr. T. Mellard Reade had, however, already pointed out
what was the truer conception of a cooling globe; but at the
time I had not read his bookt.        Afterwards Mr. C. Davison
independently, as I happen to know, arrived at the same
conclusion with Mr. Reade; and in the paper in which
he communicated it to the Royal Society in April of this
  ear he criticised my February article as “losing its force,”
in consequence of the hypothesis not according with the more
true conception. In the ‘Philosophical Magazine’ for No
vember I think I have made it clear that, inasmuch as I had
based an argument upon the effects of contraction being too
small according to a certain hypothesis, my argument could
not, as Mr. Davison supposed, “lose its force” in consequence
of his having offered a better and truer hypothesis, which
led to the conclusion that mine did not make the effects of

  cooled as a solid, and that there has always been within the
  crust a level of no strain, below which the elementary
 spherical shells have tended to be extended, and above it to
 be compressed; and we make the probable (though not
 certain) hypothesis that, below the level of no strain, during
 the process of contraction, the interior sphere remains without
 vacancies—that is, the substance settles together by what
 Mr. Reade calls “compressive extension” and Mr. Davison
 “stretching.” This precludes our applying separately the
 coefficient of contraction to the vertical and horizontal dimen
 sions throughout that portion; but we may so apply it to the
 voluminal only, which is generally applicable.

 his paper on secular cooling", let

           To find the Depth of the Level of no strain.
   The volume of the shell at the depth c is 4tra"div, and it
will contract in the interval dt through
                          E **'.         dt.
   The whole contraction of the sphere interior to this shell
will therefore be                      dv
                    E  *!   r
                              (r—w)” dt dt div.
So that the volume of the sphere interior to this shell will
become, observing that     #   is negative,
             #76-) :     +   E  *[o-y # dt d.c.;
and, neglecting E”, its radius will be

                                                  dt div.
The circumference of the interior sphere will therefore be
diminished in the interval dt by
                   (#| (r—w)2 dw
                    27TE
                                         dt dt dw.
   It is evident that, if the diminution of this circumference is
   ual to the horizontal contraction of the shell next above it,
that shell will neither be compressed nor extended. But the
 horizontal contraction of that shell will be
                        27te(r—w)    '. dt d.c.
Hence the condition that the shell at w is situated at the level
of no strain will be, since E=3e,
               3e       r         dv                 dv
             ...'…] (r—w)”        dt drase(r-t) dt
 It will be observed that the position of this level of no strain
 does not depend on the coefficient of contraction, which will
divide out.
    According as

                                                       dv
so will the shell be compressed, not strained, or extended.

   The value of r given by this equation will be the depth of
the level of no strain below the surface in terms of 2 Vct, or
a, as the unit of length. In order that the left-hand side may
 be positive, we must have

   Putting a at 402832 feet, which corresponds to V=7000°F.
and the present epoch, we find log r = 1.7150379 and
r=51.8845a. This gives as a limita = 0.0287, and the large
factor in the term in (r-t)*.c warns us that a must not be
otherwise than very small.

   Now the property of the level of no strain gives that the
mean contraction of OZo in the interval dt is the same as that
of the circumference at Zo, because, on contracting, the shell
is neither stretched nor compressed.
   Hence, owing to the change in position of that level in the
time dt, OZ, is diminished by mdt; and, moreover, by the
contraction of the radius according to the property just men
tioned, it also diminished by   •(r-mo'      dt.

    In order to fix upon a value for e, the coefficient of con
traction for 1° F., I have reduced the results of some
experiments by Mallet upon large masses of slag run from
the furnace. They give e=0.0000071". The mean of six
results obtained for the contraction of rocks at much lower
temperatures by Mr. Adie was 0.0000057f, and Mr. Mellard
Reade's experiments lead to a like result:... We may there
fore accept 0.000007 with tolerable confidence as being at
any rate large enough.          :   is the temperature-gradient at
present, which may be taken at s'." F. per foot. The
value of a, corresponding to 7000°F. as the temperature
of solidification, is 402832 feet, and r the radius is 20900800
feet. With these numbers our result gives, for the mean
height of all the elevations which would be formed upon a
solid earth by cooling,
                                19 feet.
   The smallness of this result renders it impossible to attribute
the inequalities of the earth’s surface to this cause, even if we
confine our attention to the height of the land above the sea,
for that alone has been reckoned at 900 feetS. It is also to be
observed that, if the level of no strain does not conform to
the varying level of the surface, which it probably does, it
would not pass beneath the floor of the deeper oceans.

level of no strain exceeds the surface-temperature by           b:
degrees only, which, with the high estimate of 7000° for
solidification, gives an excess of 228° at present; so that no
rock can ever have been pressed up from a depth where its
temperature has been much higher than that of boiling
water. Neither can it be replied that it may have been
otherwise in former ages, because the above expression for the
excess varies as the square root of the time and must have
been less hitherto than it is now.
    The very slight changes, either through cooling or com
pression, which the rocks above the level of no strain have
undergone since solidification, render it improbable that
their effects would be observable.       The fact that the rocks now
being compressed were once extended would not have any
effect upon the calculated mean height of the surface-eleva
tions; £ their former compressive extension was at the
cost of their thickness. If, however, the effects were sufficient,
they might be traced petrologically. But it must be re
membered that the thickness of the sedimentary strata must
be in most places greater than the depth of the level of no
strain.
    The property of the level of no strain enables us to calculate
the contraction of the radius of a solid globe, cooling according
to the supposed law; because the mean contraction from the
centre to that level is the same as that of the circumference
there. Therefore the mean contraction of 20 in the interval
dt is                                        -

    It will be noticed that, in the above calculations, no
reference has been made to the numerical value of the con
ductivity, nor to the time elapsed since the surface first
assumed its present temperature. All that has been assumed
is that the present temperature-gradient, expressed by b/a,
is 1/51, which is about the mean result of innumerable
observations; and that the temperature of solidification was
7000°F. These have been sufficient for our purpose. How
ever, the temperature-gradient being known, and the tem
  erature of solidification assumed, there follows a relation
  etween the time and conductivity; and this appears to have
been the original object of Sir William Thomson's investi
gation. If we make use of the value for the conductivity
which he has deduced from certain observations on rocks
in situ (viz. 400), the results just obtained will correspond to
 98 millions of years. But a lower temperature, say 4000°F.,
 seems more probable; in which case the time would be about
 33 millions of years. In that case all our estimates will have
 to be reduced. These depend upon the constant a ; and

It must be admitted, from the general bearing of the fore

of a level of no strain in a solid globe, cooling by conduc
tion, renders more than ever untenable the theory that the
surface-elevations can have been formed by the compression
of the crust of a solid globe caused in that manner. An
inversion of the Horatian line would seem fairly to describe
that theory—

  III. A Note on Valency, especially as defined by Helmholtz.
                By HENRY E. ARMSTRONG, F.R.S.*
     ERY little has been either said or written of late on the
        subject of Valency—not because the topic is admitted
to be exhausted, nor because our views can be regarded as
reposing on a fixed basis of fact, but more I believe on
account of the feeling being almost universally entertained
that little is to be gained by continuing the discussion from
our present standpoint.
    My purpose in this note is to call attention to the extreme
importance of reopening the discussion on account of the
intimate bearing that it has on the work in which the Electro
lysis Committee, jointly appointed by this Section and by
     tion A, are now engaged; and to urge that it is time
that the gage thrown down by Helmholtz in the Faraday
lecture (Chem. Soc. Trans. 1881, p. 277) was uplifted by
chemists.
    We are told by Helmholtz that it is a necessary deduction
from the fundamental law of electrolysis established by
Faraday, that definite, as it were atomic, charges of elec
tricity are associated with the atoms of matter; that, in fact,
a monad bears a single charge, a dyad two, a triad three ;
and that when combination occurs, the charges are still
retained by the atoms, but neutralize each other—“the atoms
cling to their charges, and opposite electric charges cling to
 each other.” I cannot help thinking, however, that Helm
 holtz deprives his statement of much of its force and simplicity
 by adding: “But I do not suppose that other molecular
 forces are excluded, working directly from atom to atom;”
 he is led to do this apparently by being aware of the distinc
 tion which it is usual to draw between atomic and molecular
 compounds. The attempt should at all events be made—and
 in my paper on “Residual Affinity” I have already ventured
 the first step—to include both classes of compounds, mole
 cular as well as atomic, in the discussion; indeed it is some
 what difficult to reconcile the passage above quoted with the
 following statement which occurs previously in the lecture —
 “The law of the conservation of energy requires that the
 electromotive force of every cell must correspond exactly
 with the total amount of chemical forces brought into play,
 not only the mutual affinities of the ions, but also those minor

stituents of the fluid.” The italics are mine. But if the
“minor molecular attractions” contribute to the electro
motive force of the cell, then conversely these also will have
to be overcome in effecting electrolysis, and are as much to
be reckoned as are the “mutual affinities of the ions” |
   It is obvious that if it should prove possible to decide what
number of charges are necessarily associated with any par
ticular atom, the conception of valency will have acquired a
definiteness which cannot possibly be attached to it as long
as the views that have hitherto guided us are adhered to. A
decision must involve the discussion of the question of the
existence of molecular as distinct from atomic compounds.
   To cast the apple of discord without further preface, I
would direct attention to the insufficiency of the evidence on
which it is usual to rely as proof that nitrogen, for example,
is a pentad; nay more, I would assert that this very evidence
should be interpreted as proof that nitrogen is not a pentad.
It is commonly held that the behaviour of the alkyl tetra
substituted derivatives of ammonium is such as to negative
the idea that these are “molecular compounds” of triad
nitrogen, and that it must be assumed that the elements of
the binary compound which are added on to the ammonia
derivative are distributed in the ammonium derivative; for
example, that in the formation of tetramethylammonium
iodide from trimethylamine and methyl iodide, the methyl
and iodine of the iodide part company, and separately attach
themselves to the nitrogen, thus:
            ACH,            CHs         CH,     CH*
          N:NCH,
                     + 1          =      £N&#.
                                          I     CH,
But I contend that the properties of tetramethylammonium
iodide and hydroxide prove that such is not the case: the
iodide, it is well known, can be boiled for hours with the
strongest caustic potash solution without undergoing change;
there is not a single case on record, however, of any haloid
compound other than an       ' compound behaving in this
manner, the chlorides, bromides, and iodides of every element
except carbon are almost at once converted into hydroxides
by such treatment, and a nitrogen iodide would surely be
acted on. The behaviour of the iodine is much more nearly
that of iodine in methyl iodide, and, it may be said, exactly
that of the iodine in iodobenzene ; indeed it would seem that
in the alkyl-ammonium haloid compounds the halogen is

               especially as defined by Helmholtz.              23
always less easily displaced by the action of alkalies than it
is in the parent haloid alkylic compound.
   The remarkable resemblance of the tetra-substituted am
monium hydroxides to potassium hydroxide has led to their
being regarded as in every respect analogous to this latter,
and would appear to preclude the idea that they are molecular
compounds of an alcohol with an ammonium derivative. But
attentive consideration of their properties will suffice, I think,
to show that the apparent discrepancies are not only explic
able, but that they actually support the molecular compound
hypothesis. Thus it might be said to be improbable that
tetramethylammonium         £            should behave as a
powerful base, and have the same heat of neutralization as
potassium hydroxide, if methyl-alcohol were one of its proxi
mate constituents; but it is to be remembered that the salt
which results from the action of an acid on methyl-alcohol is
liable to suffer reconversion into the alcohol by the action of
the water produced in the interchange; also that in many
cases the methyl salt is insoluble in water, or nearly so. The
heat   £          on neutralizing methyl-alcohol therefore falls
far short in amount of that which would be evolved if the
interchange were complete, and if the product were capable
of interacting with water, and perhaps also with itself in the
way that apparently is possible in the case of metallic salts.
In the case of the tetramethylammonium hydroxide, the
action of acids is total as the change is irreversible, or almost
so, under the conditions which obtain during the forma
tion of the salt, just as in the case of the conversion of
potassium hydroxide into a salt; moreover, the product is
easily soluble, even when acids like muriatic are used. Why
the methyl-alcohol, or other methyl derivative, retained in
the ammonium compound behaves so differently as compared
with the unassociated methyl derivative, is a question which,
 for the present, we must be content to put aside unanswered.
 I am also of opinion that in discussing their constitution,
no particular weight can be attached to the mode in which
 the tetralkylic ammonium hydroxides undergo decomposition
 when heated, as the products in some cases are an amine and
 an alcohol, but in  £ an olefine       and water, instead of an
 alcohol; in the case of the phosphonium salts the diversity is
 still greater (Chem. Soc. Proceedings, 1886, p. 164). That
 amines may act as “dehydrating” agents in the manner re
 quired, if the molecular compound hypothesis be adopted,
 appears by no means improbable.
    What is here stated of the tetramethyl compounds is true
  of tetralkylic ammonium haloid compounds generally, in the

24             Mr. H. E. Armstrong on Valency,
sense that they are all less readily acted on by alkalies than are
the parent   #.     haloid compounds; but just as these latter
are more readily attacked by alkalies and other agents the
more complex the alkyl, so are the tetralkyl ammonium
compounds; in no case, however, do they manifest a reac
tivity at all comparable with that of simple metallic or non
metallic haloid compounds—always excepting those of
carbon.
   The argument used above would apply             ''       to the
£" and sulphine compounds; indeed with greater
 Orce.
   In many other respects, the behaviour of nitrogen in
aminic compounds is altogether peculiar and irreconcilable
with the assumption of pentadicity. Thus it is commonly
  ointed out that the basic properties of aniline, for example,
 ecome lessened and ultimately almost annulled by the intro
duction of chlorine or bromine into the phenyl radical; and
that acetamide, C2H8O. NH2, and other similar compounds
formed by the introduction of acid radicals into ammonia are
all but destitute of basic properties; the power to form
ammonium compounds, therefore, is not a simple function of
the nitrogen atom, but is largely dependent on the nature of
the radicals associated with the nitrogen atom.        Other illus
trations are afforded by the hydrazines. Thus phenyl-hydrazine,
C.H. NH. NH2, although it contains two atoms of (triad)
nitrogen, forms with hydrogen chloride the compound
C.H. N2H3. HCl, which crystallizes unchanged from fum
ing muriatic acid, in which, moreover, it is almost in
soluble. Ethyl-hydrazine, however, forms a dichlorhydride,
C2H5. N2H3.2HCl; but on evaporating the aqueous solution
of this salt a monochlorhydride is obtained; and unsymmetric
diethyl-hydrazine, (C2H5)2N. NH2, is a monobase like phenyl
hydrazine.
   Hence it may well be argued that we have no reason to
assume that nitrogen is pentad in the ammonium compounds,
or phosphorus pentad in the phosphonium compounds, or
sulphur tetrad in the sulphine compounds; but that these are
all to be reckoned as molecular compounds.
   What then is the valency of the elements in question? and
what is a molecular compound?
   In answer to the first of these questions, the proposition
may be advanced that gasefiable hydrogen compounds are
the only compounds available for the direct determination of
valency, and that the valency of an element—the number of
unit charges necessarily associated with its atom—is given by
the number of hydrogen atoms combined with the single atom

                 especially as defined by Helmholtz.                  25
of the element in its gasefiable hydride". In cases where
such hydrides are unknown, the determination of valency is
very difficult; it can be but provisionally effected, and only
by most carefully weighing all the evidence relating to the
constitution of the compounds available for discussion.
   But if it be granted, for example, that nitrogen is a triad,
and that iodine is a monad, How are we to explain the fact that
the  ''         compounds of these two elements unite to form
so well characterized a molecular compound as tetramethyl
ammonium iodide? How are such molecular compounds con
stituted? My own view has long been that the nitrogen and
iodine in such a case are both possessed of a certain amount
of residual affinity; and I would define a molecular compound
as one formed by the coalescence of two or more molecules,
unattended by redistribution of the constituent radicals, and
in which the integrant molecules are united by residual affi
nities.     In other words, the unit charge must be capable in
certain cases of directly promoting the association, not merely
of two, but of at least three, atoms. To put this hypothesis
into terms which cannot be misunderstood, let unit valency
Or £ be represented by a unit line, and further be it
supposed that the charge penetrates the atom, then the atom
with its unit charge may be represented thus:
i.e., the unit charge may be held to consist of three portions,
 the buried portion a, and the free portion f--f". I' facts,
as they present themselves to me, also appear to necessitate
 the assumption that, in the case of different elements, the
 charge penetrates the atom; and in the case of some polyad
 atoms, different directions in the atom with varying degrees
of freedomt. The union of two atoms may then be pictured
 aS an   £              of the unit lines. If the atoms are freely
 penetrated by their charges, each atom may tend to move
 out to the end of the line, leaving either no portion, or but a
 very small portion, free; a conception of this order would
    * If this be granted, it follows that the maximum number of charges
 which an atom can carry is four; in other words, that the        £
 maximum valency is attained in the case of carbon.
    + This is practically but a modification of Helmholtz's statement that
 “the phenomena are the same as if equivalents of positive and negative
 electricity were attracted by different atoms, and perhaps also by the
 different values of affinity belonging to the same atom, with different
 force.”

26            Mr. H. E. Armstrong on Valency,
appear to apply in the case of hydrogen, and may be repre
sented thus:
  -e-, -e--e-e
But if the atom be not easily penetrated by its charge, it will
not move out to the end of its line, and the resulting com
pound molecule will possess more or less “residual affinity”;
this conception would appear to apply to the non-metals
£, and to some of the metals; it may be illustrated
thus:
      e-
       H.              -e- - e-e
                           Cl.
   I have thought it permissible to state my views in this
form merely in order to advance the study of molecular
compounds by the introduction of a working hypothesis, an
absolutely artificial mode of expression such as is here adopted
being perhaps pardonable in the absence of any explanation
which may serve to guide us in extending our enquiries as
regards the structure of such compounds, a knowledge of
which is all important to a rational conception of the nature
of chemical change generally. Moreover, I do not hesitate
to affirm that, from the chemical point of view, it is impossible
to adopt the Helmholtz explanation of valency, unless physi
cists are £ to grant the possibility         of the “division”
of the unit charge somewhat in the manner here suggested;
and it is in order to impress this that I have ventured to give
utterance to these speculations.
   To return to the consideration of the compounds previously
referred to, it may be supposed that the nitrogen of trimethyl
amine and the iodine of methyl iodide are possessed of residual
affinity, and hence the two molecules unite to form the
molecular compound tetramethylammonium iodide, which
may be represented thus:—
                 H,C  >
                 H,C–N =+=-CH,
                 H,C
The phosphonium and sulphine iodides may be regarded as
similarly constituted.   It is well known that the ammonium

               especially as defined by Helmholtz.              27
haloid compounds and their analogues are also capable of
forming '' more complex molecular aggregates with the
halogens, &c.; they are therefore to be regarded as possessed
of residual affinity; and that polyad elements, e.g. nitrogen,
phosphorus and sulphur, should still exhibit residual affinity
in such compounds is not surprising in the light of the
hypothesis advocated in this note; but it is scarcely com
patible with the assumption that the halogen in the ammo
nium haloid compounds serves as the bond of union. On the
other hand, if it be assumed, as I think it should be, that the
formation of double metallic chlorides, &c., is the outcome of
the possession of residual affinity by the halogen, the com
  lete analogy which appears to exist between the ammonium
£ compounds and those of the alkali metals would seem
logically to involve the inference that the halogen of the
ammonium compound does serve as the bond of union. I
see but one mode of escape from this conflict of evidence,
and that is to call in question the time-honoured assumption
that the radical ammonium is the true analogue of potassium
and sodium, which, be it remarked, is of necessity subject to
doubt if the hypothesis that the ammonium salts are molecular
compounds be entertained; and evidence which supports the
conclusion that the per-haloid compound is formed by the
 addition of the halogen to the nitrogen (phosphorus or
sulphur) is afforded by the observation that not only haloid
ammonium and sulphine compounds, but also the sulphates
 combine with halogens (Dobbin and Masson, Chem. Soc.
Trans. 1885, p. 56; 1886, p. 846).
    It is now proved by abundant experimental evidence that,
whatever the order in which the radicals A, B, C, D, are
 introduced in forming a tetralkylic ammonium compound
 N(ABCD) X, one and the same end product always results.
 This is commonly regarded as proof, not only that nitrogen
 is pentad, but also that the five affinities of the nitrogen atom
 are of equal value, and it would appear to favour the conclu
 sion that the ammonium salts are in truth “atomic ’’ com
 pounds; but I see no reason why isomeric change should not
 occur at the moment of formation of a molecular compound:
 why the integrant molecules, in fact, should not interchange
     icals. If the statement be confirmed that the compound
 formed from dimethyl sulphide and ethyl iodide is different
 from that obtained on combining methylethyl sulphide and
 methyl iodide (Krüger, Journ. pr. Chem. 1876, xiv. p. 193), it
 will follow, not that sulphur is a tetrad, and that the four
 affinities are of unequal value, but that there is little or no
 tendency for isomeric change to occur in the formation of

28              Mr. H. E. Armstrong on Valency,
 sulphines. The possible occurrence of isomeric change in
 the formation of molecular compounds, however, is a subject
 which certainly deserves careful study at the present time.
    In the case of phosphorus, the existence of the highly
 stable gaseous pentafluoride PF, discovered by Thorpe, is
 undoubtedly regarded by many as final proof of the pentad
 icity of this element; but the existence of compounds such
 as H, F, HFFR, &c., which clearly belong to the class of
 molecular compounds, is an indication of so marked a
 tendency on the part of fluorine to combine with itself, that
 for this reason alone (as Naumann and others have asserted)
 the pentafluoride is by no means necessarily regarded as
an atomic compound. And I would here add that stability
affords no criterion as between atomic and molecular com
pounds, every degree of stability being met with even among
those of the former class.
    An argument in favour of the pentadicity of phosphorus,
 which apparently cannot be disposed of by any explanation
based on conventional considerations, has, however, been
advanced by La Coste and Michaelis (Berichte, 1885, p. 2118),
 who have shown that the compounds obtained from diphenyl
 chlorophosphine, PCl(C6H5), and phenol is not identical with
the  £                     oxide, OP(C6H5)3, obtained by oxi
 dizing triphenyl-phosphine, as it should be if the latter were
a compound of the formula (C6H5)2P. OC5H5; this last cor
responding to the formula Cl, P. OCl which has been
suggested as that of phosphorus oxychloride, and which
appears to derive considerable support from Thorpe's obser
vations on the specific volume of the oxychloride (Chem. Soc.
Trans. 1880, p. 388). It is, however, conceivable that the

   Michaelis and Polis (Berichte, 1887, p. 52) have argued in
the case of bismuth, which also is a member of the nitrogen
group, that the pentadicity of this element is proved by the
existence of the triphenyl dibromide (C6H5)3BiBrs. But the
mere production of such a compound proves nothing so long
as its constitution is undetermined; it at most serves to
strengthen the conviction gained from the general study of
the element, that bismuth is a member of the nitrogen
phosphorus group.
   In other cases also it is possible that undue importance

              especially as defined by Helmholtz.          29
may have been attached to the existence of alkylic compounds
of particular types: thus lead, judging from its general
chemical behaviour, would appear to be a dyad, yet the
existence of the tetrethide Pb(C.H.) is commonly held to be
a proof that it can function as a tetrad. But the properties
of lead are such that I am tempted to suggest that it is one
of the metals in which the “charges” have but a small
degree of freedom; and it is conceivable that the tetrethide
is actually a compound of dyad lead, each charge serving to
bind two ethyl groups, thus:—
                   #--Pg=#
                   H.C.                   C.H.,
The same may be true of tin, although in this case the fact
that we are dealing with an element of the carbon-silicon
family tends to favour the conclusion that it may be a tetrad.
   Also too much importance must not be attached to the
existence of stable volatile chlorine compounds: thus tellu
rium tetrachloride may well be a compound of dyad tellurium,
thus:—
                     Cl
                     Cl      =fe='Cl
Iron, and the other members of the family which boron
heads, in like manner, I feel convinced, are triads even in
their ic compounds: recent vapour-density determinations all
": this conclusion.
    t is even conceivable that chlorine may form closed-chain
compounds, and that a tetrachloride may exist, such as is
represented by the formula:—
   I think it is, especially noteworthy that so many well
characterized and comparatively stable double chlorides exist
formed by the union of chlorides, of which one at least is
per se very unstable; the tin-sulphur chloride SnCl, .2SC),
and the remarkable series of aurous compounds recently de
scribed by Lepetit (Ann. Chim. Phys. 1887, p. 11) may be
cited as examples.
   If my contention in this and previous papers be correct,
that residual affinity thus plays a far more important part
than has hitherto been supposed, and that it must be taken
into account in all discussions on valency, it follows of
 necessity that our views regarding the constitution of the

30      Mr. T. H. Blakesley on a Geometrical Determination
majority of compounds at present rest upon a most uncertain
basis: the constitution of the paraffins, of the benzenes, and
of the haloid compounds and alcohols derived from the hydro
carbons of these series, may be regarded as determined with
a degree of precision almost amounting to certainty; but in
the vast majority of other cases we have as yet no secure
method of arriving at conclusions which in any sense
approach finality. There can be little doubt that in framing
our modern conceptions of valency, we have been too much
influenced by the graphic symbols which have been so widely
made use of.      In the future it will be necessary to attach a
more liberal interpretation to the facts, and it may be hoped
that it will some day be possible also to take into account
differences depending on the relation of the different forms
of matter to the pervading medium.
IV. On a Geometrical Determination of the Conditions of
   Maximum Efficiency in the case of the Transmission of Power
    by means of Alternating Electric Currents. By THOMAS H.
    BLAKESLEY, M.A."
1. This paper        treats the above problem as a particular
         application of the method of representing Combinations
of Electromotive Forces possessing a simple Harmonic Law of
Change, already given by the author more than three years
ago, and detailed in a series of papers published during 1885
in the ‘Electrician.”
    It was then pointed out that, though with two constant
electromotive forces acting in a simple circuit the transmission
efficiency does not exceed the ratio of the smaller to the larger,
yet with alternating electromotive forces [denominated by
their maximum values] the efficiency may exceed this ratio,
owing to the self-induction of the circuit, and to the possibility
of varying the interval of time at which the phases of one
electromotive force may follow the corresponding phases of
the other.
    It is here proposed to show how the particular interval of
time which will give the maximum efficiency may be geome
trically determined, and what the value of that maximum
efficiency is for two given electromotive forces undergoing har
monic repetition in the same given period, in a simple circuit
possessing a known resistance and a known coefficient of self
   * Communicated by the Physical Society: read November 12, 1887.

             of the Conditions of Maximum Efficiency.         31
induction. The phase-interval is then the only independent
variable in the problem, and what its value must be to give
the maximum efficiency of transmission of Power, and what
that efficiency will then be, are the questions to which we
shall have answers from Geometry alone. A short statement
of the general method of representation will make the
particular steps required for these problems perfectly clear.
    2. Let a straight line of fixed length, and situated in the
'       of the paper, undergo uniform rotation in that plane.
    en its projection upon a fixed indefinitely long line also in
that plane will undergo harmonic variation, and may repre
sent any magnitude capable of undergoing such change (e. g.
an electromotive force), the maximum value of this varying
magnitude being represented by the revolving line itself.
The period in which the revolving line makes one complete
revolution is the period of the change. Hence, if we know
the position of the fixed line and of the revolving line at any
instant, we can say in what particular phase the magnitude
undergoing harmonic change is at that instant. For instance,
suppose these lines make 30° with each other, we can say at
once that the magnitude is removed from its maximum value
by an interval of time equal to one twelfth of the period. If
the angle is at the instant increasing, the magnitude has
passed its maximum value that interval of time ago. If the
angle is growing less, the magnitude will attain its maximum
after that interval of time. It is therefore necessary to fix a
positive direction of rotation as representing the positive lapse
of time. [That direction which is opposite to that of the
hands of a watch will here be     £
    3. It follows that when we have two such electromotive
 forces acting in the same circuit, having different maximum
 values but the same Period, since each is represented by the
   rojection of a revolving straight line upon a fixed straight
  ine, the resultant electromotive force at the instant is the
 algebraical sum of the individual projections. And if the two
 revolving lines are laid down as the two sides of a triangle
 taken in order, the rotation being uniform and the same for
 both lines, the lines will remain always inclined at the same
 angle to each other, and the algebraical sum of their projec
 tions is the projection of the third side. Thus, in the matter
 of such electromotive forces, we have a theorem exactly cor
 responding to the triangle of directed quantities.
    4. We may extend this mode of representing such quantities
 so as to form a theorem corresponding to the polygon of
 directed quantities, and cite it thus:

 32      Mr. T. H. Blakesley on a Geometrical Determination
     “If the straight lines AB, BC,                           A.
  CD, ... ST represent the maximum
 values of different electromotive
  forces, and, as to direction, are so                             B
 laid down upon the paper that their
 projections upona fixed straight line                           C
 represent at some point of time the
 instantaneous values of those elec
 tromotive forces, their instanta-                     E.
 neous resultant is the projection of       R(             \
 the simple straight line AT.”                 \            \
     5. If, in any particular case, we          }
 have taken into consideration all             *           /
 the electromotive forces concerned,         £c        --"
 then clearly the line representing               *~
 the resultant corresponds in phase with the instantaneous
 current; and if by scaling or calculation we find the
 value of this resultant in volts, we have only to divide by
 the resistance in ohms to obtain the maximum value of the
 alternating current resulting from all the component electro
 motive forces.     This is true even if one of the electromotive
 forces is that of self-induction. But suppose we have arrived
 at a preliminary resultant by compounding all the electro
 motive forces with the exception of that of self-induction; we
 then require the final resultant, and we obtain it by remem
 bering that it must be at right angles to the electromotive force
 of self-induction; for the electromotive force of self-induction
 must be greatest when the current is passing through zero:
therefore it must have its projection on the fixed line greatest
when that of the final resultant (corresponding with the cur
rent) is zero. Therefore the final resultant and the electro
motive force of self-induction must be to the preliminary
resultant as the two sides of a right-angled triangle including
the right angle, are to the hypothenuse; and as we already
possess the hypotheneuse we have only to determine the ratio
of the sides, and upon which side of the hypotheneuse they
must be placed, in order fully to determine the position and

  triangle, -AB, BC, AC representing respectively the preli
  minary resultant, the electromotive force of self-induction,
  and the final resultant at the maximum values,—it is clear that
  the maximum rate of increase of the resultant electromotive
  force will be AC x angular velocity. Divide this by the
  resistance, and the maximum rate of increase in the current is
  obtained, which, multiplied by the coefficient of self-induction,
 must give the maximum electromotive force of self-induction,
 from the fundamental conception of that magnitude.
     Hence, in symbols, if r = the resistance,
                             L = the coefficient of self-induction,

 And since the electromotive force of self-induction must be
 greatest and +ve when the current is changing through zero
from +ve to -ve, it is clear that the phases of the electro
 motive force of self-induction must follow those of the final
 resultant electromotive force at an interval of time represented
 by a quarter of the period. Thus the above construction is
justified.
     6. The power working at any instant in a source of electro
motive force is the value of the product of the instantaneous
electromotive force in question and of the instantaneous cur
 rent; but this is constantly changing during a period, and
 the mean power is half the product of the maximum value of
 the electromotive force, of the maximum value of the current,
and of the cosine of the angle representing the time-interval
 between their similar phases.          | have given a geometrical
 proof of this theorem in “Alternating Currents.” It amounts
 simply to this in the methods of representation here employed,
 that if we project the revolving line corresponding to any
particular source of electromotive force upon the direction of
the final resultant, the power derived from this particular
source will be the product of such projection and the final
 resultant divided by twice the resistance. Hence the various
 powers of the different sources will simply be proportional to
 the various projections upon the line of the final resultant.

in heating the circuit. This obviously depends upon whether
BC, AE are inclined to one another at an angle greater or
less than a right angle.
   If we denominate these three powers as the power of the

We may call it briefly the F circle.

   Let D be in the F circle, and join DE.
   Now it is easy to see that the two triangles EAD, CAB are
similar, and their sides homologous in the order of the letters
given. For
                 EA=CA cos EAC,
                 DA=BA cos DAB = BAcos EAC,
and the angle
          EAD=EAC+CAD=DAB+CAD=CAB.
Hence the third side
                      DE = BC cos EAC,
and therefore is invariable, whatever the phase-difference
between the lines AB, BC.
   But D is also fixed; therefore E lies upon a circle whose
centre is D, and whose radius is BC cos EAC, or BC cos DAB.
I call this circle the E circle.
    We have now reached the following state of things —
                 F must lie upon a fixed circle,
                 E      37     33     32    33 .
 and             AEF are in one straight line.
    With these prefatory remarks I now proceed to the solu
 tion of the ''           particularized at the beginning of the
 paper; which will now be seen to be merely the finding out of
 the particular position of E upon its circle, which will make
 the ratio #    as large as possible, or, which is the same thing,
 that of # as small as possible.
    9. Let e and f be the two electromotive forces.          Take

   D is on the F circle.       Draw MN perpendicular to AD,
and with centre D at distance DN describe a circle.           This
is the E circle, for its centre is at D, and its radius
=DN=BM cos DAB.

   Through D draw the radius DH parallel to AB, H being
on the same side of D that M is of A. Join AH by a straight
line cutting the E circle in E and the F circle in F. Then
these are the particular positions on the circles which make
the ratio AF a maximum; . e. AF, as here found, is the
maximum efficiency. And if DE be joined, the angle ADE
will give the phase-difference between the electromotive forces
to give this efficiency.
   For, in the first place, it is clear that the ratio # has some
maximum (not a minimum) value between the positions where
E and F coincide, viz, when the two circles intersect.        And
because DH is parallel to AB, and AH cuts them, therefore
the angle DHE = the angle BAF.
   But DH, BA pass through the centres of the two circles
respectively; therefore AH, making the same angle with BA
as it does with DH, must cut the circumferences of the E and
F. circles at the same angle. Thus at E and F, the points
where AH cuts the E and F circles respectively, the arcs of
those circles are parallel. Therefore an elemental displace

              of the Conditions of Marimum Efficiency.         37
  ment of E and F from these positions would result in no
  alteration of the ratio in which E divides AF.
     But this is the characteristic of a maximum or minimum
                                                                It
  value of such a ratio.    Hence the maximum efficiency is AF:
  and it has before been proved that the triangle ADE is similar
  to one in which the sides homologous to AD, DE are the
  electromotive forces themselves. Thus, for maximum effi
 ciency, the phases of f must follow the phases of e by an
 angle equal to (180°-i-ADE), or, which is the same thing,
 precede them by (180°–ADE) or (T-ADE). This, reduced
 to time, is
                 (T-ADE). T_                ADE

                        By Professor TAIT".
  Th:      objections raised by Mr. Burbury and Prof. Boltz
        mann to certain parts of my first paper on the Kinetic
  Theory of Gases were such as I could understand; and my
  reply to them seems to have been accepted as sufficient.
     Mr. Burbury now (Phil. Mag. Dec. 1887) raises an objec
  tion, which I do not understand, to an assumption made
 (after Clerk-Maxwell and Clausius) in my second paper. This
 objection is based upon a Theorem which Mr. Burbury sup
 poses to have been established by Prof. Boltzmann. The
 passage objected to is as follows (the italics are not in the
 original):—“. . . . . . except in extreme cases, in which the
 causes tending to disturb the ‘special’ state are at least nearly
 as rapid and persistent in their action as is the process of
 recovery, we are entitled to assume . . . . . that in every part
 of a gas or gaseous mixture a local special state is maintained.
 And it is to be observed that this may be accompanied by a
 common translatory motion of the particles (or of each sepa
 rate classt of particles) in that region; a motion which, at
each instant, may vary continuously in rate and direction
from region to region; and which, in any one region, may
vary continuously with time. This is a sort of generalization
of the special state, and all that follows is based on the assump
tion that such is the most general kind of motion which the parts
of the system can have, at least in any of the questions here
treated. Of course this translational speed is not the same for
all particles in any small part of the system. It is merely an
   * Communicated by the Author.
   f The “classes” here spoken of are different kinds of gases, not (as in
Mr. Burbury's paper) groups of particles of one gas which have nearly
the same speed.                           -

 average, which is maintained in the same roughly approvimate
 manner as is the ‘special state, and can like it be assumed to
  hold with sufficient accuracy to be made the basis of calculation.
 The mere fact that a “steady’ state, say of diffusion, can be
 realized experimentally is a sufficient warrant for this assump
 tion; and there seems to be no reason for supposing that the
 irregularities of distribution of the translatory velocity among
 the particles of a group should be more serious for the higher
 than for the lower speeds, or vice versá. For each particle is
 sometimes a quick, sometimes a slow, moving one:—and ex
 changes these states many thousand times per second. All
 that is really required by considerations of this kind is allowed
 for '.  our way of looking at the mean free paths for different
 speeds.”
   ": I cannot see how objection can possibly be taken
 to this assumption when the question is that of the Wiscosity
 of a pure gas; though Mr. Burbury specially mentions Wis
 cosity among the subjects which he considers to be on this
 account erroneously treated in my paper. And it would
 require, I think, a most determined sceptic to entertain a
 doubt of its lawfulness in the question of Thermal Conduction,
also in a pure gas. In the matter of Diffusion some doubts
 may possibly occur to one looking at it for the first time; and
 it was on that account that I inserted in my paper the words
 quoted above. To deny their validity would, I consider, be
 tantamount to a wholesale repudiation of the statistical method
of treatment, which has done so much for questions of this
 kind. Mr. Burbury departs from the statistical method in his
 equation (1) by treating as a separate gas, with its own pres
 sures and resistances, the class of particles of one gas which
have speeds from v to v +öv :—thus ignoring the community
of interests which the mutual collisions secure for all the par
ticles of a gas. It might be lawful, though perhaps not very
useful, to treat thus a part of one gas; but it must be a part
which contains particles with all varieties of speed in their
proper proportions.
    But more. I think I have given a self-consistent, and
therefore accurate, solution of the problem of steady Diffusion
(at all events when the masses and the diameters of the
particles are the same in the two gases), basing my work
entirely on the assumption above. If Mr. Burbury can show
that solution to be erroneous, he may possibly make out
a presumptive case against the assumption on which it was
founded:—but not otherwise.

  VI. On Dedekind's Theorem concerning the Motion of a
    Liquid Ellipsoid under its own Attraction. By A. E. H.
    LovE, Fellow of St. John’s College, Cambridge",
 Th:       interesting problem, to determine the general motion
         of a mass of liquid in the form of an ellipsoid which
 moves, subject to its own attraction, in such a way as to remain
 ellipsoidal and of constant volume, was the subject of a posthu
 mous paper by Dirichlet, edited, with additions, by Dedekind,
 in Borchardt's Journal, vol. lviii. (1859).
    Dirichlet set out from the assumption that the coordinates
 of any liquid particle are at any instant linear functions of
 their initial values, and showed that all the conditions could
 be satisfied. The investigations of Greenhillf, completed by
 Bassett, lead to the £ that the most general type of
 motion within the ellipsoid can be thus expressed.
    Dedekind's most important contribution to the subject is a
 theorem of reciprocity, according to which there corresponds
 to any given motion of the ellipsoid a certain other correlated
 motion. It is the object of this Note to give a proof of this
 theorem, and especially to discuss the motion which is thus
 correlated with the     : Jacobian form of the rotating
 ellipsoid. This case of motion is usually referred to as
 “Dedekind’s ellipsoid;” and the physical description of it is
that the ellipsoidal form remains fixed in space, while the
liquid moves about inside it. Regarded from a tidal point of
view, we might say that it corresponds to a case of a fixed
finite tide with no disturbing body.
                          Dedekind’s Theorem.
    Let a, b, c be the axes of the ellipsoid at any time t, and
a, y, z the coordinates of a fluid particle at this time referred
to axes fixed in space whose origin is at the centre of the
ellipsoid; ao, bo, co, wo, y0, z0 the initial values of these quan
tities at time t-0, and let us suppose that at this time the
axes of coordinates coincide with the axes of the ellipsoid.

 These are the same conditions as those required for Jacobi's

    Another very simple proof can be derived by Greenhill's
 method. Suppose the liquid occupying an ellipsoidal case to

 angular velocity o, and let an equal and opposite angular
velocity be imparted to the case.          e shall show that Dede

  WII. The Effect produced on the Thermoelectrical Pro
     perties of Iron when under Stress or Strain by raising the
      Temperature to Bright-red. By HERBERT TOMLINsoN, B.A.”
        HE author has already had the pleasure of communicating
         to the Physical Society't the results of some experi
 ments relating to a certain curious behaviour of iron wire
 when under stress or strain at a temperature of bright red.
  It was found that if the metal was under a slight stress either
 of torsion or of flexure, there was apparently a sudden
 increase of elasticity when, on heating, the critical tempera
 ture had been reached; that is to say, if the wire was under
 a slight twisting stress it suddenly untwisted, and if under a

slight bending stress it suddenly unbent. Corresponding
sudden changes in the opposite direction occurred on cooling.
When, however, the wire was permanently strained and
relieved from stress the equally sudden changes which ensued
at the critical temperature were opposite in direction to the
changes produced when the wire was under stress; namely,
a permanently twisted wire free from torsional stress 'i
suddenly twist further when, on heating, a temperature of
bright red was reached, and a permanently bent wire would
suddenly bend further. Likewise the sudden changes which
took place on cooling were in opposite directions for stress
and permanent strain: the permanently twisted wire suddenly
untwisted, and the permanently bent wire unbent.
   Those sudden changes were regarded as probably indicating
equally sudden changes in the molecular architecture of iron;
and experimental evidence was brought forward to prove
that the temperature at which the above-mentioned phenomena
occurred was not the same as that at which iron suddenly
loses its magnetic £:
   Again, Sir W. Thomson* arrived at the remarkable con
clusion that when a permanent strain is left after the with
drawal of the stress producing it, the residual thermoelectrical
effect is the reverse of the thermoelectrical effect which is
induced by the stress and which subsists as long as the stress
acts.
   The author was led by the above-mentioned considerations
to attempt to ascertain how far the thermoelectrical properties
of iron when under temporary stress or permanent strain
might be affected by raising the temperature to a bright red.
                          Experiment I.
   A piece of well-annealed iron wire one millimetre in
diameter was subjected throughout half its length to a great
many turns of permanent torsion. It was then supported on
the ring of a retort-stand, being insulated from the latter
by paper, with the junction of the twisted and untwisted
 portions in the centre of the ring. The free ends of the
 iron wire were connected by silk-covered copper wire with
 the terminals of a delicate reflecting-galvanometer of about
 7 B.A. units resistance; the two junctions between the iron
 and copper being tied together and well wrapped up in tissue
 paper, which served also to insulate them from each other.
 The junction of the twisted and untwisted portions of the iron
 wire was now heated slightly by a Bunsen’s burner; this
   * “Electro-dynamic Qualities of Metals,” Phil. Trans. Part IV. 1856.

             of Iron when under Stress or Strain.             47
caused a deflection of the galvanometer, indicating a current
from the strained to the unstrained portion through the hot
junction, as already found by Sir W£ Thomson. The
flame of the burner, which was placed underneath the junc
tion, was at first kept small, but was afterwards increased
by degrees. At about dull red temperature the deflection
nearly ceased to increase, but as soon as the wire assumed
a bright red colour, the light reflected from the mirror of the
galvanometer went off the scale. The adjusting magnet
was therefore used to bring the spot of light back on to
the scale in the hope of getting a fairly steady deflection;
but this was found to be impossible, the light frequently
changing its position by fits and starts and sometimes going
over to the other side of the scale.    The reason of this un
steadiness will be explained later on.
   The experiment was repeated with a second piece of the
same wire similarly treated, with this difference, however,
that after slightly heating the junction to observe the
direction of the deflection, a large resistance was introduced
into the galvanometer circuit.    #, this means the variations
of the sudden deflection again produced at the temperature
of bright red were much diminished, and a moment of fair
steadiness was seized to remove the burner and allow the wire
to cool. Almost immediately after the removal of the burner
the light on the scale, after pausing slightly, went suddenly
in the opposite direction.
   The experiment was repeated some six or seven times with
different pieces of the same wire, but always with like results.
   Experiments similar to the above were tried with other
pieces of the same iron wire, to which permanent strain was
imparted by hammering transversely, by stretching longi
tudinally, or by bending the wire into coils of small diameter.
In all these experiments the thermoelectrical currents pro
duced by moderate heating were, as Sir W. Thomson has
already found, from the strained to the unstrained through
the hot junction, and in all there was a very sudden increase
of the current when, on being heated, the wire became bright
red, and an equally sudden decrease when the wire was
cooled.
                         Experiment II.
   Two pieces of the same wire were arranged as in fig. 1 (p.48).
A1 B1, A, B, are two wires brazed together at C and looped at
A1,B1 and A2, B2; from B1 and B, the wires continue to D,
where they are joined to the connecting wires of the galva
nometer & ; D was well wrapped up in tissue-paper.         B1 S1,

B, S are pieces of strong string fastened at S1, S, to the ring
of a retort-stand weighted at the bottom.       From A1 passes
                            Fig. 1.

       1/ri/o
a string over a pulley P, and to the end of this string a
weight of 1 kilo. was attached; from A3 passes another string
to a support so as to hold up the portion A2C of the wire A2,
B2. The two wires A1 B1, A2 B, lie in the same horizontal
plane; to the left of C they are covered with sand from C to a
distance of 10 centims. To the right of C for a distance of
about 3 centims. the wires are bare, but beyond this for
about 7 centims. are covered with sand; the sand is sus
tained on two stands placed to the right and left of C.
   First, the junction C was slightly heated by a burner, and
as the weight of 1 kilo. was not sufficient for the moderate
temperature then used to produce any sensible thermoelectrical
effect, the end A1 was pulled rather hard by the hand to
ascertain what would be the direction of the thermoelectrical
current due to the stress; this direction was found to be from
the unstressed to the stressed wire through the hot junction,
as Thomson had already found. A rather large resistance
was then introduced into the galvanometer circuit for the
purpose of diminishing the sensibility of the instrument, and
the parts of the uncovered wires to the right of C were raised
to the temperature of bright red. Immediately this tempera
ture was reached, there was a sudden start of the galvanometer
needles, indicating that the stretched wire had suddenly be
come more negative relatively to the unstretched wire. When
the wires were allowed to cool there was, after a short pause,
an equally sudden deflection in the opposite direction.
   The weight of 1 kilo. was now supported by blocks placed
underneath it, and the junction C was again heated to a
bright red. At the critical temperature there was again a
sudden deflection, now indicating that the wire, which had

             of Iron when under Stress or Strain.            49
been previously permanently lengthened by the 1 kilo. weight
at the bright red temperature, was rendered suddenly more
positive relatively to the unstrained wire. When the wires
were allowed to cool there was, after a short pause, an equally
sudden deflection in the opposite direction. This experiment
was repeated with three different pairs of wires and with the
same results.
   It has been mentioned in Experiment I. that as soon as the
temperature reached a bright red the deflection of the galva
nometer frequently altered by fits and starts, and was even at
times  '. reversed in direction.         This circumstance con
stituted a difficulty in all the experiments, and was presently
found to be due to slight shiftings of the flame of the burner
from slight draughts in the room. Hot iron at any tempera
ture is thermoelectrically negative to cold iron; but when the
temperature reaches a bright red there is such a sudden
accession of negativeness that if we lay a piece of iron at
this temperature upon another piece of cool iron there is
developed an electromotive force which, thermoelectrically
considered, is very large.
                        Experiment III.

removed, and after allowing sufficient time for the wires to
cool B was again placed on A, when a deflection through 10
divisions of the scale in the opposite direction indicated the
discharge of the condenser. This experiment was repeated
several times with fairly uniform results; and by comparing
the deflection thus obtained with that produced by a Daniell’s
cell, it was ascertained that the E.M.F. produced by putting
iron at a bright red temperature on iron at about 15°C. was
one twentieth of a volt, i.e. considerably more than twice as
much as would be developed in a single element of bismuth

iron, and this seems to be so at all temperatures, but it has
not, the author believes, been noticed before* how very
suddenly the negativeness is increased when the temperature
reaches a bright red. If the wire B be heated to a tempera
ture between dull red and bright red before being placed on
A, there is a current from A to B which can be readily
detected if the condenser be cut out and the galvanometer
connected directly with A and B, but no effect whatever could
be detected when the condenser was used as in the experiment.

shifted suddenly and slightly towards C; almost immediately
afterwards the light darted off the scale of the galvanometer,
indicating a strong current from A to D through C. The
portion CD was again heated above a bright red temperature,
and the burner then was shifted suddenly towards D; the
deflection of the galvanometer needle was now strong in the
opposite direction, showing a current from B to C through D.
    Experiment III.      £          the clue to the   explanation of
the phenomenon described in Experiment IV. The portion
 CD, when at a bright red, is thermoelectrically negative to
 the rest of the iron wire, and is in fact like a different metal.
 So long, however, as the flame of the burner is kept in one
 position the temperature at C will be the same as at D, and
 there will be no current; but directly we shift the burner
 towards C we make C hotter than before, whilst D cools more
 or less, and we get a current from A to D through C.
    We also see why a slight draught of air blowing the flame
 of the burner towards C or D may suddenly generate a strong
 current in one direction or the other and may completely
 mask the phenomena recounted in Experiments I. and II.
    Experiment IV. may be varied in several ways, thus:–If
 we keep the flame steadily burning so as to maintain CD at
 a high temperature, and allow a small stream of water to flow
 down on C, we get a continuous current from B to C through
 D, and if we shift the stream to D we reverse the current.
 Or, instead of the stream of water, we may blow with a small
 pair of bellows at C or D.
    What connexion there may be between the above-men
 tioned phenomena and the discovery of Professor P. G.
 Tait that the thermoelectrical diagram of iron cuts that of
 iridium-platinum at least three times below a low white heat",
 that is to say that an iron and iridium-platinum circuit has at
 least three neutral points, does not quite appear.
    In conclusion, it may be said that the investigation serves still
 further to confirm the author in his opinion that a sudden
 and profound change takes place in the molecular arrange
 ment of iron at a temperature of bright red.

VIII. On the Theory of Electric Endosmose and other Allied
   Phenomena, and on the Ecistence of a Sliding Coefficient for
   a Fluid in contact with a Solid. By Professor HoRACE
   LAMB, M.A., F.R.S."
     HE laws governing the electric transport of conducting
       liquids through the walls of porous vessels or along
capillary tubes, and other related phenomena, have been in
vestigated experimentally by Wiedemannt and Quincket,
and explained by the latter writer on the assumption of a
contact difference of potential between the fluid and its solid
boundaries. This explanation has been developed mathema
tically by von Helmholtz in his well-known paper on electric
double layers S. Applying the known laws of motion of
viscous fluids, he finds that the calculated results, so far as
they depend on quantities which admit of measurement, are
in satisfactory agreement with the experiments, and that the
values which it is necessary to assign to the contact difference
above spoken of are in all cases comparable with the electro
motive force of a Daniell’s cell. Incidentally he arrives also
at the conclusion that in the cases considered there is no
slipping of the fluid over the surface of the solids with which
it is in contact.
    In the present paper a slightly different view is adopted on
this latter point. It is assumed that a solid offers a very
great, but not an infinite, resistance to the sliding of a fluid
over it, and that this sliding is an essential factor in the phe
 nomena referred to. On this modified hypothesis the various
 cases treated by von Helmholtz are discussed, and in some
 respects extended. In all cases the results differ from those
 obtained by von Helmholtz by a factor l/d, where l is a linear
 magnitude measuring the “slip,” and d is the distance between
 the plates of an air-condenser equivalent to that virtually
formed by the opposed surfaces of solid and fluid. For in
stance, comparing with the experimental results of Wiede
 mann, von Helmholtz infers that for a certain solution of
 CuSO, in contact with the material of a porous clay vessel,

paper the inference would be—

                          D. :=1 77.
Since this involves two unknown ratios, no such definite con
clusion as to the value of E can be drawn; but it is evident
that the phenomena are consistent even with very small
values of E/D, provided l be a sufficient multiple of d. Since
this quantity d is of molecular order of magnitude (com
parable probably with 10" centim.), l may still be so small
that the effects of slipping would be entirely insensible in
such experiments as those of Poiseuille.
   1. In Wiedemann's experiments the poles of a galvanic
battery were connected with two metal plates immersed in a
conducting liquid (for instance, copper plates in a solution of
CuSO4) and separated by a porous partition. In one set of
experiments the liquid was maintained at the same level on
the two sides, and the amount carried by “electric endos
mose’’ through the pores was measured by the overflow on
the further side. This amount was found to be proportional
to the total amount of electricity conveyed by the current,
and independent of the area or of the thickness of the porous
partition. For solutions of the same salt, but of different
degrees of concentration, the amount of fluid carried across
was roughly proportional to the specific electric resistance.
   As typical of this class of experiment von Helmholtz con
siders the case of a straight tube of uniform section, made of
insulating material, and containing a liquid through which
an electric current is made to flow. Taking the axis of v
parallel to the length of the tube, let u be the velocity of the
fluid at any   #     A the coefficient of viscosity, 8 the co
efficient of sliding friction of the fluid in contact with the
wall of the tube. Considering the forces acting on a thin
surface film, and denoting by dn an element of the inwardly
directed normal, we find
                      d
                     £–8u4 x=0, . . . . . . (1)
where the first term is due to the fluid friction on the inner
surface of the film, the second to the friction between the
outer surface and the tube, while the third term represents
the external forces reckoned per unit area. In all ordinary
hydrodynamical questions the latter term is absent, but in
 the present case we have forces due to the fall of potential
along the tube, acting on the superficial layer. Let E be the

54          Prof. H. Lamb on the Theory of Electric
excess of potential of the liquid in contact with the wall of
the tube over that of the wall itself. It has been pointed out
by von Helmholtz that a discontinuity of potential implies the
existence, over the surface of discontinuity, of a “double
layer” of positive and negative electricity (analogous to the
magnetic shells of Ampère), the difference of potential on the
two sides being equal to 4T times the electrical moment of the
layer. We therefore suppose that in our present case there
exists in a thin superficial stratum of the fluid a distribution
of electricity whose amount per unit area is p, say, whilst in
a thin superficial stratum of the solid there is a complementary
distribution –p. If d denote (in an obvious sense) the mean
distance between these distributions, we have
                            E=47tpd,
or
                            p = cF.      . . . .       . .  .  (2)
if
                            c = 1/47td,
that is, c denotes the capacity per unit area of the quasi
condenser formed by the opposed surfaces of solid and fluid.
For the case of metallic electrodes (platinum, mercury) in
contact with acidulated water, von Helmholtz and Lippmann
have independently found the value of d to be comparable
with 10" centim., and we may reasonably suppose it to be
of a similar order of magnitude in the cases at present under
consideration.
   If p denote the electric potential at any point in the interior
of the fluid, we have
                                     d
                            x=-&#.                .   . .  . . (3)
   If Q be the sectional area of the tube, J the electric current
through it, a the specific resistance of the liquid, we have, by
Ohm’s law—

                              d. T Q’ . . . . . . (4)
When the motion has become steady, there being no dif
ference of fluid pressure between the two ends of the tube,
the velocity u will be uniform over the section, so that the
equation (1) becomes
                                    J

             Endosmose and other Allied Phenomena.                     55
Since in most cases the flux is in the positive direction of the
electric current, we must assume that, as a rule, E is positive,
i.e., the fluid is positive relatively to the solid *.
   To compare with von Helmholtz's result let us write

The constant l, which is of the nature of a line, measures, as
it were, the facility of slipping. In ordinary hydrodynamical
problems, in    '.       there is no question of external surface
forces, the surface condition (1) reduces to
                                 w=1: dn'  . . . . . . . ()
The motion will then be sensibly the same as it would be on
the hypothesis of no slipping, provided a layer of thickness l
were removed from the surface of the solid and replaced by
fluid, it being supposed that l is small compared with all the
dimensions of the space occupied by the fluid.
    On making the substitutions (7) and (8), the formula (6)
becomes
                                aJ l
                          U=1:...B.          -   -   -   •   -   -   (10)
which differs from von Helmholtz's result only in containing
the factor l/d.
    In one respect the difference between the view here taken
and that adopted by by von Helmholtz is little more than
verbal. Von Helmholtz considers that the velocity u is
practically uniform over the section of the tube, except near
the wall, where it falls rapidly to zero. The stratum within
which this fall is supposed to take place is that occupied by
the (probably) molecular charges of electricity, whose aggre
 gate is represented by p. The two views might perhaps be
 reconciled by interpreting von Helmholtz's investigation as
 virtually a proof that l=d, if it were not for the assumption
 that the equations of motion of a viscous fluid, as well as the
 electrostatic equation
                               V*p +4ae=0
 (where V*=d'/dx^+ d'/dy"+d'/dz”, and e is the volume
 density of free electricity), may be supposed to hold through
    * The most noteworthy exception appears to be oil of turpentine in
 contact with glass or clay. In contact with sulphur, on the other hand,
 it appears to be positive (Quincke).

56          Prof. H. Lamb on the Theory of Electric
the thickness of the stratum in question. Since these equa
tions are only true in a statistical sense, when the linear
elements dw, dy, dz are taken to be large in comparison with
the average distance between neighbouring molecules, whereas
the thickness of the stratum is almost certainly not more than
a very moderate multiple of this distance, it seems doubtful
whether they can fairly be pressed into service in the manner
indicated.
    Although we have only somewhat vague probabilities to
 guide us, it appears reasonable to suppose, from what we
 know of contact differences of potential in cases where they
can be measured, that the ratio E/D will not very greatly
exceed or fall below unity; that it will lie, say, between about
 ‘1 and 10. If this be so, the comparison of our theory with
the observations entitles us to say that the sliding coefficient
l is at all events of the same order of magnitude as d. If
for water in contact with glass l were equal to 10" centim.,
this would make
                    8= u/l=1.4 x 10° C.G.S.;
in other words, the shearing-stress necessary (in the absence
of electrical surface-forces) to produce a sliding of one centi
metre per second would be 1.4 megadynes per square centim.
It follows that the effects of slipping would be utterly insen
sible in ordinary hydrodynamical questions, e. g. the experi
ments of Poiseuille. The slipping leads to appreciable results
in the cases at present in view, only in consequence of the
relatively enormous electrical forces acting on the superficial
film, and dragging the fluid (as it were) by the skin, through
the tube.
    The formulae (6) may be written:—

                  Flux of electricity" & " . . . .           (11)
In this form it can be shown to be true, under a certain
restriction, for a tube of varying section, for a network of
tubes, and even for the labyrinth of channels contained in the
walls of a porous vessel, provided no difference of pressure be
allowed to establish itself on the two sides.
    Let b denote, as before, the electric potential at any point
of the fluid. It will appear that all the conditions of our
problem will be satisfied if we suppose the motion of the fluid
to be irrotational, the velocity-potential x being everywhere
proportional to b.

 where f is the rate of shear in a plane through ds normal to
 the surface. If l be small in comparison with the linear
 dimensions of the channels, the first term of this equation
 may, in the cases at present under consideration, be neglected
 in comparison with the rest”, so that (13) is satisfied provided

 same direction as that of electricity, and stands to it in the
 ratio of X to -ø/a, that is in the ratio ap/8. The formula (11)

 for the electric transport of liquids through porous vessels.
    2. If a difference of pressure obtains between the two sides
 of a porous wall, or between the two ends of a capillary tube,
 the # above calculated must be superposed on that which

 If the axis of r be in the direction of the flow at O, we have to prove that
ld'X/dxdz may be neglected in comparison with dx/dv. It is proved in
the appendix to this paper that at O we must have

with the radii of curvature of the wall.

 58          Prof. H. Lamb on the Theory of Electric
 difference of pressure in the absence of electrical forces. This
 follows at once from the linearity of the equations. Wiede
 mann and Quincke have made experiments in which the
 fluxes of liquid due to the two causes just balance one another,
 the subject of measurement being the difference of pressure
 which exists between the two sides when this equilibrium is
 established.    In Wiedemann's experiments the difference of
 pressure maintained in this way between the two sides of a
 porous partition was found to vary directly as the strength of
 the electric current, inversely as the area of the porous wall,
 and directly as its thickness. For solutions of different
 degrees of concentration the pressure was proportional to the
 electric resistance.
    In the case of a tube of uniform circular section treated by
 von Helmholtz, taking the axis of w along the axis of the tube,
 and using cylindrical coordinates v, r, the first of the equations
 (12) becomes

Here p is a function of v only, u one of r only. Hence each
side of the equation must be constant and = P/L, where L is
the length of the tube, and P the difference of pressure between
its ends.   Hence

   3. Quincke has also made observations on the motion of
fine particles, suspended in a liquid through which electric
currents are flowing. For instance, in the case discussed in
§2, where, under the influence of an electric current, the fluid
in a tube of circular section flows (as a rule) forwards along
the walls and backwards along the axis, the integral flux across
any section being zero, he found, using a glass tube 4 millim.
in diameter, that for a certain strength of current the particles
near the axis move backwards, ' those near the walls
 move forwards, though with less velocity. For stronger cur
 rents the motion of the suspended particles is everywhere
 backwards, but more rapid the nearer to the axis. ':
rower tubes the motion was everywhere backwards, even with
the feeblest currents which were sufficient to produce percep
tible motion at all.

   These phenomena have been explained in a general manner
by Quincke and von Helmholtz. If E denote the contact
difference of potential between the solid particle and the fluids
we have electrifications + cF on the opposed surfaces, which
are therefore urged in opposite directions by the electric
forces whose components are –d4/dw, -dq/dy, -d-p/dz.
   The principles of this paper lead to a very simple expression
for the velocity of an isolated particle when the motion has
become steady, viz., the velocity relative to the fluid in this
neighbourhood is in the direction of the electric current, and
its amount is
                             W=-Cp/8, . . . . . . (20)
where C denotes the gradient of electric potential and p, 8,
have the same meanings as before. To prove this, take the
axis of a parallel to the general direction of the electric cur
rent in the neighbourhood of the particle. The problem is
virtually unaltered if we suppose £ fluid to flow with the
general velocity –W past the solid, which is at rest. The
£Ol"In
         potential at a distance from the solid will be of the
                    qb=-Cz +So-HS-2+S-3+, .                . .   (21)
where S9, S_2, S-3. . . . . are solid harmonics of the degrees
indicated. These latter terms represent           the disturbance of
the otherwise uniform flow of electricity         by the presence of
the insulating solid particles. It will be         found that all the
conditions of our problem are satisfied by        supposing the fluid
motion to be irrotational. We therefore write for the velocity
potential at a distance
                   x=-Va.--To-HT-2+T-3+. . . . (22)
where To, T-2, T-3 . . . are solid harmonics. The surface
condition will be of the form (13), in which we may neglect
the first term if we suppose the quantity l defined by (8) to
be small in comparison with the dimensions of the particle".

 the couple-resultant of the stress across X is zero. Now let
 X be made up of the surface X1 above defined, and of a sphere
 Xs of infinite radius, having its centre at the origin. It
 follows that the stresses across X1 are statically equivalent to
 those across X's. And it easily follows from (22) that the
 latter stresses are in equilibrium.
     It is remarkable that the velocity (24) is independent of
  the size or shape of the particle, so long as its dimensions are
  large in comparison with l. This velocity is, of course, to be
  superposed on that of the fluid in the neighbourhood. For

 have

   4. We may next consider the electromotive forces produced
by the passage of a liquid through a capillary tube or a porous
diaphragm. This subject has been studied experimentally by
Quincke, Edlund, Haga, Clark, and more recently by Dornf,
the general result being that the potential is higher on the
side where the pressure is least by an amount proportional to
the difference of pressure. The phenomenon is ascribed to a
sort of electric convection, the superficial electrified layer of
fluid carrying its charge with it as it slides over the walls of
the channels. In the case of a straight uniform tube, for
instance, there is in this way a transfer of positive electricity
along the walls, from the near to the farther end, which is
compensated, if no other path is open, by conduction back
wards through the column of liquid in the tube. If the tube
be of varying section there will be a tendency also to con
vergence of positive or negative electricity by convection at
intermediate points, and a consequent establishment of
“sources'’ : “sinks” as regards '. conducting mass of
fluid in the interior.
    Taking the case of a tube of circular section, through which
fluid is forced by an excess of pressure P, and using the same
notation as in § 2, we find by the ordinary theory of Poi
seuille's experiments
                           "=#|R-rºams).                       . .     . (26)
 Hence the total quantity of electricity carried per second
along the wall of the tube is
                                                R2
                             2TBp. uR      =#.      p.
 If no other conducting channel is open the electricity thus
 carried forward will return by ordinary conduction through
the column of liquid in the tube. Since the resistance of
this column is a L/TR’, the difference of potential between
 the ends of the tube is
                                      #.E.           .  .   . . .       .   (27)
   * It is to be noticed that one of Quincke's observations remains unex
 plained, viz., the fact that in sufficiently wide tubes the direction of motion
 of particles near the walls varied with the strength of the current.

If E is positive (as it appears to be in most cases) the higher
W'          is at the end towards which the liquid is forced.
    ith the same substitutions as before, this becomes

differing from von Helmholtz's result by the factor l/d, as in
the previous cases".
    This result does not involve the dimensions of the tube, and
may therefore be surmised, like that contained in (10), to be
of much wider application than to the particular form of
channel above considered. It may be shown, in fact, that if
a liquid is forced by pressure through any system of channels
with homogeneous walls, and no external path is provided for
the electricity set free at various points of these, the resulting
distribution of electric potential is given by
                            *=-#p-const             .   .   .   .   (29)
   In the first place it follows from (12) that this value of p
satisfies V*b=0.
   We have next to take account of the fact that the integral
amount of electricity which, in consequence of the slipping of
the superficial film of liquid, crosses the contour of any
elementary area dS of the wall is not in general accurately
zero, and that each such element dS must be regarded, in
relation to the conducting mass of liquid, as a (positive or
negative) “source” of electricity. If the origin be taken in
this element, and the axis of 2 normal to it, the strength of
this source is

    5. A £ investigation applies to the electromotive
forces called into play by the motion of solid particles through
a liquid. This phenomenon, which is in a sense the converse
of that discussed in §3, has been observed by Dorn in the
case of grains of sand or glass beads descending by gravity
through a vertical column of water. For the case of steady
motion the formula (29) shows that the top of the column
will be at a higher potential than the base by an amount
equal to ap/8 times the £ per unit area of the base due
to the solid particles. This pressure is equal to the effective
weight (i.e., the gravity minus the buoyancy) of the particles
vertically over the unit area. In Dorn's experiments the
observed excess of potential was in fact positive, in accordance
with the general rule that p (and therefore E) is positive, but
the data are not sufficient for further comparison with theory.
   * The justification of these and the following approximations is given
in the Appendix.

a spherical particle. If r denote the distance from the centre,

THE following communications were read:—
       1. “Note on the so-called “Soapstone of Fiji.” By Henry
B. Brady, F.R.S.
   2. “On some Results of Pressure and of Intrusive Granite in
Stratified Palaeozoic Rocks near Morlaix, in Brittany.” By Prof.
T. G. Bonney, D.Sc., LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   The Author briefly described the banded Palaeozoic slates in the
neighbourhood of Morlaix, and gave a general account of their micro
scopic structure. They are greatly contorted and folded, and have
 evidently undergone very severe pressure. The result of this, as it
appears to him, has been the development of minute scales of a
light-coloured mica, especially in the darker (originally argillaceous
bands) and certain corresponding changes in the more quartzose
layers. The cleavage-planes often cut the surfaces of bedding and of
this micro-foliation, which are parallel, at high angles, and so are of
the nature of “Ausweichungsclivage.”
    In certain places these banded slates, after they have attained the
aforesaid condition, have been affected by intrusive granites. The
result has been the intensification of the changes which were already
incipient. The quartz granules have been doubled in size, the flakes
of mica have become four or five times as large, the black material
of the argillaceous bands has been gathered into larger granules,
and seemingly reduced in quantity (probably by partial oxidation of
the carbon), and in some cases andalusite crystals or grains of con
siderable size have been developed. The rock has become compara
tively hard, instead of friable, and the cleavage-planes are “soldered
up” by the development of mica along them. In its general aspect
one of these banded rocks (where free from andalusite) bears con
siderable resemblance, macroscopic and even microscopic, to one of
the less coarsely crystalline, distinctly banded mica-schists, supposed
by many to occupy a rather high position in the Archaean series.
   3. “On the Position of the Obermittweida Conglomerate.”          By
Prof. T. M"K. Hughes, M.A., F.G.S.
   The Author gave an account of a visit to the section at Ober
mittweida, 50 miles S.W. of Dresden, where there is an apparent
intercalation of conglomerate and sandstone in a gneissic series.
West of the stream at Obermittweida there is seen a crushed but not
much altered conglomerate of felsite and other pebbles, above which
gneiss and mica-schist rest, apparently in true sequence nume
rically. Below the conglomerate no rocks were seen, but at a little
distance to the eastward coarse flaked muscovite-schists and gneissic
rocks were exposed, apparently underlying it. By a diagram the
Author showed how the conglomerate might belong to much newer
beds caught in a synclinal fold of the schists, and he advanced various
arguments in support of this explanation.

    4. “On the Obermittweida Conglomerate: its Composition and
 Alteration.” By Prof. T. G. Bonney, D.Sc., LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    The Author is indebted to Professor Hughes for the opportunity
of examining a fine series of specimens of this rock, collected by the
latter. The pebbles vary from well-rounded to subangular, some
of the smaller fragments occasionally being practically unworn.
The matrix is sometimes granular to the unaided eye, sometimes
very fine. The whole mass has evidently been subjected to con
 siderable pressure.
    The associated gneiss is a moderately coarse gneiss, containing
 two micas and garnet. It has a general resemblance to rocks which,
 in the Alps, appear to occur about or rather below the middle
 of the crystalline series.
    The fragments consist of various kinds of rocks.   Those examined
 microscopically are referred to granitoid rock (3 varieties), mica
schist, quartz-schist, quartzite, hälleflinta (?).
    The matrix is almost wholly composed of quartz and mica (two
species, but mostly brown) with some felspar. The materials appear
 to have undergone a certain amount of metamorphism, by augmen
tation of the original fragments, and to some extent by development
 of new minerals.     The author is of opinion that the materials are
 rather more altered than is usual in Palaeozoic greywackes and con
 glomerates, but that the comparatively small amount of alteration,
 and the character of the included fragments, render it highly im
probable that the conglomerate is in stratigraphical sequence with
the above-described gneiss, or with any similar series of rocks; and
 so, if Archaean, it must belong to one of the latest epochs in that
period.
    5. “Notes on a part of the Huronian Series in the neighbourhood
of Sudbury (Canada).” By Prof. T. G. Bonney, D.Sc., LL.D., F.R.S.,
F.G.S.
   The specimens noticed by the Author were in part collected by
him in the summer of 1884, when the Canada Pacific Railway was
in process of construction, and in part subsequently supplied to him by
the kindness of Dr. Selwyn, Director-General of the Geological
Survey of Canada.
   The eastern edge of the district assigned to the Huronian consists
of rocks, which may possibly be part of the Laurentian series modi
fied by pressure. But after crossing a belt of these, barely a mile
wide, there is no further room for doubt. All the rocks for many
miles are distinctly fragmental, except certain intrusive diabases or
diorites. These fragmental rocks are grits, conglomerates and breccias,
which are described as far as about 2 miles west of Sudbury. The
included fragments in these rocks appear to have undergone some
alterations subsequent to consolidation: these are described. In
some cases the changes appear to be anterior to the formation of the
fragments. The matrix also has undergone some change, chiefly
the enlargement of quartz grains, and the development or comple
tion of mica-flakes, as in the Obermittweida rock.
   The Author gave some notes on other specimens collected by him

         Age of the Altered Limestone of Strath, Skye.            73
 long the railway, further west, and on those supplied to him from
near Lake Huron by Dr. Selwyn. As a rule these are but little
altered. Some contain fragments of igneous rocks, apparently
lavas.
   The author discusses the significance of the changes in these
rocks, as bearing on general questions of metamorphism, and states
that, in his opinion, the name Huronian, at present, includes either
a series of such great thickness that the lower beds are more highly
altered than the higher, or else two distinct series; and he inclines
to the latter view. Both, however, must be separated from the
Laurentian by a great interval of time, and neither exhibits meta
morphism comparable with that of a series of schists and gneisses,
like the so-called Montalban.   The newer reminds him often of the
 English Pebidians.
  December 7.—Prof. J. W. Judd, F.R.S., President, in the Chair.
    The following communications were read:—
    1. “A Letter from H.M. Secretary of State for the Colonies,
enclosing an account of recent Discoveries of Gold in the Trans
vaal.”
    The deposits in which gold has been found, locally known as
“banket,” consist of a quartz-conglomerate forming so-called “reefs,”
which traverse the veldt parallel to, but at a short distance from,
the rocky ridge of Witwatersrand. These masses always dip to the
south, but at angles varying from 30° up to 90°. The “reefs” are
believed to have been discovered by Mr. Struben, an English gentle
man long resident in the country. The “main reef.” has been traced
for twenty-five or thirty miles, and varies in breadth from 3 feet
6 inches to 15 feet; parallel and branching “reefs” of smaller
dimensions have also been found. The yield of gold is said to be
very variable in different portions of the “reef,” different samples
with from 3 oz. to 3 oz. per ton occurring in close proximity. So
far as observation has gone (and the deepest workings have only
reached a depth of from 70 to 150 feet), the yield of gold has gene
rally increased as the reefs are followed downwards.
    2. “On the Age of the Altered Limestone of Strath, Skye.” By
Dr. Archibald Geikie, F.R.S., W.P.G.S.
    The remarkable alteration of the limestone of Strath into a
white saccharoid marble, first described by Macculloch, has hitherto
been regarded as an instance of contact-metamorphism in a rock of
Liassic age. The various writers who have described the geology
of the district have followed Macculloch in classing the whole of the
ordinary and altered limestone with the Secondary series of the
Inner Hebrides. The author, however, saw reason in 1861 to sus
  ect that some part of the limestone must be of the age of the
   urness Limestone of Sutherland, that is, Lower Silurian; and he
expressed this suspicion in a joint paper by the late Sir R. I. Mur
chison and himself, published in the 18th volume of the Quarterly
Journal of the Society. He has recently returned to the subject,

74                        Geological Society.
and now offers lithological, stratigraphical, and palaeontological
evidence that the altered limestone is not Lias but Lower Silurian.
   In lithological characters the limestone, where not immediately
affected by the intrusion of the eruptive rocks, closely resembles the
well-known limestones of the west of Sutherland and Rosshire.        It
is not more altered than Palaeozoic limestones usually are. It con
tains abundant black chert-concretions and nodules, which project
from the weathered surfaces of the rock exactly as they do at Durness.
These cherts do not occur in any of the undoubted Lias limestones
of the shore-sections.    The limestone lies in beds, which, however,
are not nearly so distinct as those of the Lias, and have none of the
interstratifications of dark sandy shale so conspicuous in the true
Liassic series.
   The stratigraphy of the altered limestone likewise marks it off from
the Lias. There appears to be a lower group of dark limestones full of
black cherts, and a higher group of white limestones with little or
no chert, which may be compared with the two lower groups of the
Durness Limestone. A further point of connexion between the rocks
of the two localities is the occurrence of white quartzite in associa
tion with the limestone at several places in Strath, and of represen
tatives of the well-known “fucoid beds” at Ord, in Sleat.         These
latter strata form a persistent band between the base of the lime
stone and the top of the quartzite, which may be traced all the way
from the extreme north of Sutherland southward into Skye.
    Palaeontological evidence confirms and completes the proof that
the limestone is of Lower Silurian age. The Author has obtained
from the limestone of Ben Suardal, near Broadford, a number of
fossils which are specifically identical with those in the Durness
Limestone, and so closely resemble them in lithological aspect that
the whole might be believed to have come from the same crag.
Among the fossils are species of Cyclonema, Murchisonia, Maclurea,
 Orthoceras, and Piloceras.
   The relations of the limestones containing these fossils to the
other rocks were traced by the Author. He showed that the Lias
rests upon the Silurian limestone with a strong unconformability,
 and contains at its base a coarse breccia or conglomerate, chiefly
 composed of pieces of Silurian limestone, with fragments of chert and
 quartzite. The metamorphism for which Strath has been so long
noted is confined to the Silurian limestone, and has been produced
by the intrusion of large bosses of granophyre (Macculloch's “sy
enite”) belonging to the younger, or Tertiary series of igneous
rocks.

    ON ELECTRICITY PRODUCED BY THE FRICTION OF DROPS.
                    BY J. ELSTER AND H. GEITEL.
THEas authors
         follows:–
                  sum up the results to which their investigation leads
  (1) If the current of a spray-producer is directed against a solid
wetted with water, any electrification which may be observed must
not necessarily be attributed to friction against the surface. In
this mode of arranging the experiment, the inductive action of even
very low tensions in the air exerts a preponderating influence.
Even where the droplets are leaving the mouth of the spray
producer in the unelectrified condition, the plate which receives the
droplets must be charged by induction to the potential of the
neighbourhood by the droplets.
   It follows from this that experiments on the excitation of elec
tricity by the friction of drops must be received with the greatest
reserve, if suitable measures are not taken to eliminate the electro
motive forces produced by induction, or to make an allowance for
the disturbance which they produce, a problem the complete solu
tion of which has hitherto failed us.
   (2) On some bodies on which there is no wetting, the excitation
of electricity by friction preponderates so considerably over that by
induction that the influence of the latter may in most cases be dis
regarded.                                                -
   To these bodies belong those whose surface is coated with wax,
shellac, sulphur, or fat. The leaves of certain plants were found
to be particularly active.
   A jet of water which disperses in drops acts like a spray
 roducer.
   (3) If metal plates are coated with liquids which do not moisten,
a powerful electrification may be imparted to them by causing an
extremely fine jet of water to glide over them in such a way that the
place of dispersion is over or on the plate. For the success of this
experiment it is necessary that the electrical layer should be a good
insulator.    If this is not the case, as, for instance, with the leaves
of plants, electrification is only found in the discontinuous part
of the jet.

                    all the cases mentioned under (2) and (3) the
        £, isInnegative,    and therefore the water is positive.
   (4) Bodies of such high temperature that Leidenfrost's drops
form on them may also be electrified by friction. All the circum
stances which favour the occurrence of the spheroidal condition of
a liquid, also produce an increase of the electromotive force at the
place at which the solid and liquid surfaces are in contact. In this
the electrification of hot water is negative; when the spheroidal
condition ceases it is positive, and below 110° to 120° there is no
appreciable disengagement of electricity.
   The deportment of ether is analogous; at the ordinary tempera
ture it electrifies the rubbed body positively, and at higher tempe
ratures negatively.

   A NEW INSTRUMENT FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF RADIATION.
                           BY C. C. HUTCfIINS.
    The difficulties which attend the use of the thermopile as an
 accurate measurer of radiations are familiar to all who have had
 any experience with that instrument. The slowness of its indica
 tions, and the long time required for it to return to zero, are
 defects which entirely unfit it for many delicate experiments.
    It occurred to the writer that sensitiveness to radiation might as
 well be secured by employing a very thin thermal junction with
 some condensing arrangement, as by the use of several pairs of
 stout bars as in the ordinary thermopile; for the thin junction
 would be heated to a much higher temperature than a thick one by
 a given quantity of heat, and have the great advantage of quickly
 parting with its heat and returning to the temperature of the
 surrounding atmosphere.
    The instrument is constructed upon these principles as follows:—
 A tube of vulcanite ten inches long, two and a half inches in dia
 meter, is stopped near the middle by a plug of wood. The tube is
 made separable, and this plug serves to unite its two halves as well
 as to support the working parts. Through the plug pass two
 small copper rods projecting about an inch above the plug towards
 the front of the instrument, and passing out through its back,

junction; B, concave mirror; D, stop.
   The thermal junction is made by uniting with hard solder a bit
of watch-spring and a bit of flattened copper wire. The whole is
then worked to a ribbon 1 millim. wide, '03 millim. thick and
25 millim. long. The two ends of this ribbon are then soldered to
the two copper rods so that the junction may be midway between
them.
   A concave mirror of glass, silvered upon first surface, is so
secured upon the plug that the junction is exactly at its focus.
The front of the tube is provided with an opening of any convenient
size, and stops to limit the diameter of the entering ray.
   The accompanying sketch will make the details clear. Its
working has been very satisfactory. It requires no longer to
return to zero than for the galvanometer-needle to come to rest,
and is correspondingly rapid and dead-beat in its action. It is
much more sensitive than a thermopile of the same exposed area.

    APPARATUS FOR ILLUSTRATING THE FALL OF BODIES IN A
                      WACUUM.      BY J. PULUJ.
   This apparatus has the advantage over others that it demonstrates
the property that all bodies fall at the same rate in vacuo in a very
simple manner and always with certainty. It consists of a glass
tube 4 centim. wide, and 150 centim. in length, closed at both
ends, having been previously exhausted; in it are contained the
bodies, an iron bullet 1.5 centim. in diameter, and a light feather, in
the quill-end of which is a fine iron needle-point 2 millim. in
length. At the bottom of the vertical tube a caoutchouc stopper is
inserted to protect the glass tube from breakage by the falling
bullet; and at the top a brass flanged tubulure is cemented, in
which an electromagnet with an iron core can be screwed. The
tube is suspended vertically in the fork of a wooden support, by
means of two pegs affixed to the electromagnet. For exciting the
electromagnet a powerful battery of about 3 Bunsen's elements, or
an accumulator consisting of three coils, is used.
   To make the experiment, the tube is gently inclined until the
feather and the ball are in the field of the electromagnet, the
electrical current is closed, and the tube placed on the support.
Both the feather and the ball are held at the top of the glass tube,
and fall simultaneously the moment the current is opened.—

ATTEMPT TO APPLY THE DIFFUSION OF GASES AND WAPOURS
   THROUGH POROUS BODIES TO DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF
   MOISTURE AND CARBONIC          ACID IN THE SURROUNDING AIR.
   BY F. SCHIDLOWSKY.
   The author has repeated the experiments of Dufour on the
diffusion of air and aqueous vapour, and has come to the conclusion
that in this phenomenon the absorption of vapour by porous bodies
plays an important part.
   If, for instance, we take a closed porous cylinder which contains
dry air under ordinary atmospheric pressure, and in connexion
with a water-manometer, and we place it in another cylinder in
which the air is always saturated with aqueous vapour by the
 presence of water, then, according to Dufour, the manometer at
 once shows a decrease of pressure of about 10 to 12 millim, which
 afterwards becomes equalized.
    Conversely, when the same cylinder is filled with moist air, and
 brought inside a dry cylinder, there is an increase of about 20
 millim., which also is afterwards equalized.
    These phenomena are thus explained by the author:—

78            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   Between both sides of the inner porous cylinder there is obviously
a difference of pressure equal to the pressure of vapour at the
temperature of the experiment. The air goes from the interior
of the body (in the first experiment) towards the outside, and the
vapour in the opposite direction; but the latter is absorbed by the
porous sides, and we have first of all a decrease of pressure, which
rapidly vanishes, since the vapour diffuses, according to Graham's
law, more rapidly than dry air. The author explains in an ana
logous manner the converse experiment of Dufour. Similar experi
ments of his own, which essentially agree with those of Dufour,
have confirmed this explanation.
   The author applies the diffusion of gases and vapours through
porous bodies to the construction of a hygrometer, or gas-indicator.
The hygrometer in question consists of a vessel (cylinder) which is
filled with water, connected with a water-manometer, and covered
by a porous plate. If this apparatus is brought into free air, the
manometer soon rises, and the higher, the further the surrounding
air is from the point of saturation with aqueous vapour. .
   The manometer falls when the vessel is filled not with water but
with sulphuric acid, and thus dry air is present. The change of
pressure is a function of the temperature, and is different for
different porous plates. The apparatus can be easily graduated.—

           ON ELECTRICAL TRANSPORTATION IN LIQUIDS.
                          BY S. TERESCHIN.
   The transport of liquids in capillary tubes by constant electrical
currents has hitherto been investigated for comparatively small
electrical forces.
   At the suggestion of Prof. Quincke, instead of a constant voltaic
current, I used the electrical current which flows to earth from the
inner coating of a Leyden jar through the column of liquid, and
through a sensitive reflecting-galvanometer. The outer coating
 of the Leyden jar of flint glass was put to earth. The inner
 coating was kept at constant potential by rotating a Holtz's machine;
 and thiselectrical potential P was measured by a Righi's electrometer
 with bifilar suspension, in electrostatic units of the C.G.S. system.
 By multiplying these numbers by 300 we get the electrical potential
 expressed in volts.
    In these observations I used an apparatus of the same construc
 tion as that used by Prof. Quincke; it had a flint glass tube 0.738
 millim. in diameter, which was inclined at an angle p with
 the horizon.    The distance a of the electrodes was 289 millim.
 The third platinum wire interposed between the two former, made
 it possible to diminish to one half the length of column of the
 liquid traversed by the current.
    The results collated in the following tables give the observations
 for water, methylic and ethylic alcohols. The first column gives

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.          79
the difference of potential P in C.G.S. units; the second the dis
placement of the meniscus of the liquid; the third the current in
amperes. The last column contains the constant called b by Prof.
Quincke, calculated from the equation:

     If greater forces were used, water showed a sudden change of
 resistance as soon as the electrical force P/a in the liquid exceeded
 a certain limiting value; the deflection of the galvanometer-needle
 exhibited a sudden fall of potential. This sudden fall is analogous
 to that which is observed in dielectric liquids, and is explained by
 the sudden occurrence of an electrolytic decomposition *. The
 limiting value of P/a for water is considerably less than for good
insulating liquid dielectrics. As a rough approximation we may put
for it the value 1:32 to 1:45 C.G.S. in the case of the whole length,
and 1.61 to 1.98 C.G.S in the case of half the length.
    I found no alteration with alcohol.
    Observations on other dielectrics, as bisulphide of carbon, ether,
 oil of turpentine, and rape-oil, all showed a considerable transport
in the direction of the positive current. I could not, however,
obtain constant numbers.—Wiedemann's Annalen, No. 10, 1887.
        ELECTRICAL IMPRESSIONS.                  BY K. TSCHECHOWITSCH.
    If a glass plate is laid on tinfoil, and on the glass a coin, and if
the two metals are connected with the two conductors of an
electrical machine, then, as Karsten has shown, after a greater or
less number of turns of the machine, the coin can be removed, and
by breathing on the glass, an impression is produced of the coin
which laid on the glass.
    The author has observed that such impressions may be easily
fixed on glass, if, instead of breathing on the glass, it be coated with
a dilute solution of stearine, yellow oxide of mercury, oxide of zinc,
or the like in benzol.
    If the glass is covered with a thin layer of fat (vaseline is best) the
coin leaves directly on the glass after electrification a perfectly
distinct impression.                              -
    The figures differ with the kind of electricity with which the coin
is charged.—Beiblåtter der Physik, No. 10, 1887 (from the Journal
of the Russian Physical and Chemical Society, 1887).

                   By Prof. LUDwig BoLTZMANN".
     § 1. On Avogadro's Law and the Coefficient of Friction.
IN my former papers on the              £                     of a mixture
       of two gases, I have nowhere made mention of the phy
sically less important case when the molecules of one of the
mixed gases come into collision among themselves compara
tively seldom, or when the number (N1) of molecules in the
unit volume is greatly smaller for the one gas than the number
(N2) for the other.
   In reference to this, Prof. Tait, in his first paper on this
subject in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edin
burgh f, on page 78, reckons the following amongst the
necessary assumptions for the proof of Boyle’s law —“That
there is perfectly free access for collision between each pair of
particles, whether of the same or of different systems; and
that, in the mixture the number of particles of one kind is
not overwhelmingly greater than that of the other kind;” and
adds to it the remark:—“This is one of the essential points
which seem to be wholly ignored by Boltzmann and his com
mentators. There is no proof given by them that one system,
while regulating by its internal collisions the distribution of
energy among its own members, can also by impacts regulate
the distribution of energy among the members of another

£ when these are not free to collide with one another
  n fact, if (to take an extreme case) the particles of one system
 were so small, in comparison with the average distance be
 tween any two contiguous ones, that they practically had
 no mutual collisions, they would behave towards the par
 ticles of another system much as Le Sage supposed his ultra
 mundane corpuscles to behave towards particles of gross
matter &c.”
    Against this reproach I endeavoured to defend both myself
and those who in their later investigations have followed a
 similar line of thought (who are            £           intended by Prof.
 Tait's word “commentators”) in the paper “On the Assump
tions necessary for the Theoretical Proof of Avogadro's Law,”*
where on page 629 I have provedf the following general
equation:—

    In obtaining this equation I have generally made precisely
the same assumptions as Professor              #        except that I have
 not made the least assumption with reference to the relative
 magnitude of the diameters X and A of the molecules of the
 two gases, nor as to the magnitude of the ratio NI : Ng. For
 the stationary condition              : dt must vanish; whence it
 follows, as I have repeatedly shown, that:
     (1) #ach of the gases assumes Maxwell’s distribution of
        velocities (or, as Prof. Tait says, the special condition);
     (2) The mean kinetic energy of a molecule is the same for
        both gases.           -
     Simply to show why, in my former papers, I have not spe
 cially mentioned the cases where A. A or N1 - N2 have very
 small or very large values, I remark that these propositions

    f The calculations here referred to, as well as those upon the Heat
 equilibrium of Heavy Gases (cf. § 4 of the text), may be considerably
 simplified by the use of Lorentz's method, as fully explained in that para
graph. I am indebted to Mr. Burbury for kindly calling my attention to
the possibility of further simplifications, especially by use of the extremely
useful proposition, “that for the relative velocity after impact with given
magnitude and direction of velocities before impact, but with optional
line of centres, every direction is equally probable,” and I shall probably
return to all these points on some subsequent occasion.

 hold good for any values whatever of X, A, and 8; conse
 quently also when X =0, and only A and 8 differ from zero,
  and even if x=A=0, and only # differs from zero, which
  amounts to the assumption that neither the molecules of the
  first kind nor those of the second kind enter into collisions
  amongst themselves, but only the molecules of the first kind
  enter into collision with those of the second kind. It is quite
 unintelligible to me how Prof. Tait can represent" the matter
  as if this latter assumption were a fundamental assumption,
 which I had excluded from my investigations, so that my
 results would only hold good under this latter assumption.
     If the molecule-diameter is very much less for the one kind
 of gas than for the other, so that, for example, A is nearly zero
 and A nearly equal to 28, we have the case considered by
 Prof. Tait in the passage quoted, that the molecules of the
 first kind of gas enter into collision amongst themselves very
 seldom, but, on the contrary, very frequently with those of
 the other kind. It follows at once from the above formula,
 that then also the molecules of the first kind of gas are brought
 into the special condition only by collision with those of the
 other kind of gas, and the mean kinetic energy of a molecule
 must be the same for both gases, and moreover very quickly,
 if only the impacts of molecules of the first kind with those of
 the second kind occur very frequentlyf. This case is the
 clearest example that the special condition and Avogadro's
 law may both hold under circumstances which Prof. Tait
 expressly excludes from their action.
     Also the second just-mentioned paper of Prof. Tait contains
  not the least proof that in this simplest case Avogadro's law
 ceases to hold or does not hold under the special condition of
 one of the gases, or that in any other respect the objection con
  tained in the quotation given above is justified. For, from the
  circumstance that in this case Prof. Tait's proof of Avogadro's
  law is no longer applicable, it does not obviously follow that
  the law itself ceases to hold good. Prof. Tait's second paper
  contains, on the contrary, simply general statements, supported
  by English and Greek quotations, that my assumptions are not
 allowable. But how, if these assumptions are not allowable,
 can I be reproached with having ignored them in my former

   + Only if the molecules of a certain kind enter into collision both with
each other and with the rest only very seldom, then, as a matter of course,
the special condition will also be reached by these very late. But not to
have mentioned this cannot be made a reproach either to me or any one
of my commentators, since there was not the least occasion to do so.

84            Prof. L. Boltzmann on some Questions
 aper? Again, how can Prof. Tait say, on page 255, “I
£      not yet seen any attempt to prove that two sets of par
ticles which have no internal collisions tend to the state
assumed by Prof. Boltzmann,” after he has not said one word
in actual refutation of my proof, and in the Philosophical
Magazine even admits its correctness, no doubt without
having read it. But this seems to be the usual habit of my
illustrious critic, not to read the works of those authors upon
which he sits in judgment. Only in this way can we explain
why he has given (on page 260 of his second paper) as new the
same formula for the coefficient of friction which I have ob
tained essentially in the same way as Prof. Tait, in my treatise
“On the Theory of Gaseous Friction,” partii.*, and have given
as formula (9), page 45; the coefficient of B in the expression
which Prof. Tait gives in line 14 of the page quoted is the
coefficient of friction.      If in this coefficient we substitute for
C1 the value given by Prof. Tait on page 257 and replace the
letters P and s by m and 8 respectively, we obtain precisely
my formula (9). Of course, my formula (8) on page 44 also
agrees exactly with the value found by Prof. Tait on page 73 of
his first paper for ev, which moreover O. E. Meyer had already
calculated before me.
   If Prof. Tait had read my paper he might also have spared
himself the trouble of the numerical evaluation of the definite
integral, since I have already given (in the formula (9)
quoted) the numerical value C : 37t=0.08894.26; whence by
multiplication by 3T=942478 we obtain exactly Tait's value
C1=0.838, only that I have attempted greater accuracy.
   If, in the same place, I have not treated diffusion and con
duction of heat according to the same method which Prof.
Tait has adopted, this is simply partly because the calculations
in question can be easily effected without this in the same
form ; partly because, as I have shown both in the passage
referred to and in the first part of my “Theory of Gaseous
Friction,”f at the beginning of the first section, this method
does not yield that which at first sight it seems to yield. In
this expression (first calculated by me) for the coefficient of
friction, exactly as in the older expressions of Maxwell, terms
of the same order of magnitude as those giving the result are
neglected, and it is therefore not possible to tell whether one
comes closer to the truth than the other.
   This also appears in the great uncertainty of the results to
which this method leads. E. Meyer, in his book ‘The Kinetic
Theory of Gases’ (Breslau, 1877), has already followed a line
of thought essentially similar, although £ more tedious,

but  fundamentally equally sound, and obtained (on page 320)
a different numerical result.
   If we wish to neglect as few terms as possible of the order
of magnitude of the coefficient of friction, we must improve
the method adopted by Tait and myself, which in fact leads
to Meyer's numerical result. We must in fact observe that
each molecule in its path passes through layers in which a
progressively different motion of masses prevails, and that
consequently the probability of collision has a different value
in each layer. If we adopt Prof. Tait's notation exactly, then,
taking this circumstance into account, his conclusion must be
modified somewhat as follows. As on page 259 of his second
paper, let the layer of gas parallel to the y2-plane which has
the abscissa a move with the mean velocity Bic parallel to the
Y-axis. If in the unit volume there are, on the whole, n
molecules, then, according to Prof. Tait, there are
                           n . v. e.v. de
molecules emitted in unit time by the unit surface of the layer
lying between a and c + d e whose velocities lie between v and
v-Edv. We will denote the product ev by f(e). If, further, we
put
                 p:   V: e-hp(p°4-q24-r?) dp dq dr,
                           1,3
we obtain
     No=ndp d4 dr dw     V'. e-***(vFFIP)                   -
for the number of molecules emitted by the layer whose
velocity relative to the resultant motion of the layer has com
£ along the three axes of coordinates which respectively
 ie between the limits p and p +dp, q and q+dq, r and r+dr.
But since the layer itself has the velocity B." in the direction
of the Y-axis, the components of the absolute velocity of these
emitted molecules lie between the limits p and p +dp, q + Bx
and q + Bx +dq, and r and r + dr. Of these No molecules
let N:          further coming into collision, reach the plane of
abscissa #. Let us further imagine the layer which lies between
# and #4-d; constructed, ' ask how many of our N mole
cules will come into collision in this layer. As Prof. Tait
finds in his first paper (p. 73), in a layer whose mean velocity
is zero, during the time dt out of N molecules, which all move
with the same velocity v, N.e. v. dt = N dt. f(v) molecules
come into collision.
   In the above case the N molecules have velocity-components
p, q+B.e., r in the directions of the axes of coordinates, but
the layer itself has the mean velocity B: in the direction of
the Y-axis; the relative motion is therefore exactly as if the

86           Prof. L. Boltzmann on some     Questions
layer itself were at rest, but the N molecules had the velocity
                  v=Vp”--(q+ Bx-B3)*-**.
The time dt which each of the N molecules requires to pass
through the layer is d£: p. Since the number of impacts is
evidently dependent simply upon the relative motion, the
number of £ of our N molecules which in the layer d5
come into collision is
              N/(v/p +(q+ Bx-Ba)"H r").          #
   This expression also gives the decrease of the number N in
the layer d5, and may £ be denoted by –dN. If the
total velocity of the layers is very small in comparison with
the velocity of the molecular motion, B may be taken to be
very small, and the function f may be determined according
to Taylor's theorem. If, further, we put f for f(v/p + q + r.)
and f" for f'(v/p"H-7'-Fr"), where the dash denotes the derived
function, we have

 plane shows that the equal oppositely-directed momentum from

    This is exactly the expression found by O. E. Meyer. I
will not assert that it is really more accurate than that
calculated by Prof. Tait and myself, since by other methods
 one would obtain other numerical results; but it is at least
 of equal authority. This value is smaller than that calculated
 by Maxwell for the coefficient of friction by about one twen
tieth, whilst the value calculated by Prof. Tait is nearly as much
greater.
    The remarks here made at length with reference to gaseous
friction of course apply equally to Prof. Tait's method of
calculating diffusion and conduction of heat.
   Two other points connected with the theory of gaseous
friction may be mentioned here:—
    (1) If a gas move as a whole, with a constant very small

88            Prof. L. Boltzmann on some Questions
velocity b, in the direction of the y-axis, then the number of
molecules whose absolute velocity lies between v and v+dv,
and makes with the positive y-axis an angle lying between e
and e-Ede, is equal to

    If we consider all the molecules having a given absolute
velocity v, we find for their mean velocity parallel to the
y-axis the value

 which, for small values of b, reduces to         *.      which latter
 value is of course more easily obtained by assuming b very
 small at once. The mean velocity parallel to the y-axis is
 therefore not perhaps equal to b for all molecules, but greater
 for the more rapid molecules. If b is not constant, but equal
 to B.", as is the case in gaseous friction, then also the mean
 momentum of the molecules which have the velocity v is not
                         #
 equal to PBw, but to PBæv°. If we leave all of Prof. Tait's
 calculations completely unaltered, but simply substitute for
 the expression PB", which he introduces in his second paper
 (p. 260, line 6 from the top), the expression         #PB"      here
 found, we again arrive at O. E. Meyer’s formula for the
 coefficient of friction (cf. Part ii. of my “Theory of Gaseous
 Friction, p. 46). We have then applied the right correction
 at once for the order of magnitude B to the motion of each
 molecule, and for the rest may take as the basis of our calcu
 lation the special condition of a gas at rest.
     (2) A condition of a single gas which is totally different
 from the special condition must no doubt approach the special
 condition with the same rapidity as the mean kinetic energy
 of a molecule becomes equalized in two mixed gases; but it
  does not follow that any unimportant deviation from the
  special condition following a certain regularity—as, for
  example, is produced by gaseous friction—will be equalized
  with the same rapidity. On this latter point, I believe a
  conclusion is to be obtained only from the equations which I
  have given in my older papers, and which allow the cal
  culation of a quantity which is a minimum for the special

                 in the Kinetic Theory of Gases.                     89
condition. The difference between the value which this quan
tity has for a given condition and this minimum value gives
us a measure of how far this condition differs from the spe
cial condition; the value of the differential quotient of this
quantity by the time, gives the rapidity with which this
condition approaches the special condition.
   To return again to the proof of Avogadro's law, in what was
said at the commencement, as well as in all my older papers, no
limiting assumption is made with regard to the ratio NI : N2,
but it is always taken for granted that the smaller of these
numbers is very large, though the greater may be many
times larger. M. urbury * goes still further, since he
maintains that the two propositions given at the commence
 ment of this section also hold good even when of the one
kind of gas only a single molecule is present. With this
assertion, which of course has simply a mathematical interest
 but no physical application, I have agreed, and do so still.
 Since, however, the validity of this assertion is again an
 entirely new question, on which the correctness of what has
 been said does not in the least depend, I will not further
 prolong the controversy by its discussion, and will onl
 remark that the objection of Prof. Tait with reference to the
 reversal of direction of all the velocities, which cannot take
 place until the occurrence of the special condition, and then
 must affect not one only but all the molecules, has already
 been answered in my paper, “Remarks on some Problems of
 the Mechanical Theory of Heat”f. From an arbitrarily
 chosen, not special, condition we pass under Burbury's
 assumption (possibly not until after a very long time) into
 the special condition. If, therefore, we were to reverse the
 directions of all the velocities at the commencement of the
 selected condition, we should, inversely perhaps, not reach (or
 only during some time) conditions still further removed from
 the special condition; we should more probably, also in the
 reverse direction, reach the special condition.                   -
   § 2. On the Proof of Maxwell's Law of the Distribution of
                              Velocities.
    Prof. Tait admits, in his second paper, that his first proof
 of this law is defective, inasmuch as the reason he gives £ it,
that F(xyz) must be the product of three functions, of which
 one contains only r, the second only y, and the third only 2,
 is not valid.   By F(xyz)dic dy dz we are therefore to under

90           Prof. L. Boltzmann on some Questions
stand the probability that the component velocities of a
molecule estimated along the axes of coordinates lie respec
tively between v and v+da, y and y + dy, and z and z + d2.
But in what Prof. Tait has recently said in his second paper
on pp. 252 and 253, I see anything but an exact and cogent
proof of this. That that group of molecules which he
designates as the minority would behave exactly as if it
alone were shut in between two material planes, and as if all
lines of centres were parallel to these planes at the moment of
impact, is indeed asserted by Prof. Tait, but without the least
proof; for since a molecule of this minority must come into
collision with a molecule of the majority infinitely oftener than
with another molecule of the minority, in which continuall
the a-, y-, and z-components of the velocities are exchanged,
it is inconceivable why the molecules of the minority should
behave as if they alone were present, if we do not assume
Maxwell's law of distribution of velocities as already proved.
The condition of the molecules of the minority will no
doubt be stationary, but also dependent upon the condition
of the molecules of the majority. But the relative motion of
the molecules of the minority with reference to those of the
majority is different for different values of the velocity w, with
which very nearly all the molecules of the minority move
parallel to the axis of abscissae. Hence the relative pro
bability of the different values of the y- and z-components of
the velocity might also quite well depend upon the value of c
for the minority-molecules in question.
   Let us suppose, to take a case chosen at random, that w is
equal to twice the mean velocity of a molecule, or even some
what larger. Then there will be very few molecules of the
majority which have small velocities relatively to those of the
minority. Relative to each molecule of the minority, more
than half the molecules of the majority will move with a
velocity which is equal to the double mean velocity, or still
greater. Since this large relative velocity in the impacts is
continually transformed into velocity parallel to the Y- and
Z-axis, it might quite well be possible that for so large a value
of a amongst the molecules of the minority, large velocity
components in the Y and Z direction would prevail; whereas
for small values of w among the molecules of the minority, the
small y- and z-components of velocity would predominate.
From the behaviour of the different groups of a community,
we can therefore only conclude that the number of those
molecules of the minority for which the velocity-components
estimated along the Y- and Z-axis lie between y and y +dy or
2 and 2+dz, as the case may be, always remains the same on

                in the Kinetic Theory of Gases.                91
the whole, and is therefore independent of the time t, but not
that the ratio of this number to the total number of the
minority molecules is independent of w. I put here, side-by
side with the dictum of De Morgan, this other, that it is just
in the calculation of probabilities that one must not be satisfied
with general statements, but must sharply prove each assump
tion at the risk of becoming dull as the result of clear logical
developments. The bare expansibility of mathematical deve
lopments can hardly be taken to be the test of their applicability
to Physics.
   But with Prof. Tait's proof of Maxwell's law of distribution
of velocities there falls also his proof of Avogadro's law, which
implies the first law; or at least it becomes superfluous, since
in Maxwell's second and my proof of the first law, Avogadro's
law is, without this, proved at once. Another proof of
Maxwell's law of distribution of velocities, however, does not
yet exist.
    (If the gas were supposed to be in constant motion, then we
must understand by w the difference of the component velocities
of a molecule from the mean velocity of all the molecules;
and the like must hold for y and z, in order that the distribu
tion of velocity among the molecules of the minority may be
the same function of w, y, z as with a gas at rest.)
                § 3. On the Mean Length of Path.
    The mean length of path of a gaseous molecule is most
 naturally defined, according to Maxwell's proposal, as the
 arithmetic mean of all the paths which all the molecules in the
 unit volume describe between one impact and the next. Prof.
 Tait, on the other hand, proposes (in the first paper of the
 ‘Edinburgh Transactions, p. 74) to fix attention upon all the
 molecules in the unit volume at a particular instant, and to
 observe what path each of these molecules describes from the
   iven moment until it next comes into collision, and of all
 £ paths to take the arithmetic mean. In Maxwell’s
 method we take into the arithmetic mean so many paths of
 each molecule as it makes impacts in the unit of time; in
 Tait's method, on the other hand, only a single path of each
 molecule is counted.      Since the swifter molecules come into
 collision more frequently, and generally describe a longer path
 from one impact to the next than the slower ones, in the first
 method the longer paths are counted relatively oftener, and
 therefore the mean must come out greater than in the second.
 In order to calculate the mean path according to the first
  method, we observe all the impacts which each molecule

92           Prof. L. Boltzmann on some Questions
contained in the unit volume suffers during an entire second,
and note all the paths which each molecule describes between
two consecutive impacts, and take the arithmetic mean of all
these paths. If, according to Prof. Tait's notation, there are
n molecules in the unit volume, of which n . no have a velo
city lying between v and v+dv, so that Xn, E1, and if these
latter molecules come into collision with other molecules
N. times in the second, and describe a mean path p, so
that N. . p = v, then, since N, gives at once how many
paths each of the n : n, molecules describes in the second,
the mean path, according to Maxwell's definition, is
                   X. _*nn, N.       – 2n."
                     *T Xnn, N, T Sn,": p.
   This is exactly the formula which Maxwell*, O. E. Meyert,
&c. use, and which gives x1=0-0707X. Here X is the mean
path which a molecule would have if all the others, without
alteration of magnitude and number, included in the unit
volume were at rest. According to the method proposed by
Prof. Tait, we have to take of each of the n . no molecules,
not N. members, but only one member, p, in the arithmetical
mean; and so we obtain
                      - >nn, po
                  X2= >nn, =Xn, p =0.677A.
   In accordance with what has been said, it will be seen that
Prof. Tait is decidedly in the wrong if he designates Maxwell's
definition of mean path as an erroneous one; on the contrary,
it seems to me more natural than either of Prof. Tait's new
definitions. For those who care for numerical results, I may

tigations, which remained unpublished, I found

Prof. Tait. The total number of impacts which all £ mole

>nn, N, =Xnnev : pp.       Only the third of these integrals, as
already remarked in § 1, was published in the £ part of
my “Theory of Gaseous Friction,” in formula 9, p. 45. One
other circumstance deserves mention. We have spoken all the
time as if during the entire second the same n . no molecules
would move with a velocity lying between v and v+dv. In
fact, the velocities of the molecules are constantly changing;
but since, on the whole, for a molecule which loses the   #
r, another gains the same velocity, the above expression does
not lead to a false result.
  $4. On the Heat-equilibrium of Gases upon which External
                             Forces act.
    Prof. Tait, in his first paper in the Edinburgh Transactions,
page 91, also raises objections to my calculation of the heat
equilibrium of a gas on which external forces act, and treats
this case differently, starting from an assumption, which he
gives in italics on page 92 of the paper referred to at the
conclusion of § 31.
   We have to distinguish between a defining-assumption, the
object of which is to define the problem which is to be mathe
matically handled, and an unproved assertion that, from the
defining-assumptions made, certain consequences would follow.
If, for example, we assume that the molecules are elastic
spheres, that glass walls are rigid elastic planes, &c., these are
defining-assumptions. In nature these assumptions are cer
tainly not exactly fulfilled, but the logical consequence of the
conclusions drawn from them is not thereby affected. But
 Prof. Tait's above-cited assertion is of the latter kind, since
he gives no proof that it is a mathematical consequence of the
defining-assumptions made. Also I am sure that my defining
assumptions in many respects correspond extremely imper
 fectly with the properties of the actual gas. On the other
hand, both my proof of Avogadro's law, and my calculation
of the heat-equilibrium of a heavy gas, are free from preju
dicial and unproved assumptions. In order to show this I
will give what seems to me a greatly simplified treatment of
 this problem, using the results of others which have appeared
 in the last twelve years upon this subject. And in this I will
 make use altogether of the method which H. A. Lorentz, in

94           Prof. L. Boltzmann on some Questions
his treatise “On the Equilibrium of Potential Energy amongst
Gaseous Molecules,”" was the first to employ.
   I assume that we have a gas constituted in the usual way
entirely of similarly constituted monatomic gaseous molecules,
and enclosed in a vessel bounded on all sides by solid walls.
For the sake of simplicity we will suppose the form of the
vessel unalterable. Let each molecule be a solid absolutely
elastic sphere of mass m, which also is infinitely little de
formed upon impact, and whose diameter is vanishingly small
in comparison with the mean path. We also suppose the
£ to be reflected against the walls of the vessel as
perfectly elastic.
   Besides these elastic forces, now let external forces act upon
the gaseous molecules, and let mx, my, m2 be the compo
nents, estimated along the axes of coordinates of the external
force which acts upon a molecule the coordinates of whose
centre are w, y, z. Let these external forces be independent
of the time, but have a potential, and let them be nearly con
stant within a space of the dimensions of a mean path. We
will construct the diagram of velocities by drawing from the
centre of coordinates a straight line to represent the velocit
of each molecule in direction and magnitude. We will ''
the end-points of the straight lines thus obtained the “velocity
points” of the corresponding molecules.          From all the mole
cules we choose those for which the coordinates of the centre
lie between the limits
           w and a 4-dw, y and y + dy, 2 and 2+dz; . (1)
and the component-velocities between the limits
        # and #4-dà,     m and n +dn, & and #4-d£; . .             (2)
 and of these we will say that they lie in the parallelepiped
 dw dy dz, and their velocity-point in the parallelepiped d5 dm d8.
 The number of these molecules will be denoted by
                     f(x, y, z, #, m, & t) do do,     •  *   *   * (3)
where
                   do=dwdy dz, do=d: dn d8.
    We write here also the time t under the functional sign in
 order to include the general case that the gas is in motion
 under the influence of external forces: for the condition of rest,
 of course, the function f must be independent of the time.
    Let us now, following Lorentz, imagine a second function

                 in the Kinetic Theory of Gases.             95
formed of the seven variables r, y, z, #, m, £, t, which we will
denote by p. This function may be chosen quite arbitrarily.
It may be altogether independent of the function f, or may be
connected with it in any way whatever (e. g. it may be iden
tical with f, or equal to the natural logarithm off, &c.). If
we substitute in b the coordinates and component velocities
                                                         #
of the centre of any molecule, we obtain the value of COrre
sponding to the molecule in question at the time t. The sum
of the values of p corresponding to all the molecules at the
time t we will denote by X(p).

where the sign y denotes an integration with reference to the
variables #, m, from -oo to + co, but with reference to the
variables a, y, z over the whole volume of the vessel. A
change of the sum X4, will be produced during an infinitely
small time 8t by various causes:
    (1) By the function b explicitly containing the time. The

velocity-components #4-X8t, m+Yôt, #4-Zöt.            The whole

   Strictly speaking, those molecules ought to be excluded
from the integration which during the time Bt come into
collision with each other.      But since the number of these
molecules is infinitely small, like 8t, and the integral moreover
is multiplied by 8t, there result thus only terms of the order
of magnitude (8t)”, which may be neglected.
   (3) If Xq, suffers a change in consequence of the impacts
which occur during the time 8t, this change also, which
we will denote by 8.X p, must be taken into account. I
  roceed exactly as Lorentz does in the paper referred to.
W.    choose from all the impacts which occur in the paralelle
piped dw dydz during the time 8t only those for which, before
impact, the velocity-components of one of the impinging
molecules lie between the limits (2), whilst the velocity of the
£imits
         of gravity of the impinging molecules lies between the
         u and u +du, v and v+dv, w and w--dw; . (10)
and, lastly, the direction of the line of centres of both molecules
for the impacts chosen at the moment of impact lies within
an infinitely small cone of given direction in space and of
aperture dA.     If a denotes the diameter of the molecules, W
their relative velocity, and 6 the acute angle of the directions
V and C, then the number of selected impacts is
                dn=a+ffiV cos 6 do do dp dA 8t; .        .  . (11)
where
   f=f(x, y, z, #, m, & t), fi=f(x, y, z, u-#, v-n, w-£, t),
                           dp=du dvdw . . . . . . (12)
    Since we have assumed the masses equal, the velocity
 components of the second of the impinging molecules before
 impact differ infinitely little from u-5, v-n, w–8. After
 impact the velocity-components of the first of the impinging
 £ must lie between the limits
     #' and 3' + d8', n' and n'+dn',       4' and #4-dg'; .    (13)
 those of the second molecule then differ infinitely little from
 u-3', v-n', w—£".
    The function p for the two molecules before impact has
 then the values
      $(w, y, z, #, m, , t) and p(x, y, z, u-#, v-m, w-£, t),
 for which we will write b and b1 for the sake of brevity. But

                  in the Kinetic Theory of Gases.             97
after impact b has for the same molecules the values
   $(t, y, z, #, "', £, t) and p(x, y, z, u-#, v-n', w-#, t),
for which we will write p' and bi'. Infinitely small magni
tudes of the order öt may be neglected (so that in the two last
expressions, for example, t may be written instead of t+8t),
since the quantities b, p, q}, and bi' occur in equation (18)
multiplied by a factor which is itself an infinitely small quan
tity of the order 8t. By each of these impacts, therefore, Xb
is diminished by p + bi , on the other hand, it is increased by
$'+ bi'. By all the selected impacts together, therefore, Xp
is increased by
                       dn(b'+pi'-b-q1).
We will now consider, together with the action of the hitherto
selected impacts, the action of those which in the volume
element do during the time 8t have acted in exactly the
opposite way, and which, for shortness, we will call the re
versed impacts. These latter, therefore, will be just those for
which the velocity-components of the centre of gravity and
the position of the line of centres of the spheres at the moment
 of impact lie between the same limits as for the first selected,
 but for which the velocity-components of the first impinging
 molecule at the moment at     ' the impact begins lie between
 the limits (13); so that those of the second of the impinging
 molecules differ infinitely little from u-#, v-n', w–4. On
 the other hand, as we at once see, for the reversed impacts
 the velocity-components of the first of the impinging mole
 cules after impact lie between the limits (2); but #. of the
 second differ infinitely little from u-á, v-m, w–8. By each
 of the reversed impacts, therefore, Xb is increased by
                          q + pi-b'-bi';
 and if we denote the total number of reversed impacts by dn',
 then during the time 8t their effect is to increase Xb by the
 amount
                      dn'. (p + bi-p'-di').
 This quantity, therefore, by all the first selected impacts and
 the corresponding reversed impacts, is increased by
                 A=(dn—dn')(p + bi'-b-q1). . . . (14)
    Exactly as in formula (11) we have next
                 dn'=a'f''f''V cos 6 do do dp dA 8t, . . (15)

   In order to express do' in terms of do, we must imagine
the magnitude and position of the centre of gravity as well as
the direction of the line of centres at the moment of impact
completely fixed. On the other hand, the velocity-components
of the first of the impinging molecules may vary between the
limits (2). In the accompanying figure, in which the rect
angle # CC" does not necessarily lie in the same plane as the
triangle O#u, let O# be the velocity of                c
the first molecule before impact, Ou
the velocity of the centre of gravity of
both molecules, and #C' the direction

therefore represent respectively the
velocity of the first molecule after                          $
impact, that of the second before,
and that of the second after impact. We have now to kee
the points O and u, and the direction of #C' unchanged,
whereas the point # must describe the whole interior of the
parallelepiped do. Since here the figure ##"CC" is always a
rectangle, and u always remains its centre, we see at once that
the point # describes a parallelepiped do' congruent with the
parallelepiped do, w: represents nothing else than the
product of the differentials di: dn'd?"; consequently do =do'.
(I have given a much more complete account of this trans
formation of coordinates and its relationship to various for
mulae of the kinetic theory of gases in my paper “On the
Assumptions necessary for the        £ of Avogadro's Law.”"
H. A. Lorentz attains the greatest simplicity by using the
velocity-components of the centre of gravity instead of the

all possible values, which we will express by a single integral
Sign.
    In this, however, we must observe that, after performing
the integration, we have counted each impact four times.
Because we have extended the integration over all the first
selected impacts, we have already counted all the impacts
once; by further extending the integration over all the re
versed impacts, we have counted all the impacts a second
time; moreover, both in the first and in the second integration
each separate impact is counted twice, since the molecule with
the velocity-components #m & may be both the first as well as
the second of the impinging molecules.

    The whole increase 8X b, which X4 undergoes during the
 time 8t, is the sum of the expressions (5), (6), (7), and (18).
 Since the function b was left undetermined, there is nothing
 now to prevent our putting
                               $=lf,     "

    This is simply the change which the total number of mole
cules   £ in            the space suffers in the time 8t; and is
 evidently equal to zero, since we assume that the walls of the
 vessel are solid.
    According to formula (6), 8,245 consists of three summa
 tions. Integrating the first of these with reference to w, the
second with reference to y, and the third with reference to 2,
we obtain

the solid walls of the vessel like elastic spheres, those molecules
which strike against the walls of the vessel with certain values
of q, r will return from the wall with the same values of q
# r. The impinging molecules differ from the returning
molecules only in the sign of n. The function f therefore
remains unaltered if q and r remain unaltered and only n
changes its sign, whence it follows that in the integral (20a)
each two terms neutralize each other; consequently this
integral itself has the value 0. So also of the three summa
tions, of which, according to equation (7), the quantity 8:24,
consists, we may integrate the first with reference to #, the
second with reference to n, and the third with reference to £,
between the limits -oo and + oo.             But since for infinite
values of the velocities f must necessarily vanish, we see that
also 8.2% =0.
   If, at the beginning of the time, the gas were contained in
a finite space not enclosed by walls (the integration-space),
then the expression (19) would be negative, and numerically
equal to the number of the molecules which emerge from the
 integration-space during the time 8t. But then the number of
these molecules would be exactly equal to the expression (20),
so that 8.X p + 8,34 would still be equal to zero. So also 8Xb
 would assume a negative value, and 8.Xdb an equal positive
 value, if the velocities of the molecules at the beginning of
 the time were included within finite limits.

the parallelepiped do with the velocity-components X, Y, Z;

exactly like the molecules, and the latter also must be corre
spondingly altered.                                   -

   The number of molecules of the N1 molecules which, durin
the time 8t, come into collision with any others, is £
by integrating the expression given by equation (11) for dn
with reference to all possible values of du, dv, dw, and dA.
The result of this integration may be written thus:

Besides these N3 molecules, all the molecules whose number is
denoted above by N1, after lapse of the time 8t, reach the
parallelepiped do", and their velocity-points the parallelepiped
doo".
   Of the molecules whose centres are in the parallelepiped do
there are, however, during the time 8t some (let their number be
N) which had before altogether other velocities, but by impact
with other molecules have attained exactly such velocities that
their velocity-point after impact lies in the parallelepiped do".
We have therefore N2=N1–N2+N. Observing equations
(23), (24), and (25), and remembering that N, was obtained
from equation (16) by integration exactly as N3 from equa
tion (11), we obtain, since, as already remarked, do" = do and

   The right-hand side of equation (22) is a sum of terms of
which no one can be positive. But since, as soon as the gas
is at rest and does not change its condition, the left-hand side
must vanish, so also each term of the right-hand side must
vanish by itself; and we have generally for any values what
ever of the variables ff. =f'f''.
   Since this equation must hold for all possible values of the
variables occurring in it, so long as only the condition

where h is a constant, and only F involves the variables w, y, z.
In order to determine F we make use of equation (26). We
see at once that since f has the form (28), the expression
f"f'—ff must always vanish, since equation (27) must be
satisfied for every impact. Therefore also the right-hand
side of equation (26) must vanish, and the substitution of the

                 XII. The Recalescence of Iron.
                By HERBERT ToMLINsoN, B.A."
                          Introduction.
MAN: specimens of iron and steel, when they have been
         raised to a white heat and are cooling, exhibit at a
certain stage a remarkable phenomenon—the metal, to all
appearances, receives a sudden accession of heat, and reglows.
This phenomenon was discovered by Professor Barrett, and is
frequently designated the “recalescence” of iron. The author
believes the recalescence of iron to be due to a sudden phy
sical change, the event of which has been retarded by what
he will call “subpermanent retentivity.” The retentivity
of a substance may be defined to be that property by virtue
of which the substance does not immediately recover from
the strain produced by a stress when the stress has been
removed. # the original strain produced by the stress be
large, the residual strain will consist of two parts: one per
manent, which will not disappear even after £ lapse of any
length of time; the other subpermanent, which will disap
pear after a greater or less interval of time, and which may
be aided in doing so by molecular vibrations set up by
mechanical or any physical agency. Subpermanent reten
tivity appears with a great variety of strains:—when a wire is
twisted or bent, when a piece of iron or steel is magnetized,
 when a Leyden jar is charged, and when glass has been raised
in temperature. The last is an example of subpermanent

104                  Mr. Herbert Tomlinson on
strain resulting from thermal agency, and is the strain with
which we have now to deal. Such a strain is not peculiar to
glass; for the author has found that a coil of zinc wire, which
had been previously heated to nearly the melting-point of the
metal and afterwards suddenly cooled by plunging into cold
water, continued to show decrease of volume for some minutes
after the cooling. The internal friction of a metal seems to
be intimately connected with the subpermanent retentivity;
and the author has already investigated the internal fric
tion of several metals at various temperatures". The results
of the above-mentioned investigation show that changes of
temperature, even when they do not exceed 100° C., exercise
a very considerable effect on the internal friction; and it
seemed likely that a preliminary examination of the internal
friction of iron at very high temperatures might be of service
in elucidating the problem of recalescence.
       The Internal Friction of Iron at High Temperatures.
    Experiment I.—In fig. 1, a b is an iron wire 49.5 centim.
 in length and 041 centim. in diameter; the ends a and b are
 brazed to two pieces of rather stout brass wire; the upper
 piece of brass wire is furnished with a binding-screw, S, and
 the lower one is soldered to the centre of a hollow horizontal
brass bar, W.; D is a piece of copper wire soldered at its
 upper extremity to V, and dipping with its lower extremity
 into mercury contained in a glass vessel, H. The wire hangs
 in the axis of a glass tube, T, fitting into the cover of a box,
 B; the tube is closed with a cork, C, and the box B, though
 provided with a door which can be opened for making adjust
 ments or for starting the torsional oscillations, is kept shut
 up during the actual observations. The box is also provided
 with a glass window, which enables an illuminated circle
 crossed by a fine vertical dark line to be thrown on to the
 light mirror, M, and hence be reflected back on to a scale
 according to the usual arrangement. The wire was set in
 torsional oscillation by means of a light feather gently pressed
 against one end of V and then removed f; the amplitudes of
  the vibrations were never allowed to exceed one degree.
     The wire was heated by means of an electric current from
  a battery of 30 Grove cells, an ampere-meter and a set of
 resistances serving respectively to measure and to vary the
    * Phil. Trans. vol. clxxvii. (part ii. 1886) p. 801. Proc. Roy. Soc.
 No. 244 (1886), p. 343.
    + It would have been better to have had a small piece of iron attached to
 V and to have started the vibrations by a magnet on the outside of the box;
 since the amplitudes diminished very rapidly at the higher temperature.

strength of the current. The internal friction of the iron was
measured by the logarithmic decrement of arc of the wire
when set in torsional oscillation.        Part of the whole observed
decrement is due to the friction of the air, and part to the
                                  Fig 1.

 friction of the wire D against the mercury in H. The former
 of these can be calculated from formulae given in the author's
 paper on the internal friction of metals"; the latter by ob
 serving the logarithmic decrement at the temperature of the
 room, first when D dips into the mercury, and again when it
 does not, whilst from this again the effect of the friction of
  the mercury at higher temperatures can be approximately
  determined provided the change wrought in the torsional
 elasticity be known. The logarithmic decrement resulting
 from the friction of the air and the friction of the mercury
 conjointly was small compared with the whole observed
 decrement, and was in all the calculations allowed for.

   106                     Mr. Herbert Tomlinson on
      The logarithmic decrement due to internal friction was
   determined in the first instance before the wire had been
   heated at all, and proved to be
                                     .002203*.
   The wire was now heated to the highest temperature recorded
   in this experiment, and was maintained for about half an hour
   at this temperature, being all the time kept in torsional oscil
   lation; it was then allowed to cool, and immediately after
   cooling was again tested. The logarithmic decrement now
  proved to be                       -019.367.
  After a rest of one hour the logarithmic decrement had con
  siderably diminished, and finally fell to
                                        •00977.
  Lastly, the wire was again raised to the previous high tem
  perature, and as soon as the logarithmic decrement and
  vibration-period had become sensibly constant f their values
   were registered. The temperature was then lowered by put
   ting resistance into the battery-circuit, and a fresh set of
   observations was taken, and so on, until eventually the tem
   perature of the wire was reduced to that of the room, when
  the logarithmic decrement proved to be sensibly the same as
  the one last recorded.            The results of the observations, which
  extended over a period of several days, are given in the
   following table —

     f Any change of temperature, whether in the direction of increase or
  decrease, is always attended in the first instance with a larger internal
  friction than that which ultimately prevails when the vibrations are con
  tinued long enough.

   The temperatures given in the third column of the table
are deduced from the values of the modulus of torsional
elasticity, given in the second column, by means of the
formula
             21–20(1-'0002442t-'0000002510t”)*,
where 2, and 20 are the values of the modulus at t°C. and 0°C.
respectively. This formula was itself deduced from some
very careful observations of the torsional elasticity of iron at
different temperatures between 0° C. and 100° C.; but the
numbers given in the third column must only be regarded as
 rough approximations to the true values; inasmuch as in the
first place the above formula was calculated from observations
 made with a different specimen of annealed iron, and in the
 second it by no means follows that the formula would apply for
 such high temperatures as are here recorded. It would seem,
 however, from the last column of the table, that somewhere
 near 550° C. there begins to be a rapid rise in the internal
 friction of the iron, and another still more rapid rise at a
 temperature of about 1000° C. At this last temperature the
 internal friction becomes so great that only two or three
 vibrations are made by the wire before it comes practically
 to rest; and it is necessary to multiply the observations very
 considerably before any approach to accuracy in the results
 can be attained.        Some idea of the enormous friction en
 countered by the molecules may be arrived at by bearing in
 mind that the logarithmic decrement of a torsionally vibrating
 iron wire at 1000°C. is ten times the logarithmic decrement
 of a tin wire at a temperature of 20°C., tin possessing the
 largest internal friction of any metal yet examined at ordinary
 temperatures.
     From the last line in the table it would seem that the
 internal friction of iron begins to decrease as the temperature
  rises from 1100° C. to 1200°C.; but the numbers here given
  must be received with some caution in so far as they are to be
  used for determining this pointf.
     We tread on surer ground when we compare the second
 and fourth columns together; and it is abundantly evident
  that the decrease of torsional elasticity which ensues on rise
  of temperature bears no comparison with the increase of
 internal friction. It is a common lecture-experiment to
 heat a bell by means of a burner placed underneath, and
    * Proc. Roy. Soc. No. 244 (1886), p. 343.
    t A second set of experiments made with another piece of the same
 wire showed, however, a similar decrease of internal friction but at rather
 a lower temperature.

108                  Mr. Herbert Tomlinson on
to demonstrate that all musical sound departs from the bell
when struck provided the temperature approach a visible red.
This absence of musical sound is generally, if not always,
attributed to diminution of elasticity; but it would seem, from
the above, to be much rather attributable to increase of
internal friction".
    Another point to be noted in this experiment is the large
permanent increase of internal friction produced by the rise
of temperature. This doubtless arose from the fact that,
though the mass of the suspended system only amounted to
40 grms., there was a sensible permanent lengthening of the
wire resulting from the rise of temperature; for the author
has shown that permanent extension and permanent torsion
may both increase very considerably the value of the loga
rithmic decrement.
    An equally important point to the above is the effect of rest
on the logarithmic decrement when the wire has recently had
its temperature changed. It seems not improbable that, large
as the internal friction is at the higher temperatures, it would
be larger if tested immediately after the change had taken
place. Again, it would be larger still if tested by a statical
method; for the preliminary vibrations, to ' the wire
was subjected before testing, evidently reduced considerably
the internal friction.
               The Two Critical Temperatures of Iron.
    The above experiment seems to show, not only that the
internal friction of iron is very considerable at high tempera
tures, but also that there are two points, namely about 550°C.
and 1000°C., at which there are very sudden changes in the
rate at which the friction increases with the temperature.
Now at or near these points there are, at any rate for annealed
iron wire of good quality, very notable and sudden changes in
certain of the physical properties of the metal. About 550°C.
the metal begins to lose its magnetic properties very rapidly;
so rapidly indeed that, if an iron wire be surrounded by a
magnetizing solenoid always kept in action, and this again be
concentric with a secondary solenoid connected with a galva
nometer, a very sensible induced current can be observed at
the critical temperature both on heating and cooling. It would
seem likely also, from the researches of Prof. P. G. Tait and
others, that at this temperature, or about this temperature,
there are sudden changes in the thermoelectrical properties of
  * The elasticity of iron at 1000°C. is nearly the same as the elasticity
of silver at 20°C.

                       the Recalescence of Iron.                    109
the metal and also in the electrical resistance.           These sudden
changes would appear to indicate an equally sudden change
in the molecular architecture of the iron; and it seems reason
able to suppose that when, on heating, the critical temperature
is reached, a certain amount of the whole thermal energy
which may be imparted by an electric current or a burner to
the wire is used up in producing this change, whilst an equal
amount of thermal energy is given out when the wire, on
cooling, reassumes its original molecular structure. It by no
means follows, however, that the so-called latent heat con
nected with the sudden change can be detected unless by very
refined apparatus; for it is not at all unlikely that the sudden
loss of magnetic properties may be due simply to a rotation
of the molecules about their axes; and the researches of Pro
fessor Ewing" prove that there may be considerable rotation
of the molecules about their axes, and yet at the same time
very minute change of temperature resulting from this rotation.
    Near the higher temperature of 1000° C. there is again a
 most remarkable alteration in the behaviour of an annealed
 iron wire which is being heated when under stress or strain.
 If it is stretched by a slight weight it suddenly unstretches f;
 if it is under a slight bending-stress it suddenly unbends; and
 if it is under slight twisting-stress it suddenly untwists;
 whilst, on the contrary, if it has been previously bent or
 twisted permanently and then entirely released from stress, it
 suddenly bends more or twists more as the case may bet.
 Further, there are sudden changes, evidently at the same
 temperature, in the thermoelectrical relations which exist be
 tween strained and unstrained iron, and also between stressed
 and unstressed iron; these changes, like those before men
 tioned, being opposite in direction for stress and strain §.
 All these phenomena indicate, according to the author’s belief,
 a second notable change in the molecular architecture of
 the iron; they certainly seem to indicate a change which
 must involve the expenditure of thermal energy to produce
 it when the iron is being heated, and the giving out of thermal
 energy when the iron is being cooled : in other words, here
 must be, one would think, a second point at which heat becomes
 latent.
    Now    £pose that the iron has been raised in temperature
 above 1000° C. and is cooling: when the critical temperature
 is reached the molecules would begin to come back to their

 110               Mr. Herbert Tomlinson on
original positions, just as water begins to freeze when the
temperature of 0°C. has been reached; but internal friction
prevents this, and it is not till the temperature has fallen, it
may be very considerably, below the critical temperature that
the readjustment takes place. When, however, the change
under these conditions does take place it will be what Clerk
Maxwell has designated as an explosive change, and the energy
set at liberty by the transformation will accelerate the sub
sequent rate of transformation. Here, again, we have an
analogy in the case of freezing water; for in a Wollaston's
cryophorus the temperature of the water may frequently be
reduced several degrees below 0°C. before solidification sets
in ; but when it does, the whole mass, or a considerable por
tion of the whole mass, is frozen instantly. With both iron
and water, therefore, there will be a greater amount of heat
suddenly generated when the transformation takes place below
the critical temperatures than when it occurs at the critical
temperatures. Again, another 'gy may be pointed out
between ice at 0°C. and iron at 1000° C.; in both there is a
marked change in the cohesion of the molecules. When an
iron wire is under any but an exceedingly small stress of
bending, torsion, or traction, it begins to yield permanently
in a most astonishing manner when, on heating, ' tempera
ture reaches 1000°C.; the metal suddenly        £          as it
were, in a partially fluid condition.
   According to the author's view, then, recalescence in cooling
iron is owing to retardation, produced by internal friction, of
a physical change somewhat resembling the change which
occurs when water becomes ice: were it not for internal fric
tion the change would take place comparatively in a gradual
manner, and a certain amount of thermal energy would be
equally gradually given out. In consequence, however, of
internal friction the change is retarded until a temperature is
reached below the temperature at which it would otherwise
occur; when, partly owing to diminution of internal friction
and partly to increased internal molecular stress, the mole
cules give way at some one point, and this is followed by a
giving way throughout the whole mass; the change thus
partakes of the nature of an explosion, and, as a consequence,
there is a rapid rise of temperature. The following experi
ments were made with the object of collecting evidence for or
against the above-mentioned theory.
                  Experiments on Recalescence.
   It has been observed that there are two critical tempera
tures—one at about 550°C., and the other at about 1000°C.;

so that, according to the above theory, there should be at least
two points at which a sudden reheating takes place; but not
necessarily two sensible reglows", or even, as we have seen,
two sensible reheatings. £ is all the more to be expected;
because when, on heating, a wire under moderate stress has
attained a temperature of about 550°C., there is evidently a
sudden permanent yielding showing sudden softening of the
metal, though this is not nearly so marked as the permanent
yielding which takes place at the higher critical temperature.
The next experiment appeared to show, not one recalescence,
but several.                                   -
    Experiment II.—The end of a steel poker was heated to a
very bright red in a fire and was then taken to a corner of
the room on one side of the fire. The room was quite dark
 save where it was faintly lighted up by the fire, and the eyes
of the observer had been previously rested by shutting them
 for five minutes before the experiment. The heated part of
 the poker was intently watched whilst it was cooling and
 nothing was observed of any note for some little time. Pre
 sently, however, the external surface appeared to lose in
 temperature rapidly, and shortly afterwards to brighten most
 perceptibly. The apparent rapid darkening and reglow
 occurred no less than seven times during this same cooling.
 The experiment was repeated again '' again, not only on
 the same night but on several nights, and as often as it was
 repeated seemed to show most conclusively that there were
 several reglows. It was noticed, however, that when the
 poker was loosely held in the hand the apparent reglows
 occurred more frequently than when it was fixed; and further
 that, when the outside of the poker was seen to darken, a
 slight motion of the poker in any direction caused it to
 brighten. Evidently convection-currents of air could not
 account for the phenomenon; for though a current of air
 might cause a sensible darkening of the external surface            '.
 its cooling effect, it could not cause the brightening whic
 seemed to result from the motion. As it was thought that
 the brightening might be produced by the motion of the iron
 through the earth's magnetic field, the poker was reheated
 and fixed in a horizontal position above the poles of a rather
 powerful electromagnet. As soon as one of the darkenings
 preliminary to a reglow occurred, the circuit of the battery
 which actuated the electromagnet was closed and then opened
 again; but there was no sensible brightening as a result of
 these operations, either at any point of this particular trial or
    * The reheating may take place at too low a temperature to produce a
 reglow.

112                  Mr. Herbert Tomlinson on
at any point of any of several subsequent trials which were
made. The next consideration was, Was the alternate darken
ing and reglowing a subjective sensation"? The poker was
reheated, and after having been firmly fixed was watched
whilst cooling. As soon as the preliminary darkening ap
peared, the head of the observer was turned slightly and
instantly brought back again. The whole operation of turn
 ing the head away and back again certainly did not occupy
 more than a fraction of a second, and yet the metal shone out
quite clearly again. Closing and opening the eyes as quickly
as possible had a similar effect. No doubt such an instance
of subjective sensation is well known to physiologists, but it
has given the author a lesson which he will not readily forget
": the danger of trusting to mere sensationf.
    Several other attempts were made with bars and wires of
iron and steel; and in the case of certain wires there seemed
evidence of more than one real reglow. In face, however,
of the warning given by the above experiment, the author

   Eaperiment III.—A flat iron bar, 60 centim. long, 1.5
centim. broad, and 2 millim. thick, was heated at one end to a
very bright red, and observed when cooling in a dark room;
a reglow occurred at a very high temperaturet. The bar was
again heated, and whilst in the fire was bent as in fig. 2; it
                                  Fig. 2.
 was then kept in the fire a short time longer, and afterwards
 removed. At first all the bar from A to J. appeared to be of
 the same temperature; but presently a delicate cloud appeared
 on the portion BC, which probably might have escaped notice
   * This was suggested by Mr. Burton at the Meeting of the Physical
 Society at which the paper was read; the author feels much indebted
to Mr. Burton for the suggestion.
   + Possibly the £         of the apparent reglow will be found to differ
 with different individuals, and even to vary with the state of health at
 the time. To the author the phenomenon was very striking.

had it not been for the contrast caused by the unclouded por
tions AB, CE. Very shortly after its formation the cloud rolled
away, and immediately afterwards a reglow occurred through
out the whole of the heated portion of the bar. The eyes had
 been kept upon the convex side of the bar in this trial; and
 as it was thought that the concave side might possibly show
 up bright instead of dark, by contrast with the unstrained
metal, the bar was heated a second time and again watched on
 cooling. Rather contrary to expectation, the portion D, when
 the cooling had reached a certain point, showed up as being
 slightly clouded; as before, the cloud rolled away and the re
glow immediately succeeded, which also, as before, seemed to
raise the whole of the heated portion of the bar to the same
temperature. The explanation of the formation of the cloud
appears to be this ; above but near the critical temperature
 the specific heat of the strained portion is lower than that of
the unstrained portion, and, as a consequence, very shortly
after the bar has been removed from the fire the temperature
of the former is more rapidly lowered than that of the latter.
Again, the reason why the strained portion has a less specific
 heat than the unstrained, and why, after the reglow, the strained
and unstrained portions become apparently once more uniform
 in temperature, may well be that, in consequence of the greater
 internal friction of the strained portion, or from some other
 cause, the contraction of its molecules does not go on at so great
 a rate. When the temperature of a body is raised, part of the
thermal energy expended on it is expended in producing vis
viva of the molecules, and part in pushing them asunder. If
 we can prevent the molecules from being pushed asunder, a
given amount of thermal energy imparted to the metal will
produce a greater rise of temperature. Similarly, when the
metal is cooling, a    '     loss of thermal energy will be at
tended by a greater lowering of temperature when the con
traction of the molecules is lessened. As a consequence, when
the strained and unstrained portions are cooling near the cri
tical temperature, there is a greater amount of molecular
potential energy, and therefore a greater rise of temperature
when the explosive change occurs at reglow, in the former
than in the latter. The next experiment shows that effects
similar to the above can be produced by hammering.
    Experiment IV—The straight portion of the bar used in
Experiment III. was heated to a white heat, and whilst hot
 was placed upon a small anvil and struck twice very hard with
the  £      end of a hammer at two separate parts, so that two
rather deep dents were made in the bar about 10 centim. apart
from each other.     The bar was now heated a second time to a

114                 Mr. Herbert Tomlinson on
very bright red, and was allowed afterwards to cool. When
a certain temperature had been reached a very beautiful phe
nomenon presented itself.
   Suppose that AB and CD in fig. 3 represent the two dents.
                               Fig. 3.
 Slight clouds were first seen at AB and CD; these quickly
deepened and extended both ways, leaving a bright space at Q.
 Immediately afterwards the clouds rolled away, beginning
 from Q, and the whole heated portion brightened with the
 recalescence. This phenomenon was so striking that the
 heating and cooling were repeated several times, with appa
 rently no very rapid diminution of the effects of the strain.
 After the bar had been hammered and bent considerably in
 this and other experiments of like nature, several attempts
 were made after straightening it to anneal it; these attempts
 were only partially successful. Always before recalescence
 faint patches of cloud could be detected here and there, showing
 that some portions were more strained than others. These
 clouds do not seem to be formed in those specimens of steel
 or iron which do not show the phenomenon of recalescence; at
 least so far as can be judged from observations made with one
 specimen of steel in which both clouds and perceptible reglow
 were entirely absent.
    Experiment W-Several attempts were made in this expe
 riment to abolish recalescence by shaking or hammering. For
 this purpose a piece of pianoforte-steel wire, which showed
 recalescence well, was selected. The wire, which was 1 millim.
 thick, was suspended vertically with a weight of 1 kilo. on the
 end. The weight was held by one hand, £ the other hand
 was employed in making the wire vibrate transversely whilst
 cooling; but no amount of vibrating could prevent the reglow
 from showing itself. A piece of the same wire was heated to
 a very bright red in a burner; it was then removed from the
 burner, immediately placed on an anvil, and a very sharp blow
 was given it by a hammer. The blow did not prevent the
 recalescence from appearing.
    In this respect, therefore, the behaviour of iron which has
 cooled below 1000° C. without change of state seems to differ
 from water which has cooled below 0°C. without freezing;
 for the latter can be made to freeze by agitation. May not,
 however, the sudden freezing in this last case be due simply to

                       the Recalescence of Iron.          -           115
 the bringing of the liquid water into contact with small crystals
of ice which have formed on the side of the vessel. Besides,
the internal friction of the iron is very great above the tem
perature of 1000°C., and the vibrations may not have been
made sufficiently near the point of recalescence”.
   Experiment VI.—This experiment was made with a view of
ascertaining whether the reglow would occur at a lower tem
perature the greater the amount of retentivity of the specimen.
A specimen of well-annealed Swedish iron wire showed no
trace of reglow. This may have been for two reasons:—In
the first place, if the reglow occurs very near the critical tem
perature the very brightness of the wire renders detection
difficult; in the    £        the amount of potential energy sud
denly converted into kinetic energy is less. The author does
not believe that in this specimen there was no recalescence, for
the following reasons:—Whenever recalescence is very marked
the sudden    £         which have been mentioned as taking place
in a wire cooling whilst under stress and strain are also well
marked; and, conversely, if there is no sudden change in a
wire under stress or strain there is no recalescence : the
recalescence and the sudden changes seem to be inseparable
companions. Now, with the particular specimen of iron in
question, the sudden changes above alluded to could be
detected; but they evidently occurred at a much higher tem
perature than with those specimens of iron and steel which
showed recalescence plainly.
    As far as could be ascertained from an examination of
about a dozen different specimens of iron and steel, those
specimens which seemed most capable of being softened by
 the process of annealing were those in which the phenomenon
 of recalescence was least marked.             When recalescence is
 manifest, the temperature at which it appears seems to vary
 considerably with different specimens : with some this tempe
rature would be at least as high as 800°C., with others at
least as low as 550° C.
       Views of Professor G. Forbes and Mr. H. F. Newall
                        concerning Recalescence.
    According to Professor Forbes f, the phenomenon of re
 calescence is due to the fact that at a certain temperature
 there is a sudden increase of the thermal conductivity of iron.
 As the metal cools from a white heat, the difference between
    * It was impossible to continue the agitations right up to the poin, of
 recalescence, as the motion prevented  ' observer from seeing whether
the reglow took place or not.

116         Sir W. Thomson on Cauchy's and Green's
the temperatures of the outside surface and of the inside will
after a time become more or less considerable.            The outside,
being always cooler than the inside, will sooner reach the
critical temperature at which there is a sudden increase
of thermal conductivity, and, as a consequence, there will be
a sudden rush of heat from the inside to the outside; hence
the reglow. The assumption that a sudden increase of thermal
conductivity should take place when the metal has cooled to a
certain temperature is very reasonable; for there is, without
doubt, a sudden increase       £     to speak more correctly, more
than one” sudden increase) of electrical conductivity as the
iron cools.
    Mr. H. F. Newall assertst, however, that he has shown that
the reglow is “not due to differences in conductivity in iron
at different temperatures,” and that “there is a rise of tem
perature not only at the surface. ... but also throughout the
mass.” Mr. Newall has not yet brought before us any ex
perimental evidence in proof of these assertions; but he has
 promised to do so.
    Mr. Newall seems to agree with the author that the process
going on during recalescence “partakes of the nature of an
explosion, in that once started it continues throughout the
mass of the iron,” but he regards the rise of temperature as
being caused by internal chemical action. The author looks
forward with much interest to the publication of Mr. Newall's
results.

Fresnel's original conclusion, that in plane polarized light the
line of vibration is perpendicular to the plane of polarization;

 through the ray and perpendicular to the reflecting surface,
 when light is polarized by reflexion.

     2. Now when polarized light is transmitted through a
 crystal, and when rays in any one of the principal planes are
 examined, it is found that—
     (1) A ray with its plane of polarization in the principal
 plane travels with the same speed, whatever be its direction
 (whence it is called the “ordinary ray” for that principal
 plane); and (2) A ray whose plane of polarization is per
 pendicular to the principal plane, and which is called “the
 extraordinary ray” of that plane, is transmitted with velocity
 differing for different directions, and having its maximum
 and minimum values in two mutually perpendicular direc
 tions of the ray.
    3. Hence and by § 1, the velocities of all rays having their
 vibrations perpendicular to one principal plane are the same;
 and the velocities of rays in a principal plane which have their
 directions of vibration in the same principal plane, differ accord
 ing to the direction of the ray, and have maximum and mini
 mum values for directions of the ray at rightangles to one another.
 But in the laminar shearing or distortional motion of which
 the wave-motion of the light consists, the “plane of the
 shear”* (or “plane of the distortion,” as it is sometimes
 called), is the plane through the direction of the ray and the
 direction of vibration; and therefore it would be the ordinary
 ray that would have its line of vibration in the principal plane,
 if the ether's difference of quality in different directions were
 merely the aeolotropy of an unstrained elastic solidt. Hence
 ether in a crystal must have something essentially different
 from mere intrinsic aeolotropy; something that can give
 different velocities of propagation to two rays, of one of which
 the line of vibration and line of propagation coincide
 respectively with the line of propagation and line of vibra
 tion of the other.
    4. The difficulty of imagining what this something could
 possibly be, and the utter failure of dynamics to account
 for double refraction without it, have been generally felt to be
 the greatest imperfection of optical theory.
    It is true that ever since 1839 a suggested explanation has
 been before the world; given independently by Cauchy and
 Green, in what Stokes has called their “Second Theories of
 Double Refraction,” presented on the same day, the 20th of
   * Thomson and Tait's ‘Natural Philosophy, $171 (or ‘Elements,
§ 150).
   +  'i. elementary dynamics of elastic solids, shows that on this
supposition there might be maximum and minimum velocities of propa
gation for rays in directions at 45° to one another, but that the velocities
must essentially be equal for every two directions at 90° to one another, in
the principal plane, when the line of vibration is in this plane.

118.        Sir W. Thomson on Cauchy's and Green’s
May of that year, to the French Academy of Sciences and
the Cambridge Philosophical Society. Stokes, in his Report
on Double Refraction," has given a perfectly clear account
of this explanation. It has been but little noticed otherwise,
and somehow it has not been found generally acceptable;
perhaps, because of a certain appearance of artificiality and
arbitrariness of assumption which might be supposed to dis
 credit it. But whatever may have been the reason or reasons
 which have caused it to be neglected as it has been, and
 though it is undoubtedly faulty, both as given by Cauchy
 and by Green, it contains what seems to me, in all probability,
 the true principle of the explanation, and which is, that the
 ether in a doubly refracting crystal is an elastic solid,
 unequally pressed or unequally pulled in different directions,
 by the unmoved ponderable matter.
     5. Cauchy's work on the wave-theory of light is compli
 cated throughout, and to some degree vitiated, by admission
 of the Navier-Poisson false doctrine f that compressibility is
 calculable theoretically from rigidity; a doctrine which Green
 sets aside, rightly and conveniently, by simply assuming
 incompressibility. In other respects Cauchy's and Green's
 “Second Theories of Double Refraction” as Stokes calls
 them, are almost identical. Each supposes ether in the
 crystal to be an intrinsically aeolotropic elastic solid, having
 its aelotropy modified in virtue of internal pressure or pull,
 equal or unequal in different directions, produced by and
 balanced by extraneous force. Each is faulty in leaving
 intrinsic rigidity-moduluses (coefficients) unaffected by the
 equilibrium-pressure, and in introducing three fresh terms,
 with coefficients (A, B, C in Green’s          '").       to represent
 the whole effect of the equilibrium-pressure. This gives for
 the case of an intrinsically isotropic solid, augmentation of
 virtual rigidity, and therefore of wave-velocity, by equal pulli
 in all directions, and diminution by equal positive pressure
 in all directions; which is obviously wrong. Thus definitively,
  pull in all directions outwards perpendicular to the bounding

    f So little has been done towards interpreting the formulas of either
 writer that it has not been hitherto noticed that positive values of
 Cauchy's G, H, I, or of Green's A, B, C, signify pulls, and negative
 values signify pressures.

surface equal per unit of area to three times the intrinsic
rigidity-modulus, would give quadrupled virtual rigidity, and
therefore doubled wave-velocity ! Positive normal pressure
inwards equal to the intrinsic rigidity-modulus would annul
the rigidity and the wave-velocity—that is to say, would
make a fluid of the solid. And, on the other hand, negative
pressure, or outward pull, on an incompressible liquid, would
give it virtual rigidity, and render it capable of transmitting
laminar waves ! It is obvious that abstract dynamics can
show for pressure or pull equal in all directions, no effect on
any physical property of an incompressible solid or fluid.
   6. Again, pull or pressure unequal in different directions, on
an isotropic incompressible solid, would, according to Green's
formula (A) in p. 303 of his collected Mathematical Papers,
cause the velocity of a laminar wave to depend simply on the
wave-front, and to have maximum, minimax, and minimum
velocities for wave-fronts perpendicular respectively to the
directions of maximum pull, minimax pull, and minimum
   '    and would make the wave-surface a simple ellipsoid I
  his, which would be precisely the case of foam stretched
unequally in different directions, seemed to me a very in
teresting and important result, until (as shown in § 19 below)
 I found it to be not true.
    7. To understand fully the stress-theory of double refraction,
we may help ourselves effectively by working out directly and
thoroughly (as is obviously to be done quite easily by abstract
dynamics) the problem of $6, as follows:—Suppose the solid,
isotropic when unstrained, to become strained by pressure so
applied to its boundary as to produce, throughout t'. interior,
 homogeneous strain according to the following specifica
tion :

   9. Entering now on the dynamics of our subject, remark
that the isotropy (§ 1), implies that the work required of the
extraneous pressure, to change the solid from its unstrained
condition (1, 1, 1) to the strain (x, 8, y), is independent of
the direction of the normal axes of the strain, and depends
solely on the magnitudes of x, 8, y, Hence if E denotes its
magnitude per unit of volume; or the potential energy of
unit volume in the condition (a, 8, y) reckoned from zero in
the condition (1, 1, 1); we have
                        E= |r(x, 8, y) . . . . . . . (13),
where \! denotes a function of which the magnitude is un
altered when the values of 2, 8, Y are interchanged. Consider
a portion of the solid, which, in the unstrained condition, is a
cube of unit side, and which in the strained condition (x, 8, y),
is a rectangular parallelepiped V a. V/3. Vy. In virtue of
isotropy and symmetry, we see that the pull or pressure on
each of the six faces of this figure, required to keep the
substance in the condition (x, 8, y) is normal to the face.
Let the amounts of these forces per unit area, on the three
pairs of faces respectively, be A, B, C, each reckoned as
positive or negative according as the force is positive pull, or
positive pressure. We shall take
                        A+B+C=0 . . . . . . (14),
because normal pull or pressure uniform in all directions pro
duces no effect, the solid being incompressible. The work done
on any infinitesimal change from the configuration (a, S, y) is
  A V(8y)d(A/a)+B v ("ya)d(x/8)+C V(28)d(Vry),
or (because aSy=1)

   10. Let 32, 88, 8% be any variations of 2, 8, y consistent
with (2), so that we have

 where G, H, I denote three coefficients depending on the
 nature of the function V (13), which expresses the energy.
 Thus in (19), with (14) taken into account, we have just five
 coefficients independently disposable, A, B, G, H, I, which is
 the right number because, in virtue of affy=1, E is a
 function of just two independent variables.

 which give
                    8E=4G1(3a*4-86°4-86°),
 From this we see that 2G1 is simply the rigidity-modulus of
 the unstrained solid; because if we make 8 y=0, we have
 8a=-83, and the strain becomes an infinitesimal distortion

    the process.
       14. Substituting now for £4, 3, 6, a, b, c in (20), their

   These formulas are not directly convenient for finding l, m, n
from A, u, v given (the ordinary formulas for doing so need
not be written here); but they give A, u, v explicitly in terms

It is interesting to notice that this depends solely on the
direction of  £ of vibration;       and that (except in special
cases, of partial or complete isotropy) there is just one wave
front for any given line of vibration. These are precisely in
every detail the conditions of Fresnel's Kinematics of Double
Refraction.
   22. Going back to (35) and (36), let us see if we can fit
them to double refraction with line of vibration in the plane
of polarization. This would require (36) to be the ordinary
ray, and therefore requires the fulfilment of (38), as did the
other supposition; but instead of (37) we now have [in order
to make (36) constant]
                            A=B=C . . . . . . (59),
and therefore each, in virtue of (14), zero; and
so that we are driven to complete isotropy. Hence our present
form (§ 7) of the stress theory of double refraction cannot be
fitted to give line of vibration in the plane of polarization.
We have seen ($ 21) that it does give line of '' per
Pendicular to the plane of polarization with exactly Fresnel's
Jorm of wave-surface, when fitted for the purpose, by the
 simple assumption that the potential energy of the strained
 solid is expressed by (52) with k constant! It is important
 to remark that k is the rigidity-modulus of the unstrained
isotropic solid.
    23. From (58) we see that the velocities of the waves cor
 responding to the three cases, l=1, m=1, n=1, respectively
 are V  '. v(k/8), V(k/y). Hence the velocity of any wave
 whose vibrations are parallel to any one of the three principal
 elongations, multiplied by this elongation, is equal to the
 velocity of a wave in the unstrained isotropic solid.

  XIV. On the Diffusion of Gases; a Reply to Professor Tait.
                      By S. H. BURBURY".
 SU' a gas at uniform density in a closed vessel, and
       to the vessel and every molecule in it a small common
 velocity u be given. Then the gas has mass motion u.
    In the problem of diffusion the gas has density n1 inde
 pendent of the time but varying from point to point along a
 tube; and another gas has density n varying in the opposite
 way, so that ni + n, is constant. The first gas acquires a
 steady stream, say from left to right, along the tube. And
 the question is whether the steady motion of the gas in such
 circumstances can be “mass motion” as above defined, or not.
    I maintain that it cannot; and, unless by the weight of his
 authority, Professor Tait has not shaken my reasoning.
    Take an element of the tube, of length 8t, between the
 sections A and A'. Without departing from the statistical
 method, I say there exists a class v of molecules of the first
 gas in that element constant in number, namely nif(v)dv 8a,
 while the particular molecules composing it are continually
 changing. Without departing from the statistical method, I
 say there are two, and only two, possible ways in which they
 can change—(1) by molecules with velocity v passing in or
 out at A and A', (2) by encounters within the element. As
 the result of (1), molecules going to the right enter the ele
 ment in greater numbers than they leave it. The reverse is
 the case with those going to the left. From this cause you
have an increase of translation-velocity
                           .2
                                          of the class within the
element equal to f(v) de:     #8. per unit of time.
    (2) By encounters n, f(v) de B &r molecules leave the class,
 and as many enter it, per unit of time. The original mole
 cules had mean translation-velocity x. The substituted ones
have mean translation-velocity x', which is less than 2.
    Owing to encounters, you have a loss of translation-velocity
 to the class within the element equal to n, f(v) du B(x-a') 8x
per unit time. Equating the loss by (2) to the gain by (1),
you obtain the condition for steady motion,

                     3 # = n, B(x-x'),

    I find, however, that in one respect I misunderstood Pro
fessor Tait. I said that on his hypothesis 2, the translation
velocity of the class r in the moving gas, would be constant.
But that would not be the effect of mass motion. If we give
to a gas, previously at rest, mass motion u, the number of
molecules in the gas so moving whose velocities are between
v and v+dv, and make with the direction u angles between Wr
and y + dy, is

and therefore the mean translation-velocity of the class v is,
not u, but #hv'u. In order to represent Professor Tait's

would not satisfy the condition for steady motion.

feature of this scheme is the equation (3), as a fundamental
equation, the natural companion to (2).                       -
    The derived energy relations are not necessary, but are
infinitely too useful to be ignored. The electric energy U,
the magnetic energy T, and the dissipativity Q, all per unit
volume, are given by

from which W disappears by integration over all space.
    The equations of propagation are obtained by eliminating
either E or H between (2) and (3), and of course take different
forms according to the geometrical coordinates selected.
    In a recent paper I gave some examples" illustrating the
extreme importance of the lines of vorticity of the impressed
forces, as the sources of electromagnetic disturbances. Those
examples were mostly selected from the extended develop
ments which follow. Although, being special investigations,
 involving special coordinates, vector methods will not be used,
 it will still be convenient occasionally to use the black letters
 when referring to the actual forces or fluxes, and to refer to
the above equations. The German or Gothic letters employed
 by Maxwell I could never tolerate, from inability to distin
guish one from another in certain cases without looking very
hard. As regards the notation EC for the scalar product of
E and C (instead of the quaternion -SEC) it is the obvious
practical extension of EC, the product of the tensors, what
EC reduces to when E and C are parallel.f

Algebra of vectors (not quaternions) in a practical manner, i.e. without

    2. Plane Sheets of Impressed Force in a Nonconducting
Dielectric.—We need only refer to impressed electric force e,
as solutions relating to h are quite similar. , Let an infinitely
extended nonconducting dielectric be divided into two            £
by an infinitely extended plane (x, y), on one side of which,
say the left, or that of -2, is a field of e of uniform intensity e,
but varying with the time. If it be perpendicular to the
boundary, it produces no flux. Only the tangential compo
nent can be operative. Hence we may suppose that e is
parallel to the plane, and choose it parallel to r. Then E, the
force of the flux, is parallel to x, of intensity E say, and the
magnetic force, of intensity H, is parallel to y. Let e=f(t);
the complete solutions due to the impressed force are then
                    E= uv H= -$f(t–2/v) . . . . . (9)
on the right side of the plane, where 2 is +, and
                  –E=uvH= -$f(t+2/v) . . . . . (10)
on the left side of the plane, where 2 is -. In the latter case
we must deduct the impressed force from E to obtain the
force of the field, say F, which is therefore
                       F=-f(0+1/(+)                     . . . . (11)
   The results are most easily followed thus. At the plane
itself, where the vortex-lines of e are situated, we, by varying
e, produce simultaneous changes in H, thus,
                                       &

at the plane. This disturbance is then propagated both ways
undistorted at the speed v=(uc)-3.
    On the other hand, the corresponding electric displacements
are oppositely directed on the two sides of the plane.
    Since the line-integral of H is electric current, and the
line-integral of e is electromotive force, the ratio of e to H is
the resistance-operator of an infinitely long tube of unit area;
a constant, measurable in ohms, being 60 ohms in vacuum,
or 30 ohms on each side. Why it is a constant is simply
they may be added on), and allows us to work without change of nota
tion, especially when the vectors are in  ''      type, as they should be,
being entities of widely different nature from scalars. I denote a vector
by (say) E, its tensor by E. and its w, y, z components, when wanted, by
#. E2, E5. The P' occurring scalar product of two vectors

   barrier in the infinite dielectric.
     3. If the impressed force be confined to the region between
  two parallel planes distant 2a from one another, there are now
  two sources of disturbances, which are of opposite natures,
  because the vorticity of e is oppositely directed on the two
  planes, so that the left plane sends out both ways disturbances
   which are the negatives of those simultaneously emitted by
  the right plane. Thus, if the origin of 2 be midway between
  the planes, we shall have
            E="H=–1/(1-#)+1/(1-#"). (18)

  there is no disturbance outside the stratum, after the initial
  waves have gone off, the disturbance being then confined to
   the stratum of impressed force.
     Decreasing the thickness of the stratum indefinitely leads to
  the result that the effect due to e=f(t) in a layer of thickness
  dz at z=0 is, on the right side,

   e vanishes at co both ways, because we base the formulae upon
   (16), which concerns a     £      of e on both sides of which e is
   zero. Now the disturbances really depend upon de/dz, for

case of e=f(t) only. The former may be derived from it by
effecting the integrations in (21) and (22); remembering in
doing so that the differential coefficient under the sign of
integration is not the complete one with respect to 2', as it
occurs twice, but only to the second 2', and further assuming
that e=0 at infinity.
   4. Waves in a Conducting Dielectric. How to remove the
Distortion due to the Conductivity.—Let us introduce a new
physical property into the conducting medium, namely that
it cannot support magnetic force without dissipation of energy
at a rate proportional to the square of the force, a property
which is the magnetic analogue of electric conductivity. We
make the equations (2) and (3) become, if p=d/dt,
                      curl H=(4tk+ cp) E, . . . . . (23)

If s =0, these are the equations of electric and magnetic force
in a nonconducting dielectric. If therefore the new g be of
such magnitude as to make s=0, we cause disturbances
to be propagated in the conducting dielectric in identically
 the same manner as if it were nonconducting, but with a uni
 form attenuation at a rate indicated by the time-factor e-z'.
   5. Undistorted Plane Waves in a Conducting Dielectric.—
Taking 2 perpendicular to the plane of the waves, we now
 have, as special forms of (23), (24),

             arE =e"{f(z-vt)-f(z+vt)}.                . . . (33)
   The only difference from plane-waves in a nonconducting
dielectric is in the uniform attenuation that goes on, due to
the dissipation of energy, which is so £ on the electric
and magnetic sides as to annihilate the distortion the waves
would undergo were s finite, whether positive or negative.
   6. Practical Application. Imitation of this Effect.—When
I introduced" the new property of matter symbolized by the
coefficient g, it was merely to complete the analogy between
the electric and magnetic sides of electromagnetism. The
property is non-existent, so far as I know. But I have more
recently found how to precisely imitate its effect in another
electromagnetic problem, also relating to plane waves, making
use of electric conductivity to effect the functions of both k
and g in §§ 4 and 5. In the case of $ 5, first remove both
conductivities, so that we have plane waves unattenuated and
undistorted. Next put a pair of parallel wires of no resistance
in the dielectric, parallel to 2, and let the lines of electric force

of E across the dielectric from one wire to the other, and 4trC
be the line-integral of H round either wire, we shall have

 both zero. Here L and S are the inductance and per
 mittance of unit length of the circuit of the parallel wires,
 and v= (LS)”.
    Next let the wires have constant resistance R per unit
 length to current in them, and let the medium between them
 be conducting (to a very low degree), making K the con
 ductance per unit length across from one wire to the other.
 We then turn the last equations into
                            dV
                            # =(R+Lp)0, . . . . (36)

 and have a complete imitation of the previous unreal problem.
 The two dissipations of energy are now due to R in the
  wires, and to K in the dielectric, it being that in the wires
  which takes the place of the unreal magnetic dissipation.
  The relation R/L=K/S, which does not require excessive
  leakage when the wires are of copper of low resistance,
  removes the distortion otherwise suffered by the waves. I
  have, however, found that when the alternations of current
  are very rapid, as in telephony, there is very little distortion
  produced by copper wires, even without the leakage required
  to wholly remove it, owing to R/Ln becoming small, n/27t
  being the frequency; an effect which is greatly assisted by
  increasing the inductance (see Note A, p. 151). Of course there
  is little resemblance between this problem and that of the long
  and slowly-worked submarine cable, whether looked at from
  the physical side or merely from the numerical point of view,
  the results being then of different orders of magnitude. A
  remarkable misconception on this point seems to be somewhat
  generally held. It seems to be imagined that self-induction

           Forced Vibrations of Electromagnetic Systems.                 137
is harmful" to long-distance telephony. The precise contra
is the case. It is the very life and soul of it, as is proved bot
by practical experience in America and the Continent on very
long copper circuits, and by examining the theory of the
matter. I have proved this in considerable detailt ; but they
will not believe it.      So far does the misconception extend that
it has perhaps contributed to leading Mr. W. H. Preece to
£ that the coefficient of self-induction in copper circuits
 is negligible (several hundred times smaller than it can pos
 sibly be), on the basis of his recent remarkable experimental
 researches.
    The following formula, derived from my general formulaet,
  will show the rôle played by self-induction. Let R and L be
  the resistance and inductance per unit length of a perfectly
  insulated circuit of length l, short-circuited at both ends.
  Let a rapidly      £                         force act at one end of
 amplitude eo, and let Co be the amplitude of the current at the
 distant end. Then, if the circuit be very long,
                                2
                         Co=    # e-RPL",                    .  . . (38)
  where v is the speed (LS)"=(ue)", provided R/Ln be
  small, say 4. It may be considerably greater, and yet allow
  (38) to be nearly true. We can include nearly the whole
  range of telephonic frequencies by using suspended copper
  wires of low resistance.S.
     It is resistance that is so harmful, not self-induction; as, in
  combination with the electrostatic permittance, it causes
  immense distortion of waves, unless counteracted by increasing
  the inductance, which is not often practicable (see Note B,
  p. 152).

  Owing to the fact that, as above shown, we can fully utilize
  solutions   ''         the unreal g, by changing the meaning of
  the symbols, whilst still keeping to plane electromagnetic
  waves, we may preserve g in our equations (28) and (29),

  wave. The second and following reflected waves are negligible, on
  account of the length of the line.

   Knowing thus the effects due to initial elements of Eo and
Ho, we have only to integrate with respect to 2 to find the
solutions due to any arbitrary initial distributions. I forbear
from giving a detailed demonstration, leaving the satisfaction
of the proper conditions to be the proof of (42) to (48);
since, although they were very laboriously worked out by
myself, yet, as mathematical solutions, are more likely to have
been given before in some other physical problem than to be
new.                                              -
   Another way of viewing the matter is to start with s–0,
and then examine the effect of introducing s, either + or -.
 Let an isolated plane disturbance of small depth be travelling
along in the positive direction undistorted at speed v. We
have E=w H in it. Now suddenly increase k, making s
positive. The disturbance still keeps moving on at the same
speed, but is attenuated with greater rapidity. At the
same time it leaves a tail behind it, the tip of which
travels out the other way at speed v, so that at time t,
after commencement of the tailing, the whole disturbance
extends through the distance 2wt. In this tail H is of the
same sign as in the head, and its integral amount is such
that it exactly accounts for the extra-attenuation suffered
by H in the head. On the other hand, E in the tail is
of the opposite sign to E in the head; so that the integral
amount of E in head and tail decreases faster. As a special
case, let, in the first place, there be no conductivity, k=0 and
g=0. Then, keeping g still zero, the effect of introducing k
is to cause the above-described effect, except that as there was
no attenuation at first, the attenuation later is entirely due
to k, whilst the line-integral of H along the tail, or
                               y Hdz,
including H in the head, remains constant. This is the per
sistence of momentum.
   If, on the other hand, we introduce g, the statements made
regarding H are now true as regards E, and conversely. The
tail is of a different nature, E being of same sign in the tail as
in the head, and H of the opposite sign. Hence, of course,
when we have both k and g of the right amounts, there is no

tailing. This subject is, however, far better studied in the
telegraphic application, owing to the physical reality then
existent, than in the present problem, and also then by
elementary methods*.
    8. Owing to the presence of d/dz in (45) and (47) we are
enabled to give some integral solutions in a finite form.
Thus, let H = Ho constant and E=0 initially on the whole of
the negative side of the origin, with no E or H on the posi
tive side. The E at time t later is got by integrating (45),
giving
                       H         8          -       -
                    E=#1, #6–vey)", . . . ()
which holds between the limits z= +vt, there being no dis
turbance beyond, except the Ho on the left side. When g=0
and 2/vt is small, it reduces to
                          -  Ho     Al # —rkuz2/t
                        E=#(#)'.                  .   . .   . .     (50)
This is the pure diffusion-solution, suitable for good con
ductors.
    If initially E=E, constant, on the left side of the origin,
and zero on the right side, then at time t the H due to it is,

has no energy if c=0, it can produce no effect later.

   9, Again, let H=}|Hø on the left side, and H= -$H on
 the right side of the origin, initially. The E that results from
 each of them is the same, and is half that of (49); so that
 (49) still expresses the E solution. This case corresponds to
 an initial electric current of surface-density Ho/4t on the

 142 Mr. O. Heaviside on Electromagnetic Waves, and the
 2=0 plane, with the full magnetic field to correspond, and
 from it immediately follows the E solution due to any initial
 distribution of electric current in plane layers.
    Owing to H being permanently Ho at the origin in the
 case (49), (54), when g=0, we may state the problem thus:
 An infinite conducting dielectric with a plane boundary is
 initially free from magnetic induction, and its boundary
 suddenly receives the magnetic force Ho=constant. At time
 t later (49) and (52) or (53) give the state of the conductor
 at distance z < ct from the boundary. In a good conductor
 the attenuation at the front of the wave is so enormous that
 the diffusion solution (50) applies practically. It is only in
 bad conductors that the more complete form is required.
    10. Effect of Impressed Force.—We can show that the initial
effect of impressed force is the same as if the dielectric were
 nonconducting. In equations (23), (24), let p=ni, where
 n2 T=frequency of alternations, supposing e to alternate
rapidly. By increasing n we can make the second terms on
the right sides be as great multiples of the first terms as we
please, so that in the limit we '. results independent of
k and g, in this respect, that as the frequency is raised in
finitely, the true solutions tend to be infinitely nearly repre
sented by simplified forms, in which k and g play the part of
small quantities. An inspection of the sinusoidal solution for
plane waves shows that E and H get into the same phase, and
that k and g merely present themselves in the exponents of
factors representing attenuation of amplitude as the waves
pass away from the seat of vorticity of impressed force.         -
    Consequently, in the plane problem, the initial effect of an
abrupt discontinuity in e, say e= constant on the left, and zero
on the right side of the plane through the origin, is to pro
duce
                           H=-e/2ut . . . . . . (58)
all over the plane of vorticity; and
                           E= ++ e . . . . . . . (59)
on its left and right sides respectively. We may regard the
  lane as continuously emitting these disturbances to right
and left at speed v so long as the in pressed force is in opera
tion, but their subsequent history can only be fully represented
by the tail formulae already given.
    Irrespective of the finite curvature of a surface, any
element thereof may be regarded as plane. Therefore every
element of a sheet of vortex lines of impressed force acts in
the way just described as being true of the elements of an
infinite plane sheet. But it is only in comparatively simple

         Forced Vibrations of Electromagnetic Systems.       143
cases, of which I shall give examples later, that the subse
quent course of events does not so greatly complicate matters
as to render it impossible to go into details after the first
moment. On first starting the sheet, it becomes a sheet of
magnetic induction, whose lines coincide with the vortex lines
of impressed force. If f be the measure of the vorticity per
unit area, f/2uv is the intensity of the magnetic force. In the
imaginary good conductor of no permittivity, this is zero,
owing to v being then assumed to be infinite.
   Notice that whilst the vorticity of e produces magnetic
induction, that of h produces electric displacement, and whilst
in the former case E is made discontinuous at a plane of finite
vorticity, in the latter case it is H that is initially discon
tinuous.
   11. True Nature of Diffusion in Conductors.—The process
of diffusion of magnetic induction in conductors appears to
be fundamentally one of repeated internal reflexions with
partial transmission. Thus, let a plane wave E1=uv H,
moving in a nonconducting dielectric strike flush an ex
ceedingly thin sheet of metal. , Let E2=av H, be the trans
mitted wave in the dielectric on the other side, and E3=-uv H3
be the reflected wave.    At the sheet we have
                E1 + Es=E2, . . . . . . . . . (60)
                Hi + H2=H3+4tkick), . . . . . (61)
if k be the conductivity of the sheet of thickness 2. Therefore
            Es – H2 - E + E3 =           1                  (62)
            E, TH,         El T1-2Tukhar”
H is reflected positively and E negatively. A perfect con
ducting barrier is a perfect reflector, it doubles the magnetic
 force and destroys the electric force on the side containing
the incident wave, and transmits nothing.
    Take k1=(1600) for copper, and uv =3 x 10" centim.
    Then we see that to attenuate the incident wave H1 to #H,
 by transmission through the plate, requires
                := (2Tukiv)- =     : x 10" centim,       . (63)
 which is a very small fraction of the     wave-length of visible
 light. The H disturbance is made 3H1, the E reduced to
 #E1 on the transmission side. There is, however, persistence
 of H, although there is dissipation of E. To produce dissi
 pation of H with persistence of E requires the plate to be a
magnetic, not an electric conductor.
      ow, imagine an immense number of such plates to be

 144 Mr. O. Heaviside on Electromagnetic Waves, and the
 packed  £       together, with dielectric between them, forming
 a composite dielectric conductor, and let the outermost sheet
 be struck flush by a plane wave as above. The first sheet
 transmits 3H1, the second 'Hi, the third H1, and so on.
 This refers to the front of the wave, going into the composite
 conductor at speed v. It is only necessary to go a very short
 distance to attenuate the front of the wave to nothing; the
 immense speed of propagation does not result in           £
any sensible immediate effect at a distance, which comes on
quite slowly as the complex result of all the internal re
 flexions and transmissions between and at the sheets.       Observe
that there is an initial accumulation of H, so to speak, at the
boundary of the conductor, due to the reflexion. [Example:
the current-density may be greater at the outermost layer”
of a round wire when the current is started in it than the final
value, and the total current in the wire increases faster than
if it were constrained to be uniformly distributed.
   Thus a good conductor may have very considerable per
mittivity, much greater than that of air, and yet show no
signs of it, on account of the extraordinary attenuation pro
duced by the conductivity. Now this is rather important
from the theoretical point of view. It is commonly assumed
that good conductors, e.g. metals, are not dielectrics at all.
This makes the speed of propagation of disturbances through
them infinitely great. £ a hypothesis, however, should
have no place in a rational theory, professing to represent
transmission in time by stresses in a medium occupying the
space between molecules of gross matter. But by admitting
that not only bad conductors, but all conductors, are also
dielectrics, we do away with the absurdity of infinitely rapid
action through infinite distances in no time at all, and make
the method of propagation, although it practically differs so
  reatly from that in a nonconducting dielectric, be yet
£ the same, with its characteristic features masked
by repeated internal reflexions with loss of energy. We need
not take any account of the electric displacement in actual
reckonings of the magnitude of the effects which can be
observed in the case of good conductors, but it is surely a
mistake to overlook it when it is the nature of the actions
involved that is in question. (See Note C, p. 153).
   Why conductors act as reflectors is quite another question,
which can only be answered speculatively. If molecules are
perfect conductors, they are perfect reflectors, and if they
were packed quite closely, we should nearly have a perfect
conductor in mass, impenetrable by magnetic induction; and
      * “On the S. I. of Wires,” Part I. Phil. Mag. August 1886.

             Forced Vibrations of Electromagnetic Systems.     145
   we know that cooling a metal and packing the molecules
   closer does increase its conductivity. But as they do not
   form a compact mass in any substance, they must always
   allow a partial transmission of electromagnetic waves in the
   intervening dielectric medium, and this would lead to the
   diffusion method of propagation. We do not, however, ac
   count in this way for the dissipation of energy, which requires
   some special hypothesis.
      The diffusion of heat, too, which is, in Fourier's theory,
   done by instantaneous action to infinite distances, cannot be
   physically true, however insignificant may be the numerical
   departures from the truth. What can it be but a process of
   radiation, profoundly modified by the molecules of the body,
   but still only transmissible at a finite speed? The very
   remarkable fact that the more easily penetrable a body is to
  magnetic induction the less easily it conducts heat, in general,
  is at present a great difficulty in the way, thqugh it may
  perhaps turn out to be an illustration of electromagnetic
  principles eventually.
      12. Infinite Series of Reflected Waves. Remarkable Iden
  tities. Realized Example.—When, in a plane-wave problem,
  we confine ourselves to the region between two parallel planes,
 we can express our solutions in Fourier series, constructed so
 as to harmonize with the boundary conditions which repre
 sent the effect of the whole of the ignored regions beyond the
 boundaries in modifying the phenomena occurring within the
 limited region. Now the effect of the boundaries is usually
 to produce reflected waves. Hence a solution in Fourier series
 must usually be decomposable into an infinite series of separate
 solutions, coming into existence one after the other in time if
 the speed v be finite, or all in operation at once from the first
 moment if the speed be made infinite (as in pure diffusion).
 If the boundary conditions be of a simple nature, this decom
 position can sometimes be easily explicitly represented, indi
 cating remarkable identities, of which the following investi
gation leads to one. We may either take the case of plane
 waves in a conducting dielectric bounded by infinitely con
ductive planes, making E=0 the boundary condition; or,
similarly, by infinitely inductive planes    £          H=0 at
them. But the most practical way, and the most easily fol
lowed, is to put a pair of parallel wires in the dielectric, and
produce a realI' relating to a telegraph-circuit.
    Let A and B be its terminations at z=0 and z=l respec
tively. Let them be short-circuited, producing the terminal
conditions W =0 at A and B in the absence of impressed force

  B, V becomes zero, and C doubled by the reflected wave that
  then commences to travel from B to A. This wave may be
  imagined to start when t=0 from a point distant l beyond B,

    The reflected wave arising when this second wave reaches
 A may be imagined to start when t=0 from a point distant

some practical way of analyzing them into easily interpretable

V and C express the first approximation to a complete theory. Thus the
wires are assumed to be instantaneously penetrated by the magnetic in

infinitely thin sheets of the same resistance. It is only a very partial
remedy to divide a wire into several thinner wires, unless we at the same
time widely separate them. If kept quite close it would, with copper, be
no remedy at all.

                                  NOTE. A.
         An electromagnetic theory of light becomes a necessity, the
     moment one realizes that it is the same medium that transmits
     electromagnetic disturbances and those concerned in common
     radiation. Hence the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell, the
     essential part of which is that the vibrations of light are really
     electromagnetic vibrations (whatever they may be), and which is
     an undulatory theory, seems to possess far greater intrinsic pro
     bability than the undulatory theory, because that is not an electro
     magnetic theory. Adopting, then, Maxwell's notion, we see that
     the only difference between the waves in telephony (apart from
     the distortion and dissipation due to resistance) and light-waves is
     in the wave-length; and the fact that the speed, as calculated by
     electromagnetic data, is the same as that of light, furnishes a
     powerful argument in favour of the extreme relative simplicity of

152      Mr. O. Heaviside on Electromagnetic Waves, and the
constitution of the aether, as compared with common matter in
bulk.   There is observational reason to believe that the sun some
times causes magnetic disturbances here of the ordinary kind. It
is impossible to attribute this to any amount of increased activity
of emission of the sun so long as we only think of common radia
tion. But, bearing in mind the long waves of electromagnetism,
and the constant speed, we see that disturbances from the sun
may be hundreds or thousands of miles long of one kind (i. e.
without alternation), and such waves, in passing the earth, would
cause magnetic “storms,” by inducing currents in the earth's
crust and in telegraph-wires. Since common radiation is ascribed
to molecules, we must ascribe the great disturbances to move
ments of large masses of matter.
   There is nothing in the abstract electromagnetic theory to indi
cate whether the electric or the magnetic force is in the plane of
polarization, or rather, surface of polarization. But by taking a
concrete example, as the reflexion of light at the boundary of trans
parent dielectrics, we get Fresnel's formula for the ratio of reflected
to incident wave, on the assumption that his “displacement.”
coincides with the electric displacement; and so prove that it is the
magnetic flux that is in the plane of polarization.
                               NOTE B.
   I give these numerical examples:—
   Take a circuit 100 kilom. long, of 4 ohms and           microf. per
kilom. and no inductance in the first place, and also no leakage in
any case. Short-circuit at beginning A and end B. Introduce at
A a sinusoidal impressed force, and calculate the amplitude of the
current at B by the electrostatic theory. Let the ratio of the full
steady current to the amplitude of the sinusoidal current be p,
and let the frequency range through 4 octaves, from n=1250 to
n=20,000; the frequency being n/2\r. The values of p are
          1:723,     3.431,      10:49,     58.87,      778.
It is barely credible that any kind of speaking would be possible,
owing to the extraordinarily rapid increase of attenuation with the
frequency. Little more than murmuring would result.
   Now make L=2 (very low indeed), L being inductance per
centim. Calculate by the combined electrostatic and magnetic
formulae. The corresponding figures are
        1:567,     2.649,      5:587,     10.496,      16.607.
The change is marvellous. It is only by the preservation of the
currents of great frequency that good articulation is possible, and
we see that even a very little self-induction immensely improves
matters. There is no “dominant” frequency in telephony. What

          Forced Vibrations of Electromagnetic Systems.           153
should be aimed at is to get currents of any frequency reproduced
at B in their proper proportions, attenuated to the same extent.
    Change L to 5. Results :
          1.437,     2.251,      3.176,     4.169,     4.670.
    Good telephony is now possible, though much distortion remains.
    Increase L to 10.   Results:—
          1:235,     1:510,      1:729,     1.825,      1'854.
This is first class, showing approximation towards a non-distor
tional circuit. Now this is all done by the self-induction carrying
forward the waves undistorted (relatively) and also with much less
 attenuation.
    I should add that I attach no importance to the above figures
in point of exactness. The theory is only a first approximation.
In order to emphasize the part played by self-induction, I have
stated that by sufficiently increasing it (without other change, if
this could be possible) we could make the amplitude of current at
the end of an Atlantic cable greater than the steady current (by
 the quasi-resonance).
                                NOTE C.
    In Sir W. Thomson's article on the “Velocity of Electricity”
 (Nichols's Cyclopaedia, 2nd edition, 1860, and Art. lxxxi. of
 “Mathematical and Physical Papers, vol. ii.) is an account of the
 chief results published up to that date relating to the “velocity”
 of transmission of electricity, and a very explicit statement, except
 in some respects as regards inertia, of the theoretical meaning to
 be attached to this velocity under different circumstances. This
 article is also strikingly illustrative of the remarkable contrast
 between Sir W. Thomson's way of looking at things electrical (at
 least at that time) and Maxwell's views; or perhaps I should say
 Maxwell's plainly evident views combined with the views which
 his followers have extracted from that mine of wealth “Maxwell,'
 but which do not lie on the surface. [As charity begins at home,
 I may perhaps illustrate by a personal example the difference
 between the patent and the latent, in Maxwell. If I should claim
  (which I do) to have discovered the true method of establishment
  of current in a wire—that is, the current starting on its boundary,
  as the result of the initial dielectric wave outside it, followed by
  diffusion inwards,—I might be told that it was all “in Maxwell.”
  So it is; but entirely latent. And there are many more things in
  Maxwell which are not yet discovered.] This difference has been
  the subject of a most moving appeal from Prof. G. F. Fitzgerald,
  in “Nature, about three years since. There really seemed to be
  substance in that appeal. For it is only a master-mind that can
  adequately attack the great constructive problem of the aether, and
 its true relation to matter; and should there be reason to believe

  154      Mr. O. Heaviside on Electromagnetic Waves, and the
 that the master is on the wrong track, the result must be, as Prof.
 Fitzgerald observed (in effect) disastrous to progress. Now Max
  well's theory and methods have stood the test of time, and showed
 themselves to be eminently rational and developable.
     It is not, however, with the general question that we are here
 concerned, but with the different kinds of “velocity of electricity.”
 As Sir W. Thomson points out, his electrostatic theory, by ignoring
  electromagnetic induction, leads to infinite speed of electricity
 through the wire. Interpreted in terms of Maxwell's theory, this
 speed is not that of electricity through the wire at all, but of the
 waves through the dielectric, guided by the wire. It results, then,
 from the assumption u=0, destroying inertia (not of the electric
 current, but of the magnetic field), and leaving only forces of
 elasticity and resistance.
    But he also points out another way of getting an infinite speed,
 when we, in the case of a suspended wire, not of great length,
 ignore the static charge. This is illustrated by the pushing of
 incompressible water through an unyielding pipe, constraining the
 current to be the same in all parts of the circuit. This, in Max
 well's theory, amounts to stopping the elastic displacement in the
 dielectric, and so making the speed of the wave through it in
 finite.   As, however, the physical actions must be the same,
 whether a wire be long or short, the assumption being only war
 rantable for purposes of calculation, I have explained the matter
 thus. The electromagnetic waves are sent to and fro with such
great frequency (owing to the shortness of the line) that only the
 mean value of the oscillatory V at any part can be perceived, and
this is the final value; at the same time, by reason of current in
the negative waves being of the same sign as in the positive, the
current C mounts up by little jumps, which are, however, packed
so closely together as to make a practically continuous rise of
current in a smooth curve, which is that given by the electro
magnetic theory. This curve is of course practically the same all
over the circuit, because of the little jumps being imperceptible.
    But in any case this speed is not the speed of electricity through
the wire, but through the dielectric outside it. Maxwell remarked
that we know nothing of the speed of electricity in a wire sup
porting current; it may be an inch in an hour, or immensely
great. This is on the assumption, apparently, that the electric
current in a wire really consists in the transfer of electricity
through the wire. I have been forced, to make Maxwell's scheme
intelligible to myself, to go further, and add that the electricity maybe
standing still, which is as much as to say that there is no current,
in a literal sense, inside a conductor. [The slipping of electrification
over the surface of a wire is quite another thing. That is merely
the movement of the wave through the dielectric, guided by the
wire. It occurs in a non-distortional circuit, owing to the absence
of tailing, in the most plainly evident manner.] In other words,
take Maxwell's definition of electric current in terms of magnetic

           Forced Vibrations of Electromagnetic Systems.                  155
force as a basis, and ignore the imaginary fluid behind it as being
a positive hindrance to progress, as soon as one leaves the elemen
tary field of steady currents and has to deal with variable states.
   The remarks in the text on the subject of the speed of waves in
conductors relates to a speed that is not considered in Sir W.
Thomson's article. It is the speed of transmission of magnetic
disturbances into the wire, in cylindrical waves, which begins at
any part of a wire as soon as the primary wave through the dielec
tric reaches that part. It would be no use trying to make signals
through a wire if we had not the outer dielectric to carry the mag
netizing and electrizing force to its boundary. The slowness of
diffusion in large masses is surprising. Thus a sheet of copper
covering the earth, only 1 centim. in thickness, supporting a cur
rent whose external field imitates that of the earth, has a time
constant of about a fortnight. If the copper extended to the centre
of the earth, the time-constant of the slowest subsiding normal
system would be millions of years.
   In the article referred to, Sir W. Thomson mentions that Kirch
hoff's investigation, introducing electromagnetic induction, led to
a velocity of electricity considerably greater than" that of light,
which is so far in accordance with Wheatstone's observation.
Now it seems to me that we have here a suggestion of a probable
   * [Note by SIR WILLIAM THoMson.] In this statement I inadvertently
did injustice to Kirchhoff. In the unpublished investigation referred to
in the article Electricity, Velocity of [Nichols's Cyclopaedia, second edition,
1860; or my “Collected Papers, vol. ii. page 135 (3)], I had found that
the ultimate velocity of propagation of electricity in a long insulated wire
in air is equal to the number of electrostatic units in the electromagnetic
unit; and I had correctly assumed that Kirchhoff's investigation led to
the same result. But, owing to the misunderstanding of two electricities
or one, referred to in § 317 of my ‘Electrostatics and Magnetism, I
imagined Weber's measurement of the number of electrostatic units in
the electromagnetic to be 2x3.1x10" centimetres per second, which
would give for the ultimate velocity of electricity through a long wire in
air twice the velocity of light. In my own investigation, for the sub
marine cable, I had found the ultimate velocity of electricity to be equal
to the number of electrostatic units in the electromagnetic unit divided
by Vk; k denoting the specific inductive capacity of the gutta-percha.
But at that time no one in Germany (scarcely any one out of England)
believed in Faraday's “specific inductive capacity of a dielectric.”
   Kirchhoff himself was perfectly clear on the velocity of electricity in a
long insulated wire in air. In his original paper, “Ueber die Bewegun

147 of Kirchhoff's Volume of Collected Papers, Leipzig, 1882), he gives
it as c/V2, which is what I then called the number of electrostatic units
in the electromagnetic unit; and immediately after this he says, “ihr
 Werth ist der von 41950 Meilen in einer Sekunde, also sehr nahe gleich
 der Geschwindigkeit des Lichtesim leeren Raume.”
   Thus clearly to Kirchhoff belongs the priority of the discovery that the
velocity of electricity in a wire £ in air is very approximately
equal to the velocity of light.

 explanation of why Sir W. Thomson did not introduce self
 induction into his theory. There were presumably more ways than
 one of doing it, as regards the measure of the electric force of
 induction. When we follow Maxwell's equations, there is but one
 way of doing it, which is quite definite, and leads to a speed
 which cannot possibly exceed that of light, since it is the speed
(uc)-3 through the dielectric, and cannot be sensibly greater than
3 x 10" centim., though it may be less. Kirchhoff’s result is there
fore in conflict with Maxwell's statement that the German methods
lead to the same results as his.   Besides that, Wheatstone's clas
sical result has not been supported by any later results, which are
always less than the speed of light, as is to be expected (even in a
non-distortional circuit). But a reference to Wheatstone's paper
on the subject will show, first, that there was confessedly a good
deal of guesswork; and, next, that the repeated doubling of the
wire on itself made the experiment, from a modern point of view,
of too complex a theory to be examined in detail, and unsuitable as
a test.
                XVI. A Theory of Glacier Motion.
              By R. MoUNTFoRD DEELEY, F.G.S."
 So: years have now elapsed since the question of glacier
       motion was brought prominently before the scientific
world by the publication of a number of valuable treatises
and letters on the glaciers of the Swiss Alps. Each new
theory of glacier-motion, as it was given to the world, neces
sitated further observation of the phenomena presented by
glaciers, or gave increased interest to the many interesting
£ of ice.              In this way a vast amount of information
  as been collected by numerous trained observers, about
which there is little dispute; but to the simple question, “Wh
does a glacier move?” a great variety of answers would 'i
be given. Indeed, it cannot be said that any substantial pro
gress has been made, for though, as we have seen, a con
siderable number of theories have been framed, no one of
them has yet been anything like generally accepted. Prin
cipal J. D. Forbes insisted upon the problem being treated
as one of pure mechanics; and to him we largely owe that
knowledge of glacier phenomena which Professor Tyndall
and others have so ably worked out. Still the old question
remains unanswered. We know how the glacier moves, but
cannot say why it moves. To add another theory to the
already long list may be regarded as tending to make matters
                    * Communicated by the Author.

                        of Glacier Motion.                  157
still worse; but I venture to think that, as the heat of former
discussion has now dissipated itself, and no theory has suc
ceeded in standing the test of time, another attempt is justi
fiable. I do not underrate the splendid work done by Rendu,
Forbes, Tyndall, Thomson, and many other eminent men; for,
as I have previously indicated, to them we owe a series of
observations on glacier-motion and structure which will
always rank high among the scientific achievements of the
present century. Still, the exact details of the process which
goes on within a glacier as it slowly changes its form,
accommodates itself to the ever-varying shape of its rocky
channel, and moves downwards with a differential motion
under the action of gravity, is still legitimate matter for
speculation.
   The theories now in the field are too well known to render
any detailed reference to them necessary; I will therefore
content myself with stating, as simply as possible, what may
be regarded as a purely mechanical explanation of the ob
served facts.
    It should be borne in mind that all the changes of form
which a body undergoes, provided no increase or decrease of
bulk takes place, may be regarded as due to what is called
simple shear. Take a pile of notepaper, or a pack of cards,
and displace it a little so that instead of standing '        it
forms an inclined heap. Change of form has taken place
without change of bulk. The distortion has been accom
plished by the shearing of the pile in planes    £       and co
incident with the sheets of paper or card. Instructive ex
amples may be seen in the quires of notepaper piled up in
various forms in shop windows. Every change of outline
suffered by a glacier, if we disregard melting and the small
internal  £        of bulk produced by pressure &c., is due to
a shear of ice plane over ice plane. The resistance offered to
the sliding of the particles of one plane over the particles of
another plane is called friction; and the resistance they offer
to being torn asunder is called cohesion. Now the rigidity,
elasticity, &c., of a substance will depend upon the qualities
and values of these two properties. For instance, cast iron
breaks when put in tension without pulling out to any extent;
for the cohesion of its particles is not sufficient to overcome
internal friction, and allow much more than elastic shear to
take place before breaking. On the other hand, the cohesion
between the particles of wrought iron is so great that it
stretches out—that is shears—and becomes heated by the re
sulting friction.
   We are now in a position to understand an experiment

 158            Mr. R. Mountford Deeley's Theory
which will be of great value to us further on. Take a plate
of steel, say twenty-four inches long, three inches deep, and
half an inch thick. Firmly fix one end to a suitable support
so that the steel plate shall form a girder with its greatest
 depth in a vertical position. Then £ a number of
 weights along the length of the bar. It at once becomes
deflected; that is shear, elastic shear, is produced in a manner
somewhat analogous to that in the pile of notepaper. We
will now drill a row of holes along the plate; and when this
has been done, the girder, having been weakened, will be found
 to have taken a still greater amount of set. Still further in
 crease the set by drilling several rows of holes. So far all
the operations have been possible ones; but I must now draw
 upon the imagination somewhat, and perform operations which
cannot be carried out in practice. Take the material removed
 from the numerous perforations in the plate, and replace it so
 that the plate becomes whole again. It is evident that though
 again solid, only that metal £ formed part of the original
 perforated plate is in a state of strain, that filling the holes
 taking no share of the load. We will again drill a number
 of £      this time in the spaces between the older perfora
 tions, and another increase will take place in the deflection of
the plate. A strain will also be put upon the metal in the
first series of holes bored; and, in addition, a greatly increased
strain thrown upon what remains of the original plate. By
repeating the operation the girder could be deformed to any
desired extent, and, if necessary, such a violent strain thrown
upon any one point that local rupture would ensue. The
shear we have produced, and also that which took place in
the pile of paper, can now be compared with that taking place
in an ice-stream. Place the steel plate horizontally on a ma
of a glacier drawn to a suitable scale, the end which was '
as a support being placed near the edge of the ice, and the other
end, which carried the weights, near the centre of the glacier.
The differential motion Tyndall so carefully measured will then
be found to be similar to, if not congruent with, the shear
which the steel plate has undergone. It must be remembered
that the ice is a girder of great depth, and the shear surfaces
are therefore approximately plane, whereas in the experimental
plate they were surfaces of considerable curvature. What is
the bearing of the knowledge thus gained upon the question
of glacier-motion?
   # though      hard and brittle, is still an elastic substance.
When in mass it undergoes a certain amount of deformation
like any other body, by virtue of its own weight and elasticity.

 If a mountain-mass could be freed from the attraction of the
earth, it would, owing to the elasticity of its component rocks,
increase in height by many feet.
spheric pressure    :                   £       change of atmo
                              an exceedingly small rise or fall of
the earth's surface.    The ebb and flow of the tides has a
similar effect upon the land in the neighbourhood of the coast
 lines; indeed, every substance not     £          rigid (and ab
 solutely rigid substances do not exist) must, when subjected
to any stress whatever, show a corresponding strain or de
 formation.
   A glacier upon whose mass we will ' gravity has
previously had no effect is suddenly put within the sphere of
the earth’s attraction. It instantly undergoes a change of
form. In fact strains are produced in the ice each propor
tional to the measure of the corresponding stress, and the ice
takes a small step in a £ direction, that is in the
direction of least resistance. . If the glacier rested in a valley
with straight smooth sides, the ice would descend bodily and
continue to slide until stopped by an angle in its channel or
other obstruction.     Even on an uneven or crooked bed a
certain amount of slide occurs until the bending strains are
proportional to the stresses. We therefore have two kinds of
motion—one a bodily slide in a downward direction, and
another descent due to the differential motion of the ice not
in contact with the ground, the resultant motion being pro
portional to these two components. De Saussure supported a
sliding theory; but in a rocky uneven gorge, before continuous
sliding can take place, the ice must be capable of continually
changing its form to creep over the inequalities of its rocky
bed. Of course, when ice is pressed hard against a boss of
rock, thawing must go on at a temperature below the ordinary
freezing-point, a portion of the water produced recongealing
on liberation. A similar effect is obtained by passing a wire
over a block of ice and hanging a weight upon it. £ wire
passes through the mass without splitting it into two portions.
That glaciers do slide is capable of absolute proof. Examine
the rocky floor over which a glacier has moved. It is fre
quently   £          polished, scratched, and grooved. Stones
of all sizes have become embedded in the ice, and as it carried
them    £ the adjacent rocks          against which they were
pressed underwent considerable abrasion. The polishing and
finer markings are effected by the clay, sand, and smaller
stones. In this way many of the inequalities of the ground
are worn away by glaciers; and the markings give us con
clusive proof, not only of the bodily motion of glaciers, but

 160           Mr. R. Mountford Deeley's Theory
 also of their former existence in areas where they are now
 absent. Such evidence may be seen scattered over almost
 the whole of Northern and Central Europe.
    We have so far only considered the initial motion of a
 glacier resulting from its weight and elasticity. As soon as
 the strains became proportional to the stresses (we shall be
 sufficiently accurate if we regard the problem as a kinematical
 one), all movements ceased; and, without the existence of some
 further reason for motion, the ice would remain motionless in
 its bed. Generally speaking the strains produced by weight
 alone would not be sufficient to cause more than local rupture
 in such a hard material. The distortion so far undergone
 may be considered as one of elastic shear.
      isplace a glacier by an equal bulk of firm clay. The clay,
 being heavier than the ice and nothing like so capable of re
 sisting shear, ought, on the fracture theory, to move; but in
 reality it would remain in the valley for a lengthened period
without showing any signs of continuous motion. Now, if
 the weight of the clay is not sufficient to produce shear and
 give rise to motion, why should gravity act so powerfully
upon each particle of ice, a much harder and more cohesive
 material, and cause the whole to move like a sluggish river?
 Fracture cannot occur until an amount of general movement
has taken place sufficient to throw strains upon some portions
 greater than the ice at such points can withstand without
 rupture. What we have, therefore, to explain is how this
 general movement comes about : fracture and regelation are
mere secondary phenomena arising from glacier motion.
    Now we have seen how a glacier takes an initial set, or
elastic shear, by reason of its weight and elasticity. Every
portion of the mass is supporting a certain proportion of the
load; and every internal particle of ice which at any time
thaws and ceases to be an element of strength gives rise to a
further set or movement. On the other hand, when the
water in a cavity freezes, it does not begin to afford any
support until a strain is thrown upon it by the differential
motion of surrounding particles. Gravity may therefore give rise
to a slow but continuous change of form in an elastic substance
in the interior of which liquefaction and resolidification are con
stantly going on. Changes of bulk (I do not mean change of
form or reduction of mass by thawing) do not take place to
any extent in a glacier as a whole; what we have to consider
is shear, a sliding of particle over particle, producing change
of form or distortion, whether internal or external.         In an
experiment with the steel plate it was proved that by destroy
ing at numerous points the support afforded by the metal,

                        of Glacier Motion.                   161
then restoring the continuity of the mass,     and  repeating the
operation, any amount of deformity could be produced. It
therefore follows that if it can be shown that constant lique
faction and resolidification is going on within a glacier, we
have all the essential requisites for producing glacier-motion.
   It would be difficult to say which is the most interesting of
the numerous properties of water in its liquid and solid states.
We are in the habit of considering its freezing-point as being a
fixed temperature; but Professor W. Thomson proved experi
mentally that the melting-point of ice is lowered by about the
seventy-fifth part of a degree Fahrenheit for every additional
atmosphere of pressure. That is, ice under a pressure of about
eleven hundred pounds per square inch melts at 31° instead
of 32°Fahr. Hold a slab of lake-ice in the sun's rays. The
heat attacks the ice in its interior and produces liquid flowers
of great beauty. Watch a flower as it develops! Suddenly
a clink is heard, and a bright vacuous spot appears like a
silver bead in the centre of the flower.         Before the spot
formed, the water in the cavity was in a state of tension, and
the clink heard was the vibration produced by the tension
overcoming the cohesion of the particles of water, and causing
rupture. A condition somewhat similar to that of tension, or
negative pressure, exists in water when freed from air and
heated in a bath of linseed-oil and oil of cloves. In this way
it has been raised, while under a pressure of one atmosphere
 only, to a temperature of 356°F. Now 356°F. would indicate
 a cohesive force equal to nearly ten atmospheres. The negative
 pressure of the water formed by the internal melting of ice,
 in the absence of air-bubbles, probably exceeds this amount.
 If positive pressure lowers the freezing-point, negative pres
 sure should raise it.    From this it follows that the water in a
 liquid flower or glacier cavity is surrounded by and in con
 tact with ice sufficiently cold to freeze it directly the source
 of heat which produced liquefaction is removed. Professor
 Tyndall placed some lake-ice containing cavities filled with
 water and air in a warm-water bath. As soon as a cavity
 was reached by the melting of its walls the inclosed air-bubble
 at once shrank to a small proportion of its original volume,
 showing that even in this case the freezing-point of the water
 was above that of the surrounding ice. Other experiments
 £h
  act.
         it is needless to relate have been made confirming this
    During fine sunny weather, or even with warm rain,
 £          have been shown to move more rapidly than when
 the weather is cold and snowy; and if the glacier could be
 cooled several degrees below the freezing-point, and shaded

from radiant heat, all motion would cease; for experiment tells
us that it is only when at or about the freezing-point that
ice is what Principal Forbes called viscous. It is interesting
to note that those particles of ice which have to carry the
greatest load, that is, are in a state of compression, are the
most likely to be the first melted; a fact which not only ac
counts for the inability of ice to extend much when in tension,
but increases the efficacy of liquefaction and recongelation to
produce glacier-motion.
    I will not attempt to refer to the bearing of this theory
upon ribboned structure and the many other interesting
peculiarities of glacier ice, the present opportunity not being
convenient for their detailed treatment.

  ON THE INFLUENCE OF LIGHT UPON THE ELECTRIC DISCHARGE.
                  BY E. WIEDEMANN AND H. EBERT.
PRQ.:      H. HERTZ * in a recent paper, “On the Influence of
       Ultra-Violet Light upon the Electric Discharge,” has described
a series of experiments which show that light-rays, and, according
to Prof Hertz, exclusively the extreme ultra-violet rays, exert
 a certain influence upon the passage of electricity in a spark
 discharge. It remained uncertain whether this influence was of a
 primary nature, or whether the passage of the discharges was
 effected by secondary impulses produced by the action of the light.
 In order to obtain a nearer insight into the conditions and nature
 of the phenomenon, we have, in the first place, repeated Hertz's
 experiment, and always with complete success; then we have
 further varied the conditions of the experiment, and have thus
 obtained the following results. As source of light we nearly
 always employed an electric arc-lamp; in particular cases burning
 magnesium.
    (1) The phenomenon is seen with the greatest regularity not
 only with the discharge of an induction-coil, but also when a Holtz
 machine is used, that is, with statical electricity, if the discharge
 upon which the light acts is contained in a secondary circuit of a
 Holtz machine, the spark-length of the primary circuit being varied
 by means of a spark-micrometer. Illumination of the discharge
 produces a lowering of the potential necessary for the passage of
 the electricity.
    (2) In order to study the influence of the light during the
 passage of electricity in the passive discharge, one pole of the machine
 was connected with the earth; the electricity accumulated upon the
                         Wied. Ann. xxxi. p. 983 (1887).

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              163
other pole passed first through the spark-length, then through a
discharge-tube of the usual form, or a telephone wrapped with
india-rubber, and then to earth. The result was that not only the
rhythm of the discharge was entirely different (as shown by the
altered note in the telephone), but the whole character of the
discharge was altered, as the appearance of the Geissler-tube showed
without difficulty. In place of the irregular discharge, upon
illumination a steady discharge occurred (also clearly observed
directly in the spark length); but all this occurred only with the
negative discharge through the spark-length. With the passage of
positive electricity, there is no difference between illumination
and non-illumination. In order to obtain the phenomena, sharply
disturbing reflexions of the light from one ball upon the other must
be avoided. In the same way the phenomena may be disturbed by
the induction of the electricity accumulated upon the balls. If we
avoid these disturbances by suitable arrangements, then, with atmo
 spheric pressure, upon illumination and passage of negative electricity,
we hear a note, and upon non-illumination a noise veiling a much
 deeper note. With positive electricity there is no difference to be
 observed. The change which the discharge itself suffers is very
 striking. When the light does not reach it, there are irregular
 paths in which the electricity passes which change their form and
 place so often that, in consequence of the persistence of the image
 upon the retina, there are several to be seen at the same time; as
 soon as the first ray of light reaches the place at which the negative
electricity enters the spark-distance, all these paths unite into one,
 in which the electricity passes perfectly steadily and uniformly
 without noise as at first. At both balls it is at right angles to their
surface.
   (3) The intensity of this action of the rays upon the negative
electricity is essentially dependent upon the pressure of the gas in
 which the experiment is made; with certain moderate pressures and
distances between the balls, it reaches its maximum, from which it
diminishes rapidly both with increase and with decrease of
 pressures.
    (4) Further, the mode of illumination plays an important part; it
is essentially only one point of the electric light (which was the part
exclusively employed in the later experiments), and that the hottest
 part of the carbons, which is especially concerned in producing the
phenomenon; the rays therefrom must accurately strike the point
 where the discharge strikes the negative ball; for the reason already
given, it is advantageous to shade the positive ball.
   (5) The phenomenon is seen both in dry and in moist atmo
spheric air, in dry and moist hydrogen as well as in an atmosphere
 of carbonic acid; in the latter gas remarkably clear and sharp.
The maximum intensity of action occurs in different gases at
different pressures; this has apparently an intimate connexion
with the development of the kathode-rays.
    (6) The phenomenon is certainly not exclusively associated
 with the ultra-violet rays; this is seen most clearly in the experi

 164          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
ments with moist carbonic acid; here it is essentially rays which
belong to the visible part of the spectrum which show themselves
active. For if, to begin with, the ultra-violet light be shut off by
means of a glass plate placed before the lamp, we yet observe the
most marked difference if, by means of a board, a red or a green
glass, the more refrangible visible rays are taken away; blue glass
allowed the active rays to pass to a large extent. That it cannot
be the heat-rays which bring about the observed difference, is seen
from the fact that a plate of alum or a glass trough filled with
alum-solution did not affect the action.    It is to be remembered
that the kathode-rays are of different colours in carbonic acid and
in hydrogen.
   (7) From these experiments, and particularly from the fact that
it is exclusively the negative electricity which is influenced by the
light, we come to the conclusion that the above phenomena are
most intimately related to the production of the kathode-rays. The
conditions favourable to the development of the synchronously
vibrating kathode-rays are facilitated by the light falling on the
electrodes, since their wave-length is different in different gases.
Different gases must be specially sensitive to the action of different
regions of the spectrum of different wave-length. The development
of the kathode-rays is further dependent, in a manner conditioned
by the individual peculiarity of the gas, upon the pressure; so that
the magnitude of the influence which light striking the electrodes
can exert must also be dependent upon the pressure. The pheno
menon we are considering may then probably be regarded as a kind
of resonance-phenomenon, somewhat similar to the bringing about
of an explosion by the detonation of certain definite substances only.
The kathode-rays, as it were, make the way clear for the succeeding
discharge.—Proc. of the Phys.-Med. Inst. of Erlangen.

 XVIII. On a Law of Distribution of Molecular Velocities
   amongst the Molecules of a Fluid. By JoHN BUCHANAN,
   B.Sc. *
IT is knownt that if a mechanical system at rest be set in
      motion by impulses, the kinetic energy of the system is
a maxllmulln Or at Imlill Inllin.
   The kinetic energy is always a maximum when the impulses
are given, and when different motions possible under the
conditions of the system, and fulfilling the law of energy, are
considered. It is a minimum if the system be 'i from
rest by impulses applied only at places where the velocities to
be produced are specified.             *
   The present paper has for its object the introduction of
these theorems into the Kinetic Theory of Gases, and into
questions whose mathematical treatment may be of a similar
nature.
   Many years ago Clerk-Maxwell discovered his law relating
to the most probable manner of distribution of the molecular
velocities amongst the molecules of a quantity of gas whose
centre of gravity is at rest, or is moving uniformly in a
straight line. I propose to show that a law of the same form
holds for the distribution of the molecular velocities in a fluid
whose molar kinetic energy fulfils a maximum, or a minimum,

166       Mr. J. Buchanan on a Law of Distribution of
or a maximum-minimum condition.           It is of course assumed
that the fluid has a “coarse-grained ” structure.
   In the proof given below, the important assumption is also
made that the molecular energy of the fluid is       ''       due to
the linear motion of the molecules; or, rather, that if any
portion of this energy exists in the forms of molecular rotation
and vibration, this portion remains constant in value, and
may therefore be left out of account in what follows.
                             Proof”.
   By the term “element of volume at a point” is to be
understood a very small volume enclosing the point. This
elementary volume is supposed to be extremely small compared
with the whole volume occupied by the fluid, but very large
compared with the average space occupied by a molecule of
the fluid.
   The molar velocity of such an element of volume of the
fluid may be defined in precisely such terms as those in which
Clerk-Maxwell defines the velocity of a gast:—If we determine
the motion of the centre of gravity of all the molecules within
the element of volume, then the molar velocity of the ele
mentary volume of fluid may be defined as the velocity of the
centre of gravity of all the molecules within that region.
   In an element of volume at a point P let there be N mole
cules. Let us take three rectangular axes of reference, and
let us denote the components of the linear velocity of the nth
molecule by un, v, w, and its mass by mn.

fulfils a maximum, or a minimum, or a maximum-minimum
condition, then the distribution of molecular (linear) velocities
follows a law of the same form as that of Maxwell for gases.

 XIX. On the Price of the Factor of Safety in the Materials
  for Lightning-rods. By Professor SILVANUs P. THOMPsoN,
   D.Sc.*
 IT is    possible to determine in an absolute manner what
     metal is best for securing safety by a system of lightning
conductors, for a given prime cost. In the calculations that
follow it is assumed that the duration of the lightning-discharge
is so brief that there is no time for appreciable radiation or
convection of heat from the surface of the conductor, or for
conduction into other bodies; and that the conductor is devoid
of self-induction.
   Safety is dependent, other things being equal, upon the
difficulty of fusion of the conductor. The difficulty of fusion
of the conductor varies directly as the fusing-point of the ma
terial (or, more strictly, as the difference between this tempera-.
ture and that of the surrounding air, assumed here to be 15°C.),
and inversely as the temperature-rise occasioned in it by the
discharge of electricity, the amount of which is supposed to be
given. The temperature-rise varies inversely as the specific
thermal capacity of the material, and directly as the heat
developed in it. The heat caused by a given discharge of
electricity varies directly as the total electric resistance of the
conductor.      The total electric resistance of the conductor
varies directly as the specific electric resistance per unit cube
of volume of the material of the conductor, also      '        as its
length, and inversely as its area of cross section (supposed
uniform throughout). The area of section varies directly as
the volume and inversely as the length (supposed given).
The volume varies inversely as the density of the material and
directly as its mass. The mass of the conductor varies directly
as the total cost, and inversely as the cost per unit of mass.
   Hence, writing f for the temperature of fusion above that
of the surrounding air     ('         at 15° C.), s for the specific
thermal capacity, p for the specific electric resistance, l for
the given length, d for the density, k for the cost, in pence,
per pound of the material of the conductor, it at once follows
that
          Safety varies as total cost x px dfx      s
                                                 XFXk.

of iron for equal conductivity; and reckoning on this basis,

that were all, then doubtless the small saving in using iron
 would be more than counterbalanced by the attendant dis
advantages of deterioration by rust, and the like. But when
the higher fusion-point, the greater capacity for heat, and the
lesser density of iron are taken into account, the superiority
of iron, for equal total prime cost, becomes so marked as to
once more raise the question whether it may not be expedient to
 return to the original practice of Franklin, and use lightning
rods of iron instead of those of copper.

    XX. On some Questions in the Kinetic Theory of Gases.
                   Reply to Prof. Boltzmann.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
A”       you have translated Prof. Boltzmann's voluminous
       attack, I have to request you to publish my reply, com
municated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh on January 30th.
I have compressed it as far as I can, for I fear to weary your
readers by lengthened discussions of a somewhat personal
character.
   With reference to Mr. Burbury's note, I will only say for
the present that I pretend to no “authority,” having ap
proached this subject simply as a student; and that it is with
the statements of   C' and Clausius that I hold him
to be at variance.                       Yours truly,
                                                    P. G. TAIT.
   Hearing, again by accident, that Professor Boltzmann has
in the Vienna Sitzungsberichte published a new attack on my
papers about the Kinetic Theory, I at once ordered a copy,
which has at length arrived. As my papers appeared in our
“Transactions, I think my answer to this fresh attack should
be communicated in the first place to this Society. The time
I can spare for such work at this period of the year is very
scant, and Prof. Boltzmann has raised a multitude of ques
tions. I will take them in order. But I must commence by
saying, with reference to Prof. Boltzmann’s peculiar remarks
on my behaviour as a critic, that, while leaving them to the
judgment of readers, I shall have to bring before the same
' several         instances in which Prof. Boltzmann has com
  letely misstated the contents or the objects of my papers.
  his is not a new departure. In his first attack on me he said
that I had nowhere stated that my investigations were con
fined to hard spherical particles; whereas I had been parti
cularly explicit on that very point. But fresh cases of a
similar character abound in this new attack.
    First. There runs through this paper an undercurrent, at
least, of accusation against me for putting forward my results
 as new, and thus ignoring the work of others. I had no such
 intention, and I do not think anything I have said can bear
 such a construction. My knowledge of the later history of
 the subject is no doubt now considerably greater than it
 was about two years ago, when, at Sir William Thomson's

      On some Questions in the Kinetic Theory of Gases,        173
request, I undertook an examination of Clerk-Maxwell's
first proof of his own Theorem. But it is still of a very
fragmentary character. I had, years ago, read papers by
Maxwell and by Clausius, and had glanced at the treatises of
O. E. Meyer and Watson. I had also made a collection of
various papers by Prof. Boltzmann. But I found that, with
Out £ expenditure of time and labour, it would be impos
sible to master the contents of the three last-named works,
mainly because the methods employed seemed to me altogether
unnecessarily intricate. [I have already stated the impression
£           on me by such of Prof. Boltzmann's '' as I
  ave tried to read, and I need not recur to it.]        therefore
set to work for myself, having certain definite asserted results
in view, but little knowledge of the processes which their dis
coverers or propounders had used. After obtaining a demon
stration of Clerk-Maxwell's Theorem, I was led to pursue my
investigations into other matters, such as the rate of restora
tion of the special state, the size of molecules, &c. I brought
before the Society such of these investigations as I had more
fully developed; and I hope to communicate others. One
object which I tried to keep constantly in view was to make
my papers at least easily intelligible. Intelligibility is not too
common a characteristic of papers or treatises on this subject.
But if I have succeeded in putting some parts of the Founda
tions of the Kinetic Theory (for to these alone do my papers
profess to extend) in a form which renders them easily appre
hended, I shall have done a real service to students of Physical
Science. The other object at which I aimed was, of course,
the verification of Maxwell's Theorem ; and of the extension
of it (to all degrees of freedom of complex molecules) which
was made by Prof. Boltzmann. Sir W£ Thomson and
myself were, in fact, called to the question by the discre
pancies between the observed behaviour of gases and the
behaviour which Prof. Boltzmann's Theorem would have led
us to expect. To test this excessively general theorem, I
determined to examine certain special cases, and (that these
might be, however imperfectly, represented by systems of free
particles) it was necessary to assume want of freedom for
collision, though confessedly as one step only. I could not,
of course, in this way put limits on the excursions or the
admissible speeds for different degrees of freedom.
   Second. While examining, and seeking to improve, the
proof which Clerk-Maxwell originally gave of his Theorem, I
found it impossible to begin without the assumption of a
certain   "' of distribution           of masses and velocities;
and of course I sought how to justify such an assumption.        I

174              Prof. Tait on some Questions in
was thus led to believe that collisions, not merely of particles
of the two kinds with one another but among those of each
kind, are absolutely necessary for this justification. Then I
saw that, in complex molecules, perfect freedom of collisions
of all kinds of “degrees of freedom” could not possibly be
secured, and that this might, in part at least, account for the
discrepance between Prof. Boltzmann's Theorem and the
observed behaviour of gases. I saw also that, for the truth
even of Maxwell’s Theorem, it was necessary that neither of
the two gases should be in an overwhelming majority. Thus
these two things, which Prof. Boltzmann now speaks of as
“physically less important,” are from my point of view vital
to the general truth of his Theorem.
   Prof. Boltzmann commences his recent paper by citing a
“general equation” from the Philosophical Magazine of
April 1887; and of it he says:—                         -
   “Bei Ableitung dieser Gleichung habe ich dortim Ubrigen
genau dieselben    W' zu                 Grunde gelegt, welche
auch Herr Tait machte, nur dass ich iiber die relative Grösse
der Durchmesser X und A der Moleciile beider Gase, sowie
über den Grössenwerth des Verhältnisses N1 : N, nicht die
mindeste Annahme gemacht habe.”
   This is so far from being the case, that it was precisely his
assumptions, and not his proof, which I disputed. My remark
WaS :--
   “I think it will be allowed that Prof. Boltzmann's assump
tions, which (it is easy to see) practically beg the whole
question, are themselves inadmissible, except as consequences of
the mutual impacts of the particles in each of the two systems    s
separately.”
   Of course, with his assumptions, Prof. Boltzmann obtains
the desired result:-having in them virtually begged the
question. He now blames me for not having said a word in
refutation of his proof, for I had professed my willingness to
allow its accuracy without even reading it. There was no
discourtesy in that remark:—nothing but a cheerful admission
that, in the hands of Prof. Boltzmann, such premises could not
fail to give the result sought. My comments were in fact
necessarily confined to the assumptions. For, as I could not
admit them, the proof founded on them had no interest for
me. Professor Boltzmann assumed that two sets of particles,
even if they have no internal collisions, will by their mutual
collisions arrive at a state of uniform distribution in space,
and of average behaviour alike in all directions. This      may :
possibly be true, but it is certainly very far from being axio
matic, and thus demands strict proof before it can be lawfully

                    the Kinetic Theory of Gases.                 175
used as a basis for further argument. In quoting my remarks
on this point Prof. Boltzmann very significantly puts an “&c.”
in place of the following words:—“it is specially to be noted
that this is a question of effective diameters only and not of
masses:—so that those particles which are virtually free from
the self-regulating power of mutual collisions, and therefore
form a disturbing element, may be much more massive than
the others.” It was of this preliminary matter, of course,
that I spoke when I wrote the following sentence, which
seems to have annoyed Prof. Boltzmann —
   “I have not yet seen any attempt to prove that two sets of
particles, which have no internal collisions, will by their mu
tual collisions tend to the state assumed by Prof. Boltzmann.”
   I think it probable that Prof. Boltzmann has not fully
apprehended the meaning of the word “assumed ” in this
sentence. Otherwise I cannot understand why he is annoyed
because I took his proof for granted.
   In taking leave, for the time, of this special question, I
need scarcely do more, and I cannot do less, than reaffirm the
assertion just quoted:—while adding the remark that this is
very far from being my sole objection to Prof. Boltzmann's
very general Theorem. In fact Professors Burnside" and
J. J.  £             have quite recently advanced other serious
objections. Prof. Boltzmann's Theorem, in a word, is not
yet demonstrated.
    Third. As to the questions of viscosity and heat-conduction;
my investigations were expressly made on the assumption that
change of permeability, due to motion, was negligible. When
I found that I had obtained in a very simple way certain
characteristic results of Clerk-Maxwell and of Clausius respec
 tively, I was satisfied with the approximation I had made.
 Prof. Boltzmann does not allude to the fact that my investi
 gation was distinctly stated to be an     ''
 and that the additional consideration he now adduces had
                                                          one only,
been before me and had been rejected (rightly or wrongly)
for reasons given. I said:—
    “Strictly speaking, the exponent should have had an addi
tional term . . . . .    See the remarks in § 39 below.”
    And, in the § 39 thus pointedly referred to, one of the
remarks in question is:—
    “We neglect, however, as insensible the difference between
the absorption due to slowly moving layers and that due to
 the same when stationary.”
    And, in fact, the result which I gave for the viscosity (and
      * Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin. 1887.        + Phil. Trans. 1887.

176               Prof. Tait on some Questions in
which Professor Boltzmann, without doubt justly, claims as
his own) is correct under the conditions by which I restricted
 my investigation. The introduction of the consideration of
 change of permeability due to the shearing motion involves
 an alteration of about eleven or twelve per cent only in this
avowedly approximate result. Of this I have assured myself
 by a rough calculation, and I will work it out more fully
 when I have leisure.      It seems that I have missed this in
looking over Meyer's book, and, according to Prof. Boltzmann,
 all investigators except Meyer have fallen into the same trap.
 Meanwhile the calculation with which Prof. Boltzmann has
 furnished me gives an excellent example of his style, for it is
 altogether unnecessarily tedious. And it seems to contain two
   igantic errors which, however, compensate one another.
#or his integrand contains the factor e-Vip. Here f is a
 signless quantity, and the limits show that w is always posi
tive and p always       ''         As written, therefore, the in
tegral is infinite, though in the result it is made to come out
finite. The object of the paragraphs 1 and 2, which imme
diately follow, is unintelligible to me. The former seems to
suggest the use of an unsound method; the latter has no
discoverable bearing on anything that I have written. Prof.
Boltzmann has also afforded an idea of the value which he
himself attaches to the terrific array of symbols in the 95
pages of his 1881 paper (to which he r: me) by now
allowing that he is not prepared to assert that any one of
three determinations of the coefficient of viscosity which he
quotes (mine, or rather his own, being among them) is to be
preferred to the others!
    Fourth. Prof. Boltzmann refers to my remarks on Mr.
Burbury’s assertion that a single particle, with which they
Call  £,      would reduce to the special state a group of non
colliding particles. Prof. Boltzmann signified his belief in
the truth of this proposition; and in answer I showed that
(were it true) aeons would be required for the process, even
if that were limited to a single cubic inch of gas. He now
calls this an “entirely new question ” and will not “prolong
the controversy by its discussion.” I do not see that, so far
at least as the “ controversy” is concerned, it is any newer
than the rest.     It is contained in the first instalment of his
attack. Why, then, should he now desert it? But Prof.
Boltzmann, in thus leaving the subject, takes a step well
calculated to prolong the discussion, for he represents me as
speaking of the instantaneous reversal of the motions of all
the particles, whereas my argument was specially based on
the reversal of the motion of the single stranger alone, a con

tingency which might possibly occur by collision even with a
particle of the gas, certainly by collision with the containing
vessel. There is a common proverb, “All roads lead to
Rome.” It seems it ought now to be amended by the addi
tion, “whether you go backwards or forwards along them.”
    Fifth. As to my proof (so designated) of the Maxwell Law
of distribution of velocities:—I have already explained that
this part of my paper was a mere introductory sketch, in
 tended to make into a connected whole a series of detached
 investigations, and therefore contained no detailed and formal
 proofs whatever. Maxwell’s result as to the error-law dis
 tribution of velocities, being universally accepted, was thus
 discussed in the briefest manner possible. I said also that a
 detailed proof can be given on the lines of § 21 of my paper.
 Prof. Boltzmann” at first accused me of reasoning in a
 circulus vitiosus, and went the extreme length of asserting
 that the independence of velocities in different directions can
 do no more than prove the density (in the velocity space
 diagram) to be dependent on the radius vector only. Now,
 when I have taken the trouble to point out briefly and with
 out detail what I meant by the statements he misunderstood,
 he says I have admitted that my proof is defective ! For my
 own part, I see no strong reason wholly to reject even the
 first proof given by Maxwell; and it must be observed that
 although its author said (in 1866) that it depends on an as
 sumption which “may appear precarious,” this did not neces
 sarily imply that it appeared to himself to be precarious.
 The question really at issue was raised in a very clear form
 by Prof. Newcomb, who was the earliest to take exception to
 my first sketch of a proof. He remarked that it seemed to
 him to possess too much of a geometrical character (i.e. to
 ' a physical statement by mere space-reasoning), while
    axwell’s seemed to involve an unauthorized application of
 the Theory of Probabilities. In consequence of this ob
jection I examined the question from a great many points of
 view, but I still think my original statement correct. What
 I said was “But the argument above shows further, that this
 density must be expressible in the form
                               f(a) f(y) f(z)
 whatever rectangular axes be chosen                £        through the
 origin.” In my second paper I said (in explanation of this
    * This addition to Prof. Boltzmann's first attack on me seems to have
 appeared in the Phil. Mag, alone. It is not in either of the German
  copies in my possession (for one of which I am indebted to the author),
  nor do I find it in the Sitzungsberichte of the Vienna Academy.

 178    On some Questions in the Kinetic Theory of Gases.
 to Prof. Boltzmann) that the behaviour parallel to y and 2
 (though not the number) of particles whose velocity compo
 nents are from a to x +dr, must obviously be independent of
 a, so that the density of “ends” in the velocity-space diagram
 is of the form f(x). F(y,z). The word I have underlined
 may be very easily justified. No collisions count, except
 those in which the line of centres is practically perpendi
 cular to a (for the others each dismiss a particle from the
 minority; and its place is instantly supplied by another,
which behaves exactly as the first did), and therefore the
 component of the relative speed involved in the collisions which
 we require to consider depends wholly on y and 2 motions.
 Also, for the same reason, the frequency of collisions of various
 kinds (so far as w is concerned) does not come into question.
Thus the y and 2 speeds, not only in one a layer but in all,
are entirely independent of v ; though the number of par
ticles in the layer depends on r alone. Prof. Boltzmann's
remark about my quotation from De Morgan will now be
seen to be somewhat irrelevant so far as       # am    concerned,
though he may (perhaps justly) apply it to some of his own
work.                                               -
    Sirth. As to the Mean Path, though I still hold my own
definition to be the correct one, I would for the present
merely say that Prof. Boltzmann entirely avoids the state
ment I made to the effect that those who adopt Maxwell's
definition, which is not the ordinary definition of a “mean,”
must face the question “Why not . . . . define the mean
path as the product of the average speed into the average
time of describing a free path?” The matter is, however, of
so little moment, that a very great authority, whom I con
sulted as to the correct definition of the Mean Free Path, told
me that the preferable one was that which lent itself most
readily to integration.
   Seventh. In his remarks upon the effect of external poten
tial, Prof. Boltzmann does not defend his proof to w£ I
objected, but gives a new and fearfully elaborate one. And
he quotes, as a remark of mine on this entirely different
proof, the  '       “this remarkable procedure” which I had
applied to his objectionable old one ! He also treats in a dis
paraging manner the assumption on which my very short in
vestigation is based ; viz. “When a system of colliding par
ticles has reached its final state, we may assume that on the
average for every particle which enters, and undergoes collision
in, a thin layer, another goes out from the other side of the
layer precisely as the first would have done had it escaped col
lision.” Of course it would be easy to make a 20 page proof

            On the Measurement of Electric Currents.          179
of this by the help of an imposing array of multiple integrals.
But this would be the sort of thing which I have called
“playing with symbols,” i.e. using them instead of thought,
while their proper function is to assist thought. A mathema
tical demonstration does not necessarily imply the use of
symbols, any more than that of diagrams:—and, when we
find an author continually using symbols to establish what is
obvious without them, we very naturally question the validity
of his symbolical processes when they are employed for their
legitimate purpose. I still think the assumption above a
legitimate and indeed almost an obvious one; but it is strange
that an objection of this kind should come from a writer like
Prof. Boltzmann, who (see head Second above) has made, and
still defends, a fundamental assumption (of the class to which
he applies the term “unbewiesene Woraussetzung”) which
most clamantly demands proof.
   Finally, as Prof. Boltzmann objects alike to Greek, and to
English, quotations, although they have Plato and De Morgan
for their authors, what does he say to the Latin one
         “Quis tulerit Gracchos de seditione querentes”?
XXI. On the Application of the Electrolysis of Copper to the
   Measurement of Electric Currents. By THOMAS GRAY,
   B.Sc., F.R.S.E."
IN     the Philosophical Magazine for November 1886 I pub
     lished results of experiments on this subject which had been
conducted in the physical laboratory of Glasgow University.
Since that time the electrolysis of copper has £, extensively
employed in that laboratory for standardizing Sir William
Thomson's new Standard Electric Balances, and considerable
additional experience has thus been obtained as to the accuracy
of the method. As the result of that experience, it may be con
fidently asserted that the constant of an electric-current instru
ment can be obtained with certainty within a twentieth per
cent. of absolute accuracy by copper electrolysis. Although
the mode of manipulation that seemed most likely to lead to
satisfactory results, and the precautions to be attended to,
were pretty fully given in the paper above referred to, Sir
William Thomson has called my attention to one or two
defects in it which seem to render a supplementary paper
desirable.
   When discussing the proper value to be taken as the electro
                     * Communicated by the Author.

180      Mr. T. Gray on the Application of the Electrolysis
chemical equivalent of copper, I pointed out that the current
 density at the surface of the cathode required to be taken into
 consideration, because the plates gradually lost weight in the
solution. Beyond a general statement of the approximate
 correction to be allowed for increased area of the cathode
 plate, and a remark that it depended to some extent on the
temperature, little information was given on this somewhat
important part of the subject. In order to remove this defect,
 advantage has been taken of the continual use of electrolysis
 in the standardizing experiments already referred to; and a
 large number of electrolytic cells with plates of widely differ
 ing areas have generally been used in each experiment, in order
to accumulate information on the subject. The effect of tem
perature has also been more fully investigated. In some of
the special experiments on the effect of temperature, two sets
of cells at different temperatures were simultaneously used for
the purpose of finding whether the deposits were the same for
very small plates. The results showed that the same deposit is
obtained at all temperatures if the plate be small enough.
The smallness of the plate is, however, limited by the necessity
of obtaining a good deposit. In the majority of cases one set
of plates only was used, the object being to find the relative
deposit on plates of different sizes for several temperatures
ranging between 0° and 35° Centigrade.
   The solution used for these experiments had a density
varying between 1:15 and 1:18, and always contained free
'. he solution was generally made to density 1:18, and
one per cent. of sulphuric acid added. This solution was then
used for an aggregate time of about ten hours, no additional
acid being added, and was then discarded. The volume of
solution used per square centimetre of plate-surface immersed
was about three cubic centimetres, and the whole of the solu
tion for the set of cells was mixed between each pair of expe
riments. Ordinary commercial copper sulphate was used in
nearly all cases, and it was dissolved in water simply taken
from the Glasgow water-supply, which is, however, almost
  ure. Previous experiments showed that there was no appre
ciable difference between the results obtained with solutions
made in this way and solutions made from pure sulphate dis
solved in distilled water. In the method of preparing the
  lates previous to immersion in the cells, practically no change
£ been made since the previous paper was written. The
plates have generally been simply polished with fine, clean,
dry glass-paper, the loose dust wiped off with a clean silk
cloth, and the plates then weighed.     For polishing the plates
a cylinder covered with clean glass-paper is fixed in the lathe

      of Copper to the Measurement of Electric Currents.    181
and made to revolve rapidly, while the plate is held lightly
against it by means of a pad. This avoids touching either
the paper or the part of the plate to be put in the liquid with
the fingers. A £ circular brush or a soft silk or velvet
pad at the end of the cylinder, and revolving with the paper,
is convenient for cleaning off any dust or loose glass from the
surface of the plate after it is polished. A set of five or ten
plates may be cleaned in this way in a few minutes, and never
fail to give a firm deposit and accordant results. The method
of washing and drying the plates after they are removed from
the cells, which was recommended in my former paper, has
been adhered to throughout. As the plates were removed
from the cells they were rinsed two or three times in clean
water very slightly acidulated, and then placed in a shallow
glass tray containing pure water. From this they were
almost immediately taken, dried first in a clean pad of blotting
paper, and finally in front of a bright fire, care being taken
not to heat the plates much.
   The perfect regularity of the results of experiments such
 as those here referred to is greatly interfered with by the
 accidental inaccuracies of small amount which are almost
 unavoidable. The total difference of weight between one
 plate and the next of a series did not as a rule amount, at
 ordinary temperatures, to more than a few tenths of a milli
 gramme; and this was subject to error, which might be com
 parable with its total amount, from inaccuracy in weighing,
 from want of perfect insulation between the    £    from slight
 oxidation of the plate in the drying, and so on. The results
 of the individual experiments were, however, in very good
 agreement; and I believe the mean results as given in the
 tables and curves below will be found to be very close to the
 truth.
    An inspection of the tables and curves will show that the
 effect of temperature, especially when that reaches about 30°
 Centigrade, is very important. The results become so sensi
 tive to difference of temperature at about 35° C., that a
 difference of a degree or two between the different cells pro
 duces marked irregularity in the curve. At the ordinary
 temperature of a   £y         in this country, say from 10°C.
 to 15°C., the effect of difference of temperature is not im
 portant, and the numbers given for 12°C. in the table will be
 found near enough for most purposes. In hot climates, how
 ever, where the temperature of the laboratory may be 35°C.,
 or even more, the variations of temperature would require to
 be very carefully attended to.
    Some experiments made for the purpose of testing whether
 Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 25. No. 154. March 1888.           O

182 Mr. T. Gray on the Application of the Electrolysis
at the high temperatures a correction could be obtained by
keeping a plate of the same size as that used in the electrolysis
in a similar cell with no current passing through, showed that
 this method of working was capable of giving approximately
correct results. They are hardly ever absolutely exact, but
they should not differ from the truth by as much as one tenth
per cent, if the current-density is greater than the hundredth
 of an ampere per square centimetre of cathode surface.
    The curve for 2°C. is interesting as showing that, within a
considerable range of current-density, there is absolutely no
 effect produced by variation in size of plate at this temperature.
 Why there should be a somewhat pronounced effect when the
 size of the plate passes about two hundred square centimetres
 to the ampere is puzzling, and probably indicates a protecting
 power in the passage of the current through the cell. There
 is some slight evidence of such protection for high current
 densities at all temperatures. The curious shape of the curve
 for the temperature 12°, which, as will be seen from Table I.,
 again becomes steeper for lower current-densities than those
 shown in the curve, is very interesting. This result is certainly
 genuine, as that curve is taken from the mean of a large
 number of experiments made under varying conditions by
 different persons, and the whole of the individual experiments
 agree closely with the mean curve.
    Table I. and the diagram of curves which illustrate it
 give the relative results for different sizes of cathode, the
 point of crossing of the curves being reduced to 10,000 for
 the purpose of rendering the appropriate percentage correction
 for any particular size of plate easily estimated. £ regard
 to the curves at 2°, 23°, 28°, and 35°C., it should be stated
 that the curve for 2° is the mean of three experiments, that
 for 35° the mean of two experiments, while those for 23° and
 28° are single experiments.

 copper for the different current-densities and temperatures
 stated in the table; it is simply the numbers in Table I, mul

 as in the former paper, based on the results obtained by Lord
 Rayleigh and Mrs. Sidgwick for silver, or 001118 grm. of
 silver deposited per coulomb of electricity passed through the
 cell. The ratio of the electrochemical equivalents of copper
 and silver obtained in the experiments described in my former
    aper has been assumed as correct (Phil. Mag. Nov. 1886).
   t is 2940 when the copper plate presents a surface of 50 square
 centimetres per ampere of current.

XXII. On a New Method of Reducing Observations relating to
     Sereral Quantities.          By F. Y. EDGEwoRTH, M.A., Lecturer
     at King's College, London".
         SUBSTITUTE for the Method of Least Squares has
           been proposed by met, based upon the following prin
ciple. The data being of the form
           air + biy... - "1=0; as r + bay ...—v2 =0; &c.,
(where vi, v, &c. are observations of equal worth), a solu
tion is obtainable by taking r, y ... such that the sum of the
residuals (the left-hand members of the above-written equa
tions), each residual taken positively, should be a minimum #.

    | This rule is derivable from the hypothesis that the law of error, the
     --                      -                -          •                 /h
facility-curve under which the observations range, is ofthe form y= , e-hr;
a taken positively in both directions. But the use of the rule does not
commit us to the assumption of the hypothesis. The Method of Least
Sum is in this respect exactly on a }: with the Method of Least Squares.
The rule of the latter Method is—Determine a and y so that the sum of

     Reducing Observations relating to Several Quantities. 185
The point thus designated must be on each of two, or more,
loci analogous to the Normal equations of the ordinary method.
Accordingly the intersection of the “Median loci” was at first
proposed by me as the solution. But Mr. Turner has shown
that these loci are apt to have in common, not only several
points, but even lines and spaces”. Instructed by his mas
terly criticism, I now restate the rule as follows; confining
myself, for convenience of enunciation, to the case of two
unknown quantities.               -
    Trace the observation-lines in the neighbourhood of the true
point approximately knownt. Beginning at a point on one
of those lines, move continually: along one or other of the
lines in the direction for which         :     is least; R being the sum
of the residuals, each taken positively $. The value of              '     for
any path aw +by-v=0 at any assigned point is thus to be
ascertained. Let the sum of the a’s (coefficients of a) be
longing to the lines on the right of that point be A; and, to
the squares of the residuals may be the least possible. This rule is deri
vable from, and specially correlated with, the hypothesis that the law of
facility is the £                    But it is thought legitimate by Laplace
and other eminent authorities to employ the rule even where the hypo
thesis is not assumed.    No doubt the use of either method divorced from
the law of facility appropriate to it is open to logical objections. But
the difficulties are not greater for one method than for the other. The
£ writer's         explanation of the   £              difficulty common to
  oth methods is stated in the Appendix to a little treatise on the Art of
Measurement, entitled ‘Metretike’ (London: Temple Co., 1887). It is
#887.
         summarized in the ‘Cambridge Philosophical Transactions’ for
   * “On Mr. Edgeworth's Method of Reducing Observations relating to
Several Quantities,” by H. H. Turner, M.A., B.Sc., Fellow of Trinity
College, Cambridge. Philosophical Magazine, December 1887.
   t We may, as Mr. Turner says, “leave out of consideration those with
large residuals.” Or, more exactly, those for which the residual, divided by
the precision, is large. For the residual ax-Fby-v represents the perpen
dicular let fall from the point:ry, multiplied by the factor va'-b', which
factor may be called the precision. ' perpendicular, then, might be
short, and the line might run into the little field which we have to
explore, if, though the residual is large, it is matched by a large coefficient
of precision.
     The true point is in general on an observation-line. For, as Mr.
Turner has pointed out, the Median loci are in general made up of obser
vation-lines. The exceptions to this statement will be noticed presently.
   § That is, supposing all the v's to be observations of equal         '.
'         under one and the same facility-curve. Otherwise it is proper to
multiply each of the residuals entering into R by a factor proportional to
the Greatest Ordinate of the corresponding facility-curve (supposed
symmetrical). See Laplace, Théor. Analyt. Suppl. 2, sub finem.

 186           Mr. F. Y. Edgeworth on a New Method of
 the left, A'. Let the sum of the b's, above, be B; below, B'.
  Then
                     dR=(A’—A)dw-H (B'-B) dy;
  while
                  a de +b dy=0, and ds=Vd."+dy".
- When the starting-point is an intersection, we should put
  ourselves at the provimate point along the path which is being
  explored. To find         :    for another line passing through the
  same point, or for a neighbouring point and line, it will not
  be necessary to evaluate A A', BB' afresh.                 The coefficients
  of dw and dy in the expression for dR require alteration only
  in respect of the coefficients of those lines which have been
  crossed.
       Continue moving according to these directions, until a point
   is reached at which         :    is positive for every path passing
  through the point. This point constitutes the solution". It is
   in general unique. For, if possible, let there be two such
   minimum-points. Take the line joining them as the axis of y.
   Then the expression (bly—v1)+(bsy-v2) + &c., each of the
   bracketed terms taken positively, must be a minimum for two
   points on the ordinate. Which is in general absurd ; being
   possible only in the exceptional case when, in the notation
   above employed, B+ b is exactly equal to B', or B' + b to B.
   In this rare case the solution may be indeterminate, namely
   any point on a certain line or even areaf.
        n this event common sense seems to dictate that we should
   adopt the middle of the indeterminate tract as the best point;
   and this presumption is confirmed by a formal calculation of
   utility such as Laplace, in the simplest case of a single un
   known quantity, has employed to discover the “most advan
   tageous” point#.                                             -
      * The method may be illustrated thus:–Let C-R (where C is a con
   stant) represent the height of a surface, which will resemble the roof of
   an irregularly built slated house. Get on this roof somewhere near the
   top, and, moving continually    £          along some one of the edges or
    arrétes, climb up to the top. The highest position will in general consist .
    of a solitary pinnacle. But occasionally there will be, instead of a single
   point, a horizontal ridge, or even a flat surface.
       + This is Mr. Turner's “special case,” loc. cit. pp. 468 & 469.
       1 Laplace, dealing with a set of observations known to have emanated
   from a Probability-curve (Théor. Analyt book 2, chap. 4, art. 23), thus
   in effect reasons:—In the long run of cases, where we have to do with a
   set of observations exactly the same as the proposed set, the real point,
   which is the scurce from which this grouping emanated, occurs at different
   points with a frequency which is represented by a certain Probability

     Reducing Observations relating to Several Quantities. 187
   It may be worth while showing that, not only is the inde
terminateness in question rare and remediable, but it is also
apt to be slight and neglectible. For it tends to be of an
order which is insignificant in comparison with the probable
error to which the solution is liable.               It will be sufficient to
show that, in the case of a single quaesitum and observations
obeying the simplest law—ranged under one and the same
probability-curve—as the number of observations increases,
the space which is left blank at the centre tends to become
indefinitely small in comparison with the probable error of the
solution by the Method of Least Squares. The Modulus of
that error is #-* (where c is the Modulus of the primary Pro
bability-curve). Now consider the probability that a certain
fraction of that Modulus, say i          v. 7t,
                                                 measured from the centre
(the real point supposed known) will have remained blank.
The probability that any single observation should fall outside
the space + i      v.    may be written          (1–6( v.)),          where 6 is
the integral of the error-function. Hence the probability that
all the observations should lie outside that limit is

                               (1–6( ')).
Expanding and taking logarithms, we see that the logarithm
of this probability is of the order — Vn ; that is, it becomes
indefinitely improbable that the ith part of the probable error
should be left indeterminate. This investigation may be
extended to prove the required proposition in its generality.
curve whose     * is the Arithmetic Mean            of the given set (and whose
Modulus is the    with part of the     Modulus appertaining to the given ob
servations). If, now, we must put one point as representative of all the
series of points which the source may assume, the best representative, that
which minimises the detriment incident to inevitable error, is the centre
of the curve of sources; that is, the Arithmetic Mean of the given observa
tions. Now had the curve of sources given by Inverse Probability con
sisted of a horizontal line at the centre, as in the case before us, the reasonin
by which the central point is judged best would not have been £

I do not forget that, when the law of error is other than y= 5e-*,             this
reasoning is applicable less directly, and only in virtue of the explanations
referred to in the third note to p. 184.

tween the Median loci being thoroughly indeterminate. The broken line
pA B C Da, is the locus of Median both for ordinates and coordinates.

is therefore the required path. Proceeding to B we find
'. for the paths Bs and Bb, positive; and for the path BC,
zero. Also at the point C, all the paths except CB present a
positive increment. Hence the most probable solution is any
point on the line BC; and the best” solution is the middle of
that line.
   Thus the weighty objection to the new method on account
of its “failure to give a unique solution” f is completely
removed. It remains to consider the objection that it is not
less laborious than the ordinary method.
   Of course the issue cannot be decided on the score of con
venience alone. We must take accuracy also into account.
For this purpose we may distinguish two species of cases:
(2) those in which the Method of Medians has an advantage
in respect of accuracy, and (8) those where the Probability
curve is presumed to prevail. (2) Suppose that the law of
facility is “discordant,” made up of two Probability-curves,
thus:
                   =#     1  ***        1   -:
                3/     v/TC         * VTrc
By a formula of Laplace!, the probable error of the Median
is the reciprocal-of-the-Greatest-ordinate divided by V2n;
that is, in the case before us,
                           v: **s
                              2n      C+c
The corresponding error for the Arithmetic Mean prescribed
by the Method of Least Squares is the square root of twice
the Mean-Square-of-Error, divided by Vin; that is,
                             v CF-HG'.
                               v2n
It is evident that, if C and c be very unequal, the former
solution may be ever so much better than the latter.
   (8). In the ordinary case of laws of facility which are
Probability-curves, I should like to express myself with a
cautious deference to the opinion of practical astronomers.
On the one hand, the probable error is increased by about
twenty per cent, when we substitute the Median for the
Arithmetic or Linear Means. On the other hand, the labour
of extracting the former is rather less: especially, I should

190        On a New Method of Reducing Observations.
think, in the case of many unknown variables. At the same
time that labour is more “skilled.” There may be needed the
attention of a mathematician; and, in the case of many un
knowns, some power of hypergeometrical conception. Perhaps
the balance of advantage might be affected by an a priori
knowledge of an approximate solution. Which is, I think, a
greater convenience in the case of the new method than of
the received one, where the given equations are linear. Again,
in cases where Discordance or other irregularity may be sus
    cted, it will be useful to verify the result of the Method of
   east Squares by the simpler method. The consilience be
tween the two results which Mr. Turner's work exhibits is
 surely very satisfactory.
    Moreover, in cases where the observation-equations are of
 the second (or higher) degrees, it seems possible that the
 Median should have a decided advantage over the received
 method. According to the latter, we must start with an
 approximation sufficiently close to warrant the neglect of
 those terms of the equations which involve the variables in
 the second (or higher) degrees. Otherwise the principle of
 Least Squares would lead at best" to cumbrous simultaneous
 equations of the third (or higher) degrees. But, according to
 the principle herein set forth, a solution is obtained by taking
 a' and y such that R, the sum of the residuals of the type
 [aw”--2hry+by"+2fiv-E.2gy-r], each taken positively, should
 be the least possible. By considering the geometrical inter
 pretation of this condition, we may see that the required point
 is on an observation-curve. As in the simpler case, we may
 climb to the position of highest probability by noting the value
 of  :   at every turn. Thus, let us start from a point wo, yo
 on the curve aor"+2hory + boy” +2for +2goy=ro: and, as
 before, let the coefficients of the observation-lines below and
 left of the initial point be dotted; above and right, plain. Then

 where
             dr|[aov +hoy+fo]+ dy[boy +how +go]=0.
 From these equations     :    is to be found. If it is positive, we
 move backwards, and vice versá. At each intersection we
take the path for which     :    is least.

     Other uses and qualifications of the method would doubtless
come to light, if experts would turn their attention to the sub
ject. It may be hoped that Mr. Turner's example will be
followed by other practical astronomers. An unquestioning
acquiescence in the orthodox Method of Least Squares is the
less justifiable, in so far as the doctrine, in its form of rigid
exclusiveness, is not derivable from the fountain of authority,
 Laplace. Laplace by no means degrades the “Method of
 Situation ” £ the Method of Least Squares. He expressly
 prefers the former in certain cases”. Orthodoxy should not
 put tradition before inspiration.

  M         NY physicists have been at work upon the influence of
            magnetism on the electrical conductivity of metals.
  The metals which have already been studied are iron, nickel,
  cobalt, antimony, tellurium, and especially bismuth.
      The above investigations have been carried on principally
  with the view of discovering an explanation of                 I'       phe
  nonmenOn.
      The present memoir is intended to fix the date of pub
  lication. Our researches were commenced last May; since
  then many works have appeared on the question which we

 192        E. von Aubel on the Influence of Magnetism
were studying, notably the excellent memoirs of Messrs.
 Goldhammer", A. von Ettingshausent, and W. Nernstt.
    Quite recently we saw, in the Wiener Anzeiger, 1887,
p. 222, that Messrs. von Ettingshausen and Nernst had made
a communication to the         '          of Sciences at Vienna,
having the title “Ueber das thermische und galvanische
Verhalten einiger Wismuth-Zinn-Legirungen im magnet
ischen Felde.” This paper is not yet published, as far as we
know ; so that we cannot take account of it in what follows.
    Our researches are far from being finished. They will be
continued as soon as our other occupations will permit.
              I. The Preparation of Rods of Bismuth.
    We have studied bismuth under three molecular states :
          (1) Melted and cooled slowly,
        . (2) Melted and rapidly cooled or tempered,
          (3) Compressed.
    Let us examine the preparation of rods of bismuth in these
three cases.
    1. In order to prepare bismuth wires slowly cooled,
capillary glass tubes were procured, to which were joined
at both ends, at right angles to the capillary part, glass tubes
of fairly large diameter. These capillary tubes were heated
in a  £,          and some grains of bismuth were introduced
into one of the side branches. When the metal was melted,
it ran down by its own weight into the capillary tube. The
£           tubes were then left to cool very slowly; they were
taken from the sand-bath only when it was quite cold. It
often happens that, owing to the unequal expansions pro
duced during the cooling of the bismuth and the glass, the
tubes are broken ; for this reason we used capillary tubes
with very thin walls.
    Working in this way, any formation of oxide in the
capillary part is entirely avoided; and this part alone must
be used in the experiments.
    We think that this way of preparing bismuth wires is much
more convenient than the method by exhaustion employed by
others', and which cannot furnish results entirely comparable,

bismuth.

because there is no certainty that the melted metal is always
cooled under the same conditions. The bismuth rod being
thus prepared, the two side branches which are not wanted
are taken away.
   The electrodes to convey the electric current remain to be
fixed. For this purpose one end of the capillary rod of
bismuth is heated at the same time as a platinum wire in a
Bunsen burner up to the melting-point of bismuth ; then the
red-hot platinum wire is plunged into the capillary tube. It
is easy to see that a good contact is thus produced.
   2. In order to obtain bismuth rods very rapidly cooled or
tempered, the melted metal was poured rapidly into a kind of
iron trough, cold, and forming a £ acute dihedral
angle. If the pouring takes place rapidly, by inclining the
trough sufficiently to cause the melted bismuth to run down
'' quickly, rods of bismuth can be obtained sufficiently long
and not too thick. This last condition is indispensable, other
wise the bismuth rods will have too small a resistance.
   No adherence takes place during this tempering between
the iron and the bismuth. Moreover, by taking certain
precautions, the surface of the bismuth may also be filed, and
a fresh part of the metal be thus exposed.
    In this case the electrodes were made of copper wire,
soldered to the two ends of the rod of bismuth by means of a
fusible alloy.
   3. The compressed bismuth which we used in our experi
ments was   £        to us by Prof. Spring. Having been pre
pared in a drawplate", it was absolutely cylindrical.
    The electrodes were formed, as in the case of the tempered
bismuth, of copper wires soldered to the bismuth with a
fusible alloy.
   The molecular arrangement in this compressed bismuth is
very remarkable. A fracture normal to the axis of the
   linder presents a radial structure. We shall see later on
   e curious results that this sample has given us.
    The alloys have only been studied under two states:—
        (1) Melted and very slowly cooled,
        (2) Tempered.
   Rods of these alloys have been prepared in the same way
as those of bismuth.

                           II. Alloys.
   To obtain the alloys, two sandstone crucibles are used.
Bismuth is put into one, tin or lead into the other. These
metals have previously been weighed. When the bismuth is
melted it is kept liquid, being warmed gently to avoid too
much oxidation; it is then poured upon the other metal,
which is also liquid. The contents of the crucible are then
poured into the other, and this decanting is repeated several
times. We have worked in this way in order to obtain
alloys in which the proportion of tin or lead should be given
almost exactly by the weight, and to avoid having to make
analyses of the alloys in order to know their approximate
composition.
           III. Analyses of the different Specimens of
                        Bismuth studied.
   We have measured the resistance of several specimens of
bismuth.     They came from the manufactory of chemical
products of Messrs. Monheim at Aix-la-Chapelle, Trommsdorff
at Erfurt, and Schering at Berlin. . Mr. Monheim's bismuth
is commercially pure metal. We have three different spe
cimens from the firm of Trommsdorff, which we shall call, for
brevity, “Trommsdorff 1.,” “Trommsdorff II,” and “abso
lutely pure Trommsdorff.”
   The two first, as well as the bismuth from the Schering
factory, are products referred to as very pure in the catalogue
of manufacturers.
   The “absolutely pure Trommsdorff” bismuth, of which the
cost was far higher than that of the others, has been specially
prepared for us in the Erfurt manufactory.
   As to the compressed bismuth, it has been obtained by
means of the commercial metal. Prof. Spring dissolves this
metal in HNO3, precipitates it by pouring the solution into a
large quantity of water, filters, and washes it. He then
redissolves the basic nitrate, precipitates a second time,
calcines, and reduces in a current of pure hydrogen.
   We give all these directions, so that it may be possible for
£           to repeat our experiments, and in order to show how
 ittle confidence ought to be placed in certain determinations
which have been made on the physical constants of bismuth.
   M. A. Classen, Professor of Analytical Chemistry at the
Upper Technical School at Aix-la-Chapelle, was so kind as to

undertake to make qualitative analyses of various specimens
for us. We wish again to thank him here for the indispensable
assistance which he has given to our work.
   Results of the qualitative analyses:—
            Bismuth.                        Impurities.
      Monheim . . . Copper", lead, iron.

      Trommsdorff II. . Lead, copper, nickel.
      A'" }                    Lead, copper (traces), iron, carbon.
      Schering . . . Copper, lead?, nickel.
   It is very difficult to prepare pure bismuth. Even the
method indicated above for preparing the metal which has
been compressed, does not yield a pure product. A small
quantity of lead and copper is always precipitated with the
bismuth; and it is only by repeating this operation several
times that the metal can be obtained very pure.
   M. A. Classen is occupied at the present time in pre
paring for us pure bismuth, which is to be used in our later
researches.
   It results from all this that the various specimens of
so-called pure bismuth are very different from a chemical
point of view. Their points of fusion and their specific
weights have been likewise determined; they vary very
sensibly from one sample to another.
            IV. Measurement of Electrical Resistances.
   The threads of bismuth were placed in a water-bath, which
was heated all along its length by a linear gas-burner, forming
a series of small flames: a thermometer indicated the tem
perature.
   The whole was placed between the poles of a Ruhmkorff's
electromagnet of large size, worked by an Otto gas-engine
and a dynamo-electric machine of Siemens and Halsket.
    The intensity of the electric current in the spirals of the
electromagnet was sensibly 28 amperes during the whole
 course of the experiments.                           -
 - * The metals whose names are in italic are those which   were found in
 considerable quantities in the bismuth analysed.
   f The electromagnet was set in such a direction as to have no influence
 on the galvanometer.

196       E. von Aubel on the Influence of Magnetism
   The ordinary poles of the electromagnet were replaced by
large flat poles, made of thick iron circular plates, each one
having a thickness of 15 millimetres and a diameter of
150 millimetres. In this way the magnetic field was made
more uniform.
   In order to measure the resistances, Thomson's method
was employed, and a Siemens's dead-beat galvanometer, with
the magnet in the form of a bell, was used.
   In order to avoid heating the thread of bismuth by the
passage of the current, one Grove cell only was used, and, by
the aid of a see-saw commutator, the current was not allowed
to pass in the bismuth for a longer time than was necessary
for the observations.
   The deviations of the galvanometer-mirror were observed
in a telescope furnished with a graduated scale, the distance
between each division being two millimetres, and placed at a
distance of more than seven metres from the mirror.        One
can judge of the sensitiveness of the method. We have also
employed Kirchhoff’s method of measuring resistances, pre
serving all the other arrangements. A great number of rods
of bismuth and its alloys have been tried; in the following
tables we only give the values obtained for a sample of each
kind.
   In our experiments we did not obtain directly the re
sistance of the thread of bismuth, because in Thomson’s method
the wires for conveying the current were not fixed directly to
this metal, but to the copper or platinum conductors which
served as electrodes. It was necessary therefore to deduct the
resistances of these copper or platinum conductors, in order
to obtain values relating only to the bismuth. In the case of
the wires slowly cooled, we have subtracted the values obtained
directly, as the resistance of the platinum conductors exterior
to the wire of bismuth, because this latter metal adheres very
easily to platinum, and the section of the rod of bismuth
 is very great when compared with that of the thread of
platinum.

   The values of W are the electrical resistances in Siemens's
units; the values of Wm are the electrical resistances in the
same units under the action of a magnet.

        VI. Inferences drawn from the preceding Tables.
   1. The Influence of Temperature.—If the preceding results
be examined, it is easy to see at once that the different
samples of bismuth examined behave quite differently. Some
of them give an increased resistance, and others, which
is remarkable, a diminished resistance, when the temperature
rises. This last fact, noticed for the first time by '' Righi,
is not due, according to this physicist, to the presence of
arsenic as an impurity in the bismuth, but ought to be
attributed to the tin, which, even in very small quantities, is
able to produce this result.
    A number of experiments have been made by us to dis
cover the reason of this diminution of resistance.             We studied
first alloys of bismuth and tin, in which the latter metal was
  resent in comparatively large quantities. On examining
£ (c), it will be seen that these alloys always give an
increase of resistance with the temperature, while the bismuth
which enters into their composition produces a diminution of
resistance for a rise of temperature. Besides, the chemical
analysis has shown us that not one of our samples of bismuth
contains any tin as an impurity. It is then sufficiently
demonstrated that it is not the metal that is the cause of the
observed anomaly". A glance at the results of the chemical
analyses and at the electrical measurements will equally prove
that the reason for the fact ought not to be looked for in the
presence, as impurities, either of arsenic or of iron.

200         E. von Aubel on the Influence of Magnetism
cation has not taken place when bismuth is combined with
10 per cent. of lead.
    For this reason we have examined also the alloys of
bismuth and lead, which have furnished us with very inte
resting results", recorded in Table (d), but which do not in
any way explain the diminution of resistance when the tem
perature rises.
    Some influence might still be attributed to the capillary
glass tube in which the wire of bismuth is placed. On
heating, the glass and bismuth expand differently, and
mutually impede each other in their movements. We have
therefore successively studied a rod of bismuth cast in a
capillary tube, and the same rod after having broken the
glass (with precautions) in such a way as not to alter the
metallic wire; no change was observed in the direction of
these phenomena. Besides, the rods of tempered bismuth
were not prepared in glass tubes, and yet some of these
present the same peculiarity.
    We likewise assured ourselves that there was no relation
between the abnormal electrical phenomenon and the points
of fusion or specific gravities of the different kinds of
bismuthf.                                                        -
    2. Influence of Magnetism.—On the whole the influence of
magnetism on the resistance of bismuth has been more feeble
 than that which has been announced by M. Righit. Mag
netism always produces an increase of resistance; its influence
diminishes when the temperature rises, and is more feeble in
the alloys than in the bismuth itself.
    3. Study of Compressed Bismuth.—The resistance of com
  ressed bismuth hardly varies with the temperature; from
 16°-8 to 42°4 there was a slight diminution; then an increase
 up to 76°, also very small.
    After these first experiments, we took away the two ends of
 the threads of compressed bismuth, on which was the fusible
 alloy. With the rest we prepared a rod of bismuth slowly
 cooled by the method indicated above.
    Measurements of the electrical resistances of this bismuth,
 in this state, gave a fairly large increase of resistance when
the temperature rose.

 '" (Journal de Physique
of Vlew.
                                     [2], v. p. 116), but from another point
    + Mr. C. L. Weber has made known, in 1886 (Annalen der Physik
 xxvii. p. 145), some very curious results on the influence of temperature
 on the electrical conductility of the alloys of Rose, Wood, and Lipowitz;
but this work has no immediate connexion with our study.
    1 Mr. Goldhammer (l.c.) has also found the influence of magnetism
 more feeble than that indicated by M. Righi.

             on the Electrical Resistance of Bismuth.                 201
   There is, then, a notable difference, with regard to the
molecular structure, between bismuth prepared in a draw
plate and that which, having been melted, has been allowed
to cool slowly. One may conceive in this latter case that the
crystals take up their own positions during the cooling, whilst
the metal prepared in a drawplate is formed of parallel fibres
of bismuth.
   More complete electrical researches might make clear this
important question of molecular physics. £ might especiall
compare bismuth, compressed in an ordinary compressor, wit
that prepared in a drawplate.
                          WII. Conclusions.
   To sum up, the diminution of electrical resistance observed
in certain kinds of bismuth and in some alloys with lead
cannot as yet be explained. The molecular structure, which
we have modified by tempering and compression, has a great
influence on the action of the temperature.
   We hope that our further researches will lead us to an
explanation of the anomalies which we have pointed out.
   In the course of this paper we have never mentioned the
name of Prof. Ad. Wüllner, our learned and venerated
master; we might well have done so at each step. We are
glad to be able here to express our thanks to him for the
facilities which he has procured for us for undertaking our
researches.

by e the thermoelectric electromotive force of the bismuth-copper
couple, when it is out of the magnetic field; by e the electromotive
force of the same couple in the magnetic field; and           takes for a
measure of the phenomenon the quantity 3+.
   This physicist finds that 6 is positive for commercial bismuth and
negative for pure bismuth.
   One ought, perhaps, to compare this result with those we have
obtained relative to the influence of temperature on the electrical
resistance of different kinds of bismuth.—EDM. voN AUBEL.

       XXIV. Note on a Paper on Electromagnetic Waves.
                      By OLIVER HEAVISIDE".
       N editorial query, the purport of which I did not at first
         understand, has directed my attention to Prof. J. J.
  Thomson's paper “On Electrical Oscillations in Cylindrical
  Conductors”   £       Math. Soc. vol. xvii. Nos. 272,273), a copy
  of which the author has been so good as to send me. His results,
  for example, that an iron wire of centim. radius, of inductivity
  500, carries a wave of frequency 100 per second about 100,000
 miles before attenuating it from 1 to e-', and similar results,
 summed up in his conclusion that the carrying-power of an
 iron wire cable is very much greater than that of a copper
 one of similar dimensions, are so surprisingly different from
 my own, deduced from my developed sinusoidal solutions, in
 the accuracy of which I have perfect confidence (having had
 occasion last winter to make numerous practical applications
 of them in connexion with a paper which was to have been
 read at the S. T. E. and E.), ' I felt sure there must be
 some serious error of a fundamental nature running through
 his investigations. On examination I find this is the case,
being the use of an erroneous boundary condition in the
beginning, which wholly vitiates the subsequent results. It
is equivalent to assuming that the tangential component of
the flux magnetic induction is continuous at the surface of
separation of the wire and dielectric, where the inductivity
changes value, from a large value to unity, when the wire is
of iron. The true conditions are continuity of tangential
force and of normal fluv.
    As regards my own results, and how increasing the induc
tance is favourable, the matter really lies almost in a nutshell;
thus. In order to reduce the full expression of Maxwell's
connexions to a practical working form I make two assump
tions. First, that the      i.'             component of current
(parallel to the wires) in the dielectric is negligible, in com
£         with the total current in the conductors, which makes
    one of the variables, C being the current in either conductor;
and next, what is equivalent to supposing that the wave-length
of disturbances transmitted along the wires is a large multiple
of their distance apart. The result is that the equations
connecting V and C become

where R and L are the effective resistance and inductance
of the circuit respectively, per unit length, to be calculated
entirely upon electromagnetic principles. It follows that the
fully developed sinusoidal solution is of precisely the same form
as if the resistance and inductance were constants.        Disre
garding the effect of reflexions, we have
                    W=Voe-” sin (nt-Q2),
due to Wo sin nt impressed at z=0; where P and Q are
functions of R', L', S, K, and n.           -       - -
   Now if R/L'n is large, and leakage is negligible (a well
insulated slowly worked submarine cable, and other cases), we
have                    P=Q=(#RSn)',
as in the electrostatic theory of Sir W. Thomson. There is
at once great attenuation in transit, and also great distortion
of arbitrary waves, owing to P and Q varying with n. .
    But in telephony, n being large, P and Q may have widely
 different values, because R/L'n may be quite small, even a
 fraction.   In such case we have no resemblance to the former
 results. If R'/L'n is small, P and Q approximate to

 where v=(L'S)-3.        This also requires K/Sn to be smail.
 But it is always very small in telephony.          -           -
    Now take the case of copper wires of low resistance, L' is
 practically Lo, the inductance of the dielectric, and v' is prac
 tically v, the speed of undissipated waves, or of all elementary
 disturbances, through the dielectric, whilst R may be taken
 to be R, the steady resistance, except in extreme cases. Hence,
 with perfect insulation,

 204    Mr. O. Heaviside on Electromagnetic Waves, and the
or the speed of the waves is v, and the attenuating coefficient
 P is practically independent of the frequency, and is made
smaller by reducing the resistance and increasing the induc
tance, of the dielectric.
    The corresponding current is
                            C=W/Lov
very nearly, or V and C are nearly in the same phase, like
undissipated plane waves. There is very little distortion in
transit.
    How to increase Lo is to separate the conductors, if twin
 wires, or raise the wire higher from the ground, if a single
wire with earth-return. It is not, however, to be concluded
 that Lo could be increased indefinitely with advantage. If l
 is the length of the circuit,
                            Rl=2|Lov
 shows the value of Lo which makes the received current
 greatest. It is then far greater than is practically wanted, so
 that the difficulty of increasing Lo sufficiently is counter
balanced by the non-necessity. The best value of Lois, in the
case of a long line, out of reach; so that we may say, gene
rally, that increasing the inductance is always of advantage to
reduce the attenuation and the distortion.
    Now if we introduce leakage, such that R/Lo= K/S, we
entirely remove the distortion, not merely when R/Lon is small
but of any sort of waves. It is, however, at the expense of
increased attenuation. The condition of greatest received
current, Lo being variable, is now
                            Rl=Low.
We have thus two ways of securing good transmission of
electromagnetic waves: one very perfect, for any kind of
signals; the other less perfect, and limited to the case of
R/Lon small, but quite practical. The next step is to secure
that the receiving-instrument shall not introduce further dis
tortion by the quasi-resonance that occurs. In the truly
non-distortional circuit this can be done by making the resist
ance of the receiver to be Low (whatever the length of the
line); this causes complete absorption of the arriving waves.
In the other case, of R/Ln small, with good insulation, we
require the resistance of the receiver to be Lov to secure this
result approximately. I have also found that this value of the
receiver's resistance is exactly the one that (when size of wire
in receiver is variable) makes the magnetic force, and therefore
the strength of signal, a maximum. Some correction is
required on account of the self-induction of the receiver;

         Forced Vibrations of Electromagnetic Systems.       205
but in really good telephones of the best kind, with very small
time-constants, it is not great. We see therefore that tele
phony, so far as the electrical part of the matter is concerned,
can be made as nearly perfect as possible on lines of thousands
of miles in length. But the distortion that is left, due to
imperfect translation of sound-waves into electromagnetic
waves at the sending-end, and the reproduction of sound
waves at the receiving-end, is still very great; though, prac
tically, any fairly good telephonic speech is a sufficiently
good imitation of the human voice.
   There is one other way of increasing the inductance which
I have described, viz. in the case of covered wires to use a
dielectric impregnated with iron dust. I have proved expe
rimentally that Lo can be multiplied several times in this way
without any increase of resistance; and the figures I have
given above (in Note B) prove what a wonderful difference
the self-induction makes, even in a cable, if the frequency is
great. Hence, if this method could be made practical, it
would greatly increase the distance of telephony through
cables.
   Now, passing to iron wires, the case is entirely different,
on account of the great increase in resistance that the sub
stitution of iron for copper of the same size causes, which
increases P and the attenuation. Taking for simplicity the
very extreme case of such an excessive frequency as to make
the formula
                         R’=(#Run)"
nearly true, R being the steady and R the actual resistance,
we see that increasing either R or u increases R and there
fore P, because L'v' tends to the value Lov. Thus the carrying
power of iron is not greatly above, but greatly below that of
copper of the same size.
     have, however, pointed out a possible way of utilizing
iron (other than that above mentioned), viz. to cover a bundle
of fine iron wires with a copper sheath. The sheath is to
secure plenty of conductance; the division of the iron to faci
litate the penetration of current, and so lower the resistance
still more, to the greatest extent, whilst at the same time
increasing the inductance. But the theory is difficult, and it
is doubtful whether this method is even theoretically legiti
mate. First class results were obtained by Van Rysselberghe
on a 1000-mile circuit in America (2000 miles of wire), using
copper-covered steel wire. Here the resistance was very low,
on account of the copper, and the inductance considerable, on
account of the dielectric alone; so that there is no certain

 206     Mr. O. Heaviside on Electromagnetic Waves, and the
 evidence that the iron did any good except by lowering the
 resistance. But about the advantage of increasing the in
 ductance of the dielectric there       :      think, be no question.
 It imparts momentum to the waves and carries them on.
    In Note B to the first portion of my paper “On Electro
 magnetic Waves” (Phil. Mag. Feb. 1888), I gave four sets
 of numerical results showing the influence of increasing the
 inductance, selecting a cable of large permittance (constant)
 in order to render the illustrations more forcible.         I take this
 opportunity of stating that the second set of figures relates to
 the value L=2}, not 2, of the inductance per centim. The
 formula used was equation (82), Part II. of my paper “On
 the Self-Induction of Wires” (Phil. Mag. Sept. 1886, p. 284),

          Forced Vibrations of Electromagnetic Systems.     207
   It will be seen that when the resistance of the circuit is
'. a small multiple of, or is      of about the same magnitude
as Lv (which may be from 300 to 600 ohms in the case of a
suspended copper wire), the variation in the value of p as
 the frequency changes through a sufficiently wide range, is
 great, merely by reason of the reflexions causing reinforce
 ment or reduction of the strength of the received current.
 The theoretical least value of p is #, when R/Ln is vanishingly
 small, indicating a doubling of the amplitude of current.
 But as y increases the range of p gets smaller and smaller.
 After y=5 it is negligible.
    It is, however, the mean p that is of most importance,
 because the influence of terminal resistances is to lower the
 range in p, and to a variable extent. The value y = 2.065, or,
 practically, Rl=2Lv, makes the mean p a minimum. As I
 pointed out in the paper before referred to, these fluctuations
 can only be prejudicial to telephony. In the present Note I
 have described how to almost entirely destroy them. The prin
 ciple may be understood thus. Let the circuit be infinitely
 long first. Then its impedance to an intermediate impressed
 force alternating with sufficient frequency to make R/Ln small
 will be 2Lv, viz. Lv each way. ' current and potential
 difference produced will be in the same phase, and in moving
 away from the source of energy they will be similarly at
 tenuated according to the time-factor e-*. In order that
the circuit, when of finite length, shall still behave as if of
infinite length, the constancy of the impedance suggests to
us that we should make the terminal apparatus a mere re
 sistance, of amount Lv, by which the waves will be absorbed
without reflexion.
    That this is correct we may prove by my formula for the
amplitude of received current when there is terminal appa
ratus, equation (19b), Part W. “On the Self-Induction of
Wires” (Phil. Mag. Jan. 1887). It is

              –2(G,G,HoH1); cos 2(Ql +6)]-}.
Here Co is the amplitude of received current at z=l due to
Vo sin nt impressed force at z=0; R and L' the effective re
sistance and inductance per unit length of circuit; K and S
the leakage-conductance and permittance per unit-length,

Go, Ho, are terminal functions depending upon the apparatus

208     Mr. O. Heaviside on Electromagnetic Waves, and the
at z=0; G1, HI, upon that at z=l; the apparatus being of
any kind, specified by resistance-operators, making Ro', L'
the effective resistance and inductance of apparatus at z=0,
and R1, Li', at z=l. Go is given by
         G =1+(R”+L"n")="[(P +Q')(R,” +L("n")
           +2P(R/Ro' + L'L/n”)+2(Qn(Ro'L'-R/Lo'),
from which Ho is derived by changing the signs of P and Q;
whilst G1 and H1 are the same functions of R1', Li' as Go and
 Ho are of Ro, Lo'.
   Now drop the accents, since we have only copper wires of
low resistance (but not very thick) in question, and the ter
minal apparatus are to be of the simplest character. K/Sn
will be vanishingly small practically, so take K=0. Next let
R/Ln be small, and let the apparatus at z=l be a mere coil,
Ri, of negligible inductance first. We shall now have
                 P=R/2L",                Q= n v,
and these make          R                       R

                                      H=(1-#).
   Thus R1 = Lv makes H. vanish, whatever the length of
line, and the terms due to reflexions disappear.
   We now have
                          W

where Go- expresses the effect of the apparatus at z=0 in
reducing the potential-difference there,     '   being the im
pressed force, and the value of Go being unity where there is
a short-circuit.
   Now to show that R = Lv makes the magnetic force of the
receiver the greatest, go back to the general formula, let
e" be small, and let the size of wire vary, whilst the size of
the receiving-coil is fixed. It will be easily found, from the
expression for G1, that the magnetic force of the coil is a
maximum when                       2
                                  R” + L2n”\!
where we keep in Li the inductance of the receiver. Or,
when R/Ln and K/Sn are both small,
                       (R, +L'n')"=Le,
or, as described, R1=Lv when the receiver has a sufficiently
small time-constant. The rule is, equality of impedances.
   We may operate in a similar manner upon the terminal

representable as a resistance containing an electromotive
force, and that by varying the resistance we cause the electro
motive force to vary as its square root. Then, according to
a well-known law, the arrangement producing the maximum
external current is given by Ro-Lv, equality of impedances
again. This brings us to

as if the circuit were infinitely long both ways, with maximum
efficiency secured at both ends.
    Lastly, the choice of L such that Rl=2Lv makes the circuit,
of given resistance, most efficient.
    £ long-distance telephony using wires of low resistance,
the waves are sent along the circuit in a manner closely re
sembling the transmission of waves along a stretched elastic
cord, subject to a small amount of friction. In order to
similarly imitate the electrostatic theory, we must so reduce
the mass of the cord, or else so exaggerate the friction, that
there cannot be free vibrations. We may suppose that the
displacement of the cord represents the potential-difference in
 both cases. But the current will be in the same phase as the
 potential-difference in one case, and proportional to its variation
 along the circuit in the other.
       e may conveniently divide circuits, so far as their signal
 ling peculiarities are concerned, into five classes. (1) Cir
 cuits of so short length, or so operated upon, that any effects
 due to electric displacement are insensible. The theory is
 then entirely electromagnetic, at least so far as numerical re
 sults are concerned. (2) Circuits of such great length that
 they can only be worked so slowly as to render electro
 magnetic inertia numerically insignificant in its effects.
 Also some telephonic circuits in which R/Ln is large. Then,
 at least so far as the reception of signals is concerned, we
 may apply the electrostatic theory. (3) The exceedingly
 large intermediate class in which both the electrostatic and
 electromagnetic sides have to be considered, not separately,
 but conjointly. (4) The simplified form of the last to which
 we are led when the signals are very rapid and the wires of
 low resistance. (5) The non-distortional circuit, in which,
 by a proper amount of uniform leakage, distortion of signals
 is abolished, whether fast or slow. Regarded from the point
  of view of practical application, this class lies on one side.
  But from the theoretical point of view, the non-distortional
 circuit lies in the very focus of the general theory, reducing

is reflected positively, the charge negatively, at a bridge.
This is the opposite of what occurs when a resistance is put
in the main circuit, which causes positive reflexion of the
charge, and negative of the current. Unite the two effects
and the reflexion of the wave is destroyed, approximately
when the resistance in the main circuit and the bridge re
sistance are finite, perfectly when they are infinitely small, as
in a uniform non-distortional circuit.
XXV. The Geological Consequences of the Discovery of a
   Level-of-no-Strain in a Cooling Globe. By T. MELLARD
   READE, C.E., F.G.S., F.R.I.B.A."
WH' working out my theory of the Origin of Moun
          tain-Ranges I became clearly convinced that there
was a fallacy underlying the popular conception of the effect
of secular cooling upon the crust of the earth. It is very ex
traordinary that the physicists who supported the hypothesis
that mountain-chains had been ridged up through the outer
uncontracting crust following by gravitation the shrinking
nucleus, were content to leave the idea in this very vague
form.
   It is obvious, when once pointed out, that on this hypo
thesis it is only the actual surface of the earth that does not
contract. As the isogeothermal lines sink deeper in the pro
   ess of secular refrigeration, each zone below the surface in
the solid crust must contract horizontally proportionately to
the lowering of the temperature. At a certain depth the rate
of this horizontal, or in other words circumferential, contrac
tion must equal the mean rate of the radial contraction of
the sphere. At this particular zone—which varies in depth
as the time—I showed f that there is no strain; while all
of the crust above it is in compression, and below it all the
cooling matter is contracting. After fully realizing this con
ception, a few calculations convinced me that on the hypo
thesis that our globe has cooled in this way during all geolo
gical time, the £ as Mr. Fisher aptly names
it, could not at the present time be many miles deep below
the surface. All this seemed so very clear to me that I

confess I was surprised at this particular chapter escaping
the notice of my reviewers, who, as a rule, dealt very fairly
and openly with the ideas put forth, so that I was fully pre
pared for a long continuance of indifference towards this
interesting problem.
    The able papers of Mr. Davison and Prof. Darwin, and the
exhaustive mathematical investigation of Mr. Osmond Fisher"
have agreeably dispelled this fear.
    It is very satisfactory that each of these mathematicians,
though working on an independent basis, and all holding
different views as to the geological consequences of the dis
covery, are in singularly £ agreement in numerical results.
Mr. Davison puts the level-of-no-strain after the lapse of
 174 million years since consolidation at 5 miles; Prof. Darwin
at 2 miles in 100 million years; and Mr. Fisher, taking the
present temperature gradient as 1°F. in 51 feet, arrives at
the conclusion that the level-of-no-strain is now at a depth of
 2.1361 miles. I may add that my own numerical results,
 computed in an     £,        different manner, approximate closely
 to those of Mr. Fisher and Prof. Darwin.
    My present intention is not, however, to dwell upon the
 interesting nature of these mathematical investigations of the
 properties of a cooling globe, but from a geological stand
 point to speculate upon the results that flow from the dis
 covery of the existence of a level-of-no-strain situated not
 ": miles beneath our feet.
       olcanic Energy.—Mr. Mallet has based a complete theory
 of the origin of volcanic energy upon the heat developed by
 the crushing and compression of the rocks of the outer crust
 of the earth while following the contracting nucleus. Many
 objections to this theory have been pointed out from time to
 time by practical geologists, and I have dealt with the ques
 tion elsewheref. The existence of a level-of-no-strain within
 a few miles of the surface, if admitted, is absolutely fatal to
 Mallet's hypothesis. Not only is the number of cubic miles of
 rock; crushed quite insufficient to account for the necessary
 heat, but the limitation of the crushing to what I have called

    i  # Fisher estimates the amount of rock displaced by compression

 Earth and 19 feet thick.

212 Mr. T. M. Reade on the Geological Consequences of a
 the “shell-of-compression ” entirely forbids the acceptance
of this secondary theory of volcanic energy.
     Taking the greatest estimate of the present depth of the
 level-of-no-strain, the seat of volcanic energy on Mallet's
hypothesis would be limited to a depth of less than 5 miles.
W£ we point out that lava rises up to and flows from
orifices of volcanoes at a level in some cases of 24 miles above
the sea, it is obvious to anyone who has the slightest know
ledge of mechanics that the locus of its origin in the earth's
crust must be greatly below the highest estimate of the thick
ness of the shell-of-compression.
     Cores of Mountain-Ranges.—The distinguishing charac
teristics of great mountain-chains is, as I have fully pointed
out elsewhere, the presence of a central core of gneissic or
granitic rock, frequently, as in the case of the Alps, taking
the form of a series of ellipsoidal bodies throwing off on the
flanks—not seldom with reversed dips—the sedimentary rocks
through which they have been protruded. . . .
    This is also true of the great ranges of the Caucasus, the
Pyrenees, the Rocky Mountains, the Himalayas, the Andes;
and I believe such gneissic cores will be found to distinguish
every great range when sufficient observations have been
made. The apparent exception of the Appalachian chain is,
in my view, no exception at all; and I have already brought
forward a considerable body of evidence to prove that the
   neissic masses lying to the eastward of the great sedimenta
  olds is the original core of the range much denuded and
deprived of the flanking sedimentary masses formerly existing
to the eastward *.                  -
    Whether this explanation be accepted or not, the gneissic
and granitic rocks protruded through and often entangling
in their folds the great sedimentary deposits which together
admittedly constitute most mountain-chains, are a standing
monument of the untruth (said in no offensive sense) of the
contractional hypotheses of the origin of mountain-ranges.
    These central cores could not have been forced up except
accompanied by great lateral pressure, yet now we find, on
accurately working out the contractional hypothesis, that the
lateral pressure is, taking the highest estimate, zero at a depth
of 5 miles, whereas, according to the estimates of accomplished
geologists, the sedimentary strata through which the cores
were protruded ranged from 5 to 10 miles thick. It is
plain to demonstration that the lateral pressure that forced
up the mountains could not reside in a shell-of-compression
only 5 miles thick having a zero strain on the underside.

               Level-of-no-Strain in a Cooling Globe.         213
   Colorado Plateaus.—The contractional hypothesis is equally
incapable of accounting for the elevation of the great mono
clinal plateaus lying to the west of the Rockies. Indeed this
has been insisted upon by American geologists,          '      by
Dutton and Gilbert, before the discovery of the level-of-no
strain. It is, therefore, unnecessary for me to dwell upon
these arguments here, except to say that by this discovery
the difficulties are increased beyond all possibility of ex
planation.
   Effects of Contraction on the Shell underlying the Shell-of
Compression.—The bulk of the contracting portion of the
earth's crust, even if the whole crust be estimated at not
more than 30 miles thick, is so much in excess of the shell-of
compression, in addition to the much larger underlying con
tracting envelope, that I fully expect some reverse theory of
mountain-building may be based upon it. Mr. Davison has
already suggested that the ocean-basins are due to the locali
zation of this contraction. Let me examine the problem in a
 fair spirit, and as fully as the limits of this paper will allow.
 In discussing the effects of contraction on the rocks of the
crust underlying the shell-of-compression, I have said, “Prac
tically tension could not take place, as the superincumbent
 strata would by vertical compression elongate the rocks at
the zone of greatest contraction to fill the vacuities that
otherwise would be created.”"
    The depth of the zone at which compressive-extension com
mences will differ according to the nature and crushin
strength of the rocks: but we may safely assume that al
known rocks will be plastic under the superincumbent pressure
at a depth of 10 miles f. It is, therefore, possible that some
where in the solid crust between that depth and the surface,
cavities might be formed by secular contraction, and shearing
and faulting take place by the subsidence of overlying masses
of crust into the plastic medium below. Irregularities of the
 surface of the sphere might arise in this way, as well as by
 inequalities in the amount and mode of shrinkage of the whole
 of the underlying contracting body or shell. It needs, how
 ever, but little consideration to see that such orographic
 changes of the surface would tend generally in the same
 direction; depressions once commenced would increase in
 depth by a continuation of the contraction which initiated
them; while such elevations as might originate in the much
smaller shell-of-compression would tend to increase in height
 and in number also.        But while the agencies invoked in our
                    I'"'.

214 Mr. T. M. Reade on the Geological Consequences of a
hypothesis are tending to corrugate the surface of the globe,
subaerial denudation is, pari passu, levelling all the irregu
larities that appear above the waters of the ocean, and sedi
mentation in varying degrees at different localities is more
or less effacing the irregularities below the waters.
    It would be an interesting calculation to approximately
work out the relative magnitudes of these opposite actions,
but such is not my present intention. It will be more to the
purpose to enquire whether such a process—deductively ar
rived at—is in correspondence with what takes place in nature.
The geological standpoint is an entirely different one to that
of the deductive reasoner.        The geologist is prepared to
 question any physical dogma otherwise called a “law,” no
 matter how high the authority on which it may stand, if obser
 vation leads him in an opposite direction.    It is, however, in
 this branch of enquiry by the application of the two methods,
 the inductive and the deductive and their correspondence,
that the most important and far-reaching truths are eventually
discovered.
    I can quite understand a contractionist, in view of the dis
 covery of the level-of-no-strain, giving up the position that
 mountain-ranges have originated in the shell-of-compression,
 yet contending that the other irregularities of the earth's
 surface have originated in the differential movements of the
 underlying contracting shell. He would probably point to
 such a persistence of movement of subsidence, though only
 deductively arrived at, as another proof of the permanence of
 Oceans  £ continents.
     When, however, as geologists we go to Mother Earth and
 ask her to yield up her secrets, what does she answer?
     It seems pretty safe to assert anything of the abysmal
  depths of the ocean, for we know little of the ocean-bottom
  excepting what is yielded by a few scrapings of the dredge
  and the number d fathoms read off on the sounding-line.
  When, however, we investigate that which is more within
  our reach, we find that everywhere on the globe there has
  been in progress a constant flux and reflux of elevation and
  subsidence, and it would be difficult to say which has been,
  on the whole, of the greater magnitude. It is but lately that
  Dr. Guppy has shown us that there are on the Solomon
  Islands soft foraminiferous rocks which, according to Murray
  and Brady, represent deep-sea deposits laid down in water
  from 1800 to 2000 fathoms deep. These deposits in many
  cases lie upon old denuded volcanic rocks, and are overlain
  with a capping of hard coral rock.
     These deep-sea rocks are, in the case of Ugi and Treasury

             Level-of-no-Strain in a Cooling Globe.               215
Islands, themselves folded; a most remarkable fact, for which
we are indebted to Dr. Guppy’s intrepidity and love of
science. Assuming the correctness of all the facts made
known by Dr. Guppy, they appear to me inconsistent with
the assumption that the deposits took place on submerged
volcanic peaks, for it is difficult to see how folding could
originate in such a position by any cause now known. But
in ' case it points to an elevation of the sea-bottom, esti
mated by Dr. Guppy at 12,000 feet".
   In reading the accounts of various observers scattered over
the face of the globe, nothing has struck me more than the
universality of the evidences—side by side—of recent depres
sion and recent elevation in each and every country. It
would be wearisome to recount them here.            w.   know that
the great continental masses are built up of sedimentary rock
systems, some of them reaching, in the locus of mountain
ranges, an estimated thickness of ten miles. Now let us see
what this means.     It indicates that the crust of the earth on
these areas has been bent to a depth double that of the deepest
of the deep-sea soundings.                -
    Yet these very deposits now constitute the highest moun
tain-ranges!       ith these evidences of flux and reflux before
our eyes, it seems really useless to invoke as an explanation
the aid of a secular change tending to act more or ' COn
stantly in one direction. The investigation of the properties
of a cooling globe and the discovery of the existence of a level
of-no-strain only a few miles beneath our feet, have greatly
helped to clear the ground for the reception of a theory of
mountain-formation which takes more fully into account the
actualities of nature.
    It may, however, be desirable, in the light of these recent
discoveries, to try and trace by geological or other observations
whether any features of the earth are directly attributable to
secular cooling. Such would be a difficult inquiry, superim
posed as I believe the effects will be found to be (if found at
all), upon much more pronounced features due to other
agencies.                                                       -
    Here for the present I must leave the subject, perhaps to
return to it at a future time.

 purpose of it is not optical. I have found that its optical
 results can be obtained by a much simpler method, as set
 forth in the present paper. The results themselves are pro
 bably familiar to leading physicists, but they certainly are
 not so well known as they deserve to be.
    The particular case in which all the refractions and reflex
ions take place at coaxal spherical surfaces with nearly normal
incidence is treated in my edition of ‘Deschanel” (see espe
 cially footnote to § 768 of the earlier, or § 1037 of the later,
 editions), and had been previously treated by a different
 method in Helmholtz’s “Physiological Optics’ (pp. 171-175).
    The mode of investigation here adopted has been suggested
 partly by Clausius's discussion above referred to, partly by an
investigation of Kirchhoff's in Poggendorff's Annalen, vol. cix.
pp. 284-287, to which Clausius refers, and partly by § 334
 (2nd edition) of Thomson and Tait's ‘Natural Philosophy.’
    We shall begin by establishing the following
                    Theorem on Apparent Size.
   If two small equal plane areas A1, A2 are so placed that a
ray from the centre of one to the centre of the other is perpen
dicular to them both, the two solid angles formed by rays at the
Centre  %  each which come from the circumference of the other are
inversely as the squares of the absolute indices of refraction at
the centres at which they are formed. That is, if u1 u, be the
indices at the centres of A1A2, on the angle formed at the
centre of A1 by rays from the circumference of A2, and o,
the solid angle formed at the centre of As by rays from the
circumference of A1, then will
                      A1*A161 = us'Agos. . . . . . . (1)
As a particular case, if the two indices of refraction are equal,
as well as the two areas, the two solid angles will be equal ;
in other words, the apparent size of the first area as seen from

                               Proof.
    Let T denote the time of propagation of light from a point
 a y : to a point # m £, or from the latter point to the former.
 If 8s be an indefinitely short line drawn from the point w y :
 at an inclination 6 to the forward direction of a ray from 3 m £,
 the increase in T will obviously be the same as for a line
 8s cos 6 drawn along the ray. Hence, if v denote the velocity
 of light at w y z, and p, the absolute index of refraction at the
 same point, we have     dT=: 8s cos 6, or
                      dT     cos 6     cos 6

 where V denotes the velocity in vacuo.
    Take the centre of the small area A1 as origin of the rectan
     ar coordinates w y z, and the centre of A2 as origin of # m #.
   et the axes of 2 and # be tangential to the ray, and reckoned
 positive in the outward directions. The axes of w y and of #m
 will therefore be in the planes of A1 and A2 respectively, and
 we shall choose them so as to satisfy the two conditions

 the brackets signifying that the six variables w, y, z, #, m, & are
 to be put equal to zero after the performance of the differ
 entiations.
    To express the solid angle formed at the centre of A1 by
 rays from the circumference of A2, suppose tangents of unit
 length, forming prolongations of the rays, to be drawn from
 the centre of A1. The solid angle (being small) will be
 numerically equal to the base of the cone or    ''        enclosed
 by the tangents, or to the projection of this base on the plane
 of cy. Let w/ and y be the coordinates of the projection of
 the extremity of one of these unit-tangents, then the solid
 angle will be equal to the area traced by the point wy' in the
 plane of A1, while the point # m, from which the ray proceeds,
 moves round the circumference of As. The ...' a'
 and y are obviously equal to the cosines of the angles which
 the ray makes with the axes of w and y.
    Hence, putting cos 6 in (2) successively equal to w and y,
 we have
                     =Y',

 Hence a' has a constant ratio to #, and y a constant ratio to m.
 The product of these two ratios will be the ratio of the area
 traced by the point a'y to the area traced by $n, that is, it
 will be the ratio of the solid angle on to the area A2. We

 The rays considered in the foregoing proof may undergo any
 amount of either gradual or # bending by refraction,
 and may be reflected any number of times; but there must
 be no abrupt difference between the histories of rays which
 come from consecutive points.
    We now proceed to apply this theorem to the investigation
 of brightness.
    The brightness of an object as seen from any point is
 measured by                     -
                               X: . . . . . . . . (11)
  A denoting a small area at the point, sensibly perpendicular
 to the rays which reach it from the object, o a small solid
 angle of arbitrary magnitude, and q the quantity of light
 from the object which converges to A (and also diverges

                       of Brightness of Images.                 219
from A if not stopped) in pencils of magnitude o. The
justness of this measure is obvious from the fact that if we
halve either A or a we shall halve the quantity of light that
 will come into consideration.
     When the small area A is taken on the surface of the object
 itself, the value of the expression (11) is called the intrinsic
 brightness of the object.
      n the case of the two small areas which we have been dis
 cussing, let q denote the quantity of light sent by A2 on the
 road to A1. If none of it is lost on the road, it all reaches A1;
 thus the same quantity of light which leaves A2 in pencils of
  angle og reaches A1 in pencils of angle ol. Let I, denote the
 intrinsic brightness of A2, and I its apparent brightness as seen
  from A1; then
           I=~! - A*2          Q   =(#)      Q

              A101      A101 Agos     A3/A2002
      By supposing us equal to u1 we obtain the following
  theorem. If the eye and the object are in media of the same
  index, and no light is stopped on its way from the object to the
   eye, the apparent brightness is equal to the intrinsic brightness,
  notwithstanding any refractions or total reflexions that the rays
   may have undergone between the object and the eye.
       flight is lost on the way, the above expression for the
   apparent brightness must be multiplied by a coefficient k less
   than unity, which, by well-established laws of Optics, is the
   same for rays going from A3 to A1 as for those going from
   A1 to A2 (for the same kind of light). If I, and II are the
   intrinsic brightnesses of the two areas, their apparent bright
   nesses when each is seen from the other will be
                     *(£) I2,     and  A(#).       .   .   .  .  (13)
       When an observer sees the area A2, the pupil of his eye may
    be taken as the area A1; the foregoing computations of appa
    rent brightness accordingly assume that all parts of the pupil
    receive rays from every part of A2. If part of the pupil be
    covered, the apparent brightness of the object will be dimi
    nished; and a similar diminution will occur when the rays
    from the object are collected into a beam of such small section
    as not to fill the pupil. This is the cause of the falling off of
    light which is observed in the use of high magnifying-powers
    with optical instruments.
       In  #.  case of light sent  out obliquely from the surface of
     an object, the above investigations will remain applicable if

we understand by A, the projection of this surface on a
normal section of the beam.
   When A1 is the image of As the “theorem on apparent
size” requires modification, for the centre of Al will no longer
receive one ray from each point of A2, but will receive all its
rays from one point only, which we shall regard as the centre
of As. Let a section orthogonal to all the rays which go from
the centre of As to the centre of Al be taken anywhere in the
intermediate region, but not so as to coincide with a surface
at which there is an abrupt change of direction in any of the
rays. For instance, if the image is formed by a lens, the
section may be taken either in the substance of the lens or in
the external medium, but must not coincide with a face of the
lens. Divide this section into parts comparable in size with
A1 or A2, and let As denote the area of one of these parts.
Also let us denote the index of refraction at the centre of A3.
Since A1 is the image of A2, the rays which go from the
perimeter of A2 to a fixed point of As will go on to the peri
meter of A1; thus As and A1 will subtend the same solid angle
as seen from A3, call it os. Hence, by applying (1) first to
A1 and As and then to As and A2, we have

rays which traverse the perimeter of A3.
   Equations (14) show that the ratio of on to os is the same
for all the portions such as As into which the intermediate
section is divided. Let Q, Q, be the whole solid angles at
A1A2 formed by the aggregate of all the rays which go from
A2 to A1. Q1 is the sum of all the partial angles ol, and Q,

   The rays which go from A3 to A1 diverge from A3 in the
solid angle Q, 'i converge to A1 in the solid angle Q1.

XXVII. On the Tetravalency of Oxygen; with Remarks on
  the Varying Valency of the Elements and the Present Chemical
   Aspect of the Valency Problem. By J. F. HEYEs, M.A.,
   F.C.S., F.R.G.S., of Magdalen College, Oxford *.
    HE actual state, or rather phase, of philosophic Chemistry
       presents us with a remarkable paradox. Simultaneous
with the discovery and chemical analysis of countless new
compounds and many new elementary or non-resolved sub
stances during the present century, there have emerged a
series of views on the constitution of matter and the cor
relation of material forces which will for many centuries
to come mark the greatest epoch in scientific philosophy.
Although this molecular theory of matter has been            £
developed on the physical and dynamical side, the con
tributions from the chemical side of the hedge of this
great field of research have been very striking—such, in
fact, as to stimulate the work of our greatest physicists.
Scientific chemists, it may be said, have established the law
of the conservation of mass; physicists, that of energy: now
both are united in searching out the nature and influences
of the masses and forces which are at work in the material
world of chemical substances. But while the smaller limit,
so to speak, of physical analysis is the molecule, it forms the
upper limit of chemical analysis and synthesis. The main
studies of the   £           are inter-molecular, those of the
chemists intra-molecular phenomena. From this point of
view, strict Chemistry begins where Physics ends; but,
viewed historically, a growing interaction must be con
fessed, and, indeed, a friendly struggle has begun for the
wells of the border-land    '. the one        side calls molecular
£ and the other physical chemistry.                 Both are pecu
 iarly interested and  £         just now in what are somewhat
curiously termed “molecular compounds” or aggregations.
Undoubtedly the trouble is chiefly and naturally on the
chemical side; and, in the conventional system of shorthand
or formulae which the chemist uses to express (1) his facts
about their composition and (2) his views about their con
stitution, it may be said to take the form of a discussion
as to the meaning of certain dots and dashes with which our
new text-books are plentifully (and to many students, I fear,
misleadingly) sprinkled.

222                   Mr. J. F. Heyes on the
valency of an element, and the so-called atomicity of atoms,
the ordinary language of chemical theory is used, it is not
because I have any belief in an ultimate solution of the
problems on the chemical side, but because, as the problems
now stand, the conditions of the great mystery of chemical
affinity can best be attacked, and perhaps by chemists can
only . attacked, by facing the problems of what has been
termed atomicity, valency, and quantivalence.
   There is so much confusion of language on this subject
that I must beg leave to make a very elementary start with
our three historic typical compounds—HCl, H2O, H3N.
   Let us most carefully recognize the facts conveyed in these
formulae first ; for these facts, if fully ascertained, must remain
good when our transitional conceptions of them “have faded
into the infinite azure of the past.”
   (1) There are the facts of definite composition by weight
and volume. The three gas formulae weights occupy the same
volume.
   (2) Experience, aided by comparison of composition, has
led us to the laws and facts of definite and multiple pro
portion.
   (3) The latter can only, as far as we can see, be explained
in terms of the old atomic theory.
   (4) Referring to this theory, Dalton showed us it was
possible to obtain the ratio-weights of the atoms.
   The symbol O in our formulae has therefore more than one
interpretation. It stands for (1) oxygen stuff, (2) an atom
of oxygen, and (3) for a number. £ is the material for a
confusion of thought which is observable in the history of our
science. This has been increased by the natural coincidence
of our selection of the lightest stuff known (hydrogen) as the
unit to which we refer (1) densities (that is, the ratio-masses
of equal volumes), which are absolute facts, (2) atomic weights
(that is, the most probable ratio-masses of atoms whose volumes
are unknown), which are relative facts. Thus
              A2 – 16 expresses pure fact;
              An     1
but
               #= #     expresses well-grounded belief,
based upon the cumulative probability resulting from the
consideration of many physical and chemical data. It is to
be noted, moreover, that the question of the most probable
value O =1596, accepted by many chemists, versus the exact
integer 16, does not, so far as I can see at present, affect con

                      Tetravalency of Oxygen.                223
siderations of valency or atomicity. But it may subsequently
affect the questions as to the actual number of hydrogen and
chlorine atoms in a molecule of hydrogen chloride, and the
discussion of what Professor Armstrong calls “residual
affinity.” The atomic weight—that is, ratio-atomic weight—
of oxygen is in this sense 16. But it is well to bear in mind
 that the number can, if necessary, be taken in the more natural
 sense of a “combining proportion” or combining weight, and
 that this number 16 is not indissolubly bound up with the
 statement that the oxygen atom is diatomic or divalent, as is
 sometimes supposed. Indeed, Professor Odling, in his historic
 paper" on the weight of the oxygen atom, demonstrated that
 O=16, and not 8 as then usually taken if N=14, as was
 universally accepted whether in a strictly atomic sense or not.
     Taking, then, equal volumes of these three gases, it is a
 fact that we have one, two, and three unit weights and volumes
 combined with the chemical unit weights of Cl, O, and N.
 Apart even from Avogadro's law, the chemist would, adopting
 the atomic theory, say that “atoms” of chlorine, oxygen,
 and nitrogen respectively combined with one, two, and three
 atoms of hydrogen in these compounds; and hence that these
 atoms were mono-, di-, and tri-atomic respectively. In the de
  velopments of the substitution- and type-theories, and above
  all in the development of the hydrocarbon theory, based
  upon the very   £          constant “tetratomicity of carbon,”
 this theory has been so useful that there has been a strong
  school of chemists to maintain this atomicity as a constant
  property—'a property inherent in the nature of atoms.”f
       he word “atomicity” is thus naturally associated with
  some inherent and occult property of the atom or some force
  centering from it. Since it has become more generally
  recognized that the atomicity of many elements seems to
  vary when either (1) the chemical conditions of A and B are
  altered, or (2) other elements are chemically associated with A
  or B, the word “atomicity” has wisely gone out of fashion.
  More strictly speaking, it is the phrase “the atom of oxygen
  is diatomic ’’ which is disappearing, because physicists (e. g.
  Prof. J. J. Thomson) write about “diatomic molecules,”
  meaning molecules which contain two chemical atoms. Thus
  it is now said that “the molecule of oxygen is diatomic,” and
  that “the atom of oxygen is divalent,” or, most briefly, that
  “oxygen is a dyad.” The shorthand form remains distinct; it
   is O for the diatomic molecule, but O" or O" for the divalent
   atom.

 224                  Mr. J. F. Heyes on the
    Now the development of the chemistry of the carbon
compounds has shown us that not merely is there chemical
contiguity of some sort between the atoms in a molecule
 (e. g. H2O= HHO or HOH), but that there are special and
preferable contiguities between certain atoms or (for brevity's
sake, and sometimes provisionally for want of knowledge)
 groups of atoms. ... These special associations, often termed
 “atomic linkings,” are seen to keep together through
many formative and transformative reactions; and they
are indicated in our so-called constitutional formulae, where
these special associations are indicated by so-called “links”
or “bonds.” The extraordinary progress in complex or
ganic synthesis, the thousands of syntheses which have
resulted in so few years of labour in the great and, on the
whole, wonderfully systematic and connected text-books of
 organic chemistry, compel us, I think, to retain the notion of
“links” or “bonds,” or, as I prefer to call them, “valencies,”
in writing these constitutional formulae. Not merely, then,
do we write divalent oxygen as –O— but also as O= in
our constitutional formulae, according as we interpret, and
 fairly consistently interpret, our reactions. Thus, in the
case of water, alcohol and ether, with their analogues, do we
find -O-, but in ketones and aldehyds =O, and in the
organic acids both aspects of divalent oxygen. Similarly the
nitrogen atom may be directlyN specially associated with three
                  -          -              -                 -
other atoms (as in ammonia, N^), or it may not; but this
                                   |
does not necessarily interfere with its usually trivalent, and
perhaps occasionally pentavalent, character:
    It is in some such sense as this that I believe that oxygen
is occasionally, and probably in more cases than is usually
supposed, tetravalent. Pattison Muir" gives what is pro
bably the most generally accepted definition:—“The atom of
oxygen can directly act on and be acted on by two other
atoms in a molecule;” but adds, “in some molecules there
are only two atoms, one of which is oxygen.” This of course
refers to the well-known gaseous puzzles, NO, CO, compared
with the standard molecule HCl. Perhaps it would be more
cautious to say, instead of “act on,” “are directly chemically
associated with,” since it is this statical aspect which our
formulae indicate.    It is not therefore the case that a tetra
valent element is necessarily associated with four monovalent
elements. Where this is the case, as in the hydrides, halides,
and methides, I should propose that the old word “tetratomic”
be used. It is here, in fact, that the idea of the inherent

                        Tetravalency of Oxygen.                     225
property of the atom is most striking. We might usually
confine this notion of the thing or force to “atomicity,” and
reserve the idea involved in the number or ratio to “valency.”
I propose that we should always look upon valency as a
number and atomicity as a property, but both still to be
investigated. That the valency of all known atoms is a small
integer, and most probably 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, is surely one of
the best assured facts in the present state of chemical know
ledge. It is a separate question whether in particular com
   ounds the valency of a selected atom may vary within the
  imits of these numbers. It is also a separate question what
this number really means. But I would particularly point out
that this valency is apparently independent of the discussions
on and decimal revisions of our atomic weights. For valenc
as a number must be a ratio and referred to monovalent H';
and practically we have referred the valency of all atoms to
either monovalent H', or to that unit weight of chlorine which
combines with the unit weight of hydrogen in the H'C1'. Un
 fortunately the word equivalent has had and has several
 meanings attached to it. But it is most convenient to take it
 as a weight, viz. that weight of the non-metal which combines
 with unit weight of the gaseous metal hydrogen, or that
weight of a metal which combines with the chemical unit
 weight of the gaseous non-metal chlorine.
    Our first most obvious and useful definition of valency is,
 first, that it is the numerical ratio,
                             atomic weight .
                           equivalent weight’
 e.g. (1) valency of antimony (in antimony trichloride) is
                              #=8, i. e. Sb",
 (2) valency of oxygen (in steam) is
                          #     Ol'   #=2. or O".
     As some elements have more than one equivalent weight,
 but can only have one atomic weight", it is not surprising that
 the valency of an element may be a varying number. But
 although this is really a practical rule in ' case of almost all
 the metals, we meet with difficulties in the non-metals. Thus,
 on the hydrogen standard, this kind of valency of oxygen is

but the oxygen chlorides give 2, #, and #, which ratios are
those of 12, 4, and 3. It would be illogical to infer the multi
valency of oxygen from these figures, but they seem to
support clearly the integral character of valency. On this
account I would venture to deprecate the use, except with
extreme caution, of such phrases as “residual affinities” or
“residual valencies,” at any rate so long as we fully and
strictly accept the fundamental laws of definite, constant, and
multiple proportions. Whatever may emerge as the precise
meaning of that well-known little . in those formulae where
the joint influence of reactions and of notions will neither
consent to the distant chemical acquaintance of +, nor the
intimate familiarity of the valence-link – (so prematurely
thrust upon us in inorganic text-books), it would nevertheless
seem clear that we are observing the action of integral units
of some sort, and not residual or small decimal quantities of
chemism, affinity, or attraction—whichever our mysterious
force be called.
   It is in such apparently simple cases as the oxides of
chlorine and nitrogen that the combined doctrines of valency
and linking seem to break down, or are at least not obvious.
Here is the great paradox in our constitutional formulae, even
from the low standpoint of reactions’ shorthand. The doc
trines have been applied with marvellous success to analysis,
synthesis, and prevision of thousands of organic compounds,
including dozens of liquids which, although they give the
same analytical and vapour-density results, are absolutely
distinct in their properties and reactions. And, basing their
work on the idea of the geometrical stability of a molecular
system containing strictly tetravalent atoms, Van 't Hoff
and others have gone still further. Yet in the apparently
simple molecules of inorganic chemistry, we are still in
a state of comparative chaos. At least we may say that,
 whereas in organic chemistry the young student finds the
 constitutional formulae the most helpful shorthand-memo
 randa possible of reactions and relationships, the beginner in
£           chemistry is usually  £             affected, if not
hopelessly muddled, by the presumed necessity of writing
these so-called graphic (?) formulae, in the case, for instance,
of the oxides of nitrogen, chlorine, and manganese, or even
for what are commonly called ammonia, hydrochloric acid
and nitric acid.                                     -
    In the case of hydrogen dioxide, H2O2, the only reasons

the symbol –0–0– will represent a couple which is
unsaturated and capable of attaching, for example, two atoms
of hydrogen. This conception explains the constitution of
hydrogen peroxide, I'"'.
   Now this is one of the most numerous class of bodies whose
true molecular weight we have at present no means of ascer
taining, or at least of comparing with gaseous molecules. It
is, like BaO2, PbO2, MnO2, SnO2, SiO, versus CO2, simply a
chemical unit formula. As such formulae are not strictly
comparable like our two-volume formulae, the chief, if not
the only, use of constitutional formulae in such cases should
surely be to explain or indicate reactions, and thus to con
tribute something from the purely chemical standpoint to the

There is no chemical equality, so to speak, in the oxygen atoms,
and no suggested explanation of why some £ what
is technically termed “available oxygen” and others have not.
    One  £stumbling-block in our theories of quantivalence
 seems to be due to an apparently unanimous faith in the
constant divalency of oxygen, as well as the constant mono
valency of the halogens. This has been curiously illustrated
in the adoption by many chemists of extreme views in two
 directions. Either the valency has been very largely varied
 between 1 and 7 in the case of the halogens, or the valency
  ower or atomicity of the multivalent metals has been largely
 increased.      The late Professor Wurtz advocated the first
view, and Professor Williamson’s address at York furnishes
 an instance of the second standpoint. Certainly, rather than
 recognize so many valency powers” for the non-metals, it
    * Thus Wurtz gave to chlorine the valencies 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7, and to
 nitrogen, 1, 2, 3, 5. Heptavalent chlorine is also suggested by several
 philosophers,  e'        in connexion with the periodic arrangements of
 the elements. In such cases, at least equal weight must be given to
 aluminium and gallium as trivalent in £ periodic series, whereas the
 tetravalency is constantly asserted, based on the two-volume molecular

228                    Mr. J. F. Heyes on the
would be preferable to accept the high valencies of metals
suggested. But this is not necessary; and still less necessary
is it to return in despair to unitary formulae. Both extremes
seem to involve the idea that the atom of highest valency is a
sort of nucleus in the molecule, and enforces an immediate
proximity or association of all the other atoms of inferior
valency". Organic chemistry has clearly shown that this is
not true. It is thus most improbable that avoiding the
controversial dot (.) in such ways as
             (NHA),SnFs, instead of SnF, .4NH,F,
and similarly,
K.HSnFs, Am2ZrF6, AmaZrF7, Na;/rF13, Cu2ZrFs + 12H20,
should involve changes in the already high valency of tin or
zirconium. Similarly, in H2PtCl6 it is not very probable that
Pt is octovalent; nor in K. BeF, that beryllium is hexavalent.
The alternative is that the halogens are in some compounds
more than monovalent. This view I have taken during the
last five years. But we need not, as Wurtz appears to have
done, take the higher valency as more than trivalent ; for it
is not likely that the halogen atom, any more than the
metallic atom, is directly associated with all the others. This
hypothesis of the occasional trivalency of the halogens (espe
'        iodine, whose evidence is the strongest f), together
with the not infrequent tetravalency of oxygen will, I think,
be found to simplify our ground very much and practically
reduce alternative valencies to two—an alternative which, in
the case of such elements as phosphorus and tin, has been
recognized for many years.
   The elements may, indeed, be arranged in two divisions,
viz. those whose valency is a single number unchallenged
(e.g. K, Na, Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cd), and those whose
valencies are more than one number but probably only

two, which valence-powers probably all conform to the re
markable law of odd and even numbers, or, as Prof. Odling
termed atoms with such valencies, perissads and artiads. If,

should be placed in this second class, it is not to complicate
but to simplify the great valency problem. Monovalent

   It was in fact in the compounds already referred to, H2O2
and BaO2, that I at first concluded the tetravalency of oxygen
to be the lesser of two puzzles. I look upon them as

    (i.) The peculiar reactions of BaO, MnO, PbO2, and their
inability to form what are curiously called “corresponding
salts,” as contrasted with SnO2, SiO2, are suggested to me by
the formulae X"=O=O as opposed to X"O2, i.e. O=X=0,
 the molecules being (XO), where v is unknown.
    (ii.) The existence of a series of oxides in the case of some
 metals, and of only one oxide with others, is probably connected
 with this double valency—I use the phrase provisionally as the
 sequel will show—of oxygen. Some of the oxides are otherwise
 not accounted for, and in others there is an assumed linking or
 double linking of the metallic atoms of which we may well be
 sceptical. For it is, I believe, the peculiar characteristic of
 the non-metals or  £         elements to preferably exhibit this
 single, double, or treble linking (if it exists, and whatever it
 may mean) and thus to accumulate. Thus the oxides of silver,
          AgO,      Ag30, Ag,0s, are taken as
          Ag+0, Ag-O-Ag, and Ag—O—Ag.

   (iii.) There are certain suboxides which lurk in our text
books and literature. In addition to Ag,O", perhaps the “blue
crust” forming on recently cut potassium is K.O.", and Pb2O
may be Pb=O=Pb giving PbO, which can, like BaO, take
up more oxygen from the air. Indeed the curious actions of
heat on PbO and Ba0 as well as MnO, &c. seem to be due
to this conditional tetravalency of oxygen, and not to change
 of valency of metallic atom or atoms usually assumed.
   (iv.) The peroxides of potassium and sodium are puzzles. As
Na2O, is not decomposed on heating, it has a legitimate claim
    O—Na
to  o    N   which H2O, has not. Moreover it forms a hydrate
     -IN in
Na2O2.8H2O. Whatever K2O may turn out to be, it is
probable that all the O atoms are not divalent. The arrange
 ment is undoubtedly a comparatively stable one, and when
it is interpreted we shall probably see the constitution of,
 or at least the interrelations of, certain bodies not usually
associated with it, e. g. K2O, KClO4, HClO3, Cl2O, all
strikingly “stable.” Perhaps

   (v.) But just as the remarkable way in which so many metallic
chlorides combine with other chlorides, chlorhydric acid, and
 oxides, is a strong line of evidence for the trivalency of chlorine,
 so the peculiar actions of water as an active chemical reagent,
 even when it is not represented in our conventional equations,
 seem to be strong evidence of the ready way in which the
oxygen atom in water can be stimulated, so to speak, to exhibit
its tetravalent character.

so-called “basic salts” so numerous in the case of oxygen, be
it noted, and probably also the complex poly-tungstates and
silicates are also probably connected with this property of
oxygen. Prof. Carnelley's vanadates of thallium form re
markable instances of the convenience of the mode of viewing
a salt as a combination of two oxides.

   Probably more ring formulae in inorganic bodies will come to light, and
they will affect the maypole hypothesis—as it may be called of the
domination of the central polad atom.                                -
   * Even in the case of so-called “KHO ” there is more to be said for
K.H.0, at least, if not (KOH). Ag,O.H., though doubtful, is less mis
leading than AgOH.

234                    Mr. J. F. Heyes on the
experiments on the explosion of carbonous oxide * with
oxygen is also probably due to this provisional tetravalency
of oxygen,
   Undoubtedly the chief difficulty which is present to the
mind in using these links or conceding these valencies, in the
case of proposed higher values, is the doubt whether the
combination is of the same order or intensity so to speak, and
can be strictly called chemical combination in all cases. On
this account Professor Armstrong f wrote the compounds.

   But the valency as matter of discussion might perhaps be
indicated as
                               Cl=Cl–K

   There are many such compounds; e.g.
     HgCl, .2NHCl,            InCl; .3KCl,      Al,F, .6NaF,
      CuCl2. 2KCl,            TICls .3KCl,      Ir,Cls. 6KCl,

    MgBr, 2KBr.                            or ? M"Cls. 3MCl.
   These formulae clearly suggest the problem in quanti
valency which lies before us. Certainly such phrases as “re
sidual valency,” “surplus affinity,” “residual charge on the
atoms” are open to the objections which have already been
suggested. They may prematurely beg the problems of
chemical affinity. Even in the case of PCls there can scarcely
be said to be observed a perfect chemical equality of the atoms
such as we believe to be in CH4. The chlorine is apparently
dealt with preferably in two fifths and three fifths in most
chemical reactions.        Such considerations have long induced
Professor Kekulé and others to maintain that a phosphorus
atom is constantly trivalent.
   For the higher valency under discussion, in the case of
oxygen and chlorine, if we are to use other words, it may
be found convenient to use a kindred word validity, which
has therefore been occasionally used in this paper. We

 could say, for instance, that chlorine is usually monovalent
 but occasionally tervalid. The latin prefixes, roman numbers,
 and broken lines in formulae would help to keep up the dis
tinction; thus:
         -R monovalent,                 ---R      univalid.

         =R” tetravalent,               ==R's quadrivalid, &c.
We might then say that carbon is tetravalent, except in
the gaseous molecules CO and CNH, where it is bivalid
unless the tetravalency of oxygen and the pentavalency of
nitrogen are admitted, when .# is always tetravalent".
               CEO              and          C=N–H.
 Other open questions will suggest themselves to the mindf.
    The general chemical observation that no atom is really
known to be more than hexavalent to the standard monovalent
atoms; finds remarkable independent support in Prof. J. J.
Thomson’s development of the vortex-atom theory. According
to his view a triad atom consists of three vortex rings sym
metrically linked together, and “no element could have an
atom consisting of more than six vortex rings.” He has also
found that stable motion exists “when the distance between
the rings was small compared with their apertures,” and he
adds: “We found that for each displacement there are two
periods of vibration, a quick vibration and a slow one.” Is
it possible, it may be asked, that in these two periods of
vibration there is a connexion with the two valencies or rather
the valency and validity of so many of the negative or non
metallic elements which have been referred to in this paper?
    Prof. J. J. Thomson at least clearly points out that, ac
cording to the vortex-atom theory of gases, “one atom of a
   " In CO, according to Prof. J. J. Thomson's conception of links, “the
atom of carbon has the same number of links as the atom of oxygen.”
   + CNH and NCH are metameric molecules. It is not easy to decide
which is the formula of prussic “acid” gas. In the formula, I have
assumed it to be the “imido” relative of CO, which is metameric with
formo-nitrile, th    The two methyl and ethyl metamers seem distin
guishable, but sometimes turn up together in “the same” reaction.
   1 The cases of M" and M" are here considered as not proven. Prof.
J. J. Thomson's views on this point will doubtless be dealt with in the
course of further chemical research.

236                 Mr. J. F. Heyes on the
dyad might unite not only with two atoms of a monad, but
also with four atoms of a monad, the four atoms of the monad
splitting into two groups each.” He says: “Regarding
oxygen, then, as a dyad, the molecule of water consists of
three primaries H2–0–0.” I do not know the exact signi
ficance of his marks, but the analogous formula now pro
posed is H2=O=O, or at least H2=O==0. It is at least
                                 O—H
preferable to the symmetrical    ö   H   in better exhibiting its
reactions, and- as

                   the modern representative of the late Sir B.
 Brodie's H2OO, which has the no small merit of distinguish
ing between the two atoms chemically dissimilar. The
novelty (so far as I know) of formulating a divalent and a
tetravalent atom of the same element in one chemical mole
cule will, I hope, provide fruitful discussion with those
chemists who are not prepared to reject or scorn the child
hood of constitutional formulae.
    However hypothetical our constitutional formulae of most
inorganic bodies may yet be, I venture to doubt the wisdom
of abandoning the use of our valence-marks, linkings, so-called
double bonds, &c. in favour even of the single mark proposed
some years ago by Lössen. They may still be used with
advantage to chemical science, but not usually to those who
are beginning its study. The fact is that the one-sided study
 of inorganic chemistry, with its numerous elements, and there
 fore greater delicacy and intricacy of valency-variation, would
 make us pessimists, and the isolated study of organic che
 mistry, with its few elements, would keep us optimists. The
 reaction of the constitutional school of chemists upon the
 empirical formulae of inorganic chemistry has been, in some
 respects, rather premature in its attempts to solve too much
 at the outset; but the real laws of valency must be substan
 tially the same in both. Thus we have the radical or group
 ing—the organic atom so to speak—of ethyl (C2H5) always
 of one valency, but (C5H5) is both mono- and tri-valent. Nay,
 more. What would be called the allotropic modifications of
 this “atom”—were it an atom—are well known, and can be
 separably recognized. If (C5H5) were an elementary atom, it
 would be called usually trivalent but occasionally univalid;
 or, if no distinction is to be made, trivalent and monovalent
 after the fashion of gold or thallium.   There are not less than
 five trivalent  (C.H.) ";  and their compounds with either
 chlorine, oxygen, or hydroxyl are all known.

   If at present we cannot press the analogy too close in the
alternating valency" of so-called elementary radicals or atoms,
especially the non-metallic ones, we are surely not yet pre
pared to abandon formulae which have been of such signal
service in the development of organic chemistry, and to
abolish the notation because we do not yet know the real
meaning either of the marks or valency. But is it too bold
a thing for us to look forward to the time when we can
similarly deal with an elementary radical, the present pro
visional chemical atom ? At present our notions of valency
are chiefly conditioned by the experiments made, and the
chemical products constantly being beheld, at about 16° C. and
76-centim. mercury pressure. It is, therefore, wonderful
and encouraging that we should already have a theory which,
on the whole, has such promise for the future. And it is not
surprising that, as Clerk Maxwell wittily put it at Belfast,
               Though they seem to cling together,
                   And form “associations” here,
               Yet soon or late they burst their tether,

THE following communications were read:—
       1. “On the Correlation of some of the Eocene Strata in the
Tertiary Basins of England, Belgium, and the North of France.”
By Prof. Joseph Prestwich, M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   Although the relations of the several series have been for the
most part established, there are still differences of opinion as to the
exact relation of the Sable de Bracheux and of the Soissonnais to
the English series; of the Oldhaven Beds to the Woolwich series;
and of the London Clay and Lower and Upper Bagshots to equiva
lent strata in the Paris basin. The author referred to the usual
classification of the Eocene Series, and proceeded to deal with each
group in ascending order.                                         -
   The Calcaire de Mons is not represented in England, but may be
in France by the Strontianiferous marls of Meudon. It contains a
rich molluscan fauna, including 300 species of Gasteropods, many
of which are peculiar, but all the genera are Tertiary forms. The
Heersian are beds of local occurrence, and the author sees no good
reason for separating them from the Lower Landenian or Thanet
Sands. He gave reasons for excluding the Sands of Bracheux from
this group. Out of 28 Pegwell-bay species, 10 are common to the
Lower Landenian, and 5 to the Bracheux Sands, which present a
marked analogy with the Woolwich Series. These Sands of Bracheux
are replaced in the neighbourhood of Paris by red and mottled clays.
Out of 45 species at Beauvais only 6 are common to the Thanet
Sands and 10 to the Woolwich Series. Out of 75 species in the
 Woolwich and Reading Beds 19 occur in the Bracheux Beds, if we
add to these latter the Sands of Chalons-sur-Wesles.
   Respecting the Basement Bed of the London Clay (Oldhaven Beds in
part), the author would exclude the Sundridge and Charlton fossils,
which should be placed on a level with the Upper Marine Beds of
Woolwich. He allowed that the former were deposited on an eroded
surface, but this involves no real unconformity, whilst the palaeon
tological evidence is in favour of this view, since out of 57 species
in the Sundridge and associated beds, only 16 are common to the
London Clay. He therefore objected to the quadruple division.
Either the Oldhaven should go with the Woolwich or with the
Basement Bed.      He admitted that the term “Basement Bed” is
objectionable, and preferred Mr. Whitaker's term for the series, as
he would limit it.
   The Lower Bagshot Sands the author would call “London Sands”
whose Belgian equivalent is the Upper Ypresian, and the French
the Sands of Cuise-de-la-Motte, forming the uppermost series of
the Lower Eocene.      A group of fossils has been discovered in the

                               Geological Society.                               239
   Upper Ypresian sands of Belgium, which leaves no doubt of their being
   of Lower Eocene age, and consequently the Lower Bagshots must be
   placed upon the same horizon. There is no separating line of
   erosion between the London Clay and the Lower Bagshots, the
   upper part of the former is sandy, and the lower part of the latter
   frequently argillaceous. Similarly no definite line can be drawn
   between the Upper and Lower Ypresian; but in both countries this
   series is separated from overlying beds by a well-marked line of
   erosion. So also in France the base of the Calcaire Grossier (Brackles
   ham Beds) is a pebbly greensand resting on an eroded surface of
   the Sands of the Cuise-de-la-Motte.             In Belgium, in Whitecliff Bay,
   and in the Bagshot district the Upper Eocene rests upon an eroded
   surface of the Lower Eocene. Subjoined is the author's proposed
   classification of the Eocene:—

     2. “On the Cambrian and Associated Rocks in North-west Caer
  narvonshire.”        By Prof. J. F. Blake, M.A., F.G.S.
     After referring to the published views of Professor Sedgwick,
  Sir A. C. Ramsay, and the Geological Survey, Profs. Hughes and

240                      Geological Society:—
Bonney and Dr. Hicks concerning the area in question and especi
ally as to the presence or absence of Precambrian rocks, the author
gave an account of his own explorations and their results, the
principal of which were the following.
   In the Bangor and Caernarvon area three distinct conglomerates
had been confounded. The only one that showed distinct uncon
formity on the underlying rock was of Arenig (Ordovician) age.
The rocks of the southern and central portion of the area were
essentially of igneous origin and might be distinguished into two
groups, the southern probably intrusive, the northern certainly
eruptive. There is no evidence to show what interval of time elapsed
between the production of these two groups, nor which of them is
the earlier, although the author regards it as more probable that
the southern mass is of the earlier date and overlain by the northern
portion. The Bangor beds are derived from the denudation of the
volcanic series, and of rocks which may have been associated with
it, and they contain a series of conformable conglomerates of which
the great conglomerates near Bangor are members. They are the
continuation of the Cambrian rocks seen to the east, and have not
undergone any serious alteration. The porphyries of Llyn Padarn
and Moel Tryfaen are contemporaneous lava-flows in the midst of
the Cambrian series, the overlying conglomerates being derived
from them and from the sedimentary Cambrian rocks to the west;
and hence there is no certain proof of there being any Precambrian
rocks in the whole district, though it is probable that the rock
near Caernarvon belongs to an epoch distinct from and anterior to
the Cambrian.

   The following communications were read:—
   1. “On the Law that governs the Action of Flowing Streams.”
By R. D. Oldham, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author, after describing how his attention was drawn to
the subject, proceeded to an investigation of the law that governs
the action of a flowing stream.     Having accepted as a fundamental
principle that the velocity of a stream will always tend to become
such as is just sufficient to transport the solid burden cast on to the
stream, and pointed out that the principle is almost axiomatic in its
nature, he finds that, where untrammelled by exterior conditions, a
stream will be alternately confined to a single, well-defined, deep
channel, and spread out into a number of ill-defined, shallow
channels, the former being defined as a “reach,” the latter as a
“fan,” that the gradient in the “reach " is less than on the “fan,”
and that both “reach " and “fan” will continually be encroaching at
their upper ends, and being encroached upon at their lower ends.
   After detailing some general considerations which show that
what should occur according to hypothesis, does actually occur in
nature, he indicated that the accurate and detailed levels taken in
connexion with the Ganges canal, do actually show this alternation
of “reach" and “fan,” that the gradients are higher in the latter,

                 Bagshot Beds of the London Basin.                   241
as they should be, and that the records of the canal show the retro
gression of “fan” and “reach” demanded by the hypothesis.
    Accepting this agreement of fact with hypothesis as proof of the
correctness of the latter, it follows that the fundamental principle
on which it is founded is correct, and that, in the absence of inter
fering causes of greater potency, it is the coarseness or fineness of
the débris cast upon a stream that will determine its gradient and
velocity, and not, as stated in text-books, the velocity of a stream
 that will determine its gradient and the coarseness of the débris
 transported by it:—a conclusion that might be arrived at inde
 pendently, from the fact that it is in the upper reaches of a stream,
 where coarse débris prevails, that high velocities of current prevail,
 while in the lower reaches, where the débris is finer in grain, the
 velocity of current is also diminished.
     2. “Supplementary Notes on the Stratigraphy of the Bagshot
 # .G.S.
        of the   London Basin.” By the Rev. A. Irving, B.Sc., B.A.,
     This paper contained the results of field-work during the year 1887.
 Additional notes on the stratigraphy of the Bracknell and Ascot
 Hills were given, justifying the reading of the country as shown in
 figs. 1 and 2 of the author's last paper (Q. J. G. S. August 1887),
 the examination of this line of country having been extended as far
 as Englefield Green. Sections of the beds of the Middle Group as
  they crop out at Caesar's Camp, Swinley Park, Ascot, and Sunning
  dale, were described and correlated with the 76 feet of beds which
  constitute that group in the Well-section at Wellington College.
     The stratigraphy of the hills known as Finchampstead Ridges has
  been worked out from numerous sections on their flanks; and the
  strata of the Bearwood Hills were correlated directly with them.
      All along the northern margin a general attenuation of (a) the
  Lower (fluviatile) Sands, and of (b) the Middle (green earthy) Sands
  was shown to occur, and in some places on the northern margin they
  are found to have entirely thinned away, admitting of distinct
  overlap at more than one horizon.
      The second part of the paper dealt with the Highclere district,
  where the author believes he has established the full succession of
  the three stages of the Bagshot Formation, a section being given
  across the valley south of Highclere Station, showing the succession
  of the whole Eocene series (with the Ostrea bellovacina-bed for its
  base) as it is developed there.
      Some important conclusions were drawn as to the Tertiary physio
  graphy of the South of England; and the revised tabulation of the
  Tertiaries put forward by Prof. Prestwich at the Society's last
  meeting was referred to as supporting some of the main points for
  which the author has contended.
      3. “The Red-Rock Series of the Devon Coast Section.” By the
   Rev. A. Irving, B.Sc., B.A., F.G.S.
       From a recent examination of this section, and from the facts

242            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
furnished by Mr. Ussher's paper (Q. J. G. S. vol. xxxii. pp. 367 et
seq.), the author has arrived at the conclusion that the series of red
rocks between the Lias to the east of Seaton and the Carboniferous
of Devon, formerly described under the title of “New Red Sand
stone,” cover the period of geologic time which that term signified,
and that the lower members of the series belong, not to the Trias,
but to the Permian or Post-Carboniferous.
   He considered that at the base of the Budleigh-Salterton Pebble
bed there is a physical break of as much significance as that be
tween the Trias and the Permian of the Midlands.                From this
point eastwards the Triassic system is represented by a series of
rocks quite comparable with the Bunter and Keuper of the Mid
lands, the Bunter being here represented by the Middle Division
(about 200 feet thick) and the Upper Division of Prof. Hull.
   These pass under the basement sandstone-series of the Keuper
below High Peak and Peak Hills, are brought up again by faulting
at Sidmouth, and dip beneath the Keuper again east of the Sid,
from which point eastwards the whole Keuper Division is exposed,
with quite a normal facies, as seen in the Midlands, in Central
Germany (Thüringen, Jena), and in the Neckar Valley.
   In the marls which underlie the Budleigh-Salterton Pebble-bed,
he recognized the equivalents of the Permian Marls of Warwick
shire and Nottinghamshire, and of the Zechstein Marls of Germany.
These pass, by a gradual transition, through Sandstones, becoming
more and more brecciated, into the great brecciated series of Daw
lish and Teignmouth, which were regarded as the equivalents of the
great Permian breccias of the west of England, of Ireland, and of
the Lower Rothliegendes of Germany.
   All the rocks below the Budleigh-Salterton Pebble-bed were
regarded as the assorted materials furnished by the detritus of the
palaeozoic mountain-region of Devon, Cornwall, and Brittany, and as
representing the waste and degradation of that region, deposited on
the mountain-flanks and in land-locked bays during Post-Carboni
ferous times, the marls being compared with the Nyirok of the
Austrian geologists.

    AN EXPERIMENT ON THE EMISSION OF LIGHT BY IGNITED
                   BODIES.     BY FERDINAND BRAUN.
A.    SMALL portion, a few square centimetres for instance, of any
        object of porcelain is coated with the ordinary black paint
used by painters on porcelain", and is heated in a muffle closed
   * This is a mixture of several metallic oxides with a flux; that is, an
easily fusible silicate or borate. It is rubbed to a soft paste with some
fresh oil of turpentine to which a little “thickening-oil” is added, and is
painted on with a brush. “Thickening-oil" is the name given by
porcelain-painters to the liquid which gradually creeps over the edge of a
vessel in which turpentine is exposed in the open air—it is probably a
hydrate of turpentine.

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.           243
on all sides except through a small peep-hole; the following
is then observed. At the first beginning of the red heat the
porcelain begins to be luminous. The black spot stands out
from it. . As the temperature rises the emission of light by
the porcelain becomes more intense, and the whole contents of
the muffle seems as if it had been feebly illuminated from the
outside.     If the heat be still more increased the black spot
becomes feebler, and after passing through a relatively small
interval of temperature, it stands out so little from the por
celain that anyone seeing it for the first time would think it had
completely disappeared. When a burning spill or a gas-flame is
brought into the muffle, it is seen that the spot is still black on a
white ground (the black having a dark red rusty tinge). This
phenomenon, which might be used for recognizing distinct tempe
ratures, I estimate to occur at 800° C. If the temperature be now
raised, the emission of light of the dark spot precedes that of the
porcelain, and at about 1000° to 1100° C. it appears bright, radia
ting white on the rose-red porcelain. By introducing a burning
body into the muffle it again appears dark on white. Other por
celain colours, purple for instance, give similar phenomena; a
pen-stroke (which changes into oxide of iron and burns in with
lustre) is sufficient; but no material gives so intense a colour, and
is so little interfered with by reflexion, as that mentioned.
   The phenomenon is simply explained. Porcelain, at ordinary
and even higher temperatures, is transparent for luminous rays;
the dark mixture of metallic oxides, however, is opaque, as can
easily be seen with a painted porcelain crucible made red hot in the
gas-flame. In the measure in which the luminous rays increase in
intensity with increase of temperature, the emission of light by the
black spot also increases. As it always appears black when illu
minated with a source of high temperature, it follows that it must
have a greater power of absorption than porcelain; that is, if the
heat were increased its brightness would also increase, provided
there were not otherwise any change in the power of absorption.
   The experiment may of course also be made in a darkened room
with a piece of porcelain, and forms thus an instructive lecture
experiment. I find that it succeeds pretty well if a large porcelain
crucible is painted on the inside and heated in a Bunsen's burner.
The disappearance of the black, however, does not succeed very
well; and by free heating in the flame we cannot get a temperature
of more than a dark redness. On the other hand, with a spot of
gold an intensely green radiation is obtained at about 800° (like
the surface of melted copper), which at decreasing temperature
passes into a dark blue. The colours recall the colours of trans
mission of thin gold leaves. Platinum is far more luminous on
cooling than porcelain; the light disappears, passing through a
faint red, like that of the other opaque solids. The behaviour of
gold and platinum shows distinctly that certain kinds of rays have
a specific emission.—Wiedemann's Annalen, No. 2, 1888.

ON   CAPILLARY      ANALYSIS :   A   METHOD    OF  SEPARATING AND
   RECOGNIZING      INDIVIDUAL    COLOURING-MATTERS         IN  THEIR
   MIXTURES.       BY F. GOPPELSRODER.
   The properties and reactions of the pure colouring-matters are
accurately studied, and therefore the nature of a particular colour
ing-matter may be pretty readily ascertained. But the separation
of the constituents of colouring-matters is in general a very diffi
cult problem. The new method of capillary analysis renders it
possible in many cases to form in a short time a judgment as to
the composition of even very complicated substances. The basis
of the method is very simple, and is already contained in the re
searches of Schönbein. If a strip of white unglazed paper is placed
in any given solution, the solvent rises more or less rapidly than the
dissolved body. Different dissolved substances have different rates
of travelling.
   If the bottom-end of a strip of pure filtering paper is dipped in
a not too concentrated solution of the mixture to be investigated,
according to circumstances in from 15 minutes to 12 hours, a series
of zones of different colours are obtained, which contain the indi
vidual colouring-matters. The separate zones are noted as to their
colour and breadth, and are then treated with suitable solvents.
With the extracts thus produced fresh capillary experiments are
made, and the entire operation is repeated until zones of the indi
vidual pure colouring-matters are obtained, which can be examined
according to the ordinary reaction-methods.        -
   The new method has done the author good service in examining
food, and various other articles as to the addition of colours; for
instance, of picric acid in beer, fuchsine in wine &c.—Beiblätter
der Physik, vol. xi. p. 754 (from Romen's Journal, No. 1, 1887).
     ON THE CONVECTION OF ELECTRICITY BY EVAPORATION.
                       BY DR. ERNST LECHER.
   The author first of all shows, by thermometric means, that an
electrified liquid evaporates more rapidly than an unelectrified one
under the same circumstances.       It cannot, however, be concluded
that this is a consequence of the electrification of vapour; it is
primarily and almost exclusively a consequence of the electrical
aura, which also renders impossible any decision as to the far more
subtle question of the magnitude of the heat of evaporation of an
electrified liquid.
   It is moreover proved by a simple arrangement of the experiment
that, by strong electrification of a liquid surface, an electrified
cloud (or a cloud of electrified drops) may be formed; that is, its
inductive action can be demonstrated.—Sitzungsberichte der kaiser
lichen Akademie in Wien, June 1887.

  XXX. The Absolute Wave-length of Light. By Louis BELL,
          Fellow in Physics in Johns Hopkins University*.
  Th:         paper contains the final results of the research
         partially reported in this Journal for March 1887. In
  view of the wide discrepancies in the value of this physical
  constant as determined by various observers and methods, it
  has seemed desirable to give in brief the history of the sub
  ject, and to discuss critically certain portions of the investi
  gation which have proved stumbling-blocks in the past. I
  refer particularly to the verification of the standards of length
  employed, and to those errors of ruling in the gratings which
  may, and usually do, produce errors in the result obtained.
-    ' first portion of this paper will be devoted to the
  methods and results of the pioneers in this work, and the
  methods, apparatus, and standards of length employed in the
  present investigation.
     The second portion will contain the details of the experi
  mental work, together with a discussion of the final results
  and those questions of theoretical and practical interest which
  arise in connexion with the work of recent experimenters. With
  this preliminary notice is presented the first half of the paper.
                              Historical.
     Fraunhofer's first paper on the lines which bear his name
  marks a new era in the science of optics. Up to that point
  any careful study of spectra had been impossible for lack of
                     * Communicated by the Author.
     Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 25. No. 155. April 1888.          S

246              Mr. Louis Bell on the Absolute
definite standards of reference, and because the apparatus was
as yet very defective. Fraunhofer's research, “Bestimmung
des Brechungs- und Farben-zerstreuungs-Vermögens ver
schiedener Glasarten,” was presented to the Munich Academy
of Sciences in 1814, and was published in the fifth volume
of the Denkschriften. It then became possible to study in
detail the properties of rays of definite position, and the
work was taken up almost immediately. Almost the first
step was to determine the wave-lengths of prominent points
in the solar spectrum ; and, as is well known, Fraunhofer
himself took it, determining the wave-lengths corresponding
to his lines B, C, D, E, F, G, H. As there seems to have
been (noticeably in Werdet's papers) some confusion concern
ing his papers on this subject, it may be well here to clear
the matter up.
    Fraunhofer's first paper dealing with the subject was pre
sented to the Munich Academy in 1821. It is entitled,
“Neue Modifikation des Lichtes durch gegenseitige Einwir
kung und Beugung der Strahlen, und Gesetze derselben,”
and was printed in the eighth volume of the Denkschriften.
It is of considerable length, and deals with various diffraction
phenomena, but its chief interest lies in the wave-length
measurements made with wire gratings. The experiments
made with ten of these are given in detail, and are remarkably
careful and consistent. The gratings were quite various, the
wires being from 0.04 to 0.6 millim. in thickness, and the
grating-space, as ordinarily measured, from 0.0528 to 0.6866
millim. From these proportions it is evident enough that
 the spectra must have been imperfect; but, in spite of this,
 Fraunhofer obtained results which agreed remarkably well
with each other. The wave-lengths of D, as obtained from
the above-mentioned ten gratings, were as follows, reduced to
 millimetres:—
                millim.                         millim.
         (1) 0.0005891                   (6) 0.0005888
         (2) ().0005894                  (7) 0.0005885
         (3) 0.0005891                   (8) 0.0005885
         (4) () ()()05897                (9) 0.0005882
         (5) 0.0005885                 (10) 0.0005882
    The mean value adopted was 0.0005888 millim, which,
 considering the gratings, and the fact that most of the angles
 of deviation were less than 1°, is certainly remarkably accu
 rate. It should be noted, too, that the finer gratings (1) to
  (4) gave even better results.
     A brief discussion of this paper appeared in the seventy

                      Wave-length of Light.                  247
third volume of Gilbert's Annalen, and a French reprint in
Schumacher’s Astronomische Abhandlungen (ii. p. 46).
    Fraunhofer's second and more complete paper appeared in
1823 in Gilbert's Annalen (lxxiv. p. 337). Its title is, “Kurzer
Bericht von den Resultaten neuerer Versuche iber die Gesetze
des Lichts, und die Theorie derselben.” This paper gives a
detailed account of his experiments with two glass gratings.
Of these, the grating-spaces were respectively 0-0033 and
0.0160 millim. The former was apparently much the better,
and upon it Fraunhofer based his final result, which for D
was 0.0005886 millim., while the experiments with the coarser
 grating gave 0.0005890 millim. These values apply quite
 certainly to the mean of the two D lines, and not, as has been
 sometimes supposed, to one of them alone.
    The experimental work with these glass gratings was much
 better than with the previous wire ones, since the angular de
 flections were very much larger, and the gratings themselves
 were susceptible of far more exact measurement.      But at best
 they were but indifferent instruments, and the terminal lines
 were so bad that they had to be retraced before the grating
 space could be determined. So, between poor gratings and
 indifferent standards of length, Fraunhofer's determination of
 absolute wave-length left very much to be desired. However,
 nothing much better could be accomplished until the art of
 making gratings was very much improved; and it was not
 until Nobert's gratings became tolerably well known that any
 serious attempt was made to improve on Fraunhofer’s results.
 From time to time various investigators worked at the
 problem, both with Nobert's earlier gratings and by utilizing
 various interference phenomena. When, however, the great
 investigations of Bunsen and Kirchhoff revolutionized spec
 troscopic work and emphasized its great importance, the
 attention of scientific men was called to the need for accurate
  measurements; and for half a dozen years investigators were
  active, and Mascart, Ditscheiner, and Angström appeared on
  the field almost simultaneously. Each published a paper in
  1864, and of these that of Mascart is probably the most accu
  rate and painstaking, though now it is quite certain that the
  values he obtained were considerably too small. He employed
  four or five of Nobert's gratings, and instead of placing the
  grating perpendicular to either the collimator or the observing
  telescope, used it in the position of minimum deviation, that
  is to say, so that the plane of the grating should bisect the
  angle formed by the incident and diffracted rays. This
  position has certain advantages; but as the experimentation
  is rather more difficult   ":    in the ordinarv position, the
                                   2

248               Mr. Louis Bell on the Absolute
method appears to be of somewhat questionable utility. It
avoids, to be sure, the necessity of placing the grating normal
to the axis of either telescope; but as there is very little
trouble in making this adjustment with a high degree of
accuracy, and keeping it through a series of measurements,
the gain is by no means considerable. Aside from this ques
tion, Mascart's spectrometer read only to five seconds; and
while his results with different gratings agree very well indi
vidually, they are certainly collectively in error by quite a
large amount, very possibly owing to bad standards of length.
    t is a fact to be noted in discussing all these earlier wave
length determinations, that sufficient attention was not paid to
the measurement and study of the gratings—by all odds the
most difficult part of the problem. The angular measurements
of any one of the above investigators were good enough to have
given very exact results had they been combined with proper
investigations of the grating-spaces. As most of Nobert's
gratings were small and by no means accurately ruled, there
was peculiar need of care in measuring them; and when one
considers that the defining-lines on most standards of length
are far from being good, it is clear that the chances of error
were numerous. In Angström's first paper he even relied on
the grating-space assigned by the maker. Ditscheiner em
''       a grating which had belonged to Fraunhofer himself;
  ut the number of spaces was uncertain, and this led to a large
error, which he corrected, in part, in a supplementary paper
some years later. Ditscheiner's principal paper was published
in 1866; and was followed in 1868 by an elaborate discussion
of the whole problem by Van der Willigen, whose paper is
valuable mainly for a particularly elaborate review of sources
of error. Like his predecessors, he used Nobert's gratings;
but as the construction of his spectrometer confined his an
gular measurements to the deviation on one side of the normal,
their accuracy may be somewhat open to question; while his
standard of length was anything but reliable, as it was a glass
scale only three centimetres long, and the only assurance of
its accuracy was the certificate of the maker that it was “très
eracte” at 50° Centigrade. For one or both of the above
reasons, Van der Willigen’s results were larger than any which
have been obtained, before or since his time.
   In the same year appeared Angström's great research which
has so long served as the standard in all questions of wave
length. It is hard to say too much of the conscientious and
painstaking experiments on which his results were based; and
any want of accuracy in the final result was due to no lack of
skill or care on his part, but rather to the imperfect instru
ments with which he was obliged to work. Like every one

                       Wave-length of Light.                 249
 before him, he used Nobert's gratings; and in spite of the fact
 that, like all Nobert's gratings, they gave very imperfect
 definition and showed numerous “ghosts,” his results were
 more than usually consistent. But, in spite of all Angström's
 care, the event has shown that his wave-lengths are in error
 by as much as one part in seven or eight thousand, mainly
 through an error in the assumed values of his standards of
 length.      ngström measured his gratings by means of a
 dividing-engine, the screw of which was very exactly deter
 mined by comparisons resting on the Upsala metre, which, in
 turn, had been compared by M. Tresca with the prototype of
 the Conservatoire des arts et métiers. Had this comparison
 given the correct value of the Upsala metre, Angström's
 wave-lengths would have been very nearly exact except for
 corrections due to errors of ruling in the gratings.
    After Angström's research the question of absolute wave
length was not seriously raised for ten years; when Mr. C. S.
 Peirce, under the auspices of the United States Coast Survey,
again attacked the problem, armed with Rutherfurd gratings
 far superior to those used in any previous research. No
official report of his very elaborate and exhaustive experiments
has ever been published, save a very brief preliminary report
in the American Journal of Science in 1879.          Such of his
results as have been made in any way public will be discussed
in the experimental part of the present paper.
    Meanwhile Thalén, who so efficiently aided Angström in
his work, had taken up the part of it left uncompleted by the
latter’s death; and in his paper, Sur le Spectre du Fer,
published at Upsala in 1885, discussed the corrections which
must be applied to Angström's values by reason of the error
in the Upsala metre. It seems that, through the experiments
of Professor Lindhagen, Angström became aware, as early as
1872, that the assumed value of his standard was considerably
too small. His death prevented his verification of M. Lind
 hagen's results, and nothing further was done till Thalén
took up the work. Tresca's comparisons had obtained for
 the length of the Upsala metre at 0° 999.81 millim. But
the very exact experiments of M. Lindhagen have shown the
above to be somewhat too small, and that the correct value
is 999-94. This difference makes, of course, a marked error
in the wave-lengths based on Tresca's results. Applying the
appropriate correction, the wave-length of E, the line most
carefully determined by Angström, becomes
                             5269.80,
instead of the original
                             5269-12.

250                    Mr. Louis Bell on the Absolute
    This final result of Angström is certainly entitled to con
siderable respect, and seems to be subject only to those
corrections which may be due to irregularities in the gratings.
These were, however, so poor compared with the gratings of
today that such corrections would necessarily be .# uncertain
magnitude.
      t all events it is quite sure that, of the wave-length deter
minations made up to 1880, those of Peirce, and Angström
corrected by Thalén, are by all odds the best. Of the two
Peirce's is probably the better, by reason of better gratings;
but his : will be discussed in another part of this paper in
connexion with the very recent works of Müller and Kempf
and Kurlbaum, which merit more extended study than would
be in place at this point.
    A tolerably complete bibliography of the subject up to date
is annexed. Many of the papers are of little except historical
value ; but they will at least exhibit the various methods
employed, and the growth of exact experimentation.

    In general the determination of absolute wave-length in
 volves two quite distinct problems: first, the precise deter
 mination of some quantity which is an exact function of the
 wave-length and some other linear dimension; and, second,
 the reduction of this dimension to terms of some recognized
 standard of length. The first process can be made to give
  relative wave-lengths with a very high degree of accuracy,
  and is in nearly every case more exact than the second, which
  constitutes the main difficulty of the investigation. It is
 because the diffraction-grating lends itself readily to linear

252              Mr. Louis Bell on the Absolute
measurement that its use is preferable to the other interference
methods, which involve usually the exact determination of a
single very small linear quantity. The ingenious attempt of
M. de Lépinay” to avoid this difficulty is interesting theoreti
cally, but practically it involves a quantity even more uncer
tain than the average standard of length (the relation between
the kilogramme and the metre), to say nothing of the experi
mental difficulties of the method. The angular measurements
of nearly all the later investigators have been quite good
enough to furnish very exact values of wave-length; but in
every case it has been the measurement of the grating-space
that has produced the manifold errors and discrepancies in the
results. It has been the aim of the present research to inves
tigate this fruitful source of errors, and, as far as possible, to
avoid the difficulties springing from it.
   In a previous papert I briefly discussed the advantages of
transmission- and reflexion-gratings. It only remains to add
that further experience has convinced me that, not only are
speculum-metal gratings far superior in brilliancy and           :
ness of definition, but that it is possible, contrary to what one
might suppose from their large coefficient of expansion, to
rule them with almost perfect uniformity over a length as
great as a decimetre. T# large size, too, gives a great ad
vantage in determining the grating-space; apart from the fact
that speculum-metal has a coefficient of expansion not widely
different from that of any one of the materials usually employed
for standards of length, and that its temperature can be ob
tained with comparative ease.
                     Methods and Instruments.
   The plane-grating can be used for wave-length measure
ment in a variety of ways, according to the preference of the
investigator or the arrangement of the spectrometer. Five
tolerably distinct methods may be enumerated. The general
relation between the wave-length and the angles of incidence
and diffraction is
                 x=s (sin i+ sin (4–0): 5
where x is the wave-length, s the grating-space, i and q, the
angles of incidence and diffraction respectively, and n the
' of the spectrum           observed. Making i=0°, this at once

                      Wave-length of Light.                     253
becomes the ordinary formula                      -
                                 1    .
                            X=   #ssin #,
which applies to the two methods of normal incidence; one
in which the grating is kept accurately perpendicular to the
collimator, the other in which it is kept perpendicular to the
observing-telescope.
   Next is the method used by Angström, in which i is not
reduced exactly to 0°, but measured and retained in the
formula, the grating in this case being kept nearly perpen
dicular to the collimator. In this method a reading on the
slit is necessary; and if x and 2' are the readings on the circle,
and M that on the slit, the working formulae are:
                *+*
                  2      M-
                      –M=8         and 2-2   ===4;-4.
then, if i is, as before, the angle of incidence,
                      X=    '. sin b cos (i+8),
                       sin i = sin (i+8) cos b,

                             = 1-cos    bp *
    In the fourth method also i is retained, but given a definite
value. Putting the general formula in the form

                    x=#2ssin'cos(          –#)  2/?
 the deviation represented by the angular term will evidently
 be a minimum when i= 2 :            If, then, one observes in the
 position of minimum deviation,
                               1-     .
                          X=   n 2s sin q,
                                         2.
    In the fifth method, collimator and observing-telescope are
 kept at a fixed angle with each other and the      £     is turned.
 In this case, if p is the angle of deviation, and 6 the angle
 between the telescopes,                      -
                                   -        6
                       X = n 2s sin b cos;
    These methods are general, and the choice between them is
 simply a question of #. convenient application of the appa
  ratus at hand. Probably the first and second methods are

254              Mr. Louis Bell on the Absolute
the most generally useful, while the third is the most objec
tionable. The method of minimum deviation slightly increases
the experimental difficulties, but often improves the definition
of the gratings, and is capable of giving very exact results.
The last method is applicable only when the spectrometer is
so rigid as to ensure ' permanence of the angle between
the telescopes. When this condition is fulfilled, however, the
method is very valuable, since it reduces the moving mass to
a minimum and allows the method of repetition to be readily
used.
   In the present research, for the work with glass gratings,
the second method was selected as best suited to the arrange
ment of the spectrometer. This was a very good instrument
by Meyerstein. The circle is 32 centim. in diameter, divided
on silver to 6', and reading by two microscopes directly to 2'
and by estimation easily to within 1". The collimating- and
observing-telescopes are of 4 centim. clear aperture and about
35 centim. focal length, well corrected and firmly supported.
    For the second part of the work, with speculum-metal
gratings, it was desirable to use gratings of the largest size
practicable, far larger than could be used on the above
described instrument, both by reason of the small aperture of
 the telescope and the inability of the grating-holder to carry
 the requisite mass steadily. This part of the work was there
 fore carried out on a very large instrument, designed by Prof.
 Rowland especially for using gratings of the largest sizes as
 yet ruled. This instrument has virtually fixed telescopes,
 solidly clamped, with a small lateral range of adjustment, to
 a T-shaped casting bedded in cement, which in turn forms the
 top of a large brick pier resting on a stone slab.
    The telescopes are of 16.4 centim. clear aperture and about
 2.5 metres focal length, and the objectives are of excellent
 quality. Each telescope is fastened to an arm of the T, which
 has a total length of over 2 metres, and bears at the extremity
 of the shaft the spectrometer proper. This is an instrument
 by Schmidt and Haensch, having a circle 32 centim. in
 diameter divided to 6', and, as in the other spectrometer,
 reading by two microscopes directly to 2", and by estimation
 to less than half that amount. The original central platform
 had been removed and replaced by a grating-holder large
 enough to carry, if necessary, a 6-inch grating. Such an
 apparatus limits one, of course, to the fifth method; but so
 rigid is the whole affair, that experience soon showed that the
 angle between the telescopes did not change by any appre
 ciable amount. The circle, however, was not finely enough
  graduated, nor were the microscopes of sufficient power to

                       Wave-length of Light.                 255
derive the fullest benefit from the size of the telescopes; over
and over again has the line in the spectrum appeared slightly
displaced from the crosshairs, when no difference whatever
could be detected in the micrometer-readings. However,
there was gained the great advantage of using gratings of a
decimetre in length, giving spectra of great brilliancy and
superb definition, and which could be measured with vastly
greater exactness than is possible with the small gratings
generally employed.
                             Gratings.
    Four gratings have been used in my experiments—two of
glass ' of speculum metal. The former are probably
the best of the very few glass gratings that have been ruled
on Prof. Rowland’s engine. They are ruled on plane sextant
mirrors of rather hard glass.
    Grating I. contains 12,100 spaces in a length of very nearly
thirty millimetres, the lines being nineteen millimetres long.
 It was ruled in Jan. 1884, at a temperature of 6°7 C.; gives
 spectra of excellent definition, quite free from ghosts or false
 lines, and having almost exactly the same focus on both sides
of the normal.
    Grating II. has 8600 spaces, with almost exactly the same
 length and breadth as I., is free from ghosts and false lines,
 and, like I., is very smoothly ruled, though it is somewhat
 inferior to I. in the matter of regularity. The definition is
 excellent, and the spectra alike in focus on both sides of the
 normal.     It was ruled in Nov. 1884 at 11°6 C.
     Gratings III. and IV. are on speculum metal. The plates
 are five inches square and five eighths of an inch thick, and
 were worked plane with especial care. The ruled surface is
 of the same size in each, four inches long by two inches
 length of lines.
       rating III. was ruled in April 1885, at a very nearly con
 stant temperature of 10°C. It contains 29,000 spaces, having
 very nearly the same grating-space as II. It is a pheno
  menal grating both in its superb definition and extraordinary
  regularity of ruling, and was selected from a large number
  because of its very unusual perfection. The focus of the
  spectra on each side of the normal is the same, and the ruling
 is flawless.
     Grating IV. was ruled on the new dividing-engine just
  completed by Prof. Rowland, and was one of the first large
  ones completed. Although the new engine has even now not
  received the finishing touches, it has turned out a few gratings
  of remarkable excellence. One of these is IV., which was

 256                Mr. Louis Bell on the Absolute
 ruled in Dec. 1887, at a constant temperature of 17°2 C. It
 contains 40,000 spaces within the same dimensions as III., is
 ''     to it in definition, and but very little inferior in regularity
 of ruling. It has very nearly the same focus on both sides
 of the normal, and the ruling is wonderfully even and perfect.
    It should be noted that these four gratings are widely
 diverse, being ruled at different temperatures and under
 different conditions.      I. and II. were ruled to widely diverse
 grating-spaces on different parts of the screw ; III. was on
 speculum metal and with more than six times the ruled sur
 face of I. or II.; and finally IV. was ruled to a new grating
 space on a new dividing-engine. These differences may not
 favour close agreement in the experimental results, but they
 certainly serve to eliminate anything like systematic errors
 due to the gratings.
    The above gives a general view of the gratings employed;
 but some further details will be mentioned in the second part
 of this paper in connexion with the determination of the
 grating-spaces.
                     On the Standards of Length.
    Very many of the discrepancies in the determinations of
 absolute wave-lengths are the direct result of uncertainty in
 the standard of length employed. The cases of Angström
 and Van der Willigen have been already alluded to; and the
 same source of error is common to all other determinations.
 It seems, therefore, desirable to give at some length the
 various comparisons on which the wave-length as given by
 my experiments is based. Reserving for the present the
 actual measurement of the gratings, which is a compara
 tively simple matter, I will therefore discuss the standards
directly employed, their relations to the Mètre des Archives
as found by various comparisons, and finally the changes
which have taken place in those relations since they were
first determined.
   The standards with which the gratings have been directl
compared are two double decimetres on speculum                  £,
designated respectively Sei and Sea. They were              £
and compared by Prof. W. A. Rogers in 1885. The bar S1
is 23 cm. long, and bears near its edge the double decimeter
Sel, subdivided to centimetres. The defining lines are less
than 1 u in width and beautifully sharp and distinct. S2 is
27 cm. long, and is graduated in the same way, with lines of
the same width. Both standards are of the same speculum
metal, and are of very nearly the same mass, while the
surfaces and graduation leave little to be desired. The

                     Wave-length of Light.                  257
coefficient of expansion of these bars was very thoroughly
investigated by Prof. Rogers, and was found to be
               17.946 u per metre per degree C.
   The absolute lengths of S*, and S", depend on long series
of comparisons with Prof. Rogers's bronze yard and metre R,
and steel copies thereof. Upon the relation existing between
R2 and the Mètre des Archives depends, then, the absolute
value assigned to the wave-length of light, since the close
agreement of the various series of comparisons executed by
Prof. Rogers between R2 and the speculum-metal standards
show that no sensible uncertainty exists in the relations
between them.
   The yard and metre R2 is of the alloy known as Bailey’s
metal, this being the material of the Imperial Yard and many
other standards. The graduations are upon platinum-iridium
plugs, the polished faces of which are in the plane of one sur
face of the bar when supported at its neutral points. The
relation of the metre R2 to the Mètres des Archives rests on
a very large number of comparisons made with two entirely
independent secondary standards; the copper metre desig
nated T, and the brass yard and metre designated C.S. A
full account of these comparisons is contained in vol. xviii. of
the Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences.
   The metre T is on platinum plugs in a pure copper bar
and was traced and compared by M. £, in 1880, from the
Conservatoire line-metre No. 19, the relation of which to the
Mètre des Archives was very exactly known.
   The yard and metre C.S. has its graduations on silver
plugs in a brass bar. The yard was compared directly with
the Imperial Yard in 1880, and the standard was then sent
to Breteuil, where it was compared with the International
Metre by Dr. Pernet.
   There were thus two completely independent sources from
which the relation of R2 to the Mètre des Archives could be
obtained. The results derived by very elaborate comparisons
with each of these were as follows:–
           From T     R2-Ao=
           From C.S.  #-A     = ++ 1.5u U. 1:0.1:
                                   1-1/. at 16°.67 C.,
where A9 is the Mètre des Archives.         In addition to the
very close agreement of the above, further evidence was ob
tained by deriving the relation between the yard and metre
from R2, the yard R2 having been exactly determined by

258              Mr. Louis Bell on the Absolute
comparisons with C.S. and with “Bronze 11,” one of the
primary copies of the Imperial Yard, which had been recoin
pared with that standard in 1878.
   From the comparisons of Si and S. made in 1885 the
following values of those standards were deduced:–
                   S*1+0.98a =#A0, and
                   S*2+0.2u =#A9.
Hence              S*=S*, +0.78u;
and for the first decimetre were found the relations:—
                   DmiS"1 +0.05u=To Ao,
                   DmiS",—0.01u = 'o'Ao,
Whence            DmiS", = DmiS*1+0.06p.
   On these equations were based the results embodied in my
former paper. In the latter part of May 1887, these stan
dards were very carefully compared with each other, and with
a speculum-metal bar graduated by Prof. Rowland, as I
desired to take one or more of the standards to Berlin  '
the summer in order to get a comparison with the standar
 used by Müller and Kempf.
   The results of this examination were of a somewhat startling
 character, as follows:–
                      S*2 =S*, +1-2a, direct,
                      S*=S*, +1.1", through the Rowland bar
 designated Rp. Also,
              DmiS", = DmiS"1+1:7a, through Rp.
    In 1885 Rogers had found for the relation between the two
 decimetres of each bar:—
                    Dm3S*1 = DmiS*1–0:56a,
                     DmiS", = Dm3S*, +0.46a.
    I now found for the same quantities:—
               Dm3S", = DmiS", +0.64", direct,
               Dm3S"1=DmiS"1+0.60a, from Rn,
               DmiS", = Dm3S*, +1.60", direct,
               DmiS", = Dm,S*, + 1.65u, from Ra.
 All these relations being for 16°.67 C.
    The standard S*, was taken to Berlin during the summer;
 and through the kindness of Dr. Nieberding, Director of the
  Normal Aichungs Commission, I was enabled to have it com
 pared with Rts, the standard metre to which the wave-length

                      Wave-length of Light.                  259
measurements of Müller and Kempf, and Kaulbaum had
been referred. From this comparison was derived the rela
tion:
                  S*—1.68w(+0.15u)=#A9.
   On returning to Baltimore, the first step was to rede
termine the length of Sag. A series of comparisons was there
fore instituted between it and the steel yard and metre A4,
the relation of which to R, was accurately known, A, havin
been traced and determined by Prof. Rogers, and furnish
by him to the Johns Hopkins University. Only half of this
standard is subdivided to decimetres; but a series of compari
sons with the various pairs of decimetres gave the relation
                         S*2+ 1 3/w=#A0.
   This result taken together with the relations found between
S" and S" made it tolerably clear that a change had taken
place in the speculum-metal standards; and to obtain a
further confirmation, Prof. Rogers kindly consented to give
them a rigid examination and again compare them with
all attainable accuracy to R2. His results for S*, were as
follows:—
                    DmiS", Dm3S", + 1.70),
                            :
                         S"2+ 1-0u = #A0.
   There is no escape from the conclusion, therefore, that the
speculum-metal bars S1 and S2 have changed both in absolute
 length and the relative lengths of their parts. Here are two
 bars of the same shape, mass, material, and constant of ex
 pansion. Each had the relation between its halves deter
 mined in the early part of 1885. Two years later these
 relations are found to have changed by at least 1a; and an inde
 pendent determination by the original observer confirms this
 result in the most unequivocal way. Further, the original
 observer recompares one of these standards with the standard
 from which it was originally determined, and finds a change
 of 19.
    It should be borne in mind that with the comparator used
 by me in this work, 1" is completely outside of any possible
 errors of observation. The microscope used was especially
 made for micrometric work, and has a power of two hundred
 and fifty diameters, while one division of the micrometer
 equals 0.28a. The average error of a single comparison
 between two decimetres is rarely greater than 0.1", while the
 temperature of the observing vault can be kept for several
 days constant within 0°5 C., and during a day's observations

260              Mr. Louis Bell on the Absolute
usually remained constant within half that amount. The
bars under comparison were side by side, symmetrically
placed with reference to the illumination, and were at tem
peratures very near to 16°67, at which they were standard.
   The facts, then, concerning the speculum-metal bars are
these :—In about two and a     £ years S", has shortened by
very nearly 1-0u and S", by a little over that amount. In
S", this change has taken place exclusively in the last deci
metre, and in S", it has been confined to the first decimetre.
   The apparent slight increase in DmiS", and Dm3S"I I do
not regard as beyond the effect of the experimental errors.
The changes in the lengths of the subdivisions of these
standards are very curious, and some explanation may be
offered by the fact that the bars were cast in a nearly vertical
position and annealed in sawdust, a method hardly sufficient
for a material so strongly crystalline as speculum metal. I
think, however, one is justified in drawing the conclusion
that speculum metal, so tempting on account of its beautiful
surface and the exquisite sharpness of the graduations drawn
upon it, is a material thoroughly unsuitable for standards of
length by reason of its tendency to change with time. I have
thus entered into somewhat minute details in the case of
these bars, because the whole question of changes in standards
of length is in a somewhat unsettled state, and it seems
desirable to put on record this case, which has been investi
gated with more than     '         care by both Prof. Rogers
and myself, and in which the changes found have taken      £
within a comparatively short time.
   It is quite well known that in 1855 this question was
raised by Mr. Sheepshanks, then engaged in constructing
the new British standards. Discrepancies amounting some
times to 2 or 3u appeared in his measurements; but after a
considerable amount of study, these differences appeared to
be too irregular to be fairly ascribable to actual changes.
Slight variations of temperature, especially when the standards
compared were of different materials, the lagging of the real
temperatures of the bars behind the thermometer indications,
and particularly the effect of coarse and sometimes unsym
metrical defining lines, are perhaps enough to account for the
observation.
   The work, however, done on the U.S. bar “Bronze 11,”
as reported in the report of the Coast Survey for 1877, seems
to show genuine change in that standard.
   A long series of comparisons with the Imperial Yard and
its copies in 1878, showed systematically a shortening relative
to the Imperial Yard of over 4a. Although further measure

                       Ware-length of Light.                 261
ments have tended to somewhat lessen this discrepancy,
it seems to be sufficient, considering the fact that “No. 11”
and the Imperial Yard are of the same shape, material, and
mass, and were compared on the same apparatus as durin
the original comparisons in 1857, and at nearly the standar
temperature, to establish the fact of a real change. While 3
or 4% is absolutely a small quantity, its systematic appear
ance under conditions almost identical with those of the
original measurement can hardly be ascribed to experimental
errors. The other cases cited in the above-mentioned paper
tend to confirm this conclusion.
   The gradual and sometimes very irregular changes that are
known to take place in both the bulbs and stems of thermo
meters would lead one to expect that glass standards of length
would be liable to similar changes, though probably far less
in amount. It was, therefore, with s '' interest that I
examined glass Decimetres III. and IV. belonging to the
Coast Survey, and used by Peirce in his wave-length measure
ments. These scales are on plate glass, of the same dimen
sions, and having coefficients of expansion not widely different.
A series of comparisons made at a nearly constant temperature
of 16° 5 C. gave the direct relation
                        III. = IV. + 2 1/w.
While the same relation deduced from Peirce's direct com
parison, by applying the coefficients of expansion assigned by
him, is
                        III. =IV. +1.3a.
The defining-lines on both standards are fine and sharp; and
unless Peirce's coefficients are grossly in error, the evidence
of change between 1879 and 1887 is very strong indeed.
   Having now the exact present relation of S", to the original
standard R, it £ only to investigate the difference
between this result and the length of S", as deduced from the
Berlin comparisons. I have been unable to obtain the details
concerning R78, the standard used in these comparisons, but
it was determined by comparison with the standard metre of
the International Bureau. The comparisons of S", with Ris
were carefully made by two observers, and it is probable that
 the result represents the relation between these standards with
 considerable exactness. It should, however, be borne in mind
 that the microscopes had each a power of only 50 diameters,
and that the bars in question are of very different material and
mass, thus giving a chance for small errors due to varying
temperature.

262         On the Absolute Wave-length of Light.
  It is possible, however, to check this result by referring
S", to the Berlin platinum standard through the medium of
the Coast Survey metre “No. 49.” This latter standard was
compared in 1876 with metre 1605 and directly with the
platinum metre. The details are given in Prof. Foerster's
report contained in the Report of the Coast Survey for 1876.
The result of the direct comparison was
                      Pl—“49”= +24.4/.
  But now Prof. Rogers has compared R, with “49,” ob
taining in terms of the assumed length of R2
                        “49”=A–19.3a;
the assumed value of R2 was
                          R2 = A + 1 3/w.
Hence we have
                       R2-'49”=20:6a,
from which follows
                          Pl-R2 =3.8a.
If now the equation between Pl and the Mètre des Archives
established by direct comparison in 1860 be correct,
                        Ao-Pl- -3.01u.
And therefore
                        R2-A0= -0.8w,
a result which is in close accordance with those derived from
the Conservatoire metre and Type I. of the International
Bureau by means of the Standards T. and C.S.
   In my final determination of wave-length, I have used the
mean value of S", as derived by the foregoing methods.

Giving to the equations derived from C.S. and Ras twice the
weight of the others, we have finally,
                         S", +0".27++A9.
   I have given the relations derived from C.S. and RTs double
weight because these standards have been compared directly
with the standard of the International Bureau, which now,
probably, should be regarded as the ultimate standard of

        Height, Length, and Velocity of Ocean Waves.             263
reference. Especially is this true, since it is rumoured, appa
rently not without foundation, that the Mètre des Archives
is at present, for some unassigned reason, undesirable as a
direct standard of reference.
   It is unfortunate that there is not more general uniformity
in the material, shape, and mass of standards of length.
Difference in these particulars are fruitful sources of error in
comparisons, and when one adds to this the trouble arising
from bad defining-lines and imperfect focus, the wonder is
that the results are as good as they usually are. It is hard
to say what material is least liable to changes, but it is quite
certain that substances of crystalline structure, and alloys of
which the physical properties are largely dependent on a
nearly definite composition, should be avoided. Probably
pure platinum, silver, and copper, annealed with the utmost
care, and kept for some years before final graduation, are less
likely to change than any other material which we know.
For short standards, possibly bars of native copper, prepared
with as few strains as possible, would give the closest possible
approximation to a material which has arrived at a permanent
state.

 XXXI. Observations on the Height, Length, and Velocity of
    Ocean Waves. By Hon. RALPH ABERCROMBY, F. R. Met.
    Soc.”
     HE interest in ocean waves has so much declined in recent
       years, that physicists have perhaps scarcely realized how
 much more easily measurements can be taken now than
 formerly.
    In the old days wave-heights could only be ascertained, more
 or less, by estimation; while the length and speed could only
 be determined by a common watch. N'' s the aneroid
 can easily measure small vertical heights to ' one or two
 feet; while the fly-back chronograph enables time to be
 measured to the #th second, without taking the eye for one
 moment off the object to be watched.
    The following observations were taken on board the S.S.
 ‘Tongariro, in various parts of the S. Pacific between New
 Zealand and Cape Horn, in the month of June 1885.
    Height was measured by a 44-inch aneroid with a very
    * Communicated by the Physical Society: read February 25, 1888.
                                 T2

264         Hon. Ralph Abercromby on the Height,
open scale, divided to the Tboth inch ; so that the readings
could be taken at a glance to 0.025 inch, or, when time
allowed, to 0.020. The instrument is an extremely good and
accurate barometer.    The altitudes were all calculated on the
simple assumption that a difference of 1 foot in height is given
by a difference of 0.001 inch of pressure. Any error which
could arise between this reduction and that by a more rigorous
method would be far less than the other errors of observation.
   So far the observation was simple enough; but the great
difficulty arose when the height of the eye above the sea-level,
at the moment of observation, had to be estimated.            For
instance, when the barometer was at its lowest point the sur
face of the water might be 10 feet below the eye; but when
the crest of the wave rushed past, the height might be reduced
to 1 or 2 feet. Here I had to trust to my own estimation by
eye, aided by a few rough measurements with a piece of string
down the ship's side. The principal uncertainty of the results
depends on errors of this estimation. I do not think that the
aneroid errors would ever be more than 2 or 2.5 feet, while
those of estimation might be at least 2 feet either way.
   Length and velocity were determined by standing in a
suitable position with a chronograph, and measuring (1) the
interval between the time when two successive crests reached
the stern, and (2) the time that the crest of the first wave took
to run the length of the ship. Then the length of the ship,
her speed, and course relative to the direction of the wave's
progress being known, the velocity and length of wave could
be readily calculated by the following formulae:—
   Let t = time from crest to crest, in seconds;
        T= time of first crest running the length of the ship,
             in seconds;
        l = length of wave, in miles;
       v = velocity of wave, in miles per hour;
       k = speed of ship, in miles per hour;
       L = length of ship, in fractions of a mile;
       6 = angle between course of ship and direction of wave
            progress.
Then, for a following sea,
                   v=L   coso.'" + k cos 6;
                   l=(v–k cos 6) * in miles,
                                   t
                    =(v-k cos 6) 3600 * 5280, in feet.

               Length, and Velocity of Ocean Waves.              265
   The calculations were made with sufficient accuracy by
means of a slide-rule.
   It is manifest that it is only possible to obtain an approxi
mation to any of the desired data. Standing near the stern
it is not easy to observe the precise moment when the crest
reaches the bow; two successive waves rarely run in exactly
the same direction; and, with a heavy following sea, the ship
yaws about so much that the angle between her course and
that of the waves can only be estimated approximatively.
   I found great advantage in using cards for the original
records, as observations must often be made in rain, sleet,
spindrift, and frequently at temperatures near the freezing
point, when the fingers are apt to get benumbed.
   The following are some of my most interesting results :
   June 8, 1885, lat. 47° S., long, 175° W.—Sea too irregular
to measure individual wave-heights or lengths, but the baro
meter indicated about 12.5 feet for the vertical motion of the
point of observation below decks. Then, pretty constantly,
the surface of the sea was about 7 feet below the port-hole in
the troughs, but only 1 foot at the crest. This would give the
waves an average height of about 18.5 feet.
   The velocity of the waves could be got much better. Five
observations gave the accordant speeds of 29, 28, 31, 33, and
30 miles an hour, or an average of 30.2 miles.
    The following data were used in the calculation —Ship,
length 380 feet; course S.E.; Speed 14 knots. Sea running
to S.S.E., and therefore following.
   June 10, 1885. Lat. 51° S., long. 160° W., Height—I
 found it impossible single-handed to estimate the height of
 the water at the moment the aneroid was read, so I took a
constant difference of 6 feet for the difference of the height of
the eye at trough and crest. The following is an example of
the readings:

   These waves were not consecutive, and the difference be
tween the extreme heights is a good deal larger than the

 266           Hon. Ralph Abercromby on the Height,
 height of any single undulation. The highest reading of the
 series (not given     £       was 28-99, the lowest 28:955, which
 would give a difference in height of 35 feet.
    The  £         and velocity were measured on deck just before
 the heights, under the following conditions:
    Ship: length 380 feet, course E.S.E., speed 14 knots. Sea
 "'         to S.E., and therefore following.

   This sea would have been logged as 6 or 7 on the ordinary
scale of 0-8. The wind was blowing a moderate to hard gale
from N.W. with heavy squalls, and was logged 7 on Beau
fort's scale of 0–12. During some of the squalis, with thunder
and lightning, the force rose to 8; and though the ship was
never nearly pooped, we managed to split a topsail. I think
this might be taken as a fair average sea in the S. Pacific.
The waves were far too irregular to allow of any attempt
being made to determine the ratio of height to length or
velocity.

    This was the heaviest sea we encountered during the whole
voyage. The wind was blowing a hard gale from S.W., with
 squalls of hail and sleet. The sea was certainly high, but did
not appear excessively so to the eye. The ship broached to
 and lay in the trough of the sea for nearly half an hour while
 a gland in the engine-room was being£ ; but no harm
 was done beyond splitting a topsail. The ship rolled tremen
 dously, but no seas swept over her.
    Under these circumstances the height of 46 feet,        £    by
 one set of observations, seems excessive. The actual vertical
 lift of the cabin was undoubtedly 40 feet; for, as I noticed it
 at the time, there is not a mistake in the records. Any error
 in the true height must come from the estimate of 6 feet for
 the difference of the height of the eye on the crest and in the
 trough.
    £ill be       noticed that the relation of length and velocity
 to height is very irregular; but this is due to the character
 of the waves, and not to errors of observation. On all the
 days the waves were running irregularly. We never saw
 crests nearly a mile long chasing one another with a well
 defined trough between them; but the seas were so confused,
 that sometimes after one big crest nothing followed but some
 small waves. There was nothing to call a cross sea; but
 there were many series of waves of different lengths running
 pretty much in the same direction, which were constantly
 interfering with one another. An eye estimate of height is
 always delusive, but I was surprised that the waves measured
 as much as they did. I have seen a heavier sea in the Atlantic;
 so that if we take only 40 feet as the highest of this series, it
 is perfectly certain that much greater heights are sometimes
 attained.
     Fitzroy says that, even during many years spent at sea, a

268          Height, Length, and Velocity of Ocean Waves.
man only observes really high waves once or twice during a
lifetime; and this view is confirmed by every sailor I have
conversed with. Taking my own measurements as repre
senting only ordinary seas, I am certain that 60 feet at least
from trough to crest must be attained by exceptional waves.
    It may be interesting to compare the results given here
with those obtained by other observers. The following figures,
except those in the last line, are taken from Dr. Krummel’s

    It is manifest, from an inspection of the above table, that
the discrepancies are enormous. I cannot but think that the
extreme lengths recorded by Admiral Molter and Captain
 Ross must have not allowed for the interference of following
waves. No doubt such lengths might be observed between
two notable crests, but most          F'            there would be some
 smaller undulation between.          I never took the time between
two crests unless they manifestly belonged to a simple wave.
    The three sets of observations before noticed were taken on
the only three days on which at all big waves were met with.
 They serve to show the difficulties of wave-measurement;
 but the greatest obstacle is the uncertainty of meeting first
class specimens. If ever a wave-measuring party should be
organized, I think it should be arranged as follows.
    Three observers, A, B, and C, would be necessary. A would
command the party, say when the instruments were to be
observed, note personally the height of the deck from the
water, and enter all the readings on a suitable card. B would
have a suitable aneroid, and confine his whole attention to
that instrument.         C would be furnished with two chrono
graphs.
    W',        a crest touched the stern of the ship, A would give

a signal, on which B would read his aneroid, while C started
both his chronographs. A would first note the height of the
deck by marks on the ship's side; and, if need be, read a
simple clinometer to allow for the roll of the ship before
entering the records of his assistants. When the crest reached
the bow, A would give another signal for C to stop one chro
nograph. In the trough, B would read his aneroid, while A
noted the height of the water; and, finally, as the next crest
came on, B would read his aneroid, C would stop his second
chronograph, while A noted the height of the water and entered
all the records.
   By this means, and with a careful selection of tolerably
undeformed waves, I think that the measurements of undula
tions could be much more satisfactorily obtained than hereto
fore; and I only regret that the means at my disposal did not
enable me to do more towards this important line of research.
                            SUMMARY.
    The results of this paper may be summarized as follows:—
    Several sets of observations between New Zealand and
 Cape Horn, with an aneroid barometer and chronograph, gave
 for the largest waves a height of 46 feet, a length of 765 feet,
 a speed of 47 miles an hour, and a time-period of 16.5 seconds.
    As nothing but the ordinary heavy weather of these lati
 tudes was experienced, it is certain that waves must sometimes
 attain a height of at least 60 feet.
    Really big seas are of very rare occurrence.
    The great discrepancies in the observed elements of waves
 £      by different observers is doubtless due to the varying
  engths of every series of undulations, which therefore always
 make a more or less confused sea.
            XXXII. The Integral Weight of Water.
             By T. STERRY HUNT, LL.D., F.R.S.*
 IN a paper on Chemical Integration, published in the
       American Journal of Science for August 1887, and
 reprinted in the ‘Chemical News’ of September 23 and 30,
 it was said that, in comparing the densities of liquid and solid
 bodies with those of known gaseous species, such as water
 vapour and carbon dioxide, “ or in the last analysis, with the
 density of the hydrogen unit . . . . we get the specific gravity
 of these bodies, the dyad integer of hydrogen at 0° and 760
 millim. (H2=2:0) being unity.” Subsequently, in a paper
                  * Communicated by the Author.

270                The Integral Weight of Water.
 on Integral Weights in Chemistry, in this Magazine for
 October 1837, it was stated that a litre of hydrogen gas “at
0° and 760 millim, being assumed as a unit of volume for
all species, the weight of a litre of any other gas or vapour at
 the standard temperature and pressure is its integral weight.
 In like manner £ integral weight of a liquid species is the
 weight of the same volume at     £                 under a pres
 sure of 760 millim. . . . . . The weights thus obtained for
equal volumes of the various liquid and solid species, as well
as for the gaseous species, are evidently the specific gravities
 of these species; that of hydrogen at the standard temperature
and pressure being unity (H2=2-0). They are at the same
time the integral weights of the species compared.”
    Notwithstanding this clear statement in both papers that it
is hydrogen gas at 0° and 760 millim. which is to serve as the
 unit of specific gravity alike for gaseous, liquid, and solid
species, the reader will find in these papers, and also in the
first edition of the author's ‘New Basis for Chemistry’ (1887),
an error in the subsequent calculations. The problem havin
been approached from the comparison of the weights of        £
volumes of liquid water at 0° and 100°, and of water-vapour
at 100° and 760 millim., by an inadvertence (until now un
perceived) the weights alike of hydrogen gas and of water
vapour at the latter temperature were substituted for their
weights at 0° and 760 millim., thus leading to a grave error
in the figure given for the integral weight of liquid water,
and of bodies for which it serves as the unit of specific gravity,
and making it equal to 29.244. In fact, however, taking as
the unit of weight that of the litre of hydrogen gas at standard
temperature and pressure (0° and 760 millim.), and comparing
it with that of liquid water at 100° (its temperature of forma
tion at 760 millim.), when a litre of it weighs 958.78 grammes,
we have
              0.0896 : 958.78 :: 2 : a = 21400.3.
    This value is, then, alike the specific gravity of the liquid
on the hydrogen basis, and its integral weight, which, if we
take  £       1796, corresponds very closely to 1192 (H,0)=
21408; ice being probably 1094       £      calcite 584 (CCaO.),
and aragonite 630 (CCaO3). While the writer regrets this
error in calculation, made in direct contradiction to the prin
ciples laid down by him in both of the papers cited, it will be
seen that its correction in no way affects their argument,
which he hopes to develop further at an early day.

       XXXIII.     Note on the Electromotive Force in
                       Moving Conductors.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
     GENTLEMEN,
    SHOULD like to be allowed to call the attention of those
     interested in the theory of electrodynamics to the method
of estimating the E.M.F. in moving conductors generally
employed by writers on this subject. The notation I use
will require no explanation, as it is universally adopted.
   In a closed circuit at rest it is known that the E.M.F. is
proportional to the time-variation of the flux of magnetic
induction through the circuit, i.e. across any surface bounded
by the closed circuit, and therefore that it is equal to
                   dF da dG dy, dH d2
               f{' As * II d' " II #} as
taken round the circuit.
   We cannot of course determine from this result with abso
lute certainty the E.M.F. in an unclosed circuit, or in each
element of a closed circuit; but we know that our results will
be consistent with the foregoing if we assume the v component
in each conducting element at rest in a magnetic field to be
and similarly for y and 2.
   If therefore the element were moving in a constant field at
rest, the reasonable assumption would appear to be that the
E.M.F. is
                         _dF_dy.
                            dt    da' '
where the dF in this case is the time-variation of F at the
            dt
 onducting element assumed at rest while the field, otherwise
unaltered, moved, as a whole, with the reversed motion of the
conductor, the relative motion of field and conducting element
being the same, and y (whatever its meaning) being the
same as before; because all our knowledge of motion can
only be relative, and it is impossible to say whether the con
ductor or field is at absolute rest.
   Instead of this, however, it is generally assumed that the r
component of E.M.F. is in this case (moving conductor in
constant field)

viz. if in the above figure the conducting element PQ moves
to pg in time 8t, the total number of tubes of force cut by it
in this time is measured by the flux across the area PQ qp;
and this, divided by 8t, is generally taken to be the measure
of E.M.F. across the moving element PQ; differing from the
#.   as above defined, by the differences of integrals of Fds
along Qq and Pp, i.e. by

                    -               -       -
There is no more reason for assuming the magnetic E.M.F.
to be measured by the total number of tubes of force thus
cut, than by the differences of line-integral of the vector
potential; but it would seem better to assume in both cases
the same means of estimating the E.M.F., and to keep the
same meaning of \r.
   Thus, if Y be regarded as the potential of free electricity
in the one case, it should be so also in the other. It would, I
think, prevent some confusion in the mind of the student.
For instance, with a substance at rest the equations are
                              __ dF dy

XXXIV. Sketch of a Stratigraphical Table, chiefly for Western
   Europe. By JoHN YoUNG, M.D., Professor of Natural
   History and Honyman Gillespie Lecturer on Geology in
    Glasgow University".
Th:       accompanying table is an attempt to apply and extend
       the philosophical principle underlying a remark made
many years ago by Sir '' C. Ramsay, that the Carboniferous
Limestone was an episode in British Geology. I discussed
the matter tentatively in 1876 (Brit. Assoc. Report, Glasgow,
Address to Section C), and now submit a fuller scheme. The
  eology of Western Europe is the record of a border warfare
£ the Atlantic on the one hand and the Europeo
Asiatic continent on the other, the advance and retreat of
ocean and land giving rise to a series of dissolving geo
   aphical views, not one of which can be definitely fixed.
  f ocean and of continent we have little knowledge: of the
debatable line between them our whole geological    £
is made up. The index map of colours published by the
Geological Survey is commonly made the basis of calculations
of geological time, as if every superposed block of colour
represented a distinct epoch. My table is an attempt to
put in new shape the common stock of geological teachers,
that land and sea are contemporaneous, and that a true
narrative should not place all the strata of one region—say,
Western Europe—on the top of each other, but should allow
for the contemporaneous occurrence of sea and land, of thick
and of thin deposits, on the inclined plane from the coast down
to the floor of the adjacent sea. Sir A. C. Ramsay gave to
Mr. Darwin a summary statement of British Geology, from
which it seemed a fair arithmetical inference that the thickness
 of the sedimentary crust is 20 miles. I do not know for
 what purpose that statement was prepared; but I do know
 that it has been used by subsequent writers as if the “onion
 coat theory of the earth’s crust” (to use Herbert Spencer’s
 graphic phrase) were still accepted.      The right-hand side
 of my table is that of the permanent land-area, the left that
 of the permanent Atlantic Ocean. The left column shows
 the successive incursions of the ocean; the right column
 indicates the periods during which elevation carried the land,
in whole or in part, to or towards the present western
 confines of Europe; in the interval are recorded the estuarine
 and fluvio-lacustrine conditions. I need not point out in
 detail how such a table tends to demonstrate that the duration

276          Messrs. Gee and Holden on the Change of
of geological time is not so great as is ordinarily assumed.
There is no reason to believe that the time required for the
deposit of thick strata must be longer, proportionally to the
number of feet, than that required for the deposit of thin.
If the thick strata had been laid down in waters as deep as the
average of the deeper areas of the Atlantic, vast time might
perhaps have been required; but there is no evidence for
such depths having ever been attained to the east of the
present line of 100-fathom soundings off the British Islands.
Even the Carboniferous and Cretaceous Limestones do not
prove the existence of such deep waters; they only show
that at these periods there was long-continued subsidence and
continuous deposit in clear water. Prof. Huxley's homotaxis
is thus applied within the compass of the European area;
and, if the views embodied in this table are correct, the careful
correlation of strata which has given so much occupation to
geologists loses much of its importance. The palaeontological
differences are the variations of inhabitants of adjacent zoo
logical areas on a sea-floor inclining westwards.
XXXV. Experiments on Electrolysis.–Part I. Change of Den
    sity of the Electrolyte at the Electrodes. By W. W. HALDANE
    GEE, B.Sc., Assistant Lecturer in Physics, and H. HoLDEN,
    B.Sc., Bishop Berkeley Fellow in Physics, of the Owens
    College, Manchester".
WH'                studying some electrolytic polarization phe
           nomena with palladium electrodes in dilute pure
sulphuric acid, a liquid was seen, after a reversal of the cur
rent, to flow downwards in streaks from the anode. Not being
able to find any reference to the formation of streaks, for
whose appearance the reversal of the current was necessary,
it was decided to investigate their character. Further, it
was thought that the occluded hydrogen might, on reversal
of the current, unite with the nascent ion liberated at the
anode, and thus effect chemical changes of an interesting
character.
    Some little care in observation and adjustment of the light
   * Communicated by the Physical Society: read February 25, 1888.
  This is the first of a series of papers on Electrolysis and Electrolytic
Polarization, descriptive of experiments made, during last year, at the
Owens College Physical Laboratory. An abstract of the experiments
made, to the end of August 1887, was submited to the British Associa
tion Meeting at Manchester. We desire to acknowledge the assistance
received up to that time from Mr. C. H. Lees, B.Sc., Derby Mathematical
Scholar of the Owens College. His cooperation has since been discon
tinued, owing to absence at Strasburg.

          Density of the Electrolyte at the Electrodes.      277
is necessary in order to see the streaks, which, like the sur
rounding electrolyte, are colourless, and are only visible on
account of the difference between their index of refraction
and that of the main bulk of the electrolyte. A vessel with
parallel sides of good plate-glass was employed, and a mirror
used to reflect light obliquely into the cell. The arrangement
which has been found to be most convenient is shown in the
figure, and consists of a cell made of two pieces of plate-glass
about 15 centim. square. A piece of india-rubber, 25 centim.
long and 3 centim. square section, is bent in a semicircular
form and clamped between the two glass plates by means of
four iron screw-clamps. In this way a water-tight cell, about
1.5 centim. broad, is obtained which may readily be taken to
pieces for the purpose of cleaning. The electrodes have
usually £! of two pieces of palladium, about 0.5 centim.
thick and with a surface of 5 square centim., fastened to
platinum wires and supported by means of a convenient
electrode-holder.
        Streaks obtained in dilute pure Sulphuric Acid.
   The electrodes were first heated to redness in order to drive
out any occluded gas, and then cleaned by means of glass
£        They were then placed, by means of the electrode
 older H, in the electrolytic cell containing dilute pure
sulphuric acid. The current was sent from one electrode (A)
to the other (B), which is thus the kathode, for a certain time
and then reversed. On reversal no gas appears at first from
B, which is now the anode, but streaks resembling a dense
liquid are with careful observation seen flowing downwards
from this electrode. After a time, depending on the size of
the electrodes, the strength of the current, and its duration in

278         Messrs. Gee and Holden on the Change of
the first direction, evolution of gas at B begins, and the
streaks simultaneously cease to be visible. The streaks are to
be seen streaming from one electrode only at a time, and
always descend £ that palladium electrode which first
serves as kathode and then as anode.
   When platinum electrodes are substituted for the palladium
ones, we have not been successful in obtaining the streaks; it
is, however, only necessary that one of the electrodes should
be palladium in order to obtain the streaks.
   An experiment was made in order to ascertain the part
which the reversal of the current plays in the formation of
the streaks. The current was sent in one direction through
the electrolyte, the palladium electrodes then taken out,
washed, and their surface cleaned with glass-paper. On now
reversing the current and replacing the electrodes, the streaks
are quite as evident as if the electrodes had not been taken out.
But if, on taking the electrodes out, they are heated to redness
instead of merely having their surface cleaned, on replacin
them and reversing the current the streaks are not seen, #
gas appears immediately from the anode. We concluded
from this experiment that the function of the current in the
first direction was to fill with hydrogen that electrode at
which the streaks appear in the second direction of the cur
rent; and that the reason why, after a time, the streaks ceased
to be visible, and simultaneously gas began to be evolved at
the anode, was that by this time all the occluded hydrogen
had been used up. It was therefore thought probable that
the streaks were formed by a combination of the occluded
hydrogen with the ion (either SO, or some of its components,
such as oxygen) which is liberated at the anode in the second
direction of the current. The theory that the streaks were
composed of concentrated sulphuric acid seemed open to great
objections; for we know that concentration takes place at the
anode in dilute sulphuric acid without a reversal of the cur
 rent, and also does not depend on the use of palladium elec
 trodes; but the streaks are, as is shown above, only to be
 obtained after a reversal of the current, and are not to be
 obtained with platinum electrodes. It was therefore decided
 to test, as far as practicable, other possible combinations, such
 as hydroxyl (the streaks cannot be composed of water, for
 they are denser than the surrounding electrolyte), a salt of
 palladium, &c.
                       Testing for Hydroxyl.
    The palladium electrodes used were rectangular strips, about
 2 centim. long and 3 centim. broad, placed vertically in 10

             Density of the Electrolyte at the Electrodes.             279
per-cent. sulphuric acid. For the purpose of collecting the
streaks a capillary glass tube had one end blown out into
the shape # a small funnel, and was bent so that it could
be lowered into the electrolyte with the finger pressed on the
upper end, which projected from the cell, until the funnel
part was immediately below the electrode. After a reversal
of the current the funnel part was placed in this way under
the anode, from which the streaks were flowing. The finger
was then removed from the top end of the tube, and the
funnel acted as a reservoir for the denser liquid flowing
from the anode. As soon as gas appeared at the anode the
finger was replaced on the top end of the tube, the latter
being then removed and its contents emptied into a test-tube.
This proceeding was repeated many times (at least fifty), and
the total liquid collected was tested for hydroxyl by the ad
dition of a few drops of a solution of titanic acid in strong
sulphuric acid. No trace of a coloration could be perceived,
and thus the presence of hydroxyl was not proved *.
   * The test, which is a delicate one, has been greatly employed by
Richarz in his experiments on the mode of appearance of hydroxyl at the
anode in sulphuric acid (Wied. Ann. xxxi. p. 912, 1887). He concludes
that the appearance of hydroxyl at the anode is caused by the £
chemical decomposition of the “Ueberschwefelsäure” (Berthelot's S.O.--
H2O), which is first formed there. Traube, Berichte der deut. chem.
Gesell. xviii. p. 3348 (1888) gives the equation for this decomposition as
                   S.O.(O.)H2+2H.0=2H,SO44-H2(O2).
Richarz confirms Berthelot's statement that no hydroxyl is formed at
the platinum anode unless the strength of the acid is above 60 per cent.
As we obtained the streaks in 10-per-cent. acid, the above fact lends
additional strength to the view that the streaks are not hydroxyl. They
  ight consist of H.S.O. (Ueberschwefelsäure), which Berthelot has shown
# a minor secondary product formed during the electrolysis of sulphuric
acid, whether dilute or strong (see Ann. de Chim, et de Phys. xiv. 1878,
and xxi. 1880). The quantity so formed at a platinum anode is small,
and would apparently be still smaller at a palladium anode charged with
hydrogen if the following reasoning be accepted. Let us first consider
the case of an anode uncharged with hydrogen. Assuming that the ion
liberated at the anode is SO, the simplest hypothesis to account for the
secondary reactions is that part of the SOA combines directly with the
H2SO. of the electrolyte to form H2S.O., whilst the remainder of the SO,
'' by            far the greater part) acts on the H2O of the electrolyte,
forming HSO, and liberating 0. Should, however, the anode be charged
with H, the SO, would have an additional tendency to combine directly
with the H, forming HSO. This tendency would probably greatly
exceed the other two, so that if sufficient occluded H be present, it would
be expected that neither O would be liberated, nor H.S.O., formed. It is
known that there is no evolution of O under these conditions; and it
would be interesting to estimate the relative amounts of H.S.O., produced
at a palladium anode when charged and when uncharged with H. The
H2S2O, could be quantitatively determined by the method used by
Richarz (loc. cit. p. 917).

280         Messrs. Gee and Holden on the Change of
                   Testing for Palladium Salts.
   A supply of the liquid having been obtained by a similar
process to the above, a solution of potassium iodide was added
to it, but no evidence of the presence of palladium was obtained.
              Streaks obtained in Phosphoric Acid.
   Similar streaks were obtained in solutions of pure ortho
phosphoric acid by adopting exactly the same procedure as
with sulphuric acid.
            Streaks obtained in Caustic-Soda Solution.
   In this case also streaks were obtained descending from one
 of the electrodes, but the conditions necessary for their appear
 ance are very different to those in the case of sulphuric and
 phosphoric acids. No previous reversal of the current is neces
 sary, and the streaks descend from the kathode immediately
 the current is passed. The gas (hydrogen) formed at the
 kathode is at first absorbed, and the streaks are seen to descend
 as long as the absorption takes place; but, when gas begins
 to be evolved briskly, the streaks disappear. By very careful
 observation it is seen that the liquid of wh: the streaks
 are composed is still formed, but is carried up in the current
 of gas to the surface of the electrolyte, from which it re
 bounds, giving the electrolyte round the kathode the peculiar
 wavy appearance which accompanies the incomplete mixing
 of two liquids of different densities, such as two strengths
 of the same solution.
             Explanation of the Caustic-Soda Streaks.
    This experiment led us to infer that the streaks in the
 a'             solution are composed of concentrated alkali,
 which is known to be formed at the kathode, and that the
 absence of evolution of gas from that electrode is a necessary
 condition for their appearance and steady downward flow.
 The part played by the palladium in the formation of the
 streaks is, according to this theory, that of absorbing the
 hydrogen, which otherwise, in escaping from the electrode,
 would carry the concentrated solution along with it to the
 surface and thus prevent the formation of the streaks.
                 Explanation of Streaks in general.
     Since in acids concentration occurs at the anode, the descend
 ing streaks, if seen at all, should be seen at that electrode.
 But taking sulphuric acid as an instance, oxygen is given off
 at the anode, and the palladium cannot retain it       '#'

           Density of the Electrolyte at the Electrodes.        281
to stop its evolution, and thus the concentrated acid will be
carried up by the current of oxygen and escape observation.
 But if the electrode has been filled with hydrogen by previously
serving as kathode, the evolution of oxygen on reversal of
the current is prevented either by its direct union with the
occluded hydrogen, or by the union of the ion SO, with the hy
drogen. No gas being evolved, the concentrated acid is able to
flow downwards in streaks. This explanation is borne out by
the experiments with sulphuric acid detailed above, in which it
was seen that, on placing freshly-heated palladium electrodes
in sulphuric acid, gas is immediately evolved at the anode :
but if that electrode has been previously filled with hydrogen,
the oxygen, on reversal of the current, does not appear for
some time at the anode, and the streaks are visible during this
period.
   Concentration of the solution at one electrode is accom
panied by a weakening of the solution at the other elec
trode. Therefore, as in acids the weakening takes place
at the kathode (at which the gas is absorbed), we should
expect to see streaks ascending from that electrode without a
previous reversal of the current. On trying the experiment
with palladium electrodes placed horizontally in £ sul
phuric acid, this supposition is found to be warranted. The
reason why the streaks ascending from the kathode were not
seen in our earlier experiments is, that the electrodes had
been placed vertically with their top edges a little below the
surface of the electrolyte, and so the weakened solution in
ascending had naturally clung to the surface of the electrode
and thus escaped detection.
   The late Professor Christiani (in a work" to which we shall
refer more fully in a subsequent paper) gives three instances
in which he observes streaks from      '. electrodes, but does not
offer any explanation of their mode of formation. He cites
the cases of zinc electrodes in concentrated zinc sulphate and
copper electrodes in concentrated '' sulphatef. In these
cases, without a previous reversal, he observed streaks de
scending from the anode and ascending from the kathode
at the same time. These results are evidently in accordance
with the theory proposed above: no gas is given off at either
electrode, and so the concentrated solution is allowed to de
scend in streaks from the anode and ascend in streaks from
the (horizontal) kathode.

282      Change of Density of the Electrolyte at the Electrodes.
    Another confirmation is given by the behaviour of potassium
 sulphate during electrolysis. After a current has been passed
in the same direction through potassium sulphate, it is found,
 on testing with litmus paper or by cautiously adding litmus
solution, that the bottom strata of liquid have become alkaline
and the top strata acid, the solution being originally neutral.
 It follows from this that the alkaline solution produced at the
 kathode is denser than the electrolyte, which itself is denser
 than the acid solution produced at the anode. Therefore,
according to theory, the streaks, if seen at all, should descend
from the kathode and ascend from the anode. This is fully
borne out by experiment. Starting with freshly-heated pal
ladium electrodes, on putting on the current we immediately
 see the streaks descending from the kathode; and after a
reversal of the current other streaks may simultaneously be
detected rising from the anode.                                          -
    The best conditions for seeing the streaks seem to be:—
    (1) a horizontal electrode of small surface*,
    #2) anostrong  current,
            evolution of gas.
    The conditions (2) and (3) are incompatible with the use of
platinum electrodes in dilute sulphuric acid : it is quite pos
sible, however, that even in this case matters might be so
adjusted that some trace of the formation of the streaks could
be detected. In the case of platinum electrodes in solutions
of sulphates of metals which do not act readily on water, such
as zinc, copper, iron, &c., the metal will be deposited and no
gas evolved at the kathode, and thus streaks of the weakened
solution can be seen at that electrodef.
    A direct proof that the streaks were formed of concentrated
acid might £ thought possible, in the case of sulphuric acid,
on consideration of the following circumstances:
    (1) When strong sulphuric acid is dropped into dilute sul
phuric acid, the strong acid sinks to the bottom of the con
taining vessel and remains undiffused for a considerable period.
    (2) # collecting-vessels are placed under the £ and
an arrangement fitted up by which the current may be perio
dically reversed, say every minute, the streaks will be formed
at the electrodes and will stream into the collecting-vessels.
   * A vertical electrode may be used with advan          if it is well below
the surface of the electrolyte and if it is suspended by a horizontal wire,
so that the view of the electrolyte above and below it is not interrupted.
An   angular electrode is very convenient, as the liquid flows most readily
from points.
   f Christiani noted the streaks with platinum electrodes in ferrous
sulphate,

        On a Modified Water-dropping Influence-machine.                283
    (3) If we now titrate with standard caustic-soda solution
    ual volumes of the liquid in the collecting-vessels and of the
main bulk of the electrolyte, we ought to find that the former
is the more acid.
    It may, however, be noticed that, assuming the streaks were
not concentrated acid, we should collect by this arrangement,
not only the streaks, but also some of the concentrated acid
which is formed at the anode. Thus, even if the acid in the
collecting-vessels did become stronger, it would scarcely prove
that the streaks were the cause of this".
    From the experiments detailed above, though direct proofs
are apparently not available, we may draw the following general
conclusions:—That when gas is not evolved at an electrode,
streaks are formed there.        These are due either to a concen
tration or weakening of the electrolyte, as in the case of
 solutions of acids and alkalies and some salts (such as zinc
sulphate); or, in the case of other salts (such as potassium
 sulphate), to a chemical change in the electrolyte, yielding at
one pole alkali and at the other pole acid, producing solutions
of different density to the electrolyte. When gas is not
 evolved at an electrode these changes are still produced, but
their effect in producing streaks is destroyed by the evolution
 of the gas.
     In our next paper we hope to describe some experiments in
 which these effects become of great importance in changing
 the resistance of the electrolyte.
   XXXVI. On a Modified Water-dropping Influence-machine.
            By Professor SILVANUs P. THOMPsoN, D.Sc.f
       HE ordinary form of water-dropping influence-machine,
          as devised by Sir William Thomson #, possesses some
 inconveniences: it requires a double jet of water and special
 arrangements for high insulation. A simpler form, requiring
 but one water-jet and mere silk strings (well paraffined) as
 insulators, has been found by the author to give far less trouble,
 and to work well for lecture demonstrations.
     * Some observations have been made by this method, but the results
 have not been very definite. We have designed an automatic commu
 tator which will reverse the current at intervals of 15, 30, or 60 seconds.
 This arrangement will enable us to collect more easily the substance
 forming the streaks.

284 On a Modified Water-dropping Influence-machine.
   From a wooden frame are hung by silk strings three simple
metal vessels, the highest and lowest being rigidly con
nected together with a stiff metal wire. The highest is a
small cylinder open at both ends; the lowest is an open pot
which receives the water. The intermediate vessel is open at
           24
the bottom; and is provided at the top with a funnel, the
upper rim of which is soldered inside the lip of the cylinder,
and its depth such that its central aperture is about at the middle
of the cylinder. An insulated wire, recurved as shown, is
carried up clear under the funnel in the middle vessel, and
should touch the drops as they fall below the aperture. The
water-jet, which must have a fine orifice, is inserted about half
£ into the uppermost vessel. A single point of water will
suffice to gather a plentiful charge. To watch the process of
charging two gold-leaf electroscopes may be connected respec
tively to the middle and to the lowest vessels.
   The same arrangement will answer for sand-dropping if a
second, uninsulated funnel to contain the sand be provided
above the topmost cylinder, and arranged with its lower end
entering into the cylinder, so that the jet of sand breaks
away from the orifice at the proper height. As dry sand is a
very bad conductor, the apparatus is found to work with

 metallic powder, such as the finer qualities of Bessemer
bronze.

286      Mr. H. Tomlinson on the Effect of Magnetization
    The data in this table refer to the effects of temporary
magnetization; and in the case of iron, steel, and nickel,
represent only verifications and extensions of the labours of
previous observers. Abraham, Edlund, Mousson, and Wart
mann all made search for magnetic alteration of the resistance
of iron. W. Thomson* seems, however, to have been the first
to arrive at any definite result. He found the resistance to be
increased along the lines of magnetization and decreased
across them. W. Thomson has been followed by Beetzt, Tom
linson #, Chwolson $, Auerbach ||, and De Lucchi".                    These
have all confirmed the results of Thomson so far as longitu
dinal magnetization is concerned; but Beetz failed to obtain
anything but negative results with transverse magnetization,
and attributed the decrease of resistance observed by Thomson
to mere mechanical pull. The author has, however, pointed
out” the improbability of this last supposition. W. Thomson
had also previously proved ff that the electrical resistance of
nickel is increased to a greater extent than that of iron by longi
dinal magnetization; whilst Faé!! has recently verified the
author’s result concerning cobalt. Lastly, GoldhammerSS has
published a comparative study of the three paramagnetic
metals—iron, cobalt, and nickel, and of the three diamagnetic
metals—bismuth, antimony, and tellurium ||.
    There are several points in the table given above to which
it is desirable to direct attention. In the first place the resist
ance of all the metals is increased by longitudinal magnetization.
In the second it by no means always follows that the metals
which possess the greatest magnetic susceptibility are those
which are most affected in their conductivity by a given
amount of magnetizing-stress. We see, for instance, from
the third and fourth columns, that whilst the value of              #.    for
nickel is twice that for iron, the magnetic susceptili: of
iron is between three and four times as great as that of nickel.
It is, however, when we come to consider the fifth column
that we meet with the most remarkable differences in the

effects of magnetization. The numbers in this column re
present the increase of resistance per unit which would be
produced in each of the metals by magnetizing them to
such an extent that each cubic centimetre would possess
unit magnetic moment. The effect of the magnetization in
this case would be nearly twice as great for cobalt as for iron,
twelve times as great for nickel as for iron, and, speaking
very roughly, two thousand times as great for bismuth as for
iron. Startling as this last result is, it sinks into insignifi
cance when contrasted with the results obtained by other
observers. The effect of magnetization on the electrical
resistance of bismuth is largely influenced, amongst other
things, by the amount of impurity in the metal and the mag
nitude of the magretizing force. Thus, from Ettingshausen’s
researches, from which Table II. has been compiled, we learn
that the value of     #  f

288 Mr. H. Tomlinson on the Effect of Magnetization
Provided that the susceptibility of bismuth be the same for
very high magnetizing forces as for low ones, it would follow
that if a bar of pure bismuth could be magnetized to unit
intensity” its resistance would be nearly trebled, whilst the
increase of resistance per unit would be at least 300,000 times
as great as the corresponding change of resistance in iron.
Considerations such as the above render it difficult to believe
that what is observed in bismuth in such experiments as these
is a real change in the specific resistance of the metal; and
even with iron, nickel, and cobalt there seems to be evidence that
the whole of the observed change produced by magnetization
is not produced by mere rotation of the molecules. In the
author's experiments on iron and nickel he found that the
increase of resistance could be very closely represented by the
formula
                          # =&M, M .
         Ar                -                •                •
where r     denotes the increase of resistance per unit, and My
and M, are the magnetizing force and the magnetic intensity
respectively. From this formula it follows that, even if the
magnetizing force were so high that the ratio of increase of
intensity to increase of force was extremely small, the resist
ance would nevertheless go on increasing very perceptibly
indeed with the force.       The values of the coefficient b were
not very different in the two metals nickel and iron; but the
coefficient a in nickel was about five times as great as in iron,
and was nearly double the coefficient b. It would be a matter
of considerable interest to ascertain whether it would really
happen that, when very great magnetizing forces were em
ployed, the resistance of nickel would go on increasing very
perceptibly with the forcef.
    If, however, on the one hand there is a difficulty in con
ceiving how magnetization can so largely affect the true
specific resistance of bismuth, there is also an equal difficulty
in accounting otherwise for what is observed. Hall’s pheno
menon cannot certainly be credited in any of the experiments
which have yet been made with anything but a small fraction
of the whole observed effect.      It is true that bismuth has been
found by Righi and others to have a very large rotational
coefficient as compared with iron, nickel, or cobalt; but
Ettingshausen and Nernst have shown: that whilst, with
   * This would require a magnetizing force of 71,000 C.G.S. units.
  t The magnitudes of the forces used by the author never exceeded
200 C.G.S. units.               1 Loc. cit,

         on the Thermoelectrical Properties of Bismuth.               289
bismuth, antimony, and tellurium, the increase per unit of
resistance produced by a magnetizing force of 7660 C.G.S.
units is 0.20,0:006, and 0-0014 respectively, the corresponding
values of the rotatory power are —4:7, +0.18, and +790.
    Neither, again, can the change of dimensions produced by
magnetization in any of the metals be accountable for the
increase of resistance. For though, curiously enough, loading
an iron wire increases the resistance, and magnetizing it lon
gitudinally increases the length, whilst loading a nickel wire"
decreases the resistance and magnetization decreases the length,
yet, according to Joule and others, when an iron wire is loaded
to a certain extent longitudinal magnetization begins to de
crease the length; whereas the author has shown that, even
when iron is loaded nearly to breaking, longitudinal magne
 tization always produces increase of resistance. Besides, the
 changes of dimensions in nickel, iron, and bismuth produced
 by magnetization are far too smallt. Here again, however,
 it should be noticed that both the decrease of length produced
by magnetization and the decrease of resistance produced by
loading a nickel wire are considerably greater than the cor
 responding increase in the case of iron.
    Whatever it is that causes magnetization to produce so
 large an effect on the electrical conductivity of bismuth, causes
 it to produce also a large effect on some of the other physical
 properties. The thermal conductivity of bismuth is, according
 to £: and Righi S, decreased both by longitudinal 'i
 transverse magnetization by an amount which is about equal
 to the amount of decrease produced in the electrical conduc
 tivity; and though it would appear, from Ettingshausen's
  observations ||, that the decrease of thermal conductivity is
  decidedly less than the decrease of electrical conductivity, yet
 even this observer makes the former comparable with the
  latter; and we shall now see that the thermoelectrical pro
  perties of bismuth are quite as      ' affected by magnetiza
  tion as either the thermal or the electrical conductivity.

Finally, Ewing has entered very fully” into the changes
effected by longitudinal magnetization in iron when under
different amounts of       £ stress.                  Thomson has also
shownf that nickel is rendered by longitudinal magnetization
thermoelectrically positive to unmagnetized nickel; whilst the
author has found it cobalt when under longitudinal magneti
zation to be negative to the unmagnetized metal.
   The experiment now about to be described was made nearly
at the same period as the experiment on the effect of mag
netization on the electrical resistance of bismuth and with the
same bar. This bar was 25 centim. long and 0.33 centim. in
diameter; it was placed in the axis of a magnetizing solenoid,
S, specially constructed to avoid imparting heat to the mag
netized core $; a preliminary examination proved that there
was certainly no error arising from this cause. The ar
rangements are sufficiently shown in fig. 1, where S is the

before magnetization and the spot of light was driven off the
scale. The light could be again brought on the scale by
putting the adjusting-magne: low down; but this of course
materially diminished the sensibility of the galvanometer, and
as the effect to be looked for was likely to be very small this
was not desirable. Accordingly the following plan was
adopted:—There were two sets of needles in the galvano
meter, connected with each other and the mirror; round one
set was wound a coil of about 6000 ohms resistance, and
round the other a coil of between 7 and 8 ohms resistance;
 the extremities of these coils were attached to separate ter
minals, and the latter coil was employed to measure the
thermoelectrical effect of magnetization.        The thermoelec
 trical current due to want of homogeneousness in the bismuth
 was balanced by the current from a Daniell cell sent through
 the other coil, which was shunted, and through a very large
 resistance: by altering this resistance the spot of light could
 easily be brought again to the middle of the scale. Some two
 hours were £ to elapse, the steam during the whole
 of this time passing through the air-chamber, C, and the cold
 water through the air-chamber, D, after which the spot of
  light remained steady. The solenoid, S, was now actuated
  by a current from six Grove cells, and a deflection ensued
 indicating a current from unmagneticed to magnetized bismuth
  through the hot junction. The current through the solenoid
  was then stopped, and the spot of light returned sensibly to its
  old position. The observation was repeated ten times, and
  then the current through the £ being reversed, ten
  other observations were made, after which the current was
  again reversed. The readings had to be corrected for a slight
  direct action of the magnetizing solenoid on the needles of
  the galvanometer.
        e deflection due to the thermoelectrical current between
  magnetized and unmagnetized bismuth was very small; but,
  so far as could be ' out, it was the same for both direc
  tions of the magnetizing current. The mean of the readings
   gave a deflection of 3.5 divisions of the scale; and, by inde
   pendent observation with a Daniell cell, it had been ascertained
   that a deflection of 1 division of the scale would, under the
   conditions of the experiment, indicate an E.M.F. of 0-143
   microvolt. Consequently the E.M.F. produced by tempe
   ratures of 100° C. and 16° C. at the two junctions of mag
   netized and unmagnetized bismuth would be 0.143 x 3.5
   microvolts = # microvolt. The magnetizing force was 226
   C.G.S. units; so that the E.M.F. for unit magnetizing force
   would be 0022 microvolt, or 22 C.G.S. units of E.M.F. If

292      Mr. H. Tomlinson on the Effect of Magnetization
we divide the last number by 14 x 10-", the magnetic suscep
tibility, we shall obtain the E.M.F. which would be produced
by magnetizing the bismuth to unit intensity; this is 15714
C.G.S. units. Now, according to Ewing, the E.M.F. produced
in a certain specimen of soft iron wire by a magnetic intensity
of 160 C.G.S. units was 6 microvolts, when the junctions of
the magnetized and unmagnetized wires were at 100° C. and
16°C. respectively. Accordingly the E.M.F. produced by unit
magnetic intensity would be 3.75 C.G.S. From this it is evi
dent that, for a given intensity of magnetization, bismuth has its
thermoelectrical properties altered by longitudinal magnetiza
tion 4000 times as much as iron. We see, then, that the rela
tive changes produced by magnetization in the thermoelectrical
properties of bismuth and iron are comparable with the
changes wrought in the electrical and thermal conductivities
of these metals.
    Grimaldi has already published researches" on the effect of
both transverse and longitudinal magnetization on the thermo
electrical properties of bismuth, and finds that
in either of these two directions makes the bismuth of com

merce thermoelectrically negative to unmagnetized bismuth.
He also finds that the thermoelectrical E.M.F. of a pure
bismuth and copper couple is increased by both longitudinal
and transverse magnetization. Now according to Ettings
hausenf, who also quotes Rollmannt, pure bismuth is thermo
electrically negative to copper, whilst commercial bismuth is
  ositive to copper. The following table is taken from
   ttingshausen’s memoir:—

Consequently it would seem to follow, from Grimaldi’s experi
ments, that both pure and commercial bismuth are rendered by
magnetization negative to the unmagnetized metal, i.e. the
thermoelectrical current would flow from unmagnetized bis
muth to magnetized bismuth through the hot junction.
   Grimaldi shows that, in the following respects, the effect of
magnetization on the thermoelectrical properties of bismuth
resembles the effect of magnetization on the electrical con
ductivity:—
   ')   The amounts of the two effects are comparable with
each other.
   (2) Transverse magnetization produces a greater effect than
longitudinal magnetization.
   (3) Rise of temperature" diminishes the effect.
   (4) The effect increases in greater proportion than the
magnetizing force.
   It is impossible for the author to compare his own results
with those of Grimaldi; but it would seem from the above
that, by using high magnetizing forces and lower temperatures
at the junctions, the effect of magnetization on the thermo
electrical properties of bismuth might well be found to be
some three or four hundred thousand times the effect in iron,
supposing both metals to be magnetized to unit intensity.
      is being the case, it is difficult to believe that the altera
tion due to magnetization is a real alteration of the thermo
electrical power of the metal. But, again, how are we to
account for it. According to Ettingshausent, when a plate
of bismuth, A B (fig. 2), is arranged, as for experiments on
                                  Fig. 2,

through the plate instead of the electrical current, there will
be produced by the action of the electromagnet a difference
of potential at the two points" a and b. Further, besides the
difference of potential at a and b, which is designated the
transverse “thermomagnetic effect,” there will be a difference
of potential at A and B called the longitudinal thermomag
netic effect; and this last, says Ettingshausen, will account for
the apparent effect of magnetization on the thermoelectrical
properties of bismuth. Both Grimaldit and Leduct, how
ever, are of opinion that the apparent longitudinal thermo
magnetic effect is produced by decrease of thermal conduc
tivity and £ power.
    The alteration of dimensions produced by magnetization
can as little account for the change in the thermoelectrical
  roperties of metals as for the increase of resistance; for,
£ the minuteness of the alteration of dimensions, in some
cases the effect of loading on the thermoelectrical power is in
the same direction, and in others in the opposite direction, to
the effect of longitudinal magnetization, as will be seen from

    There is, however, this resemblance between the effects of
magnetization on the thermoelectrical properties of iron and
on its dimensions. When an iron wire is loaded beyond a
certain limit, magnetization begins to produce decrease of
length and increase of thermoelectrical power".
    In conclusion, when we contrast the small magnetic sus
ceptibility of bismuth with the large value of its rotational
coefficient, and with the large decrease which can be produced

both by transverse and longitudinal magnetization in the
thermal conducivity, the electrical conductivity, and the ther
moelectrical power of the metal, we must be driven to the
conclusion that magnetism in all metals exerts two distinct
influences; one by rotation of the molecules about their axes,
the other in some way which is not yet understood. In such
metals as iron, and to a less extent in cobalt and nickel, the
first of these influences probably plays a not unimportant
part; but in such metals as bismuth, antimony, and tellurium,
the second must entirely predominate.
XXXVIII. On a Method of Determining the Difference between
   the Phase of two Harmonic Currents of Electricity having
   the same Period. By THOMAs H. BLAKESLEY, M.A.”
IT has been brought to my notice by          both English and
     Foreign journals connected with science that a method of
determining the difference in phase of two Harmonic Currents
of Electricity having the same period, which I invented and
published some years ago, forms an important part of the
subject matter of a paper communicated to the Royal Academy
of Sciences of Turin, second series, vol. xxxviii., by Signor
Galileo Ferraris, in which that philosopher lays claim to the
invention above mentioned, producing it as original, with no
sign of acknowledgment that the method has before been
made public.
   The method consists in employing the two coils of an elec
tric dynamometer in a peculiar way. When an harmonic
current is sent through the coils of such a dynamometer in
series, its reading will measure the quantity  #. where I is the
maximum value of such2 a current.  2
                                         In this way we may
successively determine   #  and  '', where the subscripts refer
to two currents having the same period.
   But if we place one of the coils in one circuit and the other
in the second circuit, the reading of the instrument will
measure    l, cos 6,  where 6 is the angle representing the
phase-difference of the two currents, to which the name
 “décalage” has, I have no doubt with great propriety, been
 accorded by M. Hospitalier.
   It is clear that from the three readings we can deduce the

   Here I have supposed that the same instrument is used
successively; and it is hardly necessary to point out that if
we have three exactly similar dynamometers, or if we have
three dynamometers of which the relative values of the con
stants are known, we can deduce 6 by means of three
simultaneous observations.
   The real importance of the determination of the décalage
rests in the means it affords us of determining the causes of
its existence; among which I may here mention Coefficients
of Induction (self or mutual), Capacity of Condensers, and
hysteresis or the waste of energy involved in the reversal of
electromagnetic momentum, all of which present useful fields
for inquiry capable of investigation by means of this appli
cation of the dynamometer, a few of which I have myself
traversed.
   I wish to point out that this method and its importance
(not yet fully appreciated) were published by me in the
‘Electrician’ newspaper of October 2, 1885; and the entire
series of papers, of which this formed one, was republished in
book form at the end of the same year. This was before I
had the honour of membership in the Physical Society, or
doubtless I should have then brought the subject more imme
diately under your notice; but upon my being elected a
member I lost no time in presenting a copy to this Society,
and those who care to examine this question will find therein
a chapter devoted to this very employment of the dynamo
meter to determine Coefficients of      £ and Mutual-Induction
and the Capacity of Condensers.

 XXXXI. On Valency, Validity, and Residual Affinity. By
   J. F. HEYES, M.A., F.C.S., F.R.G.S., of Magdalen College,
   Oxford."
Th:       timely paper by Professor Armstrong, entitled “A
       Note on Valency, especially as defined by Helmholtz,”f
induces me to publish my paper on the tetravalency of
oxygen, and to offer some remarks on his paper in the hope
that both, so happily coincident and containing independent
views and suggestions, will do something to           i:     forward
the consideration of the problems of Valency which are so
essentially characteristic of the present state of Chemical
Philosophy. Raw material abounds. It is now surely more
essential for chemists to study the inner mechanism, so to
speak, of the chemical molecule both in the interrelationships
of the parts and the forces concerned than to discover, say,
more oxides of manganese when we have already too many.
Especially would I venture to direct attention to the paradox
which now confronts us in the contrast existing, on the one
hand, between so many of the complex organic molecules
whose “constitution” we know, or at any rate whose inter
atomic relationships are regular and certain, even to a degree
of prediction £ remarkable limits, and, on the other,
between so many simple inorganic molecules. Why, in fact,
should “the constitution” of complex C.H,0, or C.H.O.N.
be known, and simple N.O., remain a puzzle, which tends to
make many chemists write the old unitary formula in despair
and betake themselves to the seductive studies of molecular
p'  n my? previous paper #     some probable causes of confusion
have been discussed which have led to the different views
held on valency, but the problem is one for the immediate
future. Prof. Armstrong draws our attention to the electric
charge theory of valency—using that term, it is presumed,
in the sense of a property of the atom which used to be called
atomicity. My paper suggested that valency was primarily
a number or numbers, the measure of something whose real
character and denomination science is still seeking, but never
theless a something towards whose perception electrical,
thermal, and atomic mass ratio constants are rapidly converg
ing. The number and the thing itself should not be con
founded. But our fundamental standpoint in valency is that

of integers and not decimal residues". It is only in respect
to our standard reference gas-molecule HCl", where hydrogen

oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the comparable molecules can
be said to be divalent and trivalent, i.e. dyads and triads f.
In face of the enormous difficulties presented by “molecular
compounds,” we are apt to forget that all chemicals consist

non-metallic or the metallic atom supposed to dominate all
the rest. Thus, Wurtz latterly assigned different valencies in

   Analogous high valencies have been suggested by Prof.
Williamson and others for many rare metals of high atomic
weights; but in this case the halogens were taken as monads.
Both views have the same underlying principle. In the one
case a Peter dominates the Pauls, in the other a Paul domi
nates the Peters. Both involve what I have pictured as the
maypole theory.           Oxygen atoms dance round nitrogen or
   * The logical alternative is, I find, well put in a remarkable paper on
Atomic Valency by Prof. Pickering (Journ. Chem. Soc. 1886):—“The
valency of hydrogen being 1, that of oxygen will be represented by some
number slightly smaller than 2, say 198; a compound of these two elements
will possess a residual valency of only 0.02, and will therefore be sufficiently
saturated to be perfectly stable. It may be represented thus: (H,0)+0'02.”
He therefore treats “valencies” as “not whole numbers,” but “similar
to most other physical constants, e. g. atomic weights, specific weights.”
   t A distinction should be drawn between this provisional definition of
a trivalent element and the proposition advanced in Prof. Armstrong's
paper (page 24) that “the gasefiable hydrogen compounds are the only
compounds available for the direct determination of valency.” Un
doubtedly our present standard of reference is H'C1' as a comparable
molecular formula; but it seems only fair, on the principle of reciprocity,
not to leave the valency of metals to turn upon their '' compounds or
alloys with another gaseous metal hydrogen (see my former paper, page
225). The caution that, in the case of the halides, XH, does not neces
sarily involve a valency of X" is most important, and will, it is to be

chlorine in the one case, democratic chlorine or oxygen atoms

                    Cl
of NH,Cl as     # &:        ; and the new departure is indicated
by what Prof. Armstrong calls his first “apple of discord”

The peck-lines are simply meant to show that the point for
discussion is the valency or validity of the nitrogen and
iodine atoms. Those who accept NMe, I as not a molecular
compound usually assume (1) that N is pentavalent, (2) that
I is monovalent, (3) that there are four methyl groupings (or
other R') directly and equally intimately associated with the
nitrogen atom. The formula given simply asserts:—(1) That
the chemical evidence favours a belief in the direct association
of only three of the four methyls; (2) That in whatever sense
the nitrogen atom is pentad not triad, in that same sense the
iodine atom is interdependently triad not monad. If the ni
trogen is ''            here, the iodine atom is also trivalent.
But in order that the dispute may be fought out with the less
risk of misunderstanding, my previous paper proposed (1) that
the rarer or disputed valency may be referred to as validity, and
(2) the latin prefixes and (3) roman numerals be exclusively
used for this latter disputed number. Anything that tends
to order and method in our present notation is at least worth
consideration. Now nobody disputes that nitrogen is tri
valent. Let us, then, in this and in other well-recognized
cases keep uniformly to the greek prefix and symbolize a
trivalent nitrogen atom, as N”, reserving the symbol NV for
the disputed quinquivalid nitrogen in   £                as those
under consideration whenever there is likely to be ambiguity.
The first formula would thus assert that iodine was therein
trivalent, the second that it is tervalid ; but that whether
validity is a property (electrical wholly or in part), a function
of the atom of the same chemical intensity as that relatively
suggested by the numbers 1, 2, 3, already defined, and known

300                Mr. J. F. Heyes on Valency,
as valency or atomicity, is left open for investigation and dis
cussion. It may also be useful to adopt the word adicity,
long ago    |''          by Prof. Odling as comprehending both
valency and validity". Thus it is convenient to say that the
adicity of oxygen is 2 or 4, that oxygen is usually divalent,
but in some cases quadrivalid, if not actually tetravalent,
leaving questions of molecular compounds not entirely closed
on the chemical side, especially in the case of all # yH2O
“compounds.” To take another example; in the case of the
notorious CO molecule, if the oxygen atom is not there tetra
valent the carbon atom is bivalid.              The “molecular com
pounds” dispute does not here arise. On the other hand, in
such formulae as AgkI2 and AgI. K.I sides are taken. On
the former side we should write Ag—I=I—K; whereas
Ag—I == I–K would suggest the controversy:—Is iodine
here trivalent or is it tervalid in either some integral sense
akin to atomicity or in the sense suggested by the working
hypothesis of “residual affinity” ”
     here has undoubtedly been great ambiguity of expressions
hitherto in this matter.         Thus, whilst Wurtz admitted that
“NH,Cl belongs to the type NX,” and held “generally and
implicitly that the chlorine and the four atoms of hydrogen
are united individually to the pentavalent nitrogen,” he at
the same time gave as two reasons why HCl and NH3 can
unite:—(i.) “the atoms uniting are in possession of a residue
of affinity;” (ii) “the atoms of nitrogen can admit into their
sphere of action a fourth atom of hydrogen and an atom of
 £ ” (Atomic Theory, 1880, transl. p. 247). He went
 on to deprecate “creating and employing secondary hypo
 theses.” “Why should we graft upon this atomic hypothesis
 a second, a special attraction which in a completed combination
 is exercised by one molecule upon another?” The italics are
 mine, and they should be compared with the views he ex
 presses later on and the cases of residual affinity as Prof.
 Armstrong employs the phrase. In PCI, Wurtz held that
 “two atoms of chlorine were retained more loosely than the
 other three ’’; but the retaining force was “most naturally ”
 attributed to residence in the atoms themselves; the P atom
 in PX, “can retain a residue of energy capable of fixing new
 atoms and of developing, if we may be allowed the expression,
 supplementary atomicities.” These statements are of great
   * I note that Prof. Armstrong uses the word (p. 28) in “pentadicity
of phosphorus,” apparently in the more open sense of validity. As Prof.
Odling used the word cautiously with reference to valency it may be
convenient to retain it in the inclusive sense of P'" and P.V.

                  Validity, and Residual Affinity.                    301
historic interest in the discussion, though scarcely consistent.
Prof. Armstrong more logically inclines to the acceptance of
only one number for valency concerned with what may be
called chemical affinity of the first magnitude, and suggests
that besides this affinity proper (say a trivalent atomic charge)
there are residual affinities in play which probably account
for molecular compounds and aggregates. Curiously enough
he would, in many cases, thus place among “molecular com:
pounds” many hitherto generally recognized, “chemical
molecules.”      Chemists will be loth to part with these.           It is,
as it were, taking our friends’ dogs to the dog's home when
the street dogs really demand our attention. He supposes
that NMe, I is “the molecular compound ” (tetramethyl
ammonium iodide) caused by the union of the two molecules
 Me, N and IMe determined by the “residual affinities” of
the N and I atoms represented thus:

 Whilst '# with the associations thus indicated, I propose

 and “tervalid.” respectively,

 leaving it open for future research and discussion to determine

 cannot at present commit ourselves to any partial theory, say

 have also as chemists to keep an open mind on the sphere
 and vortex-ring hypotheses of an atom *. It may, however,
   * Professor Armstrong says, “It may well be argued that we have no
 reason to assume that nitrogen is pentad in the ammonium compounds
 or phosphorus pentad in the phosphonium compounds, or sulphur tetr
 in the sulphine compounds” (p. 24). My proposal involves the idea
 that nitrogen is pentad in whatever sense chlorine is triad in NH,Cl taken
 as HaN==Cl—H, there being no reason to assume that the four atoms
 of hydrogen are directly associated with the nitrogen. Similarly for
 phosphonium compounds; but for other reasons (e.g. the evidence of the
 phosphinic acids, of PO(C.H.), PO(C.H.), and other bodies) the penta
 valency of phosphorus seems much better established than that of nitrogen,

by Professor   £       on the trivalency of    iodine written in 1876.    On
page 181 of his ‘Introduction to Chemical Phil": (first edition) he
even gave a closed-ring formula for KHgI, as     K-KDHe pointing out
that although “many chemists regard such compounds as formed by the
union of entire molecules of the constituent salts combined      together by
some sort of adhesion differing from ordinary chemical affinity,” yet “if
they do they might naturally be expected to exhibit something of the
appearance and external characters of their proximate constituents.”
# also considered the idea of “two extra units of combining power”
for oxygen “not wholly preposterous,” and sketched crystallized
#so'do' with “four bond" oxygen atoms throughout. This
was, however, with a view to diminish the number of “molecular combi
nations,” which in a sense it is now proposed to increase. There is much
logic and tempting simplicity in the view that an atom is always n-valent,
and that conflicting puzzles are “molecular,” not “atomic,” but this
logical view seems intimately connected with the idea that the atom of
N,  :example, was born a manufactured article with three hooks,
or bonds,

bably in many cases molar, physico-chemical experiments are
forcing upon bewildered chemists. We must at any rate
leave many of them in quarantine for some time to come.
And, considering that the mortal chemist will always have to
do almost all his work at the bottom of a varyingly moist
aerial ocean, it is surely time that a protest was made against
the claims for admission to the chemical record of so-called
“new” bodies, which are simply more or less moist than the
ordinary substance. Messrs. Carnelley and Walker have
recently carefully * adduced instances of these chemical im
  ostures. It is quite refreshing to find among them an honest
  ydrate like Ce(OH), which can stand 600°f ; but surely the
line should be drawn at the temperature of hot water. In
other cases of alleged “molecular compounds” some tangible
chemical evidence should be required of their existence,
or at least of the chemical homogeneity of the material
 or watered substance which is said to contain them.             At the
 most, then, the so-called “silver hydrate” should be formulated

         HOH
 use HCl for ordinary “hydrochloric acid” is to strain out the
    at and swallow the camel. The fact probably is that it has
 £ popular in preference to AgaO +OH2, because of the
 frequent replacement of Cl by OH through its use in organic
 chemistry. Even in using the formula # conjointly with
 NH4(OH), we are guilty of going against the weight of evi
 dence, probably     £           as Prof. Armstrong (rightly as it
 seems to me!) suspects, by the “ammonium” theory.               £
 hydrochloric “acid” does not dissolve a single metal, except
   erhaps aluminium. And it may be asked, Why should a
 #       metallic chloride be expected to do so? The common
 equation Zn--2HCl=ZnCl2 + H2 is, of course, quite untrue.
 It is even more objectionable than the misleading sheet
 anchor of so many textbooks: Zn--SO, H2=ZnSO, + H2. In
 “hydrochloric acid” the chlorine is probably tervalid and the

 Probably Professor Armstrong would agree that chlorine as
 well as oxygen is here possessed of “residual affinity.” But,
 adopting Thomsen's formula H,ClO, the acid liquid would be
 HCl=0H2. The more open view, HCl == OH, is then
 fairly warranted. It is this chemical unit which doubtless is
 active in effecting the hydrolysis of the alcoholic cyanides
 R'CN, which neither water alone nor liquefied hydrogen chlo
 ride, HCl, does effect. The suggestion that TeCl, does not
 prove the tetravalency of tellurium is particularly interesting,
 since the suggestions of

 are likely to lead to new developments in the discussion of the
 valency of the inorganic elements. The suggestion, on valency
 lines, # been made in my former paper, in the case for
 instance of Tlls, as
                         T]–I           T]–I

 and the fact that two somewhat different lines of thought
 suggest these “closed-chain” molecules will, it is to be hoped,
stimulate the discussion on valency. Undoubtedly the haloid
compounds (except in the case of hydrocarbon derivatives)
must be carefully examined before it can be claimed that a
XCl, “proves" the n-valent nature of X. This is especially
the case with non-volatile chlorides, and is well exemplified
by PtCl4. In view of its chemical habitudes it is not easy for
me to believe in the symmetrical arrangement

   Platinum tetrachloride has the properties of an asymmetrical

that the platinum is divalent, and yet that the peculiarity of
the chlorine atoms—their residual affinity, validity, or even
valency-enables Cl2Pt to play the part of an unsaturated
radical, but not because Pt is necessarily tetravalent. On
this hypothesis I would write PtCl4 as
        /Cl=Cl           2Cl==Cl                -      2Cl–Cl

                                                               |.
This indicates the chemical asymmetry of the two chlorine atoms.
Either heat or free iodine removes the two remoter atoms (or,
say, more accessible    w": #ing in                the latter case
red crystals of PtCl212, i.e.   * |.          Platinum is therefore
 not octavalent in H2PtCls, and probably not even tetravalent.
The existence of the so-called molecular compound is simply
                           of the chlorine, as suggested by
due to the peculiaritiesCl==Cl==Cl–H
         t
                     "Ci--C-C-H.
 This is probably the type of the characteristic compounds of
 the platinum and palladium triplets, Rh, Ru, Pd and Ir, Os, Pt.
 The double chlorides are asymmetrical. The same idea applies
 to the characteristic R'MF, of the Ti, Zr, Th and Si,      # Sn
 triplets. In cases where the chlorine atoms are symmetrical we
 often find an equal number of molecules associated by the mys
 terious dot (...). The type is XCl, nM where M is == CIK,
 == NH, == CO, KCN==, and such like. Thus there is not
 only TICls and TICl, but also TiCl2.3CIK.
      alidity is inter alia conditioned # temperature, and a
 temperature of 200° resolves either H2PtCls or PtCl, into
 PtCl2. That Pt is divalent in KaPt(CN)4 seems to be indi
 cated by its formations from either PtCl2 or PtCl4. Light
 will probably also be thrown upon the difficulties which beset
 attempts to give constitutional formulae to the numerous iso
 meric or even metameric resultants between ammonia and
  chlorides. Their existence would appear to be due to this
  validity of the nitrogen and chlorine, For instance, of the
  two different substances formulated, PdCl2N2H6, Pd being a
  well-defined dyad, the red one yields NH3 easily, and the
  yellow one gives no NH3 on treatment with KHO, but is the
  dichloride of a divalent radical, (PdM2H4)", whose oxide and
  whose alkaline hydrate are known. In this yellow compound
  the chlorine is probably monovalent or the nitrogen pentavalent,
                            Pd*H.C.
                               >NH2Cl

306                Mr. J. F. Heyes on Valency,
But in the red compound the chlorine is trivalent, or at least
tervalid, and the nitrogen quinquivalid,
                                 >Cl=NH,
It will also be noticed that both PtCl2 and PtCl4 are, as the
phrase goes, “unsaturated compounds.” This could not well
be the case if the valency of the platinum were altered in
PtCl4; and they must therefore be due to the tervalidity of
the chlorine, rather than the tetravalency, or to the residual
affinity of the platinum. Thus, PtCl2 yields (PtCl2P)Cls,
'H'               and PtCl22PCls, and         £                    In such
cases, apparently, the higher valencies must be attributed to
the non-metallic elements. The three compounds,

are well worthy of consideration. It is at least obvious that
the supposed dominant valency of the Pt is not concerned,
but that the tervalidity of chlorine and the quadrivalidity of
oxygen most probably are. And if we remove the so-called
but very doubtful “polyad,” Pt and examine the following
series", this will be still more apparent:
                           NH,0. CIH,
                           NH,0.2ClH,
                           NH,0.3CIH.
 Certainly such a series suggests an analogy to the residual
 charge of a leyden jar, especially when we bear in mind
 Maxwell’s observation that a dielectric composed of strata of
 different sorts gives the residual effect, although none of the
 substances alone do so.
    These examples must suffice to show the meaning which
 may be provisionally attached to the conception of validity,
 with the following general results:—
    (1) Very high and shifting valencies for the elements are
 improbable and unnecessary.
    * Another £ set of triplets has just been discovered by Moissan

                                KF. FH,

 Fluorine is indeed clearly tervalid, to say the least; and its very isolation
 by Moissan seems due to the combination K-F:#H           or K. "F:#.

                  Validity, and Residual Affinity.                307
   (2) The existence of the so-called molecular compounds is
due to the validity or varying valency of the non-metallic
radicals, certainly not, as a rule, to the very high validity of
the metallic atom. Thus the          £      difficulty experienced in
“washing” certain precipitated oxides free from potash is, I
take it, due to the validity of oxygen. And in spinelle,
Al2O3. MgO, the tetravalent oxygen makes it probably
                         O=Al
                          |         O=0=Mg.
                         O=Al
   (3) In particular, the numerous grades of bodies containing
H2O is due to the tetravalency (or quadrivalidity) of oxygen
conditionally stimulated in some unknown way (say, to a
change of vibration-period or to a development of residual
charge) by chemical proximity to other non-metallic or
negative atom or atoms.
   (4) So-called catalytic change is often, if not always, due
to this development or existence of validity. This is seen in
the behaviour of hydrochloric acid as contrasted with liquid
hydrogen chloride.

seem to be perfectly analogous to the cases of allotropy.

and removes the difficulties which have been raised as to the

the scale in favour of the questioned Al(CH3)3, and leaves Al

requires. So striking a chemical substance as the '
mineral cryolite, Na3AlF6, has hitherto been between the Scylla
of the old dot formula, AlF, .3NaF, and the Charybdis of
nonad or enneavalent aluminium.        But it is difficult to resist

In the case of other double fluorides it may be that certain of
the atoms are in these circumstances trivalent, e.g. in

It scarcely seems to follow that two out of the five F atoms
in NbF5 are not “chemically equal.”              The questions of
“validity,” “residual affinity,” &c. concern the FK or FNa
connexion. These ideas at least seem worth taking as a
working hypothesis.                              -

degree only or not, from       £              valency, i.e. to the
smaller number. The analogy between polymerism and

    If these speculations are well founded, we ought to be able
to predict the discovery of “allotropic forms” of nitrogen and
the halogens. The allotropy of six of the non-metals already
seems certain; most of the others are open to suspicion:
chemists are naturally cautious and conservative on these
fundamentals of doctrine. A dirty element may easily be
called a new element or another “allotropic form.” Never
theless there are signs of surprises in store for us—dim vistas
though they be. In the case of known compounds, also,
there may be two metameric prussic acids, viz.

Crookes’ address to the British Association served to bring
out very clearly that it is also probably a periodic functiont
of the atomic weight, or at least chemical reacting weight, of
an element with one alternative valency, as this paper has
suggested, rather than many “alternatives” such as the
hypotheses of valencies from 2 to 8 or more. The idea is
well illustrated by a pendulum arrangement of the periodic

The validity alternative valency is indicated on the left of the

on the associations of vortex-rings bear upon this view. At
the least it may be urged that it would be very disastrous for
chemists to abandon these valence-marks, because the con
 nexions with chemical affinity are not measurable at this
stage of the inquiry.
   The alternatives of (C.H.)" and (C.H.)', indicated in my
first paper, suggest analogies between the probable ordinary
monovalent and rarer trivalent behaviour of the halogens. In
some cases, also, an element may be trivalent but occasion

present chemical units. If, by way of illustration, (CaBs)" be

radical, long viewed as one of the “elements” of organic
chemistry, possessing several clearly distinguished allotropic
forms, as it were. Ön the other hand, C2H5 is, so far as our
strong evidence goes, a genuine organic “element” without
such forms. May there not be some analogous mystery in
the case of our present elementary radicals which has yet to
be solved, and of which, perhaps, the spectrosco                       fore
shadowed by the almost uncanny researches of Dr. Crookes
and Prof. Norman Lockyer—already gives us indications?”
Thus Prof. Nordenskiold's experiments indicate that the crude
mixture of yttria, erbia, ytterbia, &c., which Dr. Crookes
briefly calls gadolinia, has a constant molecular weight, just
as X2, Xs, Xy has. Yet the oxide of gadolinium is known to
be the oxide of a non-simple body. M£ there is surely
enough to cause us to hope for the further great future of what
seems to be to some the untenable, if not exploded, theory of
valency.

                               PoSTSCRIPT.
    The importance and difficulties of this subject of validity is
 seen by Professor Lothar Meyer devoting over fifty pages to
it in his ‘Modern Theories, which I have, since writing my
two papers, re-read with deep interest after several years'
interval. It may be convenient to note briefly our chief
 differences of opinion.
    (1) Oxygen is, as usual, taken as strictly divalent. The
result appears to be that chlorine is not only mono- and triva
lent, but “probably heptavalent with regard to negative
   * Remembering that oxygen is characterized above all other elements
by its extreme chemical sociability for others, it is noteworthy that if we
   d its atomic weight to the atom-weights of the seven elements of the
first period, we obtain those of the second period!

elements such as oxygen.” On the other hand, the view that
in the so-called molecular formula KCl the elements are only
“apparently monovalent” leads the Professor to favour the
view of metallic linkings, each metallic atom being associated
with strictly monovalent chlorine atoms. Thus formulae such as
         Cl2=Pb-Pb=Cl,                  Cl–Fe=Fe—Cl
               |     |             d
         Cl=Ph—Ph=C|, "                      ël &
are quoted as probable or possible, pending vapour-density
determinations. In face of the scanty evidence for di-metallic
linkings in most cases, and in view of the much stronger
evidence in favour of trivalent chlorine, I hold at present that
the formula   Fe:#Fe           is preferable. Moreover the K3Cl3
formula seems less probable after the recent vapour-density
determination favouring the gas molecule KI. The Ag-Ag
linking is at least premature.
    (2) Professor Meyer so thoroughly argues for trivalent
aluminium except in Al2Cls, that      ":£"                of this
 exception to prove the rule as     Al&cl=Cisal is required.

 It is only in the case of hydrocarbon compounds that the
 strict monovalence of chlorine can be said to be demonstrated.
    (3) Professor Meyer thinks that Ba &c. are divalent in only
 their more common and most stable compounds, but that “the
 peroxides indicate a higher valency,”    "'        Ba'VO2. He
 quotes Geuther as viewing Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba as having
 valencies 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. If once the peculiarities of the
 non-metals in these molecular compounds are recognized,
 these extraordinary valence powers will disappear. It gives
 no explanation of the “molecular compounds” which even the
 “uncommon” compounds with higher valencies themselvesform.
    (4) The atoms Ru and Os are viewed as “undoubtedly
 octovalent” in their volatile oxides M"O, and cobalt pro
 bably in the purpureo-chloride (NH3),CoCl2, as if from
 £               T' valence numbers are “probably from 1
 to 8.”
    (5) In As Os Professor Meyer does not link arsenic with
 arsenic atoms, but suggests, with probability, a symmetrical
 arrangement:
                           As—0—As

The Professor also states quite clearly his opinion that valency
is a whole number; and it is pleasing to quote that, in point
ing out that chemists were investigating relations of consti
tution and atomic linking formerly regarded as subjects which
could never be properly investigated, he adds:—“At the
present time we consider this research difficult, but we have
numerous proofs in the results which we have already gained
that it is not only capable of solution, but that it also affords
a very fruitful field for the spirit of investigation.” It is to
hoped that some of the remarkable compounds discussed in
these papers will be carefully and minutely examined—J. F. H.
XL. The Application of Hydraulic Power to Mercurial
   Pumps. By FREDERICK J. SMITH, M.A., Millard Lecturer,
   Trinity College, Oxford”.
    N the mercurial pump of the Töpler type, a cistern of
      mercury has to ' lifted periodically through about four
feet. In a form of mercurial pump of this famil , devised by
the author of the paper, the receiver of the pump has been
made very large in comparison with the vessel to be exhausted,
in order that the time of exhausting may be diminished as
much as possible. The large size of the receiver, holding, as
it does, nearly 40 lb. of mercury, increased the utility of the
  ump greatly, while it added much to the labour of working it.
' order to reduce all manual labour to a minimum, the pump
has been made self-acting by the addition of an hydraulic
motor, having a 4-foot stroke, controlled by a side-valve similar
to the D-valve of a steam-engine: this valve is actuated by an
auxiliary motor and valve, acted on by a projection from the
end of the main piston. The figure shows the disposition of
the pump and motor : the motion is quite smooth, and suitable
for the work to be done, the motion at the end of the stroke
being automatically checked. The cylinder is made of thick
drawn brass tube, the flange being brazed on.
    Description of figure:—A is the cylinder, H the valves,
K the inlet of the water. The cistern of mercury is attached

                                                       I will give
    (a) A vertical metallic disk A is put more or less close
to a metal net B stretched parallel to the disk. Such an ar
rangement was adopted in order to be able to illuminate those
parts of one of the metals which are very near to the other.
One of the two metals, A for instance, is in connexion with
one of the quadrants of an electrometer of convenient sensi
bility (a volt corresponding to 130 divisions of the scale);
the other, B, is in connexion with the other quadrants and
with the earth, while the needle of the instrument is kept at a
constant potential (with 100 cells copper-water-zinc). If A
is put to earth for an instant, and soon after is conveniently
illuminated, a deflection is obtained, which reaches its maxi
mum in a time which is shorter the nearer the irradiating
source, and the larger the surfaces of the two metals. The
deflection is negative if A is zinc and B brass. The same
final value is obtained if A is so initially charged as to have
a greater deflection.
     If A is very near B, the complete deflection does not change
if A is suddenly withdrawn from B, which proves that the
radiation has reduced the two metals to the same potential.
 It follows that this deflection measures the difference of the
 potential of contact between A and B. If B is placed in
 connexion with the electrometer instead of A, the deflection
 is of the contrary sign.
     The system of the two metals, when receiving the radia
 tion, behaves then as a voltaic cell, and can be called a
photoelectrical cell.
     The sun's light does not produce the above mentioned effect,
 at least in a well marked way; the magnesium light is more
 active; and the light of the voltaic arc gives remarkable
 results. If the arc be formed between carbon and zinc, the
 phenomenon shows the greatest intensity, for the electro
  metric deflection takes place in a few seconds. This fact
 leads to the belief that the ultra-violet rays are the most
  active, which is confirmed by the fact that a plate of glass
  #" the action, while one of quartz diminishes it very
  little.
      (b) Four photoelectrical cells, each formed by a disk A and
  a metal net B, are joined in series and then illuminated.
  Such a kind of photoelectrical battery shows the well-known
  electrostatic phenomena which are obtained by a battery with
   open circuit, just as if the metals which form it were plunged
   in a vessel of water.
       (c) If the net in experiment (a) is taken away, and the

316                     Geological Society:—
radiations are allowed simply to fall on a plate communicating
with the electrometer, after the plate has been for an instant
put to the earth, a deflection is slowly formed, which is posi
tive with the bodies as yet studied. It seems that in such a
case the bodies surrounding the plate replace the metal net;
it is therefore probable that negative electricity goes to these
bodies and thence to earth.
   (d) If A is a brass disk covered with crystalline selenium,
it appears that it is at first electronegative to gas-carbon,
and that coupling it with a metal net can form a photo
electrical cell.
   But when the ultra-violet rays are suppressed so as to
prevent the occurrence of the phenomenon described, it can
then be recognized that the other rays are producing a varia
tion of the electromotive force of contact between the selenium
and any other metal, making the selenium             more electro
"£         than when it is in darkness.
     utting aside this last phenomenon, which is of a different
kind to those described in a, b, c, and without pretending
to attempt to give a complete explanation, which at present
would be premature, it seems to me that the idea is at least
£                acceptable of an electrical convection, provoked
  y ultra-violet radiations, from bodies on which exists an elec
trical distribution of a given sign (negative probably), caused
by electromotive forces of contact, towards those on which
exists an electrical distribution of contrary sign (positive) due
to the same cause.

    Of the four lowest subdivisions very little was seen. The Bokke
 veldt Beds had yielded fossils referred to Devonian. The detailed
 descriptions commenced with the Dwyka Conglomerate, which was
 coarse, containing both rolled and angular fragments, the matrix,
 which was ill bedded, resembling granitic detritus. Some of the
 boulders suggested doubtfully the action of ice. The Ecca Beds
 consisted of hardened sandy clays, without lamination, and often
 weathering in spheroids, and resembling decomposed basalt or dole
 rite. These beds in the Ecca pass, north-east of Grahamstown,
 were nearly 5000 feet thick.
    The Kimberley Shales were mainly grey and dark sandy shales,
 with a few thin layers of argillaceous limestone. At their base a
 conglomerate, resembling the Dwyka Conglomerate, was sometimes
 found. The Karoo Beds were red and purple shales, with buff or
 reddish sandstone containing much decomposed felspar.
    The Molteno Beds, also sandstones and shales, usually grey- and
 dark-coloured, associated with grits and conglomerate, contained the
 only useful coals of the colony. These coals were peculiarly lami
 nated and contained much ash; the seams were destitute of sand
 stones and often eroded on the upper surface. These characters
 might indicate subaqueous origin. Owing to the irregularity of the
 seams, the views generally formed of the coal-resources of the
 colony may be exaggerated. The upper subdivisions of the Storm

berg Beds, the Red Beds, shales and sandstones of a red colour, the
Cave Sandstone, a massive, fine-grained bed 150 feet thick, wea
thering white, and the bedded amygdaloidal lava-flows and tuffs
that cap the whole, were but briefly noticed, as but few opportunities
had offered for examining them.
   Some petrological details were given of the contemporaneous and
intrusive traps, all appearing to contain the same constituents as the
overlying subaerial traps, and doubtless belonging to the same series
of volcanic outbursts.
   The author proceeded to review the lie of the rocks and physical
structure of the country, distinguishing between the area of older
rocks near the coast and the later deposits commencing with the
Dwyka Conglomerate of the interior. There was apparently uncon
formity at the base of this conglomerate; it and the overlying Ecca
Beds were thrown into folds and occupied the Karoo plains, whilst
the ranges to the northward were formed of the higher beds, all
nearly horizontal and resting quite unconformably on the Ecca Beds.
These ranges had been carved out by denudation, which had removed
the Molteno, Karoo, and Stormberg Beds to the south and north.
 The view advocated by Mr. Dunn that the Kimberley Beds north of
 the ranges represented the Ecca Beds to the south was discussed,
 and the author gave reasons for dissenting from it, and classing the
 Kimberley Beds as a higher subdivision.
   Some notes on more recent formations, the conglomerates of Oli
phants river and superficial deposits, were followed by a summary of
 the author's conclusions as to the probable geological history of
South Africa. The Bokkeveldt Beds are shown by their fossils to
be marine, and possibly all the formations up to the Zuurberg Quart
zite may be also marine. The Ecca Beds have yielded no fossils
which would enable us to decide whether they are marine or fresh
water; the Kimberley, Karoo, and Stormberg Beds are looked upon
as lacustrine.

   The limestone-forming organisms in each of the above were men
tioned, and the methods adopted for obtaining the insoluble residues
by means of hydrochloric acid were described. A table of percen
tages of insoluble residues was given from the Lower Limestone
Shales and Black Rock, from the Oolitic Beds, Mitcheldeania-beds,
and main portion of the Middle Limestones, and from the Upper
Limestones.
   Detrital quartz of small size, with a few grains of felspar, tour
maline, and zircon, characterize the Lower-Limestone Shales, and in
one variety the soft tissues of organisms are represented by ferric
oxide, which in the case of crinoids represents the whole skeleton.
Residues of the Black Rock exhibit slight secondary crystallization
 round detrital quartz, whilst amorphous and chalcedonic silica
become more plentiful. Residues of the Middle Limestone consist
to a less extent of detrital quartz along with micro-crystals of
quartz, amorphous and chalcedonic silica, and less frequently of
pyrites, tourmaline, and zircon; sponge-spicules are also noted.
Towards the top of the Middle Limestones the proportion of detrital
 quartz increases and the deposit of secondary silica on the surface of
quartz grains is less marked.
   The nature of the amorphous and chalcedonic silica in the lime
stone, and the relations of this silica to the small quartz crystals,
were also discussed.    The latter were shown in some instances to
possess nuclei of detrital quartz, and where this is not the case, to
have resulted from the crystallization of amorphous silica.

   1. “An Estimate of Post-Glacial Time.” By T. Mellard Reade,
Esq., C.E., F.G.S.
   The author showed that there exists on the coasts of Lancashire

320                      Geological Society:—
and Cheshire an important series of Post-Glacial deposits which he
has studied for many years. The whole country to which his notes
refer was formerly covered with a mantle of low-level marine
Boulder-clay and sands, and the valleys of the Dee, Mersey, and
Ribble were at one time filled with these glacial deposits.
   These glacial beds have been much denuded, especially in the
valleys, where the rivers have cleared them out, in some cases, to the
bed rock. Most of this denudation occurred during a period of ele
vation succeeding the deposition of the Low-level Boulder-clay. On
this eroded surface and in the eroded channels lie a series of Post
glacial beds of a most interesting and extensive nature. They
consist of estuarine silt and Scrobicularia-clay covered by extensive
peat-deposits, containing the stools of trees rooted into them. Upon
these lie, in some places, recent tidal silts, and on the coast margin
blown sand and sand dunes. The series of events represented by the
denudation of the Low-level Boulder-clay and the laying down of
these deposits is as follows:–1st, elevation suceeeding the glacial
period, during which time the Boulder-clay was deeply denuded in
the valleys. 2nd, subsidence to about the 25-feet contour, when
the estuarine silts and clays were laid down. 3rd, re-elevation,
representing most probably a continental connexion with the
British Isles, during which time the climate was milder than at
present, and big trees flourished where now they will not grow.
4th, subsidence to the present level, the submersion of the peat and
forest-beds, the laying down of tidal silt upon them, and the accumu
lation of blown sand along the sea-margin extending to a con
siderable distance in an inland direction.
   It was estimated, from a variety of considerations, that these
events, all posterior to the Glacial period, represent a lapse of time
of not less than 57,500 years allotted as follows:–40,000 years for
the elevation succeeding the Glacial period measured by the denu
dation of the Boulder-clay in the valleys, 15,000 years for the
accumulation of the estuarine silts, clays, peat, and forest beds, and
2,500 years for the blown sand.
   2. “Note on the Movement of Scree-Material.”             By Charles
Davison, Esq., M.A.
   The author noticed the frequent high angle of slope of screes,
and called attention to Canon Moseley's observations on the down
ward creep of lead on the roof of Bristol Cathedral, and his
subsequent experiment, and stated his belief that stones free to
move on the surface of a scree must be affected in the same
 manner. This he proved by experiments, the result of which he
described.
   These experiments showed that stones do move downwards, owing
to alternate contraction and expansion, the movements accompany
ing or occurring a short time after the change of temperature, that

                      Occurrences of Tachylyte.                     321
the descent is greatest on days of bright sunshine interrupted
frequently by passing clouds, and that rain slightly increases the
rate of descent.
    A description was given of a scree on Hindscarth, Cumberland,
in which the stones lie with their longer axes pointing down the
slope; and it was pointed out that the movement of the stones in
the way described would cause the surface-stones to fall off those
on which they rested, and that others would be dislodged during
their descent.    A numerical estimate was then made of the total
amount of movement produced on a scree of a certain size by
expansion and contraction of the surface-stones, and after alluding
to the relative efficiency of this and other agents upon various screes,
the author concluded by pointing out that in the case of the moon
this might be almost the only agent at work.
    3. “On some Additional Occurrences of Tachylyte.” By Gren
 ville A. J. Cole, Esq., F.G.S.
    An intrusive sheet, some 8 feet thick, among the basalts of
 Ardtun Head in Mull, has selvages of tachylyte. The specific
 gravity of the glass is 2.83, and in other respects it resembles the
 examples already described from the west of Scotland. But in thin
 section, numerous fairly translucent spherulites are seen, which
 accumulate towards the inner part of the selvage until the glassy
 material between them disappears, and they become polygonal by
 contact. The rays of these spherulites are often alternately grouped
 in brown or greyer bundles, both series exhibiting striking pleo
 chroism; but the brown fibres appear darkest when their longer
 axes are parallel to the shorter diagonal of the nicol's prism,
 while the greyish and less fibrous areas are darkest in the reverse
 position. The author believes that two distinct minerals are
 present, as in the spherulites of the ordinary granophyric structure;
  the browner rays may be pyroxenic, but the crystalline substances
   roduced under these conditions of hurried consolidation may be
 far different from those developed in the more central portions of
 the mass. Spherulites with pleochroic rays are the normal type in
  basic glasses, and some occur even in some acid examples.
    An analysis of the Ardtun spherulitic tachylyte shows it to
  resemble that of Beal in Skye, having 53 per cent. of silica and
  nearly 6 per cent. of alkalies.
     An occurrence of tachylyte at Kilmelfort, Argyll, was noted, and
  a description given of an example of great beauty from the Quiraing
  in Skye. The latter rock shows, in section, a light-brown translucent
  glass, with abundant cumulites and small brown spherulites with
  radial structures.
     Near Bryansford, County Down, in Ireland, a basalt dyke occurs,
  the selvage of which must have originally resembled the tachylyte
  of the Quiraing. The alteration that this glass has undergone
  guides one in the search for tachylytes (palagonite and so forth)
  among the Palaeozoic rocks of the British Isles, and an instance was

322             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
described from Snead, near Bishop's Castle, where fragments of basic
glass are imbedded in a tuff of Ordovician age.
   In conclusion, the well-known variolite of the Durance was cited
as a rock of basic character, comparable, in its perlitic and spheru
litic structures with the acid “pyromerides,” both types having alike
suffered from secondary devitrifiction.

coveries of Wertebrate Remains in the Triassic Strata of the South
Coast of Devonshire, between Budleigh Salterton and Sidmouth.’”

        ON THE PRODUCTION OF INTENSE MAGNETIC FIELDS.
                          BY PROF. STEFAN.
    HE maximum magnetizing force which cylindrical iron cores of
      an electromagnet can exert between plane pole-pieces standing
opposite each other is 4tu, in which u is the greatest magnetic
moment which the unit volume of iron can assume.           If we take
p =1700 absolute units, 4Tu = 213600. This value is the more
nearly attained, the smaller the distance of the pole-pieces.
   The action which the iron cores exert in the centre of the field
can be increased without limitation of its length, if the terminal
faces of the pole-pieces are made of another shape. This increase
attains the greatest value if the ends of the cores have the shape of
truncated cones, so that the generating lines of the two conical
surfaces pass through the centre of the field, and form with its axis
an angle whose tangent is V2, that is an angle of 54° 44'.
   The magnitude of the force is then expressed by the formula
                    H = 4Tu (0.289+0.886 log     #).
 where d is the diameter of the iron core, a the length of the field.
 The formula gives an increase of H to any large values. In practice
 this is unimportant, for with the slow increase of the logarithms
 compared with that of the numbers, conditions of construction
 result which cannot be carried out. If H = 8tu, d must be taken
 = 85a.
   For certain optical investigations it is necessary to perforate the
 iron cores. For such cores with plane pole-pieces the principle no
 longer holds that the magnetic field is the more intense the nearer
 the pole-surfaces. The magnetic force in the centre of the field

                 Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            323
   attains its greatest value if the distance of the pole-surfaces a
  satisfies equation
                                          n:
                            a” = do”.   2
                                       n3 + 1
  in which d is the diameter of the perforation, n the number which
  indicates by how much the diameter of the iron core is greater than
  that of the perforation.
      The perforation of the iron core always produces a great defor
  mation of the magnetic field. The intensity decreases considerably
  from the centre towards the end of the field. Between plane pole
  pieces the force at the end of the field is smaller than the half of
  the force in the centre. Iron cores with conical ends of the form
  just prescribed have the advantage of a greater intensity in the
, centre, and at the same time a smaller decrease of the force towards
  the end of the field.—Wiener Berichte, Feb. 9, 1888.
         EXPERIMENTS ON THAT FORM OF THE DISCHARGE OF
               ELECTRICITY KNOWN As ST. ELMo's FIRE.
                         BY A. V. OBERMAYER.
     The experiments described in the paper show that the positive
  brushes are reddish white in the stem, with violet radiating branches.
  The stems which project into the brush are at angles which may
 reach 90°, and the rays may attain a length of 6 to 7 centim.
 Further, that the negative brushes which verge into violet are always
 so fine that individual rays can no longer be distinguished, that
 these brushes standing on a luminous point show an angle of aper
 ture of less than 90°, and that the length of the brush is always
 under 1 centim.
     In discharges from positive surfaces, for instance from clothes,
 these appear covered with fine rays of a length up to 3 centim.,
 which are like the hairs of a fur.
    Discharges from similar negative surfaces consist of a phospho
 rescent glow-light which is in continual motion, and is traversed by
 dark spaces.
    The falls in potential necessary for the production of such a
 brush-discharge decreases with the distance through which the dis
 charge takes place. In volts per centimetre this fall was approxi
 mately:
            At 5 centim. distance 6000 volts per centim.

  INFLUENCE OF LIGHT ON THE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF CRY
     STALLIZED SELENIUM.        BY MM. BELLATI AND E. LUSANA.
    The authors investigated whether light has any effect on the
 conductivity for heat of crystallized selenium, and have found
 that such an action does exist. Circular laminae of crystallized
 selenium were prepared of about 0.03 to 0.04 cm. in thickness,
 and about 2.5 cm. diameter, and were coated over with a thin layer
 of the double salt Cal, HgI2. At ordinary temperatures this double
 salt has a bright red colour, but when heated to 70° it becomes of
a dark chocolate-brown. One point of the selenium-plate was then
heated by pressing against it the apex of a V-shaped platinum
 wire, which was traversed by an electrical current. When thermal
equilibrium was established, the chocolate-brown colour had ex
tended to a circle of a definite diameter. The experiment was
 frequently repeated, partly when the selenium-plate was kept dark
and partly when it was under the influence of light. The source
was sunlight, which had passed through ammoniacal sulphate of
copper in order to eliminate the heat-rays. In each case the
diameter of that circle was determined to which the change of
colour had extended. The following table may serve as an ex
ample, in which D denotes the diameter measured according to a
definite unit:—
               Without light.                      Blue light.

   Hence we have for the ratio of the thermal conductivities, with
and without illumination of the areas, 1.13. Light accordingly very
appreciably favours conductivity in selenium. The authors show,
in conclusion, that the change of electrical as well as of thermal
conductivity in consequence of the action of light is of the same
order of magnitude.—Beiblåtter der Physik, vol. xi. p. 818 (from Atti
del R. Ist. Ven. vol. v. 1887).

   and on the Limit of Refraction. By T. PELHAM DALE, M.A."
Th:       following equation (see Sir Geo. Airey's Treatise on
       the Undulatory Theory, ed. 1877, p. 93) is proposed as
expressing the relation between wave-length and velocity of
propagation in an isotropic medium :—

of attraction, supposed to follow the law of the inverse square.

   It is convenient to reserve X to signify the wave-length in
free aether, and to use l for the wave-length within the medium.
The values of the wave-lengths in free aether are those given
in the text-book of Glazebrook and the tables of Lupton.
   Now, knowing the index of refraction for any fixed line by
observation of the index u, the corresponding value of l is
given by the equation             X.

we can find a value of 6 which satisfies both these equations

And from this value of 6 the corresponding values of 6 to any
other index and wave-length can be found.

much trouble, especially when a large number of indices of

ently near the truth, but has been verified in case of CS, (temp.
 1°5) and mint hydrocarbon by reference to the two indices
A and H, so that the table depends on these two indices only.
It will be seen that in the cases examined          :       is constant,
within the limits of observation, unaffected by temperature.

series, that the equation
                          w=AH-3 (AF-AB)
 holds with considerable accuracy in the cases examined. It
 appears generally to give a fair approximation to the limit",
 and thus to interpolate indices within the visible spectrum.
    While, however, this investigation was in progress Prof.
 Langley’s first paper on the determination of wave-lengths in
 the invisible spectrum appeared (Phil. Mag. March 1884).
 He there gives the wave-lengths of lower heat-rays down to
 length 2:030, and shows that the observed indices of refraction
 are not only below the limit obtained by Cauchy's formula,
 but even below those found by other formulae. The material
 of his prism was flint glass. I found that the values derived
 from 6H and 62B, while fairly accurate in the visible spectrum,
 were increasingly discordant in the longer wave-lengths. If
 6H were increased the lower indices were found more accor
 dant; but then the visible spectrum was not adequately
 represented within the limits of any error which could be
  imagined possible. This seemed to throw a doubt on the
 existence of a limiting value. It appeared, however, that the
   lass prism £ the longer waves considerably. The
    hil. Mag, for May 1886 contained another paper by Prof.
  Langley, the material of the prism being rock-salt. 8. COm
   aring the values found by observation with those furnished
  #    the above equations, the agreement was sufficiently close
  to encourage investigation, and, accordingly, the calculations
  were carried further, the approximation being to single
  seconds in the value of 6 and every value found.
      The results are embodied in Tables I. and II.             It will be
     * The divergence in case of CS, is, however, considerable, and v is too
  large in comparison with that given by the above equations. Especially
  does this occur in highly dispersive media.

          the Wave-length within a Refractive Medium.        329
seen in the case of rock-salt that the agreement between the
values obtained from the sine—which involve only wave
lengths in free aether—and those obtained from the arc, which
involve the two indices, and which should be equal to the
former, are very close. The errors, it will be observed, are of
small amount and not of uniform sign, possibly, however,
showing a small tendency to increase on the side of angle from
the sine in the case of the lower indices. Turning to the table
of indices in the case of flint glass, we see that the angle for
H, 24° 18' 40", gives fairly accordant values down to wave
length 0.940, and not far from the truth to 1:270; after this
the values increase in the case of the sine over that of the arc,
or, in other words, the calculated index comes out too large.
This is the more important because the proportionate increase
on so small an angle as 4° makes a large increase in the
resulting index.     If the value of 6H      #   increased, this
difference is diminished in the lower values; but it would
require an increase far greater than could possibly be allowed
as due to errors of observation in order to include the lower
values, and the upper would become greatly discordant with
observation.
   It was, however, noticed by Prof. Langley that the flint
£       prism appeared strongly absorbent of the lower rays.
 t would no doubt be unsafe to reason very confidently from
results obtained from only two substances. We may remark,
however, that the approach to limit of refraction, if it exist,
must display itself in observation by a small increase in the
index for a large proportionate increase in the wave-length.
Any disturbing cause then must become,          £
also increasingly effective as the wave-length increases.
Hence must arise a tendency to mask the limiting value if
attempted to be found by observation. Now in the case of
flint glass we can hardly suppose but that some effect is pro
duced by the change of temperature which results from the
passage of the heat-rays through the medium. In the case
of fluids the heat lowers the index, and thus the limit would
be lowered also, and in somewhat greater proportion. It is,
in the absence of sufficient data, not easy to say what would
be the effect of this change of temperature in solids. In the
case of glass, the course of the ray through the medium would
possibly be raised in temperature above the surrounding mass,
and thus there would be a cylinder of glass through which the
pencil of rays passed, which might be in a state of constraint as
compared with that around it. That a state of constraint ex
ists is shown by the glass “flying” when suddenly heated.
   However this may be, it seemed desirable in the first place

330        Mr. T. P. Dale on the Index of Refraction and
to continue the investigation with the data at hand, and to
calculate the value of the limit as given by the above equa
tions, using as data two observed indices only. The results
are given in the tables, and will be seen to include a con
siderable number of fluids differing widely in specific gravity,
optical properties, and chemical constitution. The list it will
be noticed includes certain isomeric bodies and also several
differing by a single component.
    The first fluid examined was bisulphide of carbon at diffe
rent temperatures, the data for which were furnished by Dr.
Gladstone to me for the purpose of this investigation. It
will be seen that the quantity        :     is practically a constant.
The same result is observable in the case of mint hydro
carbon and benzene. The range of temperature is not in
deed very large, but within the limits taken it is evident that
the specific gravity and the quantity v–1 increase or diminish
pari passu, and there is but little doubt that this relationship
obtains generally. It would be very desirable indeed to have
longer ranges of temperature * if these could be procured
 't corresponding errors which high temperature would
 almost certainly have a tendency to introduce.
    It is of interest evidently, in the case of a highly dispersive
substance, to determine how far the different indices yield the
same limit, as they clearly should do if the formulae are exact.
 For the determination of this a value of 6 was chosen which
should yield the value which would satisfy 6A; and then wave
 lengths of lines B C D E F and G in free aether and in the
 £, were treated so as to find 6B &c. If the sine and arc
   ive the same result, then calculation and observation agree.
 # will be seen that in the case of CS, there is an outstanding
 difference which amounts to not quite three minutes of arc,
 and increases from A to H. This is equivalent to saying that
 the formulae give correct results to the third place in the case
 of CS,. This is not so good as the rock-salt in Table II. The
 index of G is most affected. The difference was noticed by the
 late Professor Baden Powell, in his “Undulatory Theory as
 applied to the Dispersion of Light, London, 1841. This
 matter deserves further investigation, but it is a matter also
 which will involve a considerable amount of calculation; thus
 it seemed right to postpone this for the present, as being better
    * This is especially desirable near boiling and freezing points. It is
 possible that the specific gravity at boiling-point might reveal relations
 at present masked by the arbitrary character of specific gravities taken
 at any temperature convenient for observation.

           the Wave-length within a Refractive Medium.               331
policy to obtain first a sufficient number of values of v in
case of media varying considerably in optical properties.
   It seemed also desirable to include in the choice of bodies
several which were isomeric. There is a certain analogy
in these to a body at different temperatures, as in either
case we are dealing with the same chemical elements. The
result is, as will be seen from examining the tables, that
in many cases         d    is very nearly a constant.         In no case
yet examined is the divergence very great. Thus in benzene
and styrolene, cresol, metacresol, and benzil alcohol, benzil
chloride and chlorotoluine, methyl citraconate and methyl
mesaconate, the agreement is close; but in case of picoline
and aniline, as also acetone—with which butyric ether agrees
—as compared with allyl alcohol there is a difference of about
three units in the second place”. It may be merely an acci
dental coincidence, but it appears that the quantity             #    in
these two last-mentioned cases is nearly the same, but in
others the divergence is found to be greater. This also re
quires further investigation.
   It must, however, be remembered that in all these the
limit is derived solely from A and H. It is evident, then,
that if either of these indices for A or H are in error, or are
affected by anomalous dispersion, all the rest will be affected.
Yet, considering the nature of the investigation,—which is,
given certain indices to find the rest—it is evident that the
fewer which are assumed as data the more confidence we may
have, if we find that the rest are all calculable within reason
able limits. This, then, is the result of the present investi
gation: given two indices, all the rest can be found within
limits, which are in a considerable number of instances very
fair approximations to the truth. As, however, in the cases
observed the outstanding differences are in the same direc
tion, and increase apparently towards the more refrangible
end of the spectrum, we have an indication of law, which
may be sought for both in the circumstances of the experi
ment and in the mathematics of the problem.
   It will be observed that the effect of substitution on the
quantity v-1 is very marked indeed. This is shown in the
case of ethyl sulphide and ethyl thiocarbamide, and still
more in that of the substitution of iodine and bromine for
chlorine.      Iodine is peculiarly effective in increasing the
  * But in these latter, the specific gravity is evidently too high in
the case of acetone, and in a less degree with butyric ether.

332        Mr. T. P. Dale on the Index of Refraction and
specific gravity in far greater proportion than it raises the
value of the refractive and dispersive powers. No simple
relation between either density and v-1 or the quantity
denoted by h is as yet apparent. I have tried the square
and cube, and the square root and cube root of h, as well as
the simple power. I have noticed above that         y   is in case
of some isomeric bodies nearly a constant, but this may be a
mere coincidence. It is, however, worth noticing, as wh
enters the coefficient k of Airey's equation cited above.   When
the logarithms are at hand, the calculations are so simple
that even in the absence of any theoretical considerations it
seemed worth while to try them.
    It will be observed that the equation, by (#) and (n),
                          a sin 6 = sin m6
 is impossible if a sin 6 is greater than unity. Now as a is
 the ratio of two wave-lengths in free aether, denoted in this
 investigation by N. : X1, we may ask what happens if the ratio
 of Al £ upper wave-length to X the lower exceeds the ratio
unity. Now in all cases yet examined, with the exception
of selenium, this shorter wave-length is beyond violet and
 indeed the visible spectrum. In selenium it must lie some
 where near E; in solid phosphorus and sulphur it is beyond
the furthest limit of the spectrum towards its more refrangible
 end, given by Prof. Langley, i.e. 0.3727. The results are
 given for these three substances in Table IV. annexed. It
 will be seen that phosphorus reaches the limit at about 2684
 and sulphur at nearly 2664. We may observe as a coinci
 dence that the behaviour of selenium in relation to light is
 remarkable, while its red colour shows that the violet end of
the spectrum is absorbed. The results in Table V. are sup
 plemental, calculated to the nearest minute, from determina
 tions recently supplied by Dr. Gladstone, of v for water and
alcohol.
                         Abstract of Results.
    1. That the relationship between the limit of refraction (v)
found by the equation a sin 6 = sin m6, where a is the ratio
of two wave-lengths in free aether and m the corresponding
ratio in the medium, give a value which has the property
expressed by the equation      :    a constant, where d is the
density of the medium and v its limit of refraction at the same
temperature.

           the Wave-length within a Refractive Medium.        333
   2. That in isomeric bodies the same relation obtains closely
in a large number of the bodies examined.
   3. In all the cases examined v is a quantity not very far
below ua.
   4. That the substitution of one chemical element for another
has a very great influence on the quantity         '#',  and sub
stances with high chemical equivalent have, as far as ex
amined, a far greater influence in increasing the density than
in raising the limit.
    5. That the equation a sin 6= sin m6 gives in the cases
examined an approximate value for all the other indices, two
being assumed as data. In the case of rock-salt this holds good
far down in the invisible heat-spectrum, and also in the ultra
violet, but fails somewhat at a certain point in the flint-glass
spectrum, and also, to a less degree, at the upper end of the
visible spectrum of bisulphide of carbon.
    It is evident that for a certain value of a and 6 the equation
 a sin 6=sin m6 becomes impossible. This would mean that
 there is an upper limit which is given by a certain value
 of  £              beyond which the formula gives impossible
 results. In the case of selenium only, of the substances ex
 amined, is this limit within the visible spectrum. The ana
 logy with the critical angle of total reflexion gives this
 circumstance considerable interest.
     It is evident, then, in the present state of our data, that in
 all cases examined the formula of Sir Geo. Airey gives an
 approximate value of an index by means of two others, and
 in this way they can be calculated; but that, as a rule,
 the lower indices come out too high as compared with
 the upper.      A cause for this may perhaps be suggested
 in the heating of the medium due to the absorption of the
 rays; and as there seems to be evidence of absorption of
 short waves above the longer ones, given by recent stellar
   hotometric determinations, this absorption would perhaps, if
 included in the conditions of the problem, account for some
 of the outstanding difference. This and anomalous dispersion
 —itself apparently     £           on absorption—opens an in
 teresting field of inquiry, and in this direction I propose to
 pursue the investigation.
     Since the above was written I have been informed by Dr.
 Gladstone that he in some cases used a screen of solution of
 alum, but found that practically nothing was gained by its
 use.     This fact, then, must be taken into account in any
 attempt to explain the outstanding differences between theory
 and observation.

     XLV. Tidal Action as an Agent of Geological Change.
      By T. MELLARD READE, C.E., F.G.S., F.R.I.B.A.”
     HE nature of tidal action, as regards its effect on the sea
       bottom, seems to be insufficiently understood, if not in
many cases actually misapprehended.
   In looking over most of the late works on Geology this fact
has been much impressed upon me. Very little influence
seems to be attached to the tides as agents of geological
change, and then only as surface-currents affecting the coasts
and shores. So long ago as 1873, in a paper entitled “Tidal
Action as a Geological Cause”f, I attempted to show that the
mechanical action of the tides was deep and wide spread,
affecting not only the littoral, but the whole bottom of the
sea, while the profoundest depths of the ocean are not entirely
exempt from tidal movement.
   My present object, while recalling attention to this subject,
is to adduce some further facts in support of the important
office the tides perform as distributers of material worn from
the land, and even in special cases as agents of erosion acting
on the sea-bottom.
   The force producing the tidal-wave affects every particle
equally, down to the most profound depths of the ocean, while
the forces creating wind-waves act only on the surface. A
cork floating upon deep water disturbed only by the ordinary
waves, revolves (as do also all the surface-particles of water)
either in a vertical circle or an ellipse, not very different from
one having the longer axis vertical. In the free tide-wave

produced by the action of the sun and moon the particles
move in an excessively elongated ellipse, the shorter axis of
which is vertical.
   Sir John Herschel clearly shows “that all the water that
goes to form the elevated portion of the tide-wave must be
brought from the depressed area; and this can only take place
by a lateral  £            of the vertical sections of the sea when
the water is rising, and their recess from each other when
falling, which is only another way of expressing an alternating
backward and forward movement.”" # is evident, from these
considerations, that we may practically consider the particles
of water in tidal movement to be differentiated in velocity
only by frictional retardation on the sea-bottom, in other
words, by work done on the materials constituting it.
   It is necessary to explain that, in the free ocean, the total
height of the tide-wave between high and low water is but
small, and the advance and recess consequently not rapid; but
by the concentration of forces the movement of an immense
mass of water, though at first slow, advancing up a gradually
constricted channel increases rapidly in velocity as the sectional
area diminishes, and a derivative wave is created.
   With this bare statement of principle we will proceed to
question recorded phenomena, and see if it is borne out by the
facts of nature.
   Evidences of Bottom-velocity.—Between Glas island and
Sgeir-i-Noe, in the Little Minch off the west coast of Scotland,
the flood-stream often takes the buoys of the long lines down;
“and it is a remarkable circumstance, indicative of the great
depth of the tidal-stream here, that the buoys, though anchored
in 70 or 80 fathoms, are taken completely to the bottom;
star-fish and other marine animals being found attached to
them.”f As in fine weather the surface-velocity here is only
14 knots per hour, it seems pretty evident the bottom-velocity
in this case must exceed that at the surface.
   In the Gulf of Coirebhreacain, between Scarba and Jura,
the tide runs with a velocity, by actual test, of 9 miles an
hour. The principal stream of flood enters from the eastward
from the Sound of Jura, and runs out in a dangerous race
about N.W. for about halfway towards Colonsay, forming

 340             Mr. T. M. Reade on Tidal Action as
 running eastward along both sides of the Gulf, which contri
 bute to increase the agitation of the waters".
    The width of the      £ is about two thirds of a mile, and
 its greatest depths from 80 to 105 fathoms, while in the
 Sound of Jura and in the sea to the westward the soundings
are generally much less. The greatest depth occurs just in
the position it should do if attributable to the excavating
power of the current. One of the soundings of 86 fathoms on
my chart shows a rock bottom, so probably the tide sweeps
the bottom of the channel as deeply as the rock will allow.
    To the west of Scarba, and turning at an angle from the
 Coirebhreacain channel in the direction of Loch Linnhe, is a
depression or “deep,” with soundings of from 113 to 124
fathoms. It is very probable that the action of the tide in
these complicated channels between the numerous islands pro
duces under-currents, having a direction diverse from and
perhaps sometimes opposite to the surface-streams.
     To the eastward of Barra Island, from south of Barra
Head to Barra Sound, a distance of over 30 miles and parallel
to the land, is a trench from 100 to 132 fathoms deep; while
outside the general depth is about 80 fathoms with a muddy
bottom. In this trench four of the soundings show a rocky
bottom at depths of 104,125, 128, and 132 fathoms; while
one of 131 fathoms is marked as stony, the remainder bein
sand, shells, or mud. Here, again, it is evident that the tida
scour has eroded this channel at a depth of 780 feet.
    In the Little Minch there is a “deep” between the Isle of
Skye and North Uist with a sounding of 107 fathoms, “rock,”
the surrounding bottom, with soundings from 50 to 90 fathoms,
being shells, sand, or mud.
    Between the island of Rum and the island of Barra there
are a good many soundings showing rock, which are deeper
than others in the vicinity which have muddy bottoms.
    Off the island of Rathlin, north of county Antrim, there is
a deep or pool with soundings of 100 to 133 fathoms; several
of the deepest show rock. The surrounding bottom is of
shells, sand, and mud at less depths.
    It seems to me pretty evident that, as in the case of the
“remarkable ditch,” mentioned by Captain Beechy, off the
coast of Wigtonshire, 20 miles long by about a mile only in
width, and from 400 to 600 feet deeper than the general level
of the bottom about it, these “deeps” off the Scotch and Irish
coasts have also been “scooped out” by the tidef.

   It is true that some of these depressions have been claimed
by Prof. James Geikie as the work of glaciers, but there
seems to me insufficient grounds for that assumption. In the
first place, before it could be admitted, we should have to prove
that these deeps are rock-basins; which, as the surrounding
bottoms are all, or nearly all, mud and sand, it would be diffi
cult to do.
   They may or may not be rock-basins; but even if we admit
that glaciers could, under certain conditions, scoop out de
pressions in a rocky floor in such positions (a question on which
there exists much difference of opinion), these channels or
depressions could not have been cleared of the deposits which
formerly filled them, or afterwards have been kept open, except
by the action of sea-currents.
   Thus it is seen that, while the form of the channels and
coast-lines affect the direction and velocity of the tidal cur
rents, the tidal flow reacts under favourable conditions and
increases the depths of the channels. Thus the actual erosive
influence on a rocky bottom may be small; on a bottom of
softer materials it may be large, sweeping away the looser
sands, gravels, or clays until it reaches the rock, or until its
force is expended and an equilibrium of velocity and depth be
attained. It is at all events remarkable that in all the deep
pools I have mentioned, some of the deepest soundings disclose
rock while the shallower ones do not.
    This seems to me irreconcilable with the glacial theory of
the origin of these “deeps.”
    It will not follow from the principles I have attempted to
 enunciate that the deepest channels are always situated where
 there is the swiftest current. The velocity of the current, on
 the contrary, is often increased by the sudden shoaling of the
 water, so that the most dangerous and impetuous tides may be
 caused by rocky ledges which resist erosive action.
    The deeps, I take it, are the result of the steady movement
 of a great body of water, having usually a bottom-velocity
 probably not much less than that of the surface, and in some
 cases more; and the depth of erosion is to a large extent
 determined by the nature of the materials upon which the
 moving waters act.
     The Tide as a Distributer—The foregoing examples have
 all been taken from a coast where the contours and islands
 £     great diversity and strength to the currents, and where
 the erosive action is consequently at its greatest. But, as a
 distributer of material, the tide performs perhaps a greater
 function.    In less restricted areas it is not so £, in action,
 but spreading over a larger area the amount of material dealt

with is infinitely greater. It is by tidal influence that the
material brought down by continental rivers and that frayed
by waves and currents from the coast is gradually worked out
to the ocean depths. The North Atlantic is distinguished by
a more widespread distribution of sediment over its floor than
most of the oceans, doubtless due, as I have elsewhere pointed
out, to the more numerous and greater sedimentary contribu
tions of the rivers draining the surrounding land areas.
    Without tidal action this sediment would be left to shoal
the inshore waters instead of being gradually worked out to
 great depths, which is what actually takes place. Unfortu
nately at present our knowledge of the nature of the ocean
bottom is extremely limited, and quite insufficient to justify
the wide generalizations of some too—ardent naturalists who
 would paralyze inquiry by their rigid systems.
    Tidal Movements in the Ocean.—Although it is on the lit
 toral margins and the shallow seas opening into the oceans
 that the resistless force of the tides is the most obvious, the
tidal influence is felt in the profoundest depths of the ocean.
 Sir John Herschel says that “a tide-wave of 4 feet of total
height, advancing over a sea 30,000 feet deep, implies an
advance and recess of 2800 feet, which being spread over six
hours is nowhere very rapid.”"
    The mean depth of the ocean is probably not more than
 12,500 feett, and there is every reason to believe that the slow
movements of these enormous bodies of water, by concentration
in deep channels favourably circumstanced, get translated into
rapid currents that scour i. bottom. Formerly it was sup
posed that the waters of these great depths were profoundly
and universally still, but the information gained in laying
deep-sea cables proves that swift currents sometimes prevail.
 Sir James Anderson, the eminent telegraph-engineer, says, in
 a letter to me:—“Perhaps the most marked experience we
 have had of currents at great depths was in the case of the
 Falmouth cable near Gibraltar.            At 500 fathoms the wire
 was ground like the edge of a razor, and we had to abandon
 it and lay a cable well inshore. Captain Nares, of the sur
 veying ship “Nemesis, I think with tangles could get no
 specimen of the bottom whatever, and he thinks he got suffi
cient evidence to prove the existence of a perfect swirl at that
depth.” +

   Mr. Edward Stallibrass, in a valuable ' on Deep-sea
Sounding in connexion with submarine Telegraphy”, says:
“Of all bottoms these oozes are the ones to be preferred.
The fact of their being found shows that no currents exist in
those parts, and they are so soft that the cable sinks far down
into them. The old idea that currents do not exist at any
great depths has long since been rejected. Currents may
exist at almost any depth. Between the Canary Isles there
are strong currents 1000 fathoms below the surface, and their
scouring action may be clearly detected.”
   Mr. J. Y. Buchanan, in the discussion on Mr. Stallibrass'
paper, also said:—“If we find hard ground we know that there
must be something to prevent the accumulation of sediment.
Now the only thing that prevents the accumulation of sedi
ment is a current; and one help that telegraph soundings
have thus given to geographical science is the indication that
tidal currents exist even at very great depths in the open
ocean.”f
   I have very little doubt that these currents are of tidal
origin. Mere differences of specific gravity in the ocean water,
whether due to temperature or salinity, are insufficient, in my
opinion, to produce such rapid currents; but the arrest and
concentration of the immense mass of ocean water set in move
ment by the attraction of the sun and moon are more potent
influences. The comparative neglect of tidal action as a geo
logical cause is doubtless due to our usually looking at the
tides as superficial currents; whereas, unlike currents of the
Gulf-stream type, they extend to the bottom of the deepest
oceans. The subject is one capable of much development;
and numerous other illustrations could doubtless be brought
forward to fill up this merely outline-sketch which would sus
tain the main principle I have sought to establish, namely, that
tidal action as a physical agent is not confined to coasts and
shallow seas and estuaries, but is a widespread and potent
cause of geological change.

344         Dr. A. Grünwald’s Mathematical Spectral
The group of lines thus harmonically related the author infers
to be due to a common component of A and B, and the ratio
of the wave-lengths to be dependent on the influence of the
other components. He had previously applied his method
to the analysis of the spectra of hydrogen and oxygen, and
concluded that hydrogen is composed of two primary elements,
a and b, and has the chemical formula ba, ; and that a is the
substance which, when uncombined, produces the “coronal
line” and some others in the solar atmosphere (hence called
“coronium”), while b is the substance which, when uncom
bined, gives the lines ascribed to “helium” (D, &c.). Oxygen
he thinks to be composed of a substance H* combined with
 another substance O'; this substance O’ being a compound
 with the formula b.O.", where O" is again a compound bics,
 so that O= H'b,(b,cs). How he arrived at these particular
 formulae he reserves for publication in a future more complete
 memoir. The spectrum of O" will include a group of lines
 due to b which will be harmonically related to a corresponding
 group in the spectrum of hydrogen; but inasmuch as b is
 combined in the one case with c and in the other case with a,
 and the proportions in which it is combined are also different
 in the two cases, the wave-lengths of the group of lines are
 not identical in the two spectra, but are only harmonically
 related. Again, the wave-lengths of lines due to b in the
 spectrum of O" when it is free will be, not identical with, but
 harmonically related to the corresponding lines in the spec
 trum of oxygen in which O" occurs under the constraint of
 combination with b and H'.
     The criteria by which the primary elements a, b, c may be
 recognized are as follows:—
     I. If X be the wave-length of the group of rays produced
  by a as it exists in hydrogen:
     (1) 19/30X will be the wave-length of the corresponding
  ray in the spectrum of water, due to a in the state in which it
  exists in hydrogen in the state in which the latter occurs in
  water-vapour; and
     (2) 3/4X & (3) 56/75 A will be the wave-lengths of two
  other corresponding rays in the water-spectrum.
     II. If X be the wave-length of one of the group of rays due
  to b in the state in which it occurs in hydrogen under the
  influence of a:
      (1) 4/5 X will be the wave-length of the corresponding ray
  in the water-spectrum due to b as it exists in hydrogen in the
  state in which the latter occurs in water;
      (2) 46/41X will be the wave-length of the corresponding
  ray of the oxygen-spectrum due to b as it exists in % in the
   state in which the latter occurs in free oxygen; and

              Analysis of Magnesium and Carbon.            345
   (2a) 23/32 x 46/41X will be that of the corresponding ray
of the water-spectrum due to b as it exists in O' in the state
in which the latter occurs in the combined oxygen of water;
   (3) 70/59 A will be a wave-length of a ray of the oxygen
spectrum due to b as it exists in O" in the state in which the
latter occurs in O' in free oxygen; and
   (3.a) 21/32 x 70/59 A will be the wave-length of the corre
sponding ray of the water-spectrum due to b as it exists in
' as the latter exists in O' in the combined oxygen of water.
   III. If X be the wave-length of a line in the oxygen
spectrum due to c as it exists in O" as the latter exists in O'
in free oxygen:
   (1) 3/5A will be the wave-length of the corresponding ray
of the water-spectrum due to c as it exists in O" in O' in the
combined oxygen of water (chief criterion);
   (2) 5/8A will be the wave-length of another line of the
group in the same spectrum due to O", which group includes
other ' besides those referred to in the £ preceding
paragraph.
   # # X be a wave-length of free helium, that is of helium
in the state in which it occurs along with coronium uncom
bined, when hydrogen is dissociated at high temperature and
diminished pressure, and its volume thereby increased in the
ratio 3/2:
   2/3 A will be the wave-length of the corresponding ray of
the hydrogen-spectrum due to b as it is chemically combined
in hydrogen; and X =2/3X will satisfy the criteria above
given under II., so that 4/5 N, 23/32 x 46/41 A', and
21/32 x 70/59N will be the wave-lengths of three lines of
the water-spectrum, and 46/41A and 70/59X' those of two
lines of the oxygen-spectrum.
   V. On the other hand, if X be the wave-length of a ray of
free “coronium,” 2/3 X (=X') will be the corresponding
wave-length in the group of lines of hydrogen due to the
combined “coronium,” and will satisfy the criteria above
given under I.; so that 19/30N, 3/4X', and 56/75.X will be
very nearly the wave-lengths of three lines of the water
spectrum.
   VI. The wave-lengths of all the lines of the elementa
 line-spectra of hydrogen and oxygen, when multiplied by 2/3
 (the factor of condensation of the gases in the formation of
 water-vapour), become wave-lengths of corresponding lines
 in the spectrum of water.
    Applying his analysis to magnesium, the author finds that
 the lines of the magnesium-spectrum fall into four groups. Of
 these the first consists of the lines for which X=5710, 5529,
 5527, 5183,5172,4481,4456, which he ascribes to helium (or b

346         Dr. A. Grünwald's Mathematical Spectral
as it occurs in hydrogen) existing as a component of magnesium
without condensation. The proof is that 2/3X, which may be
written X', satisfies the criteria above given for such lines;
that is to say, 4/5X is the wave-length of a line of the water
 spectrum, as are also 25/32 x 46/41 X and 21/32 x 70/59 X'.
 In fact, of the 21 numbers calculated from these formulae,
 15 agree, within a fraction of a unit of Angström’s scale,
 with the wave-lengths of lines of the water-spectrum observed
by Liveing and Dewar. The remaining 6 lines the author
 thinks must have escaped observation merely through their
 feebleness, because the wave-length of each of them is the
 half of the wave-length of a corresponding line in the com
 pound line-spectrum of hydrogen; and he has elsewhere
 shown that, in general, the half of the wave-length of a line
 in the last-named spectrum is the wave-length of a line of the
 water-spectrum.
   X' ought to satisfy also the criteria IV., but no line of
wave-length \! has as yet been observed in the spectrum of
hydrogen; while of 46/41N only 4135.5, and of 70/59 X only
4371.7, are the wave-lengths of observed lines of oxygen.
    The magnesium-lines 5529, 4481, and 4456 coincide,
within the limits of errors of observation, with lines of the
compound line-spectrum of hydrogen.
   The second group of magnesium-lines consists of those for
which A=
           5167               4481                3894
           4808               4456                3892

           4587               4165                3330
           4586               4057-3              3329-1
           4570               3896                3327
   This group the author ascribes to the primary element c in
the same state in which it occurs in oxygen; and it satisfies
the criteria III., for in most cases 3/5 X and 5/8M are found
to agree, within a unit of Angström's scale, with the wave
lengths of lines of the water-spectrum observed by Liveing
and Dewar, and in most of the few remaining cases they are
the halves of the wave-lengths of lines in the compound line
£          of hydrogen. The author gives a list of 43 lines of
the oxygen-spectrum which beiong to c in free oxygen; but
of these only 4705, 4588, and 4455 are identical, or nearly so,
with lines in the second group of magnesium-lines. In ex
planation of this, he says that when an element c occurs in
different substances (as, for example, in oxygen, in magnesium,

              Analysis of Magnesium and Carbon.               347
and in carbon) in the same chemical state in each of them, but
in combination with different kinds of matter, the intensities
of the rays due to c will be variously affected by the action of
these different kinds of matter. This is the reason why, for
instance, many rays of c are seen in the oxygen-spectrum which
disappear from the spectrum of magnesium or carbon and vice
versá; so that without mathematical analysis it is almost im
possible to recognize this element and trace it spectroscopically
in different substances, even when it occurs in them in the
same state. Lately the author has succeeded in detecting c
in nitrogen also, and in the same state as it occurs in oxygen,
carbon, and magnesium.
   The third group of magnesium-lines consists of all the lines
and sharp edges of bands, thirty in number, with wave-lengths
between 3896 and 3329.1 observed by Liveing and Dewar
and by Hartley and Adeney, and, according to our author,
forms part of the large group of lines in the hydrogen
spectrum produced by the primary element b in the chemical
state in which it occurs in hydrogen under the influence of a
or “coronium.” The wave-lengths of this group, when mul
tiplied by 4/5, give the wave-lengths of corresponding lines
of the water-spectrum due to b as it occurs in hydrogen in
water; and when multiplied by 46/41 and by 7059, give the
wave-lengths of lines of oxygen due to b as it occurs in O' in
oxygen and as it occurs in O" in O' in oxygen, respectively;
and when multiplied by 23/32 x 4641 and 21, 32 x 70/59,
give the wave-lengths of corresponding groups of lines in the
water-spectrum. None of the group have as yet been ob
served in the spectrum of hydrogen, but several of them have
been observed in that of the oxyhydrogen-flame. As regards
the water-spectrum, the agreement of the observed with the
calculated lines is close and very complete throughout the long
list of some ninety lines. As regards the oxygen-spectrum,
only a few of the calculated wave-lengths correspond to lines
of which observations are recorded. The existence of these,
hitherto unnoticed, oxygen rays is therefore an inference
from the existence of the rays of water which are harmoni
cally related to them.
   £ fourth group of magnesium-lines includes 3336-2, and
all the lines more refrangible than it observed by Liveing
and Dewar and by Hartley and Adeney. This group forms
part of the large £ of lines of the water-spectrum due to
b as it occurs in    ''       in water-vapour; and for nearly
every one of the fifty lines of the group, a line with the
same wave-length within one unit of Angström's scale has
been observed by Liveing and Dewar.           hat differences of

348        Dr. A. Grünwald’s Mathematical Spectral
wave-length there are may mostly be ascribed to errors of
observation; though they may be in some part due to slight,
merely physical differences of condensation of the   '
condensed gas b as it exists in water-vapour on the one hand,
and in magnesium on the other.                                *
   That these magnesium-lines, which are also water-lines,
really belong to the group of lines due to b as it exists in
hydrogen in water the author thinks to be proved; because
when their wave-lengths are multiplied by 5/4, they satisfy
the criteria II. so far that if X"=5/4A, 23/32 x 46/41 A" and
21/32 x 70/59A" respectively are groups of wave-lengths which
agree well with observed wave-lengths in the water-spectrum.
46/41X" and 70/59 A" should also be the wave-lengths of
oxygen-lines; but of these only a few agree with the wave
lengths of observed lines. The absence of the greater part
of the lines of these groups from the observed oxygen-spectrum
and of the group with wave-length X" from the hydrogen
spectrum, the author ascribes to the weakness of the lines
under ordinary circumstances; and he expects that oxygen
and hydrogen will yet, under some different conditions, be
made to emit them with sensible intensity. His theory, then,
is that magnesium is a compound containing :
    (1) Helium, without condensation or dilatation, which in
magnesium emits only the rays of group I. ; all its other rays,
including D3, being weakened by the influence of the other
components.
    (2) The primary element c, in the same state in which it
occurs in oxygen and carbon, giving the rays of group II.
    (3) The primary element b in that state in which it occurs
in free hydrogen, giving the rays of group III.
    (4) The primary element b, but in the chemically more
condensed state in which it occurs in the hydrogen of water
vapour, giving, under the influence of the other components,
the rays of the partial group IV. with more or less intensity.
    Applying the same method to carbon, he finds 11 : 1
 rays of the elementary line-spectrum of that substance form
 five groups. The first consists of the rays for which X is
 65830, 6577:5, 56941, 5660.9, 5646.5, 5638-6, and 5150.5.
 In this group A, when multiplied by 3/5, satisfies very com
 pletely the criteria II. for b as it occurs in hydrogen, so far
 as the calculated wave-lengths of rays of water are concerned;
 but only one of the corresponding rays of hydrogen, and none
 of those of oxygen, have been recorded as occurring in the
 spectra of these substances. Nevertheless several of these
 rays have been observed by Liveing in the oxyhydrogen

               Analysis of Magnesium and Carbon.              349
flame; and in such a flame there are variable quantities of the
uncombined gases, so that the rays in question may really be
emitted by oxygen or hydrogen, through mixed up in the
photograph with the rays of water. The ratio 3/5, which
expresses the relation between X in this group to the wave
length of a corresponding ray in the spectrum of hydrogen,
according to the author's theory indicates the ratio between
the volume which a given quantity of b in free hydrogen
occupies and the volume which the same quantity of b in
carbon occupies. So that if the chemical density of b in free
hydrogen be 1, that of b in the state in which it occurs in
carbon will be 5/3.
    The second group of carbon-lines, for which X is 6577:5,
5638-6, 5379-0, 5150.5, 51442, 5133.0, 4266.0, 3919, fulfils
criteria III. for the element c in the same state as that in
which it occurs in oxygen. For 3/5 X and 5/8% agree closely
with the observed wave-lengths of lines of the water-spectrum.
This group, like the second group of magnesium-rays, forms
but a part of the whole group of rays which c can emit when
in the state of chemical condensation in which it occurs in
oxygen and in magnesium. And this partial appearance of the
 group depends on the intensities '. are determined by the
 influence of the other elements with which c is combined.
    The third group of carbon rays, for which X is 3919, 3881.9,
 3877, 3875-7, 3870-7, 3589:9, 3584.8, 3583:3, 3167.7, 2993:1,
 forms, like the third group of magnesium-lines, a part of the
 group of lines which b can emit when it is in the state in
 £ it exists in free hydrogen. It satisfies the same tests
 as the corresponding magnesium group and with equal com
 pleteness. That b in carbon should give an entirely different
    oup of rays from that given by the same matter existing in
 the same state of condensation in magnesium, the author ex
  plains, as before, by the variations of intensity induced by the
 other elements in the two substances.
     The lines of the fourth group, for which X is 3166, 2993:1,
 2967:3, 2881:1, 2837.3, 2836-7, 2835'9, 2746-5, 27332,2640,
 and 2523-6 (silicon-line), like the fourth group of magnesium
  lines, are also, within the limits of error of observation, lines
  of the water-spectrum. Also 5/4 A satisfies, to the same
  extent as in the case of the corresponding group belonging to
  magnesium, the criteria II. for the wave-lengths of rays due
  to b in the same chemical state as that in which it occurs in
  the hydrogen in water-vapour; and, as before, the author
  thinks that the ratio 5/4 indicates the condensation of b, in
  the form in which it exists in carbon and produces this group,
  as compared with its condensation in    £

350               Mr. Louis Bell on the Absolute
   The fifth group consists of the remaining lines of carbon,
together with the lines which were at first attributed to carbon
by Liveing and Dewar, and were afterwards shown by Hartley
to be produced by silicon. The author’s analysis leads him to
think that the latter lines belong both to carbon and silicon,
and are due to a common element in those substances.          The
wave-lengths of the whole group, when multiplied by 5/4,
become wave-lengths of lines of the water-spectrum ; and
when multiplied by 25/16 give a group of wave-lengths which
satisfies the criteria II. for b as it occurs in hydrogen as com
pletely as any of the preceding groups so far as the water
spectrum is concerned, and somewhat more completely than
them so far as the observed lines of hydrogen and oxygen
are concerned. The factors 5/4 and 25/16 are interpreted to
indicate the condensation of b, as in former cases. It is
noteworthy that 25/16 x 2500-6=3916.5 = 2/3 x 5874.7, the
wave-length of the helium-ray D3.
   The conclusion is that carbon contains c in the same state
as that in which it occurs in oxygen and in magnesium, and b
in four different states: (1) in which it is less condensed than
in hydrogen in the ratio 3: 5; (2) in which it is in the same
state as in free hydrogen; (3) in which it is in the state
in which it occurs in the hydrogen in water-vapour, more
condensed, in the ratio 5:4, than in free hydrogen; and
(4) in which it is still more condensed, in the ratio 25: 16,
than in free hydrogen. In the second and third of these
states b occurs also in magnesium.

  Grating I. was used during October and November 1886,
and forty-eight series of observations were obtained as follows,
each series consisting of three to seven observations:

   Grating I. was used at an average temperature of very
nearly 20°, to which all observations were reduced. The
average barometric height was 761 millim., so that no cor
rection was required for this cause. Weighting and com
bining the above observations, the final value is
                      $=45° 1' 48"24+0":11,
corresponding to the spectrum of the third order.
   The resulting probable error in wave-length is about one
part in a million.
   Grating II. was used in March 1887, at an average tem
perature of very nearly 20°, and an average pressure of
760 millim. Thirty-six series of observations were obtained
in the fourth order, as follows:—

352              Mr. Louis Bell on the Absolute
   Combining and weighting, the mean value is
                    $=42°4'59"28+0"-2.
The probable error is equivalent to about one part in six
hundred thousand in the wave-length.
    Both the glass gratings were used exclusively for the line
D1, which was on the whole most convenient for measure
ment, D, being rejected by reason of the troublesome atmo
spheric lines. The relative wave-lengths of a very large
number of lines have been so exactly determined by Prof.
Rowland that any one of them would have given results
equally valuable, and in the subsequent work with gratings
' and IV., two of these standard lines were employed.
    In this second part of the investigation, the gratings as
before mentioned were used on the large spectrometer in
which the telescopes were kept at a fixed angle and the
grating was turned. This method is, of course, applicable
only to very solid instruments in which the angle can readily
 be kept constant, and it should be further noted that it also
 requires the use of very perfect gratings, since the grating is
 used asymmetrically. As a £ of this the spectra on the
 two sides differ in dispersion; and if the ruling is irregular
 either in spacing or in contour of the individual lines, may
 differ quite widely in focal-length definition and illumination.
 After critical examination gratings III. and IV. appeared to
 be so nearly perfect in ruling as to be quite secure from the
 dangers of £ method. The method has moreover the dis
 tinct advantage of enabling the angle of deviation to be
 varied within certain narrow limits. Hence it becomes pos
 sible so to arrange the apparatus as to give to some con
 venient line a double deflection that shall be an exact sub
 multiple of 360°. This once accomplished it becomes an easy
 matter completely to eliminate the errors of the divided circle
 and obtain a value of nq, dependent only on the micrometer
 constants, which in turn may be themselves almost eliminated.
 To be sure, this method practically confines observations to
 the spectra of a given order and limits the choice of lines for
 measurement, but the first objection does not apply to gratings
 of which the ruling is very nearly perfect, and since the re
 lative wave-lengths of a large number of lines are known with
 very great exactness, measurements of the absolute wave-length
 are quite comparable even if made on different lines.
     As regards the constancy of the angle between the colli
  mator and observing telescope, there was every reason to ex
  pect entire permanence throughout the experiments; and
  observation soon justified this expectation. The telescopes

                     Wave-length of Light.                    353
were firmly secured at both ends to one and the same casting,
which in turn was firmly bedded in a brick pier. In addi
tion the size of the apparatus was such that a variation of
even 1" in the angle was quite improbable. The angle,
measured in the ordinary way with a collimating eye-piece,
could be determined to 1" of arc, exclusive of errors of gra
duation in the circle. At first there appeared to be distinct
variations in the angle as determined at the beginning of
each series of observations, reaching sometimes more than
 10". It soon appeared, however, that when the same part of
the circle was used the angle between the telescopes was
sensibly the same, and the apparent variations were then
traced to a periodic error in the divided circle, which by the
method of repetition was completely eliminated from the
measurements of angles of deviation, and only appeared in
the determinations of 6. This error was finally eliminated by
 measuring 6 in various portions of the circle.
    The method of determining b was as follows:—The in
 strument being adjusted by the ordinary methods, a suitable
 line was selected for measurement, and then the angle 6 was
 slightly increased or diminished until, by measurement of a
 double deflection, nd, was found to be very close indeed to
 360°. Then a double deflection was carefully measured, and
 if time permitted several times repeated, an observer always
 being at the eye-piece to see that the line did not move
 from the cross hairs while the micrometers were being read.
 Then, clamping the main circle, the grating-holder was turned
 through 245 until the line was very closely upon the cross
 hairs, any slight readjustments made necessary by this dis
 turbance of the instrument were made, and the process was
 repeated. In this way the initial line of the circle was finally
  reached and a value of np obtained which depended only on
  the algebraical sum of the micrometer-readings, always a
  small quantity.
    The determination of the temperature, a very difficult and
  uncertain matter in the case of glass gratings, is here com
 paratively simple. A sensitive thermometer (Baudin 6156)
 was kept in contact with the grating, its bulb being carefully
  shielded by cotton. The construction of the spectrometer
  made it impracticable to shield the grating effectively from
  radiation from the observer's body; but the thermometer
  apparently proved effective in giving the real temperature,
  since no discrepancies in the results could be traced to thermal
  causes. The thermometer-readings were made to 0°:05, and
  the temperature of observation rarely varied more than two
  or three degrees from 20°C.

354               Mr. Louis Bell on the Absolute
    The temperature being thus obtained, the necessary cor
rection was introduced directly into the angle of deviation.
Writing the formula for wave-length in the form
                           X = Cs sin b,
where C is a factor depending on the method in which the
 grating is used, and differentiating we obtain
                        8s
                         # = — cotto,

where, if we take 1° for the temperature variation,  : is  the
coefficient of expansion.    Whence
                                  8s
                                  S
                          8p– cot b
 correction for 1° variation in temperature. For grating III.,
 for instance, 84 =2"688; and by this means all the deviations
 were reduced to 20°. Writing again the equation for wave
 length in the form for the method here used,
                          c=sin b cos 6.
 Now to obtain the variation in p due to a change in the angle
between the telescopes,
                       8qb=tan b tan 666.
 Taking now 86=1" and b as found in these experiments,
                           84–0",089.
 By this means the necessary correction could be introduced
 in the angle of deviation, but the angle between the tele
 scopes was so nearly constant as to render this correction
 needless.
     The line selected for measurement with III. was a sharp
 one in the green at 5133.95 of Rowland's map. The angle
  6 between the telescopes was adjusted so that in the eighth
 order the double deflection was 72°. Eighteen complete
 series of observations were then obtained, £ giving a value
 of 10p, from which the errors of the circle were completely
 eliminated. The results in detail were as follows, corrected
  to 20° on thermometer used:—

   The last decimal place is retained simply for convenience
in averaging. The mean value of p is 36° 0' 26"-07, which,
reduced for the error of thermometer at 20°, gives finally
                        $=36° 0' 25";17.
The probable error of this value is 0"14. The effect of a
small error in b on the resulting wave-length is given at
once by                    öA= cos (böp.
    In this case the error introduced by an error of 1" in b is
a little less than 1 part in 250000.
    The mean value of 6 during these measurements was
                        6= 6° 59' 58'56.
 In case of grating IV. the line selected for observation was
one of Rowland’s standards at w.l. 5914:319 of his prelimi
nary list. It is a very close double, the components being
 distant from each other something like 75'oo of their wave
 length. The double deflection was as before 72°, but in the
 fifth order. As with grating III. eighteen series of obser
 vations were obtained, with the following resulting values
of b :—

   During the observations with grating III. the barometric
height reduced to the place of £ was very nearly
762 millim, but during the work with grating IV. it was
 phenomenally high, reaching an average value of 766 millim,
 an amount so far from normal pressure as to render a small
 correction necessary.
   The mean temperature during the observations with III.
 was about 21°C., but in the case of IV. it averaged almost
 exactly 20°C., varying at most only two or three degrees from
 that figure.
                  Measurement of the Gratings.
    The comparator on which this, the most important portion
 of the research, was accomplished was the same one described
 in my previous paper. It had, however, been improved in
 several particulars. The platform carrying the standards had
 been fitted with smooth rack-and-screw adjustments, and the
 microscopes and micrometers were new. The illumination of
 a grating under the power used,—two hundred and fifty

                        Wave-length of Light.                357
 diameters—is by no means an easy matter, and at the same
 time a   £          and symmetrical illumination is absolutely
 necessary for the most accurate work, particularly in the case
 of rather small grating-spaces. I had been thoroughly dis
 satisfied with the illumination previously used—a lamp at a
 suitable distance—and now made a radical change. A three
 candle power electric lamp was attached directly to the
 microscope just below the eyepiece and about a foot above the
 objects measured. A small mirror carried by an arm screwed
 to the objective reflected the beam into the Tolles illuminator.
 A glass bulb filled with water surrounded the light and
 served the double purpose of stopping radiation and partially
 condensing the beam upon the mirror above mentioned.
    I am aware that such an arrangement is somewhat revolu
 tionary, and it was only after a careful trial that I convinced
 myself that the heat from so near a source was not injurious.
    In the first place, it should be noted that the lamp is only
 used for a few moments at a time and at intervals long com
 £      with the time of observation. Thus the very minute
  eat-wave that reaches the bar through the bulb of water can
not possibly produce a perceptible rise of temperature during
the time of an observation, while during the intervals it is
 completely dissipated.
   As an experimental fact, no heating effect whatever is
sensible even after a whole day’s observations. To show at
once this fact, and the general character of an average series
of comparisons I subjoin ten comparisons of DmiS", with a
certain decimetre on glass, made at intervals of about three
quarters of an hour on two successive days. The figures are
taken directly from my note-book.

358               Mr. Louis Bell on the Absolute
radiation should be at their maximum; but the preceding
series, including as it does all the experimental errors, and
showing an extreme variation of but 0"5 leaves, I think,
little to be desired.
   The comparator was placed in a vault some six feet below
the level of the street, which was provided with thick double
walls with an air-space between. This observing-room enabled
the temperature to be kept down to a daily variation of less
than half a degree, the extreme range for several days being
frequently less than that amount. Before this vault in the
new Physical Laboratory was completed, the comparator had
been placed in an upper room of one of the old buildings,
where it was well nigh impossible to keep anything like a
constant temperature, particularly since the heat was unavoid
ably partially shut off during the night. Owing to this state
of affairs the measurement of the gratings on which my pre
liminary wave-length was based was made under difficulties,
and in most of the series necessarily under a rising tempera
ture. Now when a glass standard is measured against a metal
one, glass, being a notoriously bad conductor, and having a
very small coefficient of expansion, if any rise of temperature
takes place the length found for the glass will be too small, for,
responding less readily to a change, it will be actually measured
at a lower temperature.
   It therefore became necessary to re-measure the glass
gratings Nos. I. and II., to eliminate this source of error,
which was done before the results for III. and IV. were
obtained. These gratings are very nearly 3 centim. long, and
they were therefore compared with successive triple centi
metres of S*2 until the fifteen-centimetre mark was reached.
Grating I. was first taken in hand and six complete series
of observations were obtained, each micrometer reading
being the mean of several, and the extreme limits of tem
perature-variation during the two days occupied by the
comparisons being 0°-3C. The following gives a summary
of the results:—
                         Cill,    8.
                  5G = 15 Sag + 19.0

                  5G = 15 S", + 18:3)
 Hence combining. these and reducing them to the standard
temperature of 20° we have:—
        60,000 spaces=5G=15 centim. S", +5"2 at 20°.

                     Wave-length of Light.                 359
   The micrometer-constant here used was that of the new
micrometer, where 18=0"257.
   In precisely the same way grating II. was remeasured, the
six series giving the following relations:
                      Cn,        8.
                5G =  15 S", +157.4
                5G =  15 S', 4-154-9
                5G =  15 S", +154.5 At 199.8 C.
                5G =  15 S"2+152.4
                5G =  15 S", +1549
               5G =   15 S", + 1624.
Combining and reducing these results as before, we have the
equation
       42640 spaces=5G=15 centim. S', '+39"9 at 20°.
The temperature-variation in the two days of observation was
only 0°-2.
   &: III. and IV. were then measured.          In this case a
large number of comparisons were obtained at both high and
low temperatures with the object of detecting any differences
which might exist between the coefficients of expansion of
the gratings and those of the speculum-metal standards. III.
and IV. being a little over a decimetre in length were very
easy to measure, particularly since the lines were very sharp
' of approximately the same width as those on the
standards.
   III. proved to have sensibly the same coefficient as the
standards. I subjoin the comparisons made at or very near
20°:—
                                       8.
                     G=    DmiS"2+32.9

                     G=       ,     +32.6
                     G=       ,     +34.5

                     G=       ,     +32.6
   Combining these and other series of observations gives
finally
          28418 spaces = G = DmiS", +8°5 at 20°.
   It should be noted that the extreme variation in the above

 360              Mr. Louis Bell on the Absolute
 series is 2*2, very nearly 0”5, or one part in two hundred
 thousand.
    In the case of IV. the coefficient appeared to be somewhat
 smaller than that of S". The range of temperature secured
 was not large, but as nearly as could be ascertained the coeffi
 cient is about 16"1 per metre per degree, while that of the
 standards is 17".9 per metre per degree. However, since
 the measurements of p made with IV. were distributed with
 a tolerable degree of symmetry on both sides of 20°, any
 error due to an inexact value of the coefficient of expansion
 would appear mainly in the probable error of p. The varia
 tion found would, as a matter of fact, have changed the final
 value of p by less than 0^2.
   The comparisons of IV. made near 20° were as follows:–
                                       8.
                      G = DmiS", + 35.8
                      G =      ,    +35.5
                      G=       ,    +35.6
                      G=       ,    +36.0
                      G=       ,    +34:0
                      G=       ,    +35.8
                      G =      ,    +34-6
                      G=       ,    +36.3
                      G=       ,    +33.3
Combining these and the other observations,
            39,465 spaces=G=Dm,S' +9° 1 at 20°.
   The probable error of the relations found for III. and IV.
can hardly exceed one part in a million so far as the distance
between the terminal lines selected is concerned.    These ter
minal lines were varied at each comparison, so that while each
of the above relations represents 39,465 spaces, the lines
measured between, though in the same vicinity, are seldom or
never identical.
   In gratings I., II., III. the number of spaces was very
easily counted, as the dividing-engine automatically rules
every hundredth line longer, and every fiftieth line shorter,
than the others. In grating IV. the number of spaces was
found readily enough by     £      at a known temperature the
terminal lines of a test-plate almost exactly a decimetre long,
and containing a known number of lines. A comparison of
this with the grating gave the quantity required.

                         Wave-length of Light.                 361
the errors of ruling in a grating were briefly noticed.     It will
be well here to enter somewhat more into detail.
    The grating-space is never perfectly uniform throughout
the whole extent of the ruled surface. The variations may be
in general classed as regular and irregular.     In the first class
we put variations in the grating-space which are purely
periodic or purely linear. These produce respectively
“ghosts” and difference in focus of the spectra on opposite
sides of the normal. Either fault might be large enough to
unfit the grating for wave-length determination, and would
always be undesirable, but nevertheless would introduce no
gross errors into the result. Variations of the second class
include the displacement, omission or exaggeration of a line
or lines, and, what is of great importance, a more or less
sudden change in the grating-space producing a section of
the grating having a grating-space peculiar to itself. The
former types of accidental error, unless extensive, are harm
less, and are present in most gratings, usually showing as
faint streaks in the ruling. It is with the last-mentioned
error that we mainly have to do.
   Consider a   £       the spacing of which is sensibly uniform
except throughout a certain portion. Let that portion have a
grating-space distinctly larger or smaller than that of the
remainder of the grating. If the abnormal portion is a con
siderable fractional part of the whole grating it will, in
general, produce false lines and injure or ruin the definition
of the grating. Such a grating we should now throw aside
as useless,   £         many of the older gratings are thus
affected. Suppose, however, that the abnormal portion is con
fined to a few hundred lines.    Such a series of lines will have
little brilliancy and less defining-power, and consequently will
simply diffuse a certain amount of light without either pro
ducing false lines or, in general, injuring the definition. In
short, when the full aperture of the grating is used, the
spectra produced will be due only to the normal grating-space,
£ abnormal portion having little or no visible effect. If,
however, we attempt to evaluate the grating-space by measur
ing the total  £       of the ruled surface and dividing it by
the number of spaces therein contained, we shall obtain an
incorrect result, since this average grating-space, including, as
it does, the abnormal portion, will be necessarily different
from the normal grating-space which produces the spectra
observed.
   In general, if n be the total number of spaces and s the
normal grating-space, the length of the £ surface will be
ns +A, where A is a quantity depending on the magnitude

362               Mr. Louis Bell on the Absolute
and nature of the abnormal portion.           It will have for its maxi
mum value X(s—s'), where s'is the varying grating-space, in
the case when the change in the spacing is £ and sudden
as to produce no effect at all on the spectrum ; and will be
variously modified by the considerations now to be mentioned.
If we could always assume that the abnormal portion of the
grating produced no effect on the spectrum, the elimination of
errors of ruling would thus become comparatively simple.
But in practice it is not very uncommon to find gratings in
which d'. are several portions where the spacing is abnormal,
in one case perhaps producing no effect, in a second producin
 false lines, and in a third causing a faint shading off of the
lines. For an abnormal portion will produce no effect, a
 slight shading, or reduplicated lines, according to its extent
 and the amount of its variation from the normal.
    The following experiment will readily show the laws which
 govern these errors of ruling. Place a rather bad grating—
 unfortunately only too easily obtained—on the spectrometer,
 and setting the cross-hairs carefully on a prominent line,
 gradually cover the grating with a bit of paper, slowly moving
 it along from one end. In very few cases will the line stay
 upon #. cross-hairs. A typical succession of changes in the
 spectrum is as follows: Perhaps no change is observed until
 two-thirds of the grating has been covered. Then a faint
 shading appears on one side of the line, grows stronger as
 more and more of the grating is covered, and                   £     is
 terminated by a faint line. Then this line grows stronger till
 the original line appears double and finally disappears, leaving
 the displaced line due to the abnormal grating-space. This
 description, I regret to say, is from the examination of a
 grating which had been used for the determination of absolute
 wave-lengths." This case is exceptionally complete, but even
 with a very good grating minute displacements can usually
 be noticed.
    When the abnormal portion is sufficiently extensive to pro
 duce a faint shading along one side of the lines when the full
 aperture of the grating is used, the effect of the error on the
 resulting wave-length may be in part eliminated by the fact
 that the shading would displace the apparent centre of the
  line and hence slightly change the observed angle of deviation.
  For this reason a grating so affected would be likely to give
 results varying with the order of spectrum used, since the
 appearance of the line would vary somewhat with the illumi
  nation. It is at once apparent, however, that no combination
              * Not by the author it is almost needless to add.

                          Wave-length of Light.                 363
  of the results from different orders of spectra can possibly
  eliminate the class of errors we are discussing, since the
  algebraic sign of the error will be the same for all orders, and
  # ' be in every case a nearly constant fraction of the wave
   ength.
        e problem before the experimenter is then the following:
  To detect the existence and position of any abnormal portion
  of the grating in use, to separate as far as possible such
  portions as produce a visible effect from those which do not,
  and thus finally to determine the proper value to be assigned
  to the quantity A.
     The investigation is somewhat simplified by the fact that,
  for the most part, abnormal spacing occurs at an end of the
  ruled surface, generally at the end where the ruling was
  begun, since, when the engine is started, it is likely to run for
  some little time before it settles down to a uniform state.
 Then, too, one is able to disregard the slight and gradual
 variations in the grating-space which appear in every grating,
 since their effects will in general be integrated in the spectrum
 produced.
     It only remains, therefore, to study those larger and more
 sudden changes which can produce a sensible error in the
 result. It is evident that the process of examination indicated
 above will serve to detect the more extensive faults, together
 with any errors of figure in the surface, but an abnormal
 portion, consisting of only a few hundred lines, will not have
 resolving power enough to produce a marked effect. Making
 then a slit in a card just wide enough to expose a sufficient
 number of lines to give tolerable definition, one can examine
 the grating, section by section, and still further discriminate
 between the normal and abnormal spacing, errors of figure
 being included as before. But as the number of abnormal
 spaces decreases, a point will be reached when this method
 breaks down completely; and since the error in the resulting
 wave-length may be as large in this case as when the fault is
 more extended, another method must be sought. So far as I
 know, the only method which will detect and evaluate all
 these errors is that which I have called calibration, measuring
the relative lengths of n grating-spaces taken successively
 along the ruled surface. The process employed was as
follows: The stops of the comparator were set as close to
   ether as practicable, limiting the run of the carriage to a
£ which varied in different cases from            4 to 10 millim.
Then the grating to be examined was brought under the
microscope, and micrometer-readings were taken on the lines
just within the run of the carriage; the grating was then

364              Mr. Louis Bell on the Absolute
moved along about the length of the run, and the process
repeated till the whole grating had been gone over. The
variations in the micrometer-readings then gave the variations
in the length of n spaces in different parts of the grating.
The only assumption involved was that the variation in the
different sections did not amount to an entire space, an
hypothesis quite secure in gratings with spaces as large as
those employed.      It was thus possible to determine quite
accurately the variations in the grating-space throughout the
whole grating.
   It should #. noted that, since these variations may be of
almost any kind and magnitude, the errors produced by them
will not in general be eliminated by combining the results
obtained from several gratings. It may happen that the
gratings used by one experimenter will have errors that will
counterbalance each other, while those used by another will all
have errors of the same sign. For instance, by the merest
accident the gratings used by the writer gave nearly identical
results corrected and uncorrected, while those used by Peirce
uniformly required a reduction in the resulting wave-length.
The number of gratings used by a given investigator is, how
ever, so small that the errors will very seldom be eliminated;
while no combination of the results obtained from different
orders of the same grating can produce any useful effect
whatever.
   Each of the gratings used in this research was examined
minutely by the above methods, and in each was found an
abnormal portion of one sort or another. Of eight gratings
which I have calibrated all have shown a similar error; and of
more than twenty which I have examined in the spectrometer
only one (grating III.) failed to show an abnormal section at .
one end.    Since this is the commonest form of the error in
question, it is but natural to inquire why it cannot be avoided
by covering the defective end. The reason is simple enough.
By stopping out the defective portion the grating is reduced
to an incommensurable length, which       £,           increases
the difficulty of measuring it. A grating which is in length
some convenient submultiple of a metre is easy to measure
with a comparatively high degree of exactness; but one which
is, say, twenty-seven millimetres long, is exceedingly difficult
to measure accurately, since it involves a long micrometer run
or the errors of subdivision down to single millimetres. It is,
therefore, better to use the full aperture of the grating and
find A by calibration.
   In calibrating the gratings used, I divided I. and II., which
were thirty millimetres long, into six sections of 5 millim.,

            The calibration of III. is worth describing in detail. Cen
         timetre 3 was evidently too long. I therefore measured the
         centimetres from 15 to 25 millim, and from 25 to 35 millim.
         The former was quite normal, but the latter showed an increase
         almost identical with that of the whole third centimetre.           I
         then examined the grating in a strong light and detected at
         27 millim. from the end a faint line, such as usually indicates
         a few wavering lines, caused perhaps by dust under the
         diamond point.         Placing, however, this line under the micro
         scope, a band of perhaps twenty lines appeared with spacing
         noticeably wider than usual. Here was a very serious flaw
         in a grating to all appearance absolutely perfect. A most
         critical examination in the spectrometer of course failed to
         detect it, but it was both detected and located with unerring
         certainty by the process of calibration. Micrometrical
         measurements on this group showed an excess of about 2".5
         over an equal number of spaces elsewhere on the grating.
         This quantity, of course, had to be taken account of in
         connexion with the previous calibration.
            The deduction of the necessary corrections from the data
         given by calibration requires no little care and judgment, and
         can be properly done only in connexion with a detailed study
         of the spectra given by various portions of the gratings con
         cerned. For the four gratings used by the author, these
         corrections, applied directly to the lengths of the gratings in

 as follows:—

   It should be distinctly understood that the corrections
deduced from the calibration are necessarily only approximate.
A very minute examination of a grating on the spectrometer
is impossible, since a small section of the ruled surface has
not sufficient resolving power to give measurable spectra.
 On the other hand, while calibration gives the variations of
 the grating-space with a high degree of exactness, it obviously
cannot definitely decide how far these variations are integrated
in the spectrum measured. Consequently, while calibration
will in every case give a valuable approximation, it must
necessarily leave residual errors.
   In these experiments the gratings were always measured
parallel to the terminations of the lines. Consequently the
length of each grating as found directly must be multiplied
by cos (90°-a), where a is the angle made by an individual
line with the line formed by the locus of the terminations.
In the case of gratings I, II, III, this angle was found by
measuring a test-plate as described in my previous paper, and
WaS  ' to be within a very few seconds of 89° 56'.
   Grating IV, ruled on the new engine, was tested by
measuring the sides and diagonals of the ruled surface, and
gave an almost exactly identical value of a., No correction,
therefore, need be introduced for this cause, since cos (90°–a)
does not differ sensibly from unity.
             Final Result for Absolute Wave-length.
   Only one equation needs to be added to those already given
for Sag. This is the one for the third 5-centim. space, neces
sary to determine the absolute length of the first 15 centim.
5-centim, (3) and (4) were compared, and the following
relation was found between them: (4)=(3)+0"4.               The
relation found in 1885 was (4)=(3) + 1"1. Consequently
(3) has not sensibly shortened, and nearly the whole change
found in S* has taken place in the last five centimetres.

    Reducing now these latterwave-lengths to the corresponding
 values of D1, introducing the barometric corrections and com
 bining, the final results for that line are:—
             Grating.                              W. L.

    Finally, then, the mean value of the absolute wave-length of
 D1 in terms of the mean value assigned to S", is
                                     5896-18
 in air at 760 millim. pressure and 20°C. temperature, or, in
 vacuo,                            5897.90.
     It is no easy matter to form an estimate of the probable error
  of this final result. So far as errors of observation go, the
  result should be correct to within one part in half a million,
  but there are so many complex sources of constant errors in
  this problem that '. a statement means little. My present
  result exceeds the estimated probable error of my former
  result considerably, though it falls within the limit set by
  Prof. Rowland and myself for the possible error, and noted
  in his paper on “Relative Wave-lengths” of the same date as

368                    Mr. Louis Bell on the Absolute
my own. The cause of this discrepancy is partly due to the
varying temperature under which the glass gratings were
first measured, and partly to the change in the value assigned
to the standard of length.*
   Then, too, the corrections applied to gratings II. and III.
may be slightly in error. Taking into account all these
sources of uncertainty, it is my opinion that the above final
result is not likely to be in error by an amount as great as one
part in two hundred thousand.
   Taking the above value of the absolute wave-length and
applying the appropriate corrections to some of the funda
mental lines given in Prof. Rowland’s paper (this Journal,
March 1887), the wave-lengths of the principal Fraunhofer
lines in air at 20° and 760 millim. are,

    Comparisons between these wave-lengths and the older
ones become somewhat uncertain toward the ends of the
spectrum, since the ' of lines like A, B, G, and H
varies greatly with the dispersion employed. The relative
wave-lengths from which the above values are calculated are
certainly exact to within one part in half a million.
   It may not be out of place here to discuss the most
recent work on this problem. Just before the publication of
my first paper the '. elaborate paper of Müller and Kempf
appeared. Their work is a monument of laborious
and it is unfortunate that so much time should have
                                                                 £
been spent in experiments conducted with glass gratings of
small size and inferior quality. Since the invention of the
concave grating it is a waste of energy to make micrometric
measurements with plane ones, and this statement could
hardly be corroborated more strongly than by the relative
   * In terms of the length I originally assigned to S', the wave-length of
D, would be 5896:14,       while if the value deduced from the Berlin Conn
parison were taken it would be 5896:22. The wave-length quite certainly
iies between these values, but the proper weight to be given to the Berlin
comparison relatively to the others is rather uncertain.

                        Wave-length of Light.                       369
wave-lengths given by Müller and Kempf. The probable
error of their wave-lengths is in general not less than one
part in two hundred thousand. That the value assigned by
them to the absolute wave-length is as near the truth as it
probably is, is not due to lack of faults in the gratings. Their
results for the line D1 were as follows:—
                      Grating.                   W.L.
                   “2151 *       .  .   .   .  5896.46

                   “8001 L *     .  .   .   .  5896.33
    A discussion of these errors as exemplified in the paper
under consideration would take up too much space to be in
serted here, but one or two points are worthy of notice.
When a grating gives different results in the different orders,
it is evident that there are in it serious errors of ruling, and
the maximum amount of the variation will give a rough
 estimate of their size as compared with those of other gratings.
Applying this test, the four gratings rank as follows:–
“5001,” “8001 L,” “2151,” “8001,” where the first, which
 gave for the w.l. 5896:14, had no sensible variation in the
 different orders, and the last, which gave 5895-97, varied in
 the most erratic fashion. It by no means follows, however,
that because a grating gives identical results in the various
 orders, it is therefore free from errors of ruling. Witness
 grating III. of this paper, in which the error was of a kind
 which could not be detected at all in the spectrometer. Yet
 it was large enough to give, if neglected, 5896:28 for the
 wave-length of Di". Speaking of errors in gratings, a case
 in point is the work of Peirce. On account of the reasons
 heretofore noted, Peirce's standards of length are somewhat
 uncertain in value, so that from this cause no definite cor
 rection can be as yet applied to his wave-length. Three of his
 gratings, however, I have calibrated, and each of them showed
 an error tending to diminish the wave-length. If the mean
 result obtained from these had been assumed to be correct, it
 would have been equivalent to the introduction of a constant
 error. Peirce's preliminary result is for this reason too large
 by more than one part in a hundred thousand; how much
 more, it is impossible to say without knowing the results
   * The results given by the gratings used by the author, neglecting the
 correction A, would be as follows:–
            I, 5896:20; II. 5896-14; III, 5896.28; IV. 5896.12.
Curiously enough the mean would be practically unchanged.

370              Mr. Louis Bell on the Absolute
obtained from each grating, and so being able to apply the
corrections found.    Peirce's method was such as should have
secured very excellent results, and such will undoubtedly
follow a further investigation of the standards and gratings.
Still another recent determination is that by Kurlbaum, who
used two good-sized speculum-metal gratings and measured
them with particular care. Like the previous experimenters,
he neglected, although he did not ignore, the errors of ruling,
and consequently the results he obtained are somewhat in
doubt. A serious objection, moreover, to his work is the
very small spectrometer he used. To undertake a determi
nation of absolute wave-length with a spectrometer reading
by verniers to 10' only, and furnished with telescopes of
only one-inch aperture is simply courting constant errors.
More especially is this true, since it would be hard to devise
a method more effective in introducing the errors of ruling
than to use a grating with telescopes too small to utilize its
full aperture, and then determine the grating-space by
measuring the total length of the ruled surface. Kurlbaum’s
gratings, too, were of an unfortunate size, 42 and 43 millim.
broad respectively, and consequently by no means easy to
measure. On the whole his result, 5895'90, is not surprising.
   The agreement of relative wave-lengths as determined by
different experimenters unfortunately gives no measure as to
the accuracy of the work. The relative wave-lengths, as
determined by Müller and Kempf and by Kurlbaum, agree in
general to within 1 part in 100,000; the absolute wave-lengths
assigned by these experimenters vary by more than 1 part in
30,000.
   A very ingenious flank movement on the problem of ab
solute wave-length has been made by Macé de Lépinay. His
plan was to use interference-fringes in getting the dimensions
of a block of quartz in terms of the wave-length, and then to
avoid the difficulties of the linear measurement by obtaining
the volume through a specific-gravity determination. His
results do not indicate, however, experimental accuracy as
great as can be obtained by the usual method, and the final
reduction unfortunately involves a quantity even more un
certain than the average standard of length, i.e. the ratio
between the metre (?) and the litre.
   It may be interesting here to collect the various values
which have been given for the absolute wave-length within
recent years.   Results are for the line D1.

   These figures are discordant enough. When beginning
the present work, I had hoped that it would prove possible
to make a determination of absolute wave-length commen
surate in accuracy with the relative wave-lengths as measured
by Prof. Rowland. This hope has proved in a measure illu
sory, by reason of the small residual errors of the gratings
and the greater uncertainty involving the standards of     £
I feel convinced, however, that the result reached is quite
near the limit of accuracy of the method. It should be re
membered that any and every method involves the uncer
tainty of the standards of length, an uncertainty not to be
removed until a normal standard is finally adopted and exact
£       of it distributed. And as far as experimental diffi
culties are concerned, the next order of approximation will
involve a large number of small but troublesome corrections,
such as the effect of aqueous ' on atmospheric refrac
tion, varying barometric height, the minute variations in the
grating-space, failure of thermometer to give temperature of
  rating exactly, and countless others which will suggest
themselves only too readily.
   Aside from the use of gratings, decidedly the most hopeful
method as yet suggested is that due to Michelson and       £
Theoretically the plan is particularly simple and beautiful,
consisting merely in counting off a definite number of inter
ference-fringes by moving one of the interfering-mirrors and
measuring, or laying off upon a bar, the resulting distance.
The mechanical difficulties in the way are, however, formid
able, and whether or no they can be surmounted only per
sistent trial can show. The possible sources of error are of
much the same type and magnitude as those involved in the
comparison of standards of length; and if these errors are
avoided, the uncertainty concerning the standards still remains.
Whether or no the practical errors of the method are greater

XLVIII. The Temperature at which Nickel begins to lose sud
    denly its Magnetic Properties.          By HERBERT TOMLINSON,
    B.A."
 IT has long been known            that nickel, like iron, begins at a
     certain temperature to rapidly lose its magnetic properties,
and that the critical temperature for the former metal is much
lower than for the latter. According to Faraday, nickel loses
its magnetic permeability about 330° to 340° C.; according
to Becquerel, about 400° C.; according to Pouillet, about
350° C.; and according to Chrystal, about 400° C. Berson,
however, seems to have been the first f to publish a curve
showing the relation between magnetic induction and tempe
rature right up to the point at which the former ceases prac
tically to exist. The author has also, independently of Berson,
drawn up curves of a similar kind which have not as yet been
  ublished, and which he ventures to offer to the            £
£          because they not only supplement Berson's results,
but they seem also to partly explain why different observers
have obtained such widely differing temperatures for the point
of nil permeability#.
    In the axis of a magnetizing solenoid, and perpendicular to
the magnetic meridian, was placed a nickel wire, 30 centim.

    Nickel begins to lose suddenly its Magnetic Properties. 373
round a brass tube slit throughout its entire length, and havin
an internal diameter of 2.5 centim.       Before ££
round the brass tube the wire was well coated with pipeclay
moistened in water. Round 10 centim. of the central portion
of the solenoid were wrapped 240 turns of another piece of the
same wire, also coated with pipeclay, to serve as a secondary
coil.  The whole was then introduced into an air-chamber and
the wet pipeclay allowed to dry, at first slowly at the tempe
rature of the air, and afterwards more quickly at temperatures
which were gradually raised to 400°C. The air-chamber
consisted of two concentric copper cylinders 40 centim. in
length, enclosing between them an annular space about 5
centim. thick which was filled with fine sand, and was heated
by a row of burners placed underneath. The temperature of
the air-chamber was calculated from the alteration of electrical
resistance of a coil of platinum wire, whose resistance had
been very carefully determined at different temperatures up
to 100°C., and expressed in terms of the temperature by a
formula of the form
                     R, = Ro(1+ at-bt”),
where R, and Ro are the resistances at t°C. and 0°C. respec
tively, and a and b are constants. The platinum coil was
wound double and was placed inside the slit brass tube close
to the nickel wire, but insulated from it and the tube by
asbestos; the length of the coil was 10 centim., and it occupied
the central portion of the air-chamber. To the ends of the
coil were hard-soldered stout copper terminal rods, which
passed through a wooden cap closing one end of the air
chamber, and served to connect with a Wheatstone-bridge
arrangement employed for determining the resistance of the
platinum. The other end of the air-chamber was also closed
with a wooden cap, through holes in which passed the ends of
the wires of the magnetizing solenoid and the secondary coil.
After the pipeclay coating had become thoroughly dry the
resistances of the primary and secondary coils were tested, and
found to be sensibly the same as before winding. The object
of coating the cotton covering of the wires with pipeclay was
to maintain the insulation, for at the temperatures reached in
some of the experiments the cotton became charred. Whilst
the coils lay undisturbed the pipeclay coating served the pur
pose for which it was intended very well; but when they
were removed from the air-chamber on the conclusion of the
experiments, both the charred cotton and the pipeclay easily
came away from the wire, and so rendered the coils useless.
   A pair of primary and secondary coils exactly similar to the

374       Mr. H. Tomlinson on the Temperature at which
 first, except that they had no pipeclay coating and no nickel
 core inside, was kept buried in a box filled with well-dried
 sawdust and placed about two feet away from the air-chamber.
 The two primary coils were connected up in series with each
 other, a battery, a key, a rheostat, and a tangent-galvanometer
 whose constant had been previously carefully determined.
 The secondary coils were also connected up in series with
 each other, with a rheostat, a Thomson's reflecting-galvano
 meter, and an earth-coil.     The earth-coil consisted of seven
 turns of silk-covered copper wire laid side by side round the
 circumference of a wooden disk 30 centim. in diameter; the
 disk was supported with its plane horizontal, but could be
 turned £ a horizontal axis in either direction through an
 angle of 180 degrees. The ends of the wires round the disk
 were soldered to amalgamated copper disks revolving in
 mercury-cups, which last served to connect the earth-coil
with the rest of the apparatus in series with it. The two
pairs of primary and secondary coils were so arranged that
the currents induced on opening or closing the battery-circuit
by means of the key exactly balanced each other before the
introduction of the nickel into one of them.     When therefore
the nickel was introduced, the observed deflection produced
by opening or closing the primary circuit was entirely due to
the magnetic permeability of the nickel; and by comparing
this deflection with that produced by turning the earth-coil
suddenly through 180° the permeability could be determined
in absolute measure, since the vertical component of the
earth's magnetic force at the place was known. The earth
coil also served another purpose, namely to secure with the
aid of the rheostat the constancy of the sensitiveness of the
Thomson-galvanometer. As the temperature of the air
chamber was raised, the total resistance in both primary and
secondary circuits increased; but by altering the rheostats in
these circuits until the deflection of the tangent-galvanometer
in the one case, and of the Thomson-galvanometer, when the
earth-coil was suddenly turned, in the other, became the same
as before the heating, constancy both in the magnetizing force
and in the sensitiveness of the Thomson-galvanometer was
secured.
   The mode of proceeding was as follows:–By means of the
set of burners underneath the air-chamber the temperature
was raised to nearly the highest point which it was desirable
to attain; the burners were then adjusted until the tempera
ture was either constant or very slowly rising or falling; this
could always be secured by waiting for a sufficient length of
time. The rheostat in the secondary circuit was then adjusted

    Nickel begins to lose suddenly its Magnetic Properties. 375
until the deflection of the Thomson-galvanometer, produced
by suddenly turning the earth-coil, was exactly 80 divisions
of the scale. The rheostat in the primary circuit was next
adjusted until the required current had been reached, care
being taken to begin with a small current, which was increased
very gradually to the required amount. As it was the aim of
the author to test only the temporary permeability” of the
nickel, the current in the primary circuit was opened and
closed a great many times, until the current induced on closing
the circuit became the same in magnitude as that induced on
opening the circuit; and then the mean of the deflections
produced by ten times closing the circuit was taken to
measure the temporary induction. The air-chamber was
now allowed to cool a little, and then, as before, after the
temperature had been steadied by adjusting the burners, a
fresh set of observations was made, and so on until the tempe
rature of the room was reached.           As soon as the observations
with the lowest magnetizing force had been completed, fresh
ones were made with a higher magnetizing force until a mag
netizing force of 18,183 C.G.S. units had £ reached.
   The temporary permeability of the nickel was calculated
from the following formulae:—

of the nickel under the magnetizing force was about 350 times
the diameter, the effect of the ends is quite negligible. The

  It seems from the above table and the curves in fig. 1 that
the temperature of maximum permeability is lower the greater
the magnetizing force. Thus, for the magnetizing forces
4.959, 9-918, and 18:183, we get the temperatures of maxi
mum permeability as 287°, 248°, and 242°C. respectively.

 378            On the Magnetic Properties of Nickel.
     The temperature at which the permeability practically
 vanishes seems, on the other hand, to be higher £ greater
  the magnetizing force. As for the above-mentioned magne
  tizing forces, we have for this temperature the values 333°,
  392°, and 412°C. respectively. In this respect the behaviour
 of nickel resembles that of iron, as is evidenced by the curves
 in fig. 3; and it is probably partly for this reason £ different
 observers have obtained different results for the temperature
 of nil-permeability. Another cause for the discrepancies in
 this respect between the observations of different experimen
 ters is probably to be found in the want of purity of the metal;
 for it is evident that if iron be present as an impurity, the
 point of nil-permeability may be rendered very much higher".
 The observations made by the author were not in any case
 carried right up to the vanishing-point of the permeability, as
 the nickel used by him was, though nearly, not quite puref;
 and it is not at all unlikely that, had this £ done, the ter
 minations of the curves would more nearly resemble those of
 Berson, shown in fig. 2, where it will be noticed that there is
 a point of inflexion before 320°C. The author does not
 believe that, even with perfectly pure nickel, the magnetic
 permeability would entirely vanish; but the following ex
 periment will show that, with a thin layer of pure nickel,
 the permeability practically vanishes with great sudden
 ness:—A brass wire 1 millim. in diameter was coated with
 a thin layer of nickel by electrolysis, and a piece of it, about
 2 centim. in length, was suspended horizontally in a cradle of
 platinum between the pole-pieces of a powerful electromagnet
 in a direction perpendicular to the lines of magnetic force;
 the platinum cradle was supported by a platinum wire 12
 inches long and Tlo inch in diameter. The nickel-plated
 brass wire was heated by a burner to a temperature of visible
 red, and the electromagnet was then excited by five Grove
 cells. Not the slightest effect of the intense field seemed to
be experienced by the nickel, even after it had been cooling
for several seconds. The magnetizing circuit was now broken,
leaving only the residual magnetism in the pole-pieces, when,
after a few seconds of further cooling, and without the least
preliminary warning, the wire set axially with startling rapidity.
   * The temperature at which the permeability of iron vanishes seems,
from Ledeboer's curves, to lie between 750° and 770° C.
   + The wire was procured from Messrs. Johnson and Matthey, who
informed the author that they found it impossible to draw pure nickel
wire. Mr. G. S. Johnson, the Demonstrator of Chemistry at King's
College, London, has kindly furnished an analysis of the wire. It con
tains 97.5 per cent of nickel and only 0.67 per cent of iron.

   The chief aim of the author in this research was to fix ap
proximately the temperature at which the rate of loss of
permeability begins to be greatest; and this appears to be
300° C., not only for the specimen of nickel used by him, but
also for that used by Berson, and this, too, both for the tem
porary and total magnetization. The following table shows
the rate at which the temporary permeability decreases with
rise of temperature between 300° and 320°C.

   From this table it is apparent that the rate of decrease of .
permeability is less the higher the magnetizing force; so much
so indeed that whereas, with a magnetizing force of about 5

decrease of 11 lines of force per square centimetre; with a
force of 18 the loss of lines per degree is only increased to 14.
XLIX. On Electromagnetic Waves, especially in relation to the
    Vorticity of the Impressed Forces; and the Forced Vibra
   tions of Electromagnetic Systems. By OLIVER HEAVISIDE.
                               [Continued from p. 156.]
                   Spherical Electromagnetic Waves.
15.  LPA' the                     subject of plane waves, those next in
             order of simplicity are the spherical. Here, at the
very   '. the question presents itself whether there can
be anything resembling condensational waves?
   Sir W. £ (Baltimore Lectures, as reported by Forbes
in “Nature,” 1884) suggested that a conductor charged rapidly
alternately + and – would cause condensational waves in
the aether. But there is no other way of charging it than by

380.     Mr. O. Heaviside on Electromagnetic Waves, and the
a current from somewhere else, so he suggested two conducting
spheres to be connected with the poles of an alternating dynamo.
The idea seems to be here that electricity would be forced out
of one sphere and into the other to and fro with great rapidity,
and that between the spheres there might be condensational
WaVeS.
   But in this case, according to the Faraday law of induction,
the result would be the setting up of alternating electromagnetic
disturbances in the dielectric, exposing the bounding surfaces
of the two spheres to rapidly alternating magnetizing and
electrizing force, causing waves, approximately spherical
at least, to be £ into the spheres, in the diffusion
manner, greatly attenuating as they progressed inward.
   Perhaps, however, there can be condensational waves if we
admit that a certain quite hypothetical something called elec
tricity is compressible, instead of being incompressible, as it
must be if we in Maxwell's scheme make the unnecessary
assumption that an electric current is the motion through
space of the something. In fact, Prof. J. J. Thomson has
calculated” the speed of condensational waves supposed to
arise by allowing the electric current to have convergence.
But a careful examination of his equations will show that the
condensational waves there investigated do not exist, i. e. the
function determining them has the value zerof.
   16. To construct a perfectly general spherical wave we may
proceed thus. The characteristic equation of H, the magnetic
force, in a homogeneous medium free from impressed force is,
by (2) and (3),
                      V*H=(47tukp +ucp”)H. . . . . (93)
   Now, let r be the vector distance from the origin, and Q any
scalar function satisfying this equation. Let
                          H= curl (r(Q). . . . . . . (94)
Then this derived vector will satisfy (93), and have no con
vergence, and have no radial component, or will be arranged
in spherical sheets. From it derive the other electromagnetic
quantities. Change H to E to obtain spherical sheets of
electric force.
    This method leads to the spherical sheets depending upon
any kind of spherical harmonic. They are, however, too
general to be really useful except as mathematical exercises.

   17. The simplest Spherical Waves.—Let the lines of H be
circles, centred upon the axis from which 6 is measured, and
let r be the distance from the origin. We have no concern
with b (longitude) as regards H, so that the simple specifi
cation of its intensity       fully defines it. Under these
circumstances the equation (93) becomes

where the acute accent denotes differentiation to r, and the
grave accent to cos 6 or u, whilst v stands for sin 6. The
inductivity will be now uo, to avoid confusing with the u of
zonal harmonics. Equation (95) also defines q in the three
forms it can assume in a conductor, dielectric, and conducting

   Now try to make of rH an undistorted spherical wave, i.e.
 H varying inversely as the distance, and travelling inward or
outward at speed v. Let

 more everyday quantities, let the angles 6, and 6, be small, for simplicity
 of representation; then we have two infinitely conducting tubes of gra
 dually increasing diameter enclosing between them a non-conducting
 dielectric. Now change the variables. Let V be the line-integral of E
 across the dielectric, following the direction of the force; it is the poten
tial-difference of the conductors. Let 4TC be the line-integral of H round
the inner tube; it is the same for a given value of r, independent of 6;
 C is therefore what is commonly called the current in the conductor. We
 shall have

according as m is odd or even, and an outer medium, or at
least one in which q has a different form in general. Then,

 the two sides *.
   * Some rather important considerations are presented here. On what
principles should we settle which functions to use, internally and exter
nally, seeing that these functions U and W are not quantities, but diffe
rential operators? First, as regards the space outside the surface of origin

    Now, at the surface of separation, r=a, H is continuous
(unless we choose to make it a sheet of electric current, which
we do not); so that the H in (117) and in (120) are the same.
We only require a relation between the E's to complete the
differential equation.

 of disturbances. The operator ear turns f(t) into f(t+r/v), and can there
 fore only be possible with a negative wave, coming to the origin. But
 there cannot be such a wave without a barrier or change of medium to
 produce it. Hence the operator e-47 alone can be involved in the external
 solution when the medium is unbounded, and we must use W. Next,
   o inside the sphere r=a. It is clear that both U and W are now needed,
      ause disturbances come to any point from the further as well as from
  the nearer side of the surface, thus coming from and going to the centre.
  Two questions remain: Why take U and W in equal ratio?; and why
  their sum or their difference, according as m is odd or even P. The first is
  answered by stating the facts that, although it is convenient to assume
  the origin to be a place of reflexion, yet it is really only a place where
  disturbances cross, and that the H produced at any point of the surface
  is (initially) equal on both sides of it. The second question is answered
  by stating the '' of the Q'm function, that it is an even function of
  u when m is odd, and conversely; so that when m is odd the H dis
  turbances arriving at   '', point   on a diameter from its two ends are of
  the same sign, requiring U+W; and when m is even, of opposite signs,
  requiring U-W.
      Similar reaso      applies to the operators concerned in other than
  spherical waves. . Cases of simple diffusion are brought under the same
  rules by generalizing the problem so as to #: wave-propagation with
   finite speed. On the other hand, when there are barriers, or changes of
   media, there is no difficulty, because the boundary conditions tell us
   in what ratio U and W must be taken.

 equation of the form f=qbH, and there is a change of medium somewhere,

property of the functions concerned comes into play. It causes a great
simplification in the form of p, and makes the last method fail completely,
all traces of the roots having disappeared. But if we pass continuously
from one case to the other, then the last formula becomes a definite inte
gral. On the other hand, we can immediately integrate f=q, H in its
simplified form, and obtain an interpretable equivalent for the definite
integral, which latter is more ornamental than useful. In the simplified
form, p may be either rational or irrational. The integration of the irra

It is particularly to be noticed that the ti part of (141) only
comes into operation when ti reaches zero, and similarly as
regards the to part. Thus, the first part expresses the primary
wave out from the surface; the second, arriving at any point
2a/v later than the first, is the reflected wave from the centre,
arising from the primary wave inward from the surface.
   The primary wave outward may be written
                   _ / fiv \ 1

where vt > (r—a), and the second wave by its exact negative,
with vt > (r-Ha). Now, by comparing (132) with (134), we
see that the internal solution is got from the external b
exchanging a and r in the {}'s in (139) and (141), including
also in ti and t2. The result is that (142) represents the
internal H in the primary inward wave, vt having to be
 > (a—r); whilst its negative represents the reflected wave,
provided vt= (a+r).
   The whole may be summed up thus. First, vt is < a.
Then (142) represents H everywhere between r=a+vt and
r= a-vt. But when vt is > a., H is given by the same
formula between the limits r=vt-a and vt +a.               In both
cases H is zero outside the limits named.

          Forced Vibrations of Electromagnetic Systems.     389
    The reflected wave, superimposed on the primary, annuls
 the H disturbance, which is therefore, after the reflexion,
 confined to a spherical shell of depth 2a containing the un
 cancelled part of the primary wave outward.
   The amplitude of H at the fronts of the two primary waves,
in and out, before the former reaches the centre, is
                         (fiva)+(2uovr).
After the inward wave has reached the centre, however, the
amplitude of H on the front of the reflected wave is the
negative of that of the primary wave at the same distance,
which is itself negative.             -
   The process of reflexion is a very remarkable one, and
difficult to fully understand. At the moment t=a/v that the
disturbance reaches the centre, we have H=(fiv)+(4wov),
constant, all the way from r=0 to 2a, which is just half the
initial value of H on leaving the surface of the sphere. But
just before reaching the centre, H runs up infinitely for an
infinitely short time, infinitely near the centre; and just
after the centre is reached we have H= -oo infinitely near
the centre, where the H disturbance is always zero, except
in this singular case when it is seemingly finite for an £
short time, though, of course, v is indeterminate.
   With respect to this running-up of the value of H in the
inward primary wave, it is to be observed that whilst H
is increasing so fast at and near its front, it is falling else
where, viz. between near the front and the surface of the
sphere; so that just before the centre is reached H has only
half the initial value, except close to the centre, where it
is enormously great.
   After reflexion has commenced, the H disturbance is
negative in the hinder part of the shell of depth 2a which
goes out to infinity, positive of course still in the forward
part. At a great distance these portions become of equal
depth a ; at its front H = (fiva)(2a,"r)", at its back
H= - ditto; using of course a different value of r.

 that when the travelling shell has gone a good way out, and
 it has become nearly equivalent to a plane wave, its electric

    * Sometimes the flux is apparently wrongly directed. For example, a
uniform field of impressed force from left to right in all space except a
spherical portion produces a flux from right to left in that portion. This
is made intelligible by the above.      Let the impressed force act in the
space between r=a and r=b, a being small and b great. In the inner
sphere the first effects are those due to the r=a vorticity, and the flux
left behind is against the force. But after a time comes the wave from
the r=b vorticity, which sets matters right. The same        '       in the

We know therefore by the preceding, the complete solution
due to sudden starting of the single vortex line. That is, we
know the individual waves in £ produced by ei, es, &c.
The resultant travelling disturbance is therefore confined
between two spherical surfaces of radii vt-a and vt +a, after
the centre has been reached, or of radii a-vt and a + vt
before the centre is reached. But it cannot occupy the whole
of either of the regions mentioned.
    The actual shape of the boundaries, however, may be easily
found. It is sufficient to consider a plane section through the
axis of the sphere. Let A and B be the points on this plane
cut by the vortex line.     Describe circles of radius vt with A
and B as centres.      If vt.<a, the circles do not intersect; the
disturbance is therefore wholly within them. But when
vt is > a, the intersecting part contains no H, and only the E

$24.
     That within the part common to both circles there is no H
we may prove thus. The vortex line in question may be
imagined to be a line of latitude on any spherical surface
passing through A and B, and centred upon the axis. Let
a1 be the radius of any sphere of this kind. Then, at a time
 making vt > a, the disturbance must lie between the surfaces
of spheres of radii vt-ai and vt +a1, whose centre is that of
the sphere a1. Now this excludes a portion of the space
 between the vt—a and vt--a circles, referring to the plane
section; and by varying the radius at we can find the whole
 space excluded. Thus, find the locus of intersections of
 circles of radius
                            rt-(a + 2*)',
 with centre at distance 2 from the origin, upon the axis.

   If this case be taken literally, then, since it involves an
infinite concentration in a geometrical line of a finite amount
of vorticity of e, the result for the steady field is infinite close
up to that line, and the energy is infinite. But imagine,
instead, the vorticity to be spread over a zone at the equator
of the sphere r=a, half on each side of it, and its surface
density to be fiv, where f is finite. Consider the effect pro
duced at a point in the equatorial plane. From time t = 0 to
t1=r—a (if the point be external) there is no disturbance.
But from time t1 to t3=b/w, where b is the distance from the
point to the edges of the zone, the disturbance must be iden
tically the same as if the harmonic distribution fiv were
complete, viz. by (142),

After this moment t2, the formula of course fails. Now nar
row the band to width adó at the equator and simultaneously
increasefi, so as to make flad6=e, the strength of the shell
of impressed force when there is but one. The formula (175)
will now be true only for a very short time, and in the limit it
will be true only momentarily, at the front of the wave, viz.

   Instead of a simple shell of impressed electric force, it may
be one of magnetic force, with similar results. As a verifica

two circles (vol. ii. art. 697).

    26. An Electromotive Impulse. m=1.—Returning to the
case of impressed electric force, let in a spherical portion of
an infinite dielectric a uniform field of impressed force act
momentarily. We know the result of the continued applica
tion of the force. We have, then, to imagine it cancelled by
an oppositely directed force, starting a ' later. Let ti be
the time of application of the real force, and let it be a small
fraction of 2a/v, the time the travelling shell takes to traverse
 any point. The result is evidently a shell of depth vti at
r=vt-Ha, in which the electromagnetic field is the same as in
the case of continued application of the force, and a similar
 shell situated at r=vt-a, in which H is negative. Within
 this inner shell there is no E or H.        But between the two
 thin shells just mentioned there is a diffused disturbance, of
 weak intensity, which is due to the sphericity of the waves,
 and would be non-existent were they plane waves. In fact,
 at time t = ti, when the initial disturbance H=fiv/2uov has
 extended itself a small distance vti on each side of the surface
 of the sphere, there is a radial component F at the surface
 itself, since, by (150),                 v3ts
                                    ?'t

 so that the sudden removal of f leaves two waves which do
 not satisfy the condition E=uov H at their common surface of
 contact. On separation, therefore, there must be a residual
 disturbance between them. The discontinuity in E at the
 moment of removing f is abolished by instantaneous assump
 tion of the mean value, but it is impossible to destroy '.
 radial displacement which joins the two shells at the moment
 they separate. Put on f when t=0, then –f at time ti
 later. The H at time t due to both is by (142),

the companion to       ''         its negative, when vt=r +a, lasting
for time t1, after which it is all over. This description applies
when r > a. If r <a, the interval between the beginning and
end of the H disturbance is only 2r/v. From the above
follows the integral solution expressing the effect off varying
in any manner with the time.
   27. Alternating Impressed Forces.—If the impressed force
in the sphere, or wherever it may be, be a sinusoidal function
of the time, making p’= —n”, if n=2T X frequency, the
complete solutions arise from (132) to (135) so immediately
that we can almost call them the complete solutions.                  Of
course in any case in which we have developed the connexion
between the impressed force and the flux, say e=ZC, or
C=Z-'e, when Z is the resistance operator, we may call this
equation the solution in the sinusoidal case, if we state that
p” is to mean —n”. But there is usually a lot of work needed
to bring the solution to a practical form. In the present
instance, however, there is scarcely any required, because u
and w are simple functions of qa, and 9” is real. The sub
stitution p”=-n” in u results in a real function of nr/v, and
in win a real function x (-1)}. Thus:—

reached the distance r=vt--a.          Of course the solutions are
true, provided we do not go further than r=vt-a. We see,
therefore, that the real function of the never-ceasing waste of
energy is to set up the sinusoidal state of E and H in the
boundless regions of space to which the disturbances have not
yet reached. The above outward waves are the same as in
Rowland's solutions". Here, however, they are explicitly
expressed in terms of the impressed forces causing them.
    un=0 makes the external field vanish when m is odd; and
wa=0 when m is even; that is, when the sinusoidal state has
 been assumed. It takes only the time 2a/v to do this, as regards
the sphere r=a; the initial external disturbance goes out to
 infinity and is lost. This vanishing of the external field
happens whatever may be the nature of the external medium

differing from the case of no conductivity only in the presence
of the exponential factor.
   It is, however, easily seen by the form of n, in (202) that
in a good conductor the attenuation in a short distance is very
great, so that the disturbances are practically confined to the
vortex lines of the impressed force, where the H disturbance
is nearly the same as if the conductivity were zero, as before
concluded.     It follows that the initial effect of the sudden
introduction of a steady impressed force in the conducting
dielectric is the emission from the seat of its vorticity of waves
in the same manner as if there were no conductivity, but atte
nuated at their front to an extent represented by the factor
e", with the (202) value of n1, in addition to the attenuation
by spreading which would occur were the medium non-con

only.
   %. Current in Sphere constrained to be uniform.—Let us
complete the solution (200) of $29 by means of a current of
uniform density parallel to the axis within the sphere of
radius a, beyond which (200) is to be the solution. ' will
require a special distribution of impressed force, which we
shall find. Equation (200) gives us the normal component of
electric current at r=a, by differentiation. Let this be
 T cos 6. Then T is the density of the internal current. The
 corresponding magnetic field must have the boundary-value
 according to (200), and vary in intensity as the distance from
 the axis, its lines being circles centred upon it, and in planes
 perpendicular to it.        us the internal H is also known. The
internal E is fully known too, being k-'I' in intensity and
parallel to the axis. It only remains to find e to satisfy
                         curl (e-E)=uff, . . . . . (3) bis
within the sphere, and at its boundary (with the suitable sur
 face interpretation), as it is already satisfied outside the sphere.
 The simplest way appears to be to first introduce a uniform

 field of e parallel to the axis, of such intensity el as to neu
 tralize the difference between the tangential components of
 the internal and external E at the   £ and so make con
 tinuity there in the forc of the field; and next, to find an
 auxiliary distribution e2, such that
                       curle=uff,
 and having no tangential component on the boundary. This
may be done by having e, parallel to the axis, of intensity
proportional to
                       (a”—r”) sin 6.
   The result is that the internal His got from the external by
putting r=a in (200) and then multiplying by r/a; T from
the internal H by multiplying by (2Tr'sin 6)"; el from the

L. The Thermodynamics of Cryohydrates. By J. PARKER,
    B.A., late Scholar of St. John’s College, Cambridge*.
     R. GUTHRIE has found that when a dilute saline solu
        tion, formed by dissolving a salt in water or any other
liquid, is subjected to reduction of temperature, the ice
formed is perfectly fresh, until a certain temperature is
reached, which depends only on the natures of the salt and
liquid employed, and not on their relative proportions. The
solution then freezes, without further reduction of tempera
ture, into a solid homogeneous brine. Dr. Guthrie has also
found that the final solution thus obtained, which he calls a
“cryohydrate,” is of the same strength whatever may have
been the strength of the dilute solution with which we started.
   Again, he has found that the lowest temperature obtainable
by means of a “cryogen,” i.e. a freezing mixture of salt and
ice, is the freezing-point of the corresponding cryohydrate.
   These experimental results have been obtained at atmo
spheric pressure, but we shall suppose them to be true at
anV DreSSll re.
      e at once infer that at the freezing-point of the cryohy
drate, the salt and pure ice are neutral to each other; in
other words, a saturated solution is then in stable equilibrium
with pure ice. There is, therefore, only one stable solution
possible at this temperature, viz. the cryohydrate itself.
   At any temperature above the freezing-point of the cryohy
drate, and below the freezing-point of the pure liquid, there
may be any number of stable solutions, the strongest being
a saturated solution, and the weakest in stable equilibrium
with pure ice.
   Analytically, let b, \r be the thermodynamic potentials at
constant pressure of unit weights of £ salt and ice, re
£             at any temperature £ the freezing-points of
the cryohydrate and of the pure liquid.
   Also let the weakest £ solution contain a weight m1 of
the salt, and a weight m2 of the liquid. Its thermodynamic
potential will be
                         dp=mifi + m2.f,
where fi, f. are homogeneous in mi and m2 and of degree 0.
   But the solution is in stable equilibrium with pure ice, and
not with the salt; hence;

pressure, and the axis of 2 the quantity h =", so that h is
the strength of the solution.                  7m2
   The weakest and strongest stable solutions will be repre
sented in the diagram by two surfaces which meet along the
freezing line of the £             and all other stable solutions
will be represented by points lying between these two sur
faces.
   Our principal object in this paper is to find the effect of
  ressure upon the freezing-point and composition of the cryo
£           For the former purpose we make use of the im
portant equations (3).
   Thus, let us suppose that at any point (p, t) on the freezing
line of the  £             (v, U, S, q2) represent respectively
the volume, energy, entropy, and thermodynamic potential at
constant pressure of unit mass of the cryohydrate, and let
(v1, U1, S1, QP1) be respectively the sums ' the volumes,
energies, entropies, and thermodynamic potentials at the same
pressure and temperature of the salt and ice of which the
cryohydrate is composed.        E.

We may notice, generally, that the freezing-point of the
cryohydrate is depressed or raised by pressure, according as
the liquid employed expands or contracts in the act of
freezing.
   In particular, the freezing-point of the cryohydrate of an
aqueous solution of sodium chloride is lowered by pressure by
almost exactly the same amount as the freezing-point of pure
water.                               -
   We will now give reasons for believing that the composi
tion of a cryohydrate is independent of the pressure. For
suppose, if possible, that along the freezing line of the
cryohydrate, h increases with p.
   At any pressure p, let the temperature of the cryohydrate
be reduced below its freezing-point, and then let the pressure
increase if öp is negative along the freezing line, but if
              8t
# is positive, let the pressure decrease.                    -
   Referring to the diagram we see that, sooner or later, the

                 Experiments with Soap-bubbles.                   409
solid cryohydrate must melt into an unstable solution. The
improbability of this event leads us to conclude that h cannot
increase with p. Similarly we may reason that h cannot
decrease as p increases. A cryohydrate must therefore be
regarded as a body of definite chemical composition, and not as
a mere solution in which the proportions of salt and ice depend
upon various accidents.
   This property of a cryohydrate has already been noticed by
Dr. Guthrie, but he has not examined the effects of pressure.
   Again, Duhem has shown that when a dilute solution,
formed by dissolving any salt in water, is reduced in tempera
ture until the pure ice appears, then increase of pressure
causes some of the ice to melt, or, in analytical language,
dih is negative for the weakest stable solution.
dp
   If, however, the solution is formed by dissolving the salt
in a liquid, like acetic acid, which contracts whilst freezing,
then  # is positive.
   As h is constant along the freezing line of the cryohydrate,
it follows that in the former case 8p is negative, and in the
                                       8t
latter case positive.
   It is now evident that when a salt is dissolved in water, the
cryohydrate expands in the act of freezing, and its melting
point is lowered by pressure, whereas, when a salt is dissolved
in a liquid, like acetic acid, which contracts whilst freezing,
the cryohydrate also contracts whilst freezing, and its melting
point is raised by pressure.

Pl. II.).
              is no more than two or three millimetres (fig 2,
   The great pressure which the air-film will carry is well
shown by the next experiment, which, moreover, is more easily
carried out than the last.
    Exp. 3.-Proceed as in the last experiment, but instead of
making a large drop on the first bubble, hang on a moistened
ring of wire rather smaller than the fixed ring. This ring
should be weighted until it pulls the bubble so much out of
shape that a tangent to the curve at the points where the film
meets the hanging ring makes an angle of 20° or 30° with the
plane of the ring (fig. 3, Pl. II.). A bubble may then be
blown inside and allowed to drop, when it will be found to
rest on the conical seat provided by the outer bubble, while
the heavy drops of liquid are kept apart, and thus there is no
fear of contact (fig. 4). These drops may now be both removed
with the end of the blowpipe; then, if the lower ring is pulled
down slowly, it will be found that the inner bubble is being
squeezed out of shape until it becomes a beautiful oval, while
the outer bubble shows the effect of the pressure by a corre
sponding enlargement (fig. 5). If the lower ring is pulled
down still further, the outer bubble is simply pulled in half,
and the inner one, often unbroken, gently floats away. This
shows that contact was not made, as in that case both would
be immediately broken. If, however, instead of pulling the
ring too far, it is held in the position shown in fig. 5, it will
be found that it is possible to swing the pair of bubbles round
 and round, and yet in spite of this violent treatment the
 bubbles refuse to touch one another. Or, if the lower ring is
 cautiously inclined and pulled away, the outer bubble will peal
 off it and remain attached to the upper one only. The two
 bubbles will now be spherical again, but there will be no
 heavy drop as in fig. 2. The air of the outer bubble may be
 withdrawn as before, until the two bubbles are barely separate.
     This experiment, and many of those that follow, may be
 made more beautiful by using for the inner bubble a solution
 strongly coloured by fluorescine, or still better by uranine
  (for the knowledge of which I am indebted to Mr. Madan);
 then, if sunlight, electric or magnesium light is thrown on to
 the bubbles, the inner one appears a brilliant green, while the
 outer one remains clear as before.
      The power of the surface-tension to do work is demon
  strated by blowing a large bubble below the ring and
  hanging on the weighted ring. If now a very small ring, a

412               Mr. C. V. Boys's Experiments
centimetre or more in diameter, is placed on that part of the
bubble which is stretched across either ring, and then the
part within the small ring is made to burst, the air will escape
through the small hole and the heavy ring will be lifted until
it comes in contact with the upper one. If the film over the
whole of the heavy ring is burst instead, the ring is pulled up
 so suddenly that it is difficult to follow it with the eye, and it
 strikes the upper ring with such violence that the noise is
 loud enough to be heard across a large room.
    A suspended ring affords a simple and accurate means of
 measuring the surface-tension of the soap-film.          A plane
 film is formed across a fixed horizontal ring and a light
 smaller ring is attached to the plane film, which is then broken
 within the smaller ring so as to leave an annular film only.
 Weights are then hung on to the suspended ring until the
 'gle between the film and the plane of this ring approaches
 90°. At this point equilibrium becomes unstable, and the
 lower ring falls away, but now both rings will be found to
 carry plane films, though the moment before neither did. On
 repeating the experiment a few times it will often be found
 possible to use such a weight that the ring will hang for some
 time, but will gradually sink, while the angle referred to
 above will approach more and more nearly to 90° as the
 surface-tension of the film diminishes; and thus the exact
 surface-tension at the particular moment of separation may
 be found by dividing weight of the ring and attached
 moisture by twice its circumference.
    Exp. 4.—Bubbles blown with coal-gas are lighter than air
 and rise.   If therefore an inner bubble is blown with such a
 mixture of air and gas as to rise, it will rest against the upper
 side of the outer bubble, where there are no heavy drops but
 where the films are thinnest and cleanest (fig. 6). A pair
 of bubbles blown in this way will sometimes last an hour
when exposed to the air of the room. The inner bubble may
 be gradually enlarged by blowing in gas until the outer one
 can barely withstand the pull. The forms assumed under these
circumstances are extremely graceful, and their beauty is
increased by the play of colours on the two bubbles which
 the multiple reflexions seem to intensify. If, when the inner
bubble is not too large, as in fig. 6, a little gas is gently let
into the outer bubble, it is possible to so adjust the mixture of
      and air that the inner will float either near the top or
near the bottom of the outer bubble, or about the middle, as
may be desired (fig. 8). If under these conditions the bubbles
are left undisturbed, the richer £ above the inner bubble
will diffuse into the poorer and heavier gas below, and the

                         with Soap-bubbles.                   413
bubble will slowly rise or fall, according to the relative
quantities of gas and air. The diffusion through the film is
well shown in the next experiment.
    Exp. 5.—Blow a pair of bubbles, as shown in fig. 6, but
make the inner bubble only just light enough to rest against
the top of the outer one. Lower a bell-jar over all, and pass
a stream of gas into the bell-jar by means of a tube passing
through the top. As the air is gradually driven down, the
outer bubble begins to feel the want of buoyancy, and
gradually settles down, as shown in fig. 9. After a short
time, the effect of the diffusion through both bubbles tending
to enrich the gas of the outer bubble is made evident by the
gentle descent of the inner bubble. If the jar is raised
'           and a little air is blown into the outer bubble, it is
possible to again cause the inner one to rise and float against
the top of the outer one as before. The bell-jar may be
lowered and the process repeated until the outer bubble is so
large that the ring is unable to support its weight when in an
 atmosphere of coal-gas.
    The very rapid diffusion of a vapour which will mix with
 the solution of which the film is made is easily shown.
    Exp. 6.—Into a large inverted bell-jar pour a small quantity
 of ether, or to fill the jar with the vapour quickly wet a piece
 of blotting-paper with ether and stand it on edge in the
jar. Remove the paper, then blow a bubble and drop it
 into the jar. The bubble will rest on the ether vapour as
 on carbonic anhydride, and while floating the most violent
 agitation of the colours of the film will be seen. The bubble
 does not remain floating long at the same level; it gradually
 sinks into denser and denser layers of vapour until it reaches
 the bottom or breaks on the way. This gradual sinking is
 due to the penetration into the bubble of the ether vapour,
 as may be shown as follows:—The bubble may be taken out
 of the vapour by means of a ring wetted with soap-solution
 and carried to a flame, when instantly there is a blaze of ether
 vapour a foot or more in diameter. That the flame is not due
 to liquid ether condensed on the film is shown by exposing a
 plane film to the vapour and carrying it to a light in the
 same way, when no trace of flame will be seen:
    Exp. 7.—At the end of a wide tube, which has been
 enlarged at the lower end, blow a large bubble and lower it
 gently into the vapour of ether, holding the finger at the
 mouth of the tube.        After a few seconds it will be found
 difficult to remove the bubble by means of the tube, because
 its weight may have become sufficient to tear it away when
 buoyed up by the air only. If it is removed successfully it

414              Mr. C. W. Boys's Experiments
will hang like a heavy drop; then, on removing the finger, a
light may be put to the issuing vapour, which will burn like
a bunsen-burner. If, moreover, the bubble full of ether
vapour is held in a brilliant light, the shadow will show the
ether vapour oozing through ' film and falling away in a
heavy stream (fig. 10). This experimen; shows in succession
the #: of an air-bubble on a heavy vapour, rapid diffusion
of a soluble vapour through a soap-film, and the power of the
surface-tension to force the heavy vapour up a tube fast
enough to supply a large flame.
   Exp. 8.—Blow a bubble with oxygen gas in a jar partly
filled with ether vapour; on taking the bubble out of the vapour
and carrying it to a light, it will explode with a loud report.
Sufficient vapour will penetrate the bubble, even whilst it is
being blown, to make the mixture violently explosive.
   Eap. 9.—The weight of the air is well shown by blowing a
bubble with gas on a ring and then trying to blow an air
 bubble within it (fig. 11). The inner bubble is then pulled
out into a pear-shape, and very soon breaks away from the
pipe on account of its great weight.
   Exp. 10.—If Exp. 4 be repeated, but instead of a
heavy fixed ring a light aluminium one be used instead, to
which is tied a long piece of thread which may have a sheet
of paper at the end, then the whole combination will float
and rise in the air, even though, as in fig. 7, practically the
whole of the buoyancy is due to the gas in the inner bubble.
In this case the inner bubble is the bag of a balloon, the outer
bubble is the netting, and the wire ' the things carried by
it are the car. In this case the power of the air-film to resist
contact of the two films is more evident than ever. If any
of the former figures 6, 7, or 8 are carrying a wire ring and
thread, as described, it is possible by a suitable pull at the
thread to release the pair of bubbles, which float away, one
inside the other, until the ceiling brings the experiment to
a conclusion.
   Exp. 11.—If the inner bubble of fig. 6 is made smaller
than the ring, then the corresponding experiment to that re
presented in   #   5 is shown in fig. 12. The small sphere will
always roll to the upper end of the outer bubble, which may
 be pulled out to the cylindrical form and be inclined either
 way. This modification of the other experiment was sug
 gested by Mr. Newth, to whom I had shown the previous
 combinations.
   A great many experiments may be shown in which strings
 of two or more bubbles, filled some with air and some with
 gas, tend to pull in different directions. Thus an air-bubble

                       with Soap-bubbles.                   415
with a gas-bubble blown on the top of it will rise till the gas
bubble breaks against the ceiling, when the air-bubble falls
'',     and may be sent up as often as desired by the addition
of a new gas-bubble; or three bubbles, the lower one of air
the upper one of gas, so proportioned that the combination just
floats, will remain until the middle bubble is touched with
the finger, when the other two immediately go opposite ways.
There is no occasion to say more about experiments of       #
type.
   Exp. 12.—An experiment which is easily performed shows
in a striking way how the air-film resists being broken. If
a pair of bubbles are blown as shown in fig. 4, and the vi
brating prongs of a large tuning-fork are brought quite close
to the line where one bubble rests upon the other, both films
will take up the movement of the fork, and a point of light
reflected by the two films is seen spread out into a pair of
rings, so violent is the motion, yet the films do not touch.
It is hardly possible to suppose that the two films remain as
close together where the movement occurs as in other parts
of the line of support; if  '    tend to separate they form an
exception to the general rule that a vibrating body attracts
an object in the immediate neighbourhood. In this case the
inner bubble is heavier than the air in the outer one, both
because of the weight of the film and the compression of the
air within due to its tension. But if the same experiment
is tried when the inner bubble is lighter than the air in the
outer one, as it may be by holding one of the prongs close to
the highest point of the bubbles shown in fig. 6, or when
either bubble is heavier or lighter than air, the same result
will be found—the bubbles will refuse to touch one another.
   Plateau has described (Statique des liquides) a number of
very beautiful experiments in which wire frames representing
the edges of geometrical solids are dipped in soap-solution,
after which they are found to carry combinations of films,
plane or curved according to the character of the frame.
Thus within a triangular prism, when it is removed from
the solution, is found a combination of nine plane films which
form three troughs meeting along the axis of the prism and
a triangular pit at each end.
   Erp. 13.—A spherical bubble may be dropped into one of
these troughs and rolled from end to end, it may be taken
out of one trough and dropped into another, or the frame
may be held with its axis vertical, when the bubble may be
dropped into the triangular pit, where, however, it will not
remain long.
   The characteristic feature of all the laminar figures is that

416              Mr. C. W. Boys's Experiments
there are never more than three surfaces meeting in a line
where the angles are always 120°, or more than four lines or
six surfaces meeting in a point. Further, the mean curva
tures of the films are always zero so long as no air is enclosed.
As Plateau mentions in      #.   book, the screw-surface has no
mean curvature, therefore if a frame be made out of a helix
of wire with its ends connected by wire to a solid axis, such
a frame after being dipped will carry a helical surface of
soap-film.
   Erp. 14.—If, instead of a single helix of wire, two helices
are fixed to the same axis, but not quite symmetrically, so
that in any part the wire of one helix is nearer that above it
than the one below, two helical films will not be formed, but
there will be a single one in an intermediate position which
will be joined to the two wire screws by a pair of conical
screw-surfaces, these forming with the true screw-surface a
screw-shaped trough down which bubbles may be rolled or
up which they may be wound, as water is wound up by a
screw-pump (fig. 13). Further, if a series of small £
are blown along the helical edge in which the three films
meet at angles of 120°, a spiral staircase is made of soap
film, down which a bubble will run one or two steps at a
time, and from which it will escape uninjured when it reaches
the bottom. Of course bubbles lighter than air, in the same
way, will rest against the lower sides of a trough or roll up
instead of down the screw-surface.
   Exp. 15.—One more experiment in which the rolling of
bubbles is the chief feature is worth describing. Three rings
of wire, seen in section in fig. 14, are joined together by wires,
shown dotted, and are carried by a central axis, which may
be made to rotate. After this frame has been dipped in the
solution of soap, and the three radial planes broken, it is
found to carry a circular trough, into which a series of
bubbles may be dropped, while at the same time the frame
may be kept rotating, so that the bubbles are rolling round
'round like marbles       on the rim of a solitaire-board.      A
corresponding frame might possibly be made of light wire,
which after dipping would rest on the bubbles in the first
frame, thus forming a working model of the ball-bearing. I
have not, however, succeeded.
   Plateau has mentioned the fact (p. 166) that M. Chautard
has found a soap-film a convenient envelope for a gas which
is to be tested magnetically. He says that a spherical film
above one pole of an electromagnet is visibly disturbed if the
     within has magnetic properties when the exciting current
 rom a battery of 25 to 30 Bunsen's cells is made and broken.

                        with Soap-bubbles.                   417
If, instead of a spherical bubble, one of cylindrical form, with
its length about three times its diameter, is used, the dis
tortion produced by a small disturbing force is so greatly
magnified that, using an electromagnet actuated by five
Grove's cells only, not only is the change of form manifest
when oxygen is the gas in the bubble, but it is even possible,
by making the    I'      such that the form is very nearly un
stable, to cause the bubble to divide the moment the current
is made to pass round the electromagnet. With the same
means I have not been able to detect any change of form in
a spherical bubble. Fig. 15 shows a convenient apparatus for
producing, as often as may be desired, a cylindrical bubble of
any degree of stability.
   The short tube a is in connexion with a supply of oxygen
which is employed to blow the spherical bubble shown by the
dotted circle. According to the position of the screw d this
bubble will be larger or smaller before it comes in contact
with the ring b, which is held down by the loose weight w.
The gas-tap is then immediately turned off, and the ring b
raised by the action of the weight c, until the screw e brings
the movement to a stop, Thus the length of the cylinder
depends on the screw e, while its volume is determined by
the screw d, and so whatever degree of stability is found
suitable can be reproduced as often as may be required.
The poles of the magnet should be placed at about the level
of the line pp.                                -
   There is one other property of a pair of soap-films resting
against one another, but not in contact, to which I have not
referred. In a lecture at the Royal Institution a few years
ago Lord Raleigh showed that two water-jets if perfectl
clean will, if directed so as to meet one another at a      £
angle, be reflected again and fall as two separate jets, never
# coming into         contact at all. If the water is not per
fectly clean, the experiment will not succeed. He showed
that such a pair of mutually reflected jets form a very delicate
electroscope, so that if a piece of excited sealing-wax is held
even at a considerable distance they instantly coalesce. As
the two jets in his experiments and the two bubbles in those
which I am about to describe are in each case kept apart by
a thin film of air, I expected to find a pair of bubbles attached
to two rings in the same way act as a delicate electroscope.
   Exp. 16.—If a pair of bubbles are blown on rings, which
must be insulated from one another, as shown in fig. 16, and
the cover of a small electrophorus is raised even at some
yards distance, instantly the two bubbles coalesce as seen in
fig, 17, but do not burst as they have hitherto been found to

418               Experiments with Soap-bubbles.
do.    Or if the two rings are connected with a key and a
single bichromate-cell so that when the key is not pressed the
rings are connected together, but when depressed they form
the terminals of the cell, then at the moment of making the
contact the bubbles unite because the electrostatic attraction
between surfaces so very close together is able to squeeze out
the air, which mere pressure had £ failed to do.
   Erp. 17.—Bearing in mind how exceedingly delicate this
is as a test of difference of potential, the following experiment
seems the more decisive. The cover of the electrophorus may
be brought so close to the side of the bubbles, shown in fig. 4,
as to pull them completely out of shape, and yet the outer film
so completely screens the inner from the electrical action,
even though the inner one is to all appearance in contact
with the Outer one, that there is no difference of potential
between them, and so the film of air is not destroyed. I do
not know any experiment which so clearly shows as this that
electrical force is confined to the absolute surface of a con
ductor, and is not felt at any depth within it however small.
   Plateau has mentioned, p. 168, that a hemispherical film
blown on a plate will screen a smaller hemisphere blown
within it, and also resting on the plate, from electrical dis
turbance; but in this case the two films are widely separate,
and there is not the same delicate test as in the case of two
bubbles apparently coincident, which instantly join when the
smallest  ' stress exists between them.
   Exp. 18.—One more experiment, which is a combination
of these two, is worth performing. If one of the bubbles of
fig. 16 is replaced by the combination shown in fig. 4 while
the other remains as before, and if the cover of the electro
phorus is raised anywhere in the neighbourhood, immediately
the two outer films join and become one, while the inner
bubble undamaged and the heavy ring slide down to the
bottom of the now enlarged single bubble, and give rise to
the form shown in fig. 18.
    I am perfectly sensible of the fact that these experiments
lie very closely on that ill-defined border-line which separates
 scientific work from scientific play, but I trust that the
 beautiful way in which they illustrate the action of certain
 forces may be sufficient excuse for my showing members of
the Physical Society what cannot fail to remind some of them
of their nursery days.
    The following particulars may be of service to those who
 wish to repeat any of these experiments.

   Use of the term “Resistance” in Physical Phenomena. 419
   The solution that I have used is composed of
              1 part by weight oleate of soda.
            40        ??       distilled water.
   These, when solution is complete, are well mixed with one
third the volume of glycerine and left for a week to settle in
stoppered bottles. The liquid is then syphoned off from the
impurities which have risen to the surface and clarified with
a few drops of ammonia.
   The thick wire rings and frames are made of tinned iron
wire 13 millim. in diameter, well cleaned with emery cloth.
   The thin wire rings may be made of any thin wire, but
aluminium about $ millim. in diameter does well.
   I have found it necessary to make a blowpipe with a trap as
shown in fig. 19 to catch condensed moisture, which is apt to
cause a failure if it mixes with the bubble.    The diameter of
the mouth at a is 7 millim. For detaching small light bubbles
a pipe with a smaller mouth should be used.
    When both gas and air are used in any experiment and it
is necessary to regulate the proportions very carefully, it is
well to have a T-piece attached to the blowpipe, so that either
gas or air may be blown or stopped at pleasure.
 LII.    On the Use of the term “Resistance” in the Description
      of Physical Phenomena. By R. H. M. BosANQUET*.
 Th:      following observations were suggested by a remark
        quoted by Prof. S. P. Thompson from Dr. Hopkinson,
 at the meeting of the Physical Society on January 28, 1888.
 The remark was to the effect that there is no such thing as
 magnetic resistance, because the resistance of iron to mag
 netization is not constant under varying conditions. I wish
to bring before you the question, What is the fundamental
 idea involved in the use of the term “resistance” in the
 description of physical phenomena?
    If we apply force to produce any change, say to extend an
 extensible  '.    or compress a compressible one, the body is
 said to offer resistance to the force.    If we have a second
 body which requires a greater force than the first to produce
 the same change, we say that the second body offers a greater
 resistance than the first.   Consequently resistance increases
 with the force employed to produce a given change.
    Again, if in the second body the same force produces a
 greater change than in the first, the resistance of the second
                    * Communicated by the Author.

420 Mr. Bosanquet on the Use of the term “Resistance”
body is said to be less. Consequently resistance diminishes
as the change produced increases, and vice versá.
   The change may consist in the flow of a fluid, through a
tube say, under pressure; then we should say that the re
sistance offered by the tube to the flow increases as the
pressure increases and as the flow diminishes.
   Or, again, we may consider a liquid being evaporated
under the action of heat. We may say that the resistance to
evaporation is the greater the more heat is required and the
less liquid evaporated.
   We may shortly refer to the two elements in any such
change as the cause and the effect. And we shall generalize
the conception of resistance in stating that it is the greater
the greater the measure of the cause and the less the measure
of the effect. But nothing is so far assumed as to the precise
law which connects these quantities.
   If we now refer to the case of electrical resistance, we
have a law suggested by Ohm’s law, viz., that the measure
of the resistance is the direct ratio of the measures of cause
and effect. Or, to take the words “measure of ’’ as under
stood, resistance is the ratio of cause to effect, or the quotient
of cause by effect; or, resistance is proportional to the
cause and inversely as the effect.
   This is not the least necessary. We might very well, if
there were any reason for it in any particular case, adopt as
the measure of resistance such a function as the square, or
the square root of the above ratio. It would be quite com
patible with the general definition deduced above from the
meaning of the word. But Ohm’s law ties us down to the
direct ratio.
   If, therefore, we extend the analogy of Ohm’s law to other
cases, we shall have some such propositions as follows:—
   If force be employed to extend an extensible body or to
compress a compressible one, the resistance to extension or
compression, on the analogy of Ohm’s law, is the quotient of
the cause, or force employed, by the effect, or amount of
change.
   If liquid flow through a pipe under a difference of pressure
between its ends, the resistance, on the analogy of Ohm’s
law, is the quotient of the cause, or difference of pressure, by
the effect, or rate of flow.
   In such cases the precise manner in which cause and effect
are measured must be determined by convenience. It does
not in the least affect the conception of resistance as the ratio
 f cause and effect.
  Again, if a liquid be evaporated under the action of heat,

                                                  *
             in the Description of Physical Phenomena.          421
 the resistance to evaporation, on the analogy of Ohm's law, is
 the ratio of the cause, or heat expended, to the effect, or
 amount of liquid evaporated, no matter how these are
 measured.
    We may add a further illustration.         Suppose that any
 substance is heated.    Different substances will rise to different
 temperatures in virtue of their different specific heats. Here
 the resistance to heating up, on the  ''        of Ohm's law, is
 the ratio of the cause, or heat expended, to the effect, or
 rise of temperature produced, no matter how these are
 measured.
    In all these cases we have a perfectly intelligible physical
 conception of resistance, strictly in accordance with the
 natural meaning of the word in the English language.
    But I think we should not apply by way of objection in
 such cases arguments such as ' following:—i. e. (1) That
 the resistance so measured is not of the same dimensions as
 electrical resistance; or (2) that the resistance so measured
 is not a constant, but liable to variation depending on the
 conditions, as well as to complication by other factors.
    The ground that underlies the employment which has been
 made of these two arguments in opposition to the use of the
term resistance in connexion with magnetism, is really the
assumption that the same word ought to imply identity in the
two cases of electricity and magnetism, and not analogy. If
it be admitted that analogy is sufficient ground for the use of
a word, the objections disappear.
    But if used in connexion with two different subjects, it is
quite impossible that the meanings of the word can be
identical. And that there is no objection in practice to the use
of the same word in meanings justified by analogy only may be
shown by many illustrations.        Take the case of the word
Potential.     It originated I suppose in connexion with
mechanical theory.      It has a  £        mechanical meaning,
and definite dimensions regarded as a mechanical quantity.
But we extend the term without difficulty to both the mag
netic and electrical analogies; and in each of these cases it
has another definite meaning, and other definite dimensions.
Yet nobody thinks of objecting to either of these uses of the
term potential, because they involve definitions of the dimen
sions of potential, different both from that used in mechanics
and from each other.
   Similarly with the word Force. This is a purely mechanical
term. But nobody objects to its use in the terms electro
motive force, or magnetizing force because these uses involve
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 25. No. 156. May 1888.          2F

422 Mr. Bosanquet on the Use of the term “Resistance”
definitions of the dimensions of Force different both from
that used in mechanics and from each other.
    It is fully understood in these cases that analogy is all
that is involved, and nobody supposes that there is any
question of identity.
    I will now for a moment compare the case of magnetic
resistance with a natural case of ordinary resistance, to show
that the analogy between the two is extremely close.
    Consider a mass of matter in any condition; suppose it
enclosed in a vessel and subjected to compression. Then the
cause will be the pressure, the effect the compression, and the
resistance on the analogy of Ohm’s law the ratio of pressure
to compression. If we choose to measure the compression
by the inverse of the volume, the resistance will be the pro
 duct of pressure and volume.
    If we suppose the matter to be at first gaseous, and the
 compression to take place with loss of heat according to
 Boyle and Marriotte's law, the resistance will be so far
 constant. But as the compression advances, and the liquid
 and solid states are  £,           the resistance will necessarily
 increase, and when the compression reaches a certain value
 it will be practically incapable of proceeding further, and the
 resistance will increase indefinitely with the pressure. The
 resistance is therefore here a function of the compression,
 i.e. of the effect, just as magnetic resistance is a function of
 magnetic induction; and, if we omit the initial part of the
 curves of magnetic resistance of bars, the rest of them is
 oddly similar to the course of the resistance in the case
 imagined.
     Now the resistance in the case imagined (of the compres
 sion of matter) is not constant, but is a function of the effect
 just as magnetic resistance is. Is this want of constancy
 an objection to the use of the term resistance as a descrip
 tion of that quality in matter which tends to prevent com
 pression? For if it is a sufficient objection to the term
 magnetic resistance, it must be a sufficient objection to the
 term resistance to compression as well, as the analogy be
 tween the two cases is so extraordinarily close. It cannot
 be maintained for a moment that the want of constancy offers
 any objection.
     An objection may be taken possibly that the magnetic
 resistance has varying values for rising and falling mag
 netizing force, and is therefore not definitely ascertainable as
 a function of    £             force. Answer: We do not give
 up trying to find out the true values of things because
 they are superficially complicated with others. If magnetic

           in the Description of Physical Phenomena.        423
 retentiveness does lead to complications, it is our business to
 disentangle them; and practically the method of reversals of
 magnetizing current enables us to do this. But it is not main
 tained, at least by me, that magnetic resistance is properly a
 function of magnetizing force. It is a function of the effect
 produced, i.e. of the magnetic induction, as is amply proved
 by the inspection of the numerous curves that have been
published in connexion with this question. And it is so just
in the same way in which the resistance of matter to com
pression is a function only of the compression, or of the stage
which the condensation has reached.
   A word may be usefully said here on the origin of the
differential formula used by Lamont to express the so-called
magnetic conductivity of a magnet. The ambiguity on which
the origin of this formula depends can be well dealt with by
the present illustration.             -
   # we    consider the compression of matter which has at
tained the liquid condition, we may speak of the resistance to
any further compression at this point, or under these con
ditions, as being infinite. For the effect produced by the
further pressure is nothing. But in the magnetic analogy we
always consider a change, the initial condition of which corre
sponds roughly to the gaseous condition, or rather a pre
gaseous condition, in the material analogy. In either case,
if, instead of considering the total change, we consider the
state of things at a point, then we must suppose the cause to
vary by a small quantity, d cause, producing a small effect,
d effect; and the ratio of these may be said to be the re
sistance at the point of the representative curve, or under the
  iven conditions.     It is on this mode of statement that
£           differential formula is based.    The formula is
(Handbuch des Magnetismus, p. 41),
                      dm=k (M-m) dw;
whence by integration,
                      M-m=Ce-*;
                   w =magnetizing force,
                   m = magnetism,
                   M=maximum of magnetism.
    Here dm/da is called the magnetic conductivity; and it is
inversely as the magnetic resistance at a point. That mag
netic conductivity, which is inversely as the magnetic re
sistance as I and others use the term, is m/a, i.e. has
reference to the total change. I have shown (Electrician,
xvi. p. 247) that the assumption m/w = k (M-m) is that to
                              2 F 2

424 Use of the term “Resistance” in Physical Phenomena.
which we are thus led, in place of Lamont's formula above
given. Prof. S. P. Thompson has shown that this formula,
which is the same as that known as Frölich’s, corresponds
with the facts better than Lamont's,
    In what precedes I have, for convenience in quotation,
used the ordinary term magnetizing force, and regarded it as
a cause. As, however, so-called magnetizing force is identical
in dimensions and physical nature with the rest of the mag
netic induction which it develops, I use the expression in
this way under protest only; for I regard it as inconceivable
that cause and effect should be of identical nature, unless the
effect reacts again as a cause, so that the smallest original
cause drives the effect up to saturation. Without going into
detail I may mention an analogy where cause and effect are
 identical in nature, and the process does therefore necessarily
always go to saturation; viz., the case of the multiplication
 of germs, in a habitat of limited capacity. Here the indivi
 duals which formed the original cause multiply; the progeny
 constitute at once the effect and an increase of the cause. And
the smallest original infection of the cause is enough to
 develop saturation, i.e. the highest population that the habitat
 can maintain. Now in the case of magnetism, magnetizing
 force and the rest of the magnetic induction are by definition
identical in nature. If they are cause and effect, the effect
should therefore act again as cause, so as to produce satura
tion from the smallest force; but this does not occur.           I
prefer therefore to regard the difference of potential as the
cause, as is always done in the case of the electric current.
    There is only one further point. It may be maintained
that the mention of Ohm’s law involves sub silentio the
assumption that the corresponding law holds true, i.e. that
the resistance is constant. If this is supposed, it is only
necessary to explain that it is not intended. It is clearly
legitimate to measure a quantity in the manner suggested by
Ohm's law (i.e. by the ratio of cause to effect), and speak of the
laws or courses of values thus obtained as representing in
the different cases the analogues of Ohm’s law. These are
the laws which occupy the place in the various matters dealt
with, which Ohm’s law occupies in the subject of the flow of
electricity, i.e. they express the ratio of cause to effect in
the different cases. But the statement that they are the
analogues of Ohm’s law does not involve the position that
they are identical with it, any more than the definitions of
Potential or Force in electricity and magnetism are identical
with those in mechanics or with each other.
   The main points I have dealt with are:—That resistance

   That the objections to the employment of the term mag
netic resistance have been founded on the assumed require
ment of identity instead of analogy between the affections
of different subjects, and cannot be sustained.
   And that the extension of the employment of the term
Resistance in the above manner leads to some remarkable ana
logies which go far to justify independently the employment
of the term Magnetic Resistance. And it has been pointed
out that the ordinary mode of statement involves inconsistent
and impossible ideas as to the relation of cause and effect
in the phenomena, whereas the application of the term
Magnetic Resistance compels us to precisely ascertain these,
and put them in their ri # places.
    Note.—An objection ' been recently raised                '   M. Hos
pitalier” to my definition of Magnetic Resistance, which comes
to this, that in defining the effect I take the induction through
unit surface instead of the total induction. This objection is
again based on the supposed necessity for conforming identi
cally to Ohm’s law in Electricity. The foregoing remarks
 will have made it clear that I consider this unnecessary, the
question being, What is the most convenient measure of the
effect? Since the magnetic potential attainable is practically
limited, though it increases with the dimension, and the induc
tion through unit of area practically attainable is also limited
(by saturation), the ratio of these two quantities lies always
within certain limits, though it increases with the dimensions.
In fact the magnetic resistance thus estimated is of linear
dimension, and may be regarded as of linear scale in plans.
If, therefore, this quantity # selected to be tabulated, the dis
cussion of questions of design from a practical point of view
is greatly facilitated, and the relations of the quantities
involved are more easily followed and more simply expressed.

426       M. Wladimir Michelson on the Distribution
special memoir upon the radiations of solids at different tem
peratures, induce me to publish at once, at least in abstract,
some theoretical considerations upon this subject. I hope to
give a more complete discussion of the question when the new
data of Prof. Langley's spectro-bolometric researches shall
enable me to confront my theory with experiment in a more
detailed manner.
   1. Hypothesis and General Law.—The absolute continuity
of the spectra emitted by solids can only be explained by the
complete irregularity of the vibrations of their atoms. The
discussion of the distribution of radiant energy amongst the
simple vibrations of different period is, then, to be undertaken
by the calculus of probabilities.
   Let us consider a homogeneous isotropic solid of which all
the atoms are in identical circumstances, so that, for example,
they are not grouped into separate molecules. Each atom
has a definite position of equilibrium towards which it is con
tinually driven back by the surrounding atoms, and about
which it describes infinitely small oscillations. I express this
fact by supposing that each atom moves freely in the interior
of a spherical elastic shell of infinitely small radius p, which
has the position of equilibrium as its centre. The atom
rebounds from the interior surface of this sphere according to
the law of impact for perfectly elastic bodies, preserves its
absolute velocity during several free paths, and then changes
its velocity in consequence of the unsymmetrical action of the
surrounding atoms.
   Let us endeavour to find upon this hypothesis what will be
the most probable trajectories of the atom in the interior of
the sphere of displacement. Let us admit that, for the initial
position of the atom, all possible distances from the position
of equilibrium are equally probable; then the probability that
this distance shall lie between the limits r and r-H dr will be
expressed by                   dr                -
                                  .   .   . . .    . . . . (1)
                                p
   Let us take the radius ON (fig. 1) of the sphere passing
through the initial position, M, of the atom for polar axis.
Let us denote the angle N MP, which the direction of motion
of the atom makes with this axis, by p. Let us admit, as in
the theory of gases, that all directions are equally probable.
Then the probability that b will lie between the limits p and
qb+db will be               # sin b d b.
   Let us call the angle of incidence MPO, 8. This angle is
connected with p by the relationship

                of Energy in the Spectra of Solids.             427
   Since the same value 8 corresponds to the values p and r-p
of the angle b, the probability that an atom whose initial dis

 tance from the centre of the sphere lies between r and r+dr
 shall strike the spherical surface at an angle lying between 8
 and 8+d6, is given by the expression

                                 v/1-#3
     We obtain the same probability for any atom whatever by
 multiplying this expression by #. and extending the total to
  all possible values of r for a given 8 ; that is to say, by
  integrating with reference to r between the limits p sin 8 and p,
       r=|        # 5*            d8. dr=   (#
                                             ,2

              *** A/      1–'sin'8
     It is evident that this probability has a maximum value when
  8=0; that is to say, that motions along diameters of the
  spheres of displacement are the most probable. It will happen
  most frequently that, between two neighbouring disturbances,
  each atom will describe trajectories differing but little from
  the stellar form (fig. 2).
      If we suppose that each periodic change in the motion of

 428        M. Wladimir Michelson on the Distribution
 the atom produces a wave of the same period in the surround
 ing aether, and if we consider that the waves produced by the
 radial motion indicated above will not only be the most fre
 quent, but also the most intense, we must admit, as a first
 approximation, that it is only these motions which determine
 the composition of the radiations emitted by our solid.
    But the period of vibration t corresponding to this radial
 motion is evidently connected with the instantaneous velocity
 v of the atom by the relationship
                              r=# . . . . . . . . ()
   This relationship may be employed for the transformation of
 the known formula of Maxwell, which expresses the most
probable distribution of energy amongst a large number of
 any material points whatever continually exchanging their
velocities by means of forces having a potential". If we denote
by N the total number of atoms, by m the mass of each of
                                                                 3

   This formula gives the number of atoms of which the prin
cipal periods of vibration lie between the limits r and T+dr.
It is the probable law of distribution of the periods of vibra
tion between the atoms of our solid.
   In consequence of the law of superposition of vibrations, we
may admit that the intensity of a simple radiation of period t
ought to be :—
     1) Proportional to the number v. of atoms of the source of
radiation vibrating in the same period.

body itself. We will denote this function by f(6).
   Thus, then, denoting positive constants by A and p, we put

   This formula gives the intensity of a simple radiation of
wave-length X as a function of this length and of the absolute
temperature of the source.           -
   * According to the analysis of Helmholtz, resultant waves must be
produced in all cases where the square of the elongation is not to be
neglected. They '' according to this author, the phenomena of
sound cf Sorges and Tartini (combination tones). In the case which we
are considering they ought to form especially upon the surface of the
radiating body, the forces which retain the atoms in their positions of
equilibrium not being symmetrical in all directions.

430         M. Wladimir Michelson on the Distribution
   It is towards a law of this sort that the distribution ot
radiant energy in each spectrum must tend as its continuity
becomes more and more perfect, that is to say, as the elective
absorptions along the path of the rays diminish. To obtain a
more complete expression of the law it would still be neces
sary to determine the value of p and the form of f(6); but
our formula is capable of giving some interesting results
without our even having to make such a specialization.
   It is evident that, under this general form, our law embraces
as particular cases all the empirical laws of emission proposed
hitherto, such as those of Newton, of Dulong and Petit, and
of Stefan.
   If we were to attribute to 6 a constant value, and if we were
to take A as abscissa, and IA as ordinate, equation (10) would
be the equation of the curve of energy in the normal con
tinuous spectrum of a solid source at the temperature 6.
These are the curves which M. Crova has called “isothermic
curves.” In order to study the general properties of these
curves, we will suppose 6 constant and take the derivative of
the expression IA.
   2. Limits of the Spectrum.—It is easy to see, from formula
(10) and its derived formula, that      £)       and p have definite
values, we shall have for A=0 and A=co,
                       IA=0     and   '   : U.
    This signifies that all the curves of energy represented by
equation (10) are tangents to the axis of A at the origin of
coordinates, and that they have this axis as an asymptote. At
the two extremities of the spectrum the radiant energy dimi
nishes to zero; but whilst towards the violet it disappears
almost suddenly because of the rapid diminution of the factor
eTox', the less refrangible energy extends indefinitely towards
the side of increasing A. This fact has been recently observed
by Prof. Langleyf.
    3. Marimum Intensity.—Each of the curves represented by
equation (10) presents only a single maximum defined by the
condition
                     --V::,      p+2 V6           . . .     . . (11)
We see that the position of maximum intensity in our spectra

depends upon temperature, and formula (11) gives the law of
this dependence – Whatever the law of emission may be, the
wave-length corresponding to the maximum energy is inversely
proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature of the
SOtt?"ce.

which have been published hitherto upon this subject are con
tained in a recent diagram by Prof. Langley*. In order to

   Although the constancy of 6A's is far from being perfect,
yet in view of the manner in which these four values have
been obtained, and the uncertainty attaching to the determi
nation of elevated temperatures, we may say that these obser
vations appear to confirm our theory.
   4. Measurement of Temperatures.—If we suppose that this
law were confirmed by more numerous observations, it would
then furnish us with a very simple method of measuring the
high temperatures of radiating bodiest. This method would
be superior to the spectro-photometric method elaborated by
 M. Crova, inasmuch as it is not dependent upon the choice of
the tints compared, and would give, not “optical degrees,”
but absolute temperatures. Knowing the constant of equa
tion (11), it would suffice, in order to measure the temperature
of a radiating body, to determine the wave-length corre
sponding to the maximum intensity of its normal spectrum.
    If we take account, as much as possible, of the absorptions
suffered by the solar rays, and if we admit that the great den
sity and enormous mass of the sun ought to give to its primi
tive spectrum all the qualities of continuous spectra, we may
apply this method to calculate the temperature of the sun.
According to the observations of Prof. Langleyt, the maximum

propounded by M. Crova, loc. cit. p. 479.

432       M. Wladimir Michelson on the Distribution
intensity of the solar spectrum observed beyond our atmo
sphere would be situated about A=0"5. Hence if, according
to the preceding table, we take for 6A., the round number
10,000, we obtain about 40,000° for the absolute temperature
of the sun. It should be remarked that this method only
supposes an analogy in the distribution of energy in the pri
mitive spectrum of the sun and in that of    #          ; but the
total emissive power may be very different for these two
bodies.
   5. Total Energy of Radiation.—By calculating the area of
each curve represented by the equation (10), I obtain the total
energy of radiation of the spectrum
            B-fin-P-"reprivo)",                       •   •  (12)
where T denotes the Eulerian integral of the second order.
   Comparing this formula with that obtained by eliminating
X between the two equations (10) and (11), that is to say,
with the maximum intensity of the spectrum,
                                2\p+2               -
                   I.-B(£)           f(6)6". . . . . (13)
Making abstraction of constant coefficients, expressions (12)
and (13) only differ because the second contains another
factor V6. Hence the maximum intensity increases with the
temperature more rapidly than the total energy of radiation,
and their ratio

increases in the direct ratio of the square root of the absolute
temperature of the source.
     ultiplying together equations (11) and (14), we obtain
            Ima:\max_ 2e"
               E       T T(p +3)
                                  (p+2)"=const.       . . (15)
This interesting relationship shows that the total radiant energy
emitted by a solid bears a constant ratio to the product of the
maximum energy of the normal spectrum by the correspondin
wave-length, or, differently expressed, that the area of eac
curve of energy bears a direct ratio to the area of the rectangle
having for sides the coordinates of the summits of this curve
(see further on, fig. 3). This constant ratio depends only upon
the value of p, which probably is the same for all bodies;
for in our equations it is this value which characterizes the

                 of Energy in the Spectra of Solids.               433
mode of action between the ponderable atoms and the sur
rounding aether.
   This relation, which does not require a knowledge of the
absolute temperature, is better fitted for experimental verifica
tion than the preceding relations. For the moment we do
not possess direct data for such a verification. It is only in
a very imperfect manner that I have been able, by measuring
the ordinates and areas of the curves given by Prof. Langley,
to obtain the following values of Imax and E:—
       6.              *:          Imax.      E.      ImaxE\max-
     451    .  .   .   4.90         5.2     182        0-140
     603    .  .   .   4-05        21.5     532        0.163
     798    .  .   .   3.63        39.7    1074        0-134
   1088     .  .   .   3'27        64.9    1730        0 123
   Bearing in mind the imperfection of the method of verifi
cation, the numbers of the last column, which according to
our theory should be equal, do not seem unfavourable to it.
    6. Tracing the Curves.—To be able to trace the curve of
energy it is necessary to give special values to p and f(6). If,
for example, we admit with M. Stefan" that the radiant energy
emitted by a body bears a direct ratio to the fourth power of
its absolute temperature, we shall be able to put
                         p=1, f(0)=R6";
from which equation (10) will take the form
                            I-B,6'-5'-'. . . . . . (16)
 Having determined the two constants B1 and c of this equation
 from a diagram of the normal invisible spectrum of lampblack
 at 178°C., given by Prof. Langley, I have calculated and traced
the theoretical curves for this temperature and for 327°C. =
 600° abs. (fig. 3). We see that these curves have all the
qualities that Prof. Langley attributes to the curves determined
experimentally by him; that is to say:—
    (1) The radiant energy represented by the ordinates dimi
nishes on both sides, yet extends indefinitely towards the
 side of the less refrangible rays.
    (2) When the temperature increases all the ordinates in
 crease, but in unequal proportion. Those which represent the
 energy of the more refrangible waves increase always more
 rapidly than those which correspond to the longer undulations.
    (3) Hence the fact, independently observed, that the maxi
          * Stefan, Sitzher. Wien. Akad vol. lxxix. p. 391 (1879).

434        M. Wladimir Michelson on the Distribution
mum ordinate is progressively displaced toward the more
refrangible region. We have indicated above the probable
law of this displacement.

     it. 2    #   1 - 5 ---,-,-IV-T-I-T-TTF
    (4) The theoretical curves of the normal spectrum, like
 Prof. Langley's prismatic curves, are not symmetrical ; the
 largest area is situated on the right-hand side of the maximum
 ordinate, that is, on the side of the less refrangible rays.
    (5) In accordance with this, the fall of each curve is more
 rapid on the side of the shorter undulations. For the two
 cases of which we have given diagrams, all sensible heat
 disappears before the curves reach the limit of the visible
 spectrum : there is only dark heat.
    7. Solar Curve—I have also endeavoured to compare my
theoretical curves, as to general form, with the curve of solar
energy beyond the atmosphere. In         #   4 the separate points
correspond to the numbers given by Prof. Langley in No. 9
of the table 120 of his work, ‘Researches on Solar Heat, &c.’
The dotted curve has been traced from curve 3 of plate 15 of
the same work, and the continuous curve gives the theoretical
 curve represented by the equation
                                  M
                         IA=Ae" xx", . . . . . . (17)
 and passing through the observed points A and B.
   To take account of the difference between theory and obser
 vation (a greater difference in this case than in the preceding
 one), we must remember that not only equation (17), but also

                   of Energy in the Spectra of Solids.               435
 the more general formula (10), can only be considered as a
 first approximation; that these equations have been deduced
 for solid bodies, and not for such bodies as the sun; and,
 lastly, that in our atmosphere, as well as in the colder regions
 of the gas surrounding the sun there must occur the pheno

  a portion of the more refrangible radiations would be trans
  formed into longer undulations, which would tend to modify
  the spectral diagram exactly in the sense indicated by obser
 vation.
     Recognizing the provisional character of the ideas suggested
  in this paper, I hope that it will be possible to give them a
  greater development and precision when once we are in pos
  session of more complete experimental data to guide us in this
  study. We should then be able to express by one sufficiently
  exact formula the law of distribution of radiant energy as a
  function of the wave-length and the temperature of the source.
  Such a formula would be of great service in all questions
  arising in the study of spectra.

 The Testing of Materials of Construction. A Text-book for the
    Engineering Laboratory and a Collection of the Results of
    Experiment.      By WILLIAM CAwTHORNE UNwiN, F.R.S.,
    M. Inst. C.E., Professor of Engineering at the Central Institution
    of the City and Guilds of London Institute, formerly Professor
    of Hydraulic and Mechanical Engineering at the Royal Indian
    Engineering College. (London : Longmans, Green, and Co.,
    1888.)
    The present work is a treatise on the strength of materials used
 in construction, considered in connexion with the instruments and
 methods by which the properties of materials are investigated
 experimentally.
    The treatise consists of three parts. In the first, the mechanical
 properties of materials are explained—that is, their elasticity and
 plasticity, and the relations between stress and strain. In the
 second, the apparatus used in the engineering laboratory is described.
 Lastly, the third part contains a collection of the most complete
 and trustworthy results of testing, of all the ordinary materials of
 construction.                                      -
    After an introduction, which the reader will do well to reperuse
 when he has gone through the whole work, the author devotes
 three chapters to an explanation of the mechanical properties of
 materials. His explanations here, and indeed throughout the
 book, are lucid and can be readily followed even by those who
 may not be in possession of very advanced mathematical knowledge.
 Some of the deductions, however, which the author makes from
the experiments which he quotes do not seem to us to be quite
justifiable. We find for instance on page 89 the statement, “Some
remarkable experiments of Colonel Maitland at Woolwich show
that, contrary to common prejudice, the ultimate elongation is
increased by very rapid loading.” We do not think that Colonel
Maitland's experiments, which were made on bars of unhardened
steel only two inches in length, settle the question, especially as
we learn on page 291 that “M. Barba has stated that in rapid
testing, the resistance is somewhat greater and the elongation less
than in slow testing.” We rather incline to the opinion that when
the length of the piece tested is large compared with the sectional
area, slow testing, if not too slow, will often produce a greater
ultimate elongation than very rapid testing. In the case of iron
and steel very slow testing will always produce less elongation
than rapid testing. Again, though M. Tresca observed with lead
and other plastic metals that large plastic deformation was unac
companied by any sensible change in the density, the reader should
not be allowed to infer, as he probably would, that there is no
sensible change in density accompanying large plastic deformations
of such metals as copper and iron. The density of copper may be

                   Motices respecting New Books.                437
increased nearly 5 per cent. by compression between the dies used in
coining, and 1 per cent. by simple longitudinal extension. Such
changes of density are not great, but it would have been better, we
think, to have given the reader some idea of their extent.
   We would pause here for a moment to observe that though
Professor Unwin has wisely not confined himself to consulting only
the memoirs of engineers, but has also paid some little attention to
the experiments which physicists have made on elasticity, he might
have still further profited by the latter. We venture to say that a
closer inspection of such memoirs as those of Wertheim (Annales
de Chimie, vol. xii. 1844), G. Wiedemann (Wiedemann's Annalen,
1879, vol. vi. p. 485, and elsewhere), and of Herbert Tomlinson
(Phil. Trans. 1883, 1886), would have been not without profit.
The experiments of Wiedemann are especially valuable and
throw very considerable light on the effect of repeated stress
whether of bending, torsion, or extension. Tomlinson has also
shown that the internal friction of metals does not depend upon
the velocity with which deformation is taking place, whereas we
are told on page 47 that it does.
   “The author has had opportunity of examining nearly every
form of testing machine, and of using very nearly all the subsidiary
measuring and other apparatus here described.” As might be
expected, therefore, the next four chapters, which deal with the
apparatus used in the engineering laboratory, are good, and indeed
could not well be better. It is impossible to read the description
of the 450-ton Emery Testing Machine at Watertown Arsenal,
U.S.A., without being strongly impressed. “This machine is pro
bably the largest and most accurate testing machine in the world.
Before acceptance by the Board a link of hard iron, 5 inches in
diameter, was placed in the machine, and slowly strained in tension
till it broke at 722,000 lbs. Without any readjustment a horse
hair was then fixed in the machine and broken at an indicated
stress of 1 lb.”
   The last eight chapters are occupied with the results of testing.
Out of an enormous mass of data which has accumulated during the
last forty years, a very judicious selection has been made. The
tables of results which are given are all the more valuable in that
they have all been reduced to common units and are consequently
most easily understood and compared.
    We are sorry to learn from Professor Unwin that in most cases
Young's Modulus is measured by the ratio of longitudinal stress
and strain, when the last includes not only temporary but also per
manent and subpermanent strain. It is no wonder that even the
careful observations of Professor Bauschinger (p. 250) show vari
ations in the modulus which actually amount to 10 per cent., and
this too with instruments which would enable him to determine
the modulus within one-half per cent. According to Young, his
modulus of elasticity is the amount of end-pull or end-thrust re
quired to produce any infinitesimal elongation or contraction. Now
provided a bar be loaded and unloaded a number of times with
    Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 25. No. 156. May 1888.            2G

438                      Geological Society :
 any fairly small temporary load (say not exceeding one tenth the
 breaking-load) until the elongation which is produced on putting
 on the load is equal to the contraction which ensues on taking
 it off, and the ratio of the temporary stress to the temporary
 strain then produced be taken as measuring Young's modulus, we
 obtain a result which is practically the same as when the deforma
 tion is infinitesimal, one which is independent of the amount of
 permanent load and, provided in the case of iron and steel which
 have been permanently deformed rest be allowed, one which is
 independent of any previous permanent extension of the metal.

TH' following communications were read:—
       1. “On the Gneissic Rocks off the Lizard.” By Howard Fox,
Esq., F.G.S.; with Notes on Specimens by J. J. H. Teall, Esq.,
F.G.S.
    The rocks may be classed under three heads:—(i.) the coarse
gneisses or Mén Hyr type, (ii.) the light-banded granulitic gneisses
or Wiltshire type, and (iii.) the transition micaceous rocks of “Lab
ham Reefs,” type intermediate between (ii.) and the mainland
schists.
   The first are seen in Mulvin, Taylor's Rock, Man-of-war Rocks,
the Stags, Men Par, Clidgas, Mén Hyr, and Wasiler; the second in
Sanspareil, the Quadrant, and adjoining reefs, Labham Rocks, &c.;
and the third in the Labham reefs.
   The inclination of the divisional planes appeared conformable
with that of the rocks of the mainland.
   The gneisses and granulites of several of the islands are traversed
by numerous dykes of porphyritic basic rock, seen in Taylor's Rock,
Man-of-war Rocks, Sanspareil, Quadrant Rock and Shoals, and Clid
gas. These dykes have been disturbed by movements subsequent
to their intrusion. They sometimes strike across the foliation
planes of the gneiss and send veins into the latter rock; at other

             Rev. J. F. Blake on the Monian System.                439
times the strike is parallel to that of the foliation-planes; the two
modes of occurrence are occasionally observable in different portions
of the course of the same dyke, e. g. in one traversing that part of
the Man-of-war group known as the Spire. This dyke is also
noticeable from the fact that it appears to be traversed by veins of
gneiss.
   The dykes vary in width from 18 inches to several feet.
   In his notes on the specimens Mr. Teall says that the rocks may
be arranged in four groups:—
   1, principally occurring in the outer islands, are of the Mên Hyr
type, consisting of felspar, quartz, dark mica, and hornblende; the
quartz and felspar sometimes exhibit relations characteristic of
igneous rocks, at other times they form a fine-grained granulitic
aggregate, the latter being probably the result of dynamic meta
morphism. This granulation is carried to a greater extent in some
of the islands, as in Taylor's Rocks. The rocks possess the minera
logical composition of quartz diorite, and may be termed tonalite
gneisses; they may originally have been eruptive tonalites.
    2, occurring chiefly in the inner islands, are of the nature of
granulitic gneisses and granulites, confining the latter term to rocks
in which the quartz and felspar are present wholly in the form of a
micro-crystalline mosaic of fairly uniform grain. In some of these
foliation is not well marked. Such rocks occur in “Wiltshire,” &c.
    3. Rocks showing a passage from the granulitic rocks to the
mica-schists of the mainland, as the brown schistose rocks of Lab
ham Reefs. The Enoch rock, a coarse quartzless hornblende schist,
also has affinities with the mainland schists.
    4. Dykes traversing the gneisses, consisting of porphyritic felspars
lying in a ground-mass of hornblende and granulitic felspar. The
hornblende is probably secondary after augite, and the rocks epi
diorites. These dykes have been affected by deformation, and
sometimes pass into actinolite schists near the junction with the
gneissose rocks.
    In conclusion, the period of dynamic metamorphism, of which the
most striking results are seen in the schists of the south-western
 portion of the Lizard peninsula, was posterior to the formation of
the basic dykes. There is no evidence of igneous action in this
 district since the period of metamorphism.
   2. “The Monian System.”          By the Rev. J. F. Blake, M.A.,
F.G.S.
   The object of the author was to show that the whole of the rocks
which, under various names, had been described as Pre-Cambrian in
Anglesey constitute a single well-characterized system, of which the
various divisions hitherto described are integral and inseparable
parts.
   The evidence of these rocksbeing Pre-Cambrian was first discussed,
and it was shown that the greater part of it went no further than
to prove them Pre-Ordovician, the basal conglomerates being asso
ciated with rocks of Arenig age, though from the occurrence of these

440                      Geological Society:—
conglomerates on Holyhead Island it was inferred that the previous
denudation had been great. The rocks of the eastern district, how
ever, are proved to be Pre-Cambrian from the basal Cambrian rocks
of Bangor type lying on them unconformably near Beaumaris and
near Redwharf Bay. The rocks described are found in six distinct
districts in Anglesey.
   1. The Western District.—The lowest rocks are the great quartz
ites of Holyhead, which pass at Porth-yr-ogof and inland into chlo
ritic schists, which are foliated in planes of lamination, and thus
is produced a tough rock which will not cleave or break, but
bends into minute contortions.        Towards the east this becomes
finer in grain, and may be distinguished as chloritoid schist. On
the side of the Straits near the valley it may be seen passing into
purple slate. Further north the rocks are confused, especially at
Porth-y-defaid, but there is no well-defined fault. The material
becomes irregular and forms rocks described as “marbled slate,”
“lenticular pelites,” and soft tuffs.     Amongst such are found two
special features, viz. masses of quartz in the form of knobs, and
lenticular patches of limestone. These it is suggested were pro
duced by the agency of springs rising through and into the ashy
rocks. They are specially characteristic of this part of the series.
The granite of Pen-bryn-yr-Eglwys is intrusive, and its junction may
be seen in several places, the surrounding rocks developing mica.
It is here therefore the youngest rock.
   On the south-west side of a fault in Holyhead Island and the
neighbouring mainland occurs a distinct group of rocks, continuous
upwards from the chloritoid schists, and equivalent to the volcanic
facies of the north. These are called the South Stack series. They
are characteristically bedded, thrown into large folds, sporadically
cleaved, and possess cleavage-foliation. They contain great beds of
quartzite, and others of light dusty material. When not cleaved
they are almost entirely unaltered.
   The spot near Tywyn, supposed to show fragments of granite
contained in a rock of the upper series, and hence the conformity of
the two, shows only an intrusive diabase which has caught up
granitic fragments.
   2. The Central District.—This is divided into two parts by a
fault. That on the east consists of grey gneiss, considered to be
the lowest rock of the whole series, with the quartzite at Bodofon as
an episode, followed after a fault by chloritoid schists, so intimately
connected with the overlying volcanic facies as to be inseparable.
The principal features of the latter are the agglomerates of Llangefni,
the quartz knobs, and the more or less bedded sporadic limestones.
The portion on the west consists of ashes and fine hälleflintas, toge
ther with gneissose rocks of no great similarity to the grey gneiss.
These have been so interfered with by intrusive rocks that it is
difficult to ascertain their true original character. These intrusions
consist of (1) Diorite, often foliated, with the folia contorted, and
affording by its brecciation some portion of the surrounding rocks.
(2) Granite, seen everywhere to be either intrusive, as at Porth-y

             Rev. J. F. Blake on the Monian System.                441
dee, Ceryg-defaid, Craig-y-allor, and Maen-wyn, or absorptive, as
near Llyn-faelog. This granite is of various kinds, often passing
into a felsite.
   3. The District west of Traeth Dulas shows granite intrusive into
grey gneiss, and also passing into a felsite; it is correlated with the
western half of the central district, of which it appears to be a con
tinuation.
   4. The Eastern District.—The lowest portion here is the grey
gneiss, which is very compact towards the west, especially near the
igneous rocks, but becomes more micaceous and chloritic towards
the east, passing through chloritoid rocks into others of the volcanic
facies, with the usual quartz knobs and sporadic limestones, but
here, on the whole, more slaty. The complete unity of the whole
system is here well seen. The most remarkable feature is the in
trusive foliated diorites, which are coarse and non-foliated near
Holland Arms, but become finer towards the east, where also
glaucophane takes the place of hornblende. They are seen intruding
into and contorting the grey gneiss in the Llangaffo cutting.
   At the southern end at Careg-gwladys is a remarkable volcanic
group, with a spherulitic diabase breaking into and surrounding the
baked blocks of calcareous slate. There are associated great
masses of mixed agglomerate, and terminated masses of limestone
and quartzite filled with brecciated fragments.
   5. The Northern District.—This commences in the south with the
chloritic schists, but soon becomes slaty, and such rocks with grits
occupy the greater part of the area. But towards the north we
reach the volcanic facies, characterized as usual by ashes, agglome
rates, quartz knobs, in one case, near Bull Bay, seen to cross the
bedding, and sporadic limestones at Llanbadrig, showing oolite
within oolite, and suggesting its origin by a petrifying spring.
Above the quartz is found a great conglomerate, apparently derived
from it, and immediately above this conglomerate occur the fossils
discovered by Prof. Hughes, and no line of separation can be dis
covered between them and the rest of the rocks in the district.
These fossils have been referred to Bala species, and there are
three alternatives to choose: either (1) they are not Bala fossils,
but are characteristic of the Pre-Cambrian rocks; or (2) they are
Bala fossils, and the dividing line has as yet been missed; or (3)
there is no dividing line, and the whole series is of Bala age.
Against the latter is their similarity to the rocks of the eastern
district definitely overlain by Cambrian; and against both the two
latter is the fact that the series is unconformably overlain in the
neighbourhood by other conglomerates succeeded by black shales in
which Llandeilo Graptolites have been recorded.
   6. The District north-east of Parys mountain is a volcanic com
plex, in which granitic and felsitic rocks with others of a more
basic character are inextricably mixed with the débris of the same
materials, and both are altered so as to be, in most places, insepa
rable. This is connected on the N.W. side with grey gneiss.
   In the Lleyn the rocks belong to the volcanic facies, in which

 442                     Geological Society:—
great masses of quartz-felsite, foliated at the edges, are intruded.
Here also are found the quartz knobs and sporadic limestones as well
 as diabase-flows. At Mynydd ystum is found an isolated patch of
 grey gneiss.
    The area between Bangor and Caernarvon has lately been shown
to contain some felsite-flows, and also granites, apparently intrusive
 into ashes, which may belong to the volcanic facies.
     At Howth, near Dublin, the rocks have all the characters of the
 South-Stack series, to which they may be correlated; and these are
 followed upwards by the well-known Bray-Head rocks, which differ
 from them in character, but whose fossils are not of Cambrian
 species.
    The succession thus shown in the various districts consists of the
 following in ascending order. The grey gneiss, becoming more
 quartzose, micaceous, or chloritic in parts, and so representing the
 quartzite and the chloritic schists of other districts; changing through
 chloritoid schists into two facies, viz., (1) the slaty, represented
 best in the northern district, and also as the South-Stack series;
 and (2) the volcanic facies. No further deposits are recognized in
 the areas of the volcanic facies, but in the slaty area of Howth the
 Bray-Head rocks succeed.
    To the whole system of rocks the name of MonTAN is applied, as
 derived from Mona, or the Isle of Anglesey, and the several parts
 are distinguished as the Holyhead group, or Lower Monian, the
St. David's group and the equivalent of the South-Stack Series, or
Middle Monian, and the Bray-Head group, or Upper Monian.
    The “Pebidian” represents the St. David's group, and but for its
termination, which indicates a system, might be used as an alterna
tive. The “Dimetian and Arvonian” are intrusive granites, or
felsitic flows associated with the same group.
    The Monian system, though much metamorphosed in its lowest
parts, is not considered Archaean, but as a lower sedimentary system
than the Cambrian, and hence the lowest system of our ordinary
stratified rocks.

                              in the Chair.
    The following communications were read:—
    1. “On some Eroded Agate Pebbles from the Soudan.”                By
Prof. W. Ball, M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   The majority of the pebbles in a collection made by Surgeon
Major Greene in the Soudan, and presented by him to the Science
and Art Museum in Dublin, are of very similar character to the
agate and jasper pebbles derived from the basalts of India. It
may be concluded inferentially that they came originally from a
region in which basaltic rocks occur to a considerable extent. A
certain number of them are eroded in a manner unlike anything
noticed in India, though it is probable that similar eroded pebbles
will eventually be found there.

          Mode of Transport of Granite and other Rocks.          443
   Throughout India, wherever there is deficient subsoil-drainage
or excessive evaporation and limited rainfall, salts are apparent
either in supersaturated subsoil-solutions or as crystallizations in
the soil. They are most abundant in basaltic regions, and in a
lake occupying a hollow in the basalt in Berar carbonate of soda is
deposited in abundance from the water, which becomes super
saturated during the summer.
   The author commented on the efficacy of such a liquid as a solvent
of silica, and noticed the selective action of the agent which had
affected the Soudan pebbles and had corroded some layers more than
others; he suggested that while this might be to some extent due
to differences in composition, it was more probably owing to differ
ences of nodular constitution. He considered it unnecessary to refer
to the action of humic acid, because, while the salt to which the
solvent action is attributed would be capable of doing such work,
and would be probably abundant in the region referred to, we could
not expect any great amount of humic acid in the same area. "
   2. “On the Probable Mode of Transport of the Fragments of
Granite and other Rocks which are found imbedded in the Carboni
ferous Limestone of the neighbourhood of Dublin.” By Prof. W.
Ball, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   Angular fragments of granite and of schist, quartzite, and vein
quartz, such as might have been derived from the metamorphosed
rocks which rest on the granite near Dublin, have been discovered
in beds of Carboniferous Limestone, which often contain fragments
of fossils, especially Encrinites. They have been previously noticed
by Professor Haughton, Mr. H. B. S. Montgomery, Prof. Jukes, and
Mr. Croll. While Prof. Jukes refers their transportation to the
agency of land-plants, Mr. Croll quotes their occurrence in support
of his argument as to the existence of glacial conditions during the
Carboniferous period,
   The author observed that the specimens exhibited none of the
indications of the existence of glacial conditions, whether we regard
the characters of the boulders or the nature of the rock in which
they are imbedded, which contains no such silt as that occurring in
the boulder-bed of the Talchir formation. Whilst rejecting the
view that they were transported by ice, he pointed out that they
need not necessarily have been carried by land-plants, but that they
might have been torn from the sea-floor by marine algae, some of
which may have had a more buoyant character than those of modern
seas. He cited the case of a sandy beach in the neighbourhood of
Youghal, which is strewn with limestone fragments, which had
been conveyed by sea-weeds thrown up after storms from submarine
banks.
   It was suggested that the occurrence of natural fissures in the
rocks and cracks produced by concussions from large masses hurled
about by the waves might sufficiently explain how the fragments
could be freed from the main mass of the reefs under the stress of
the waves.

   3. “The Upper Eocene, comprising the Barton and Upper Bag
shot Formations.” By J. Starkie Gardner, Esq., F.G.S., and Henry
Keeping, Esq.; with an Appendix by H. W. Monckton, Esq., F.G.S.
   The familiar Upper Eocene having been transferred to the Oligo–
cene, the remaining uppermost division of the Eocene bears the title
Middle.    Unless the considerable literature relating to the Brackles
hams, the Calcaire Grossier, and the Nummulitic, is to be rendered
obsolete, their classification as Middle Eocene must be preserved, and
a modified Upper Eocene constructed out of the Barton series. The
authors' proposal is that the following should be adopted:—
                             London Area.           Hampshire Area.
                                                   Upper Barton.
      Upper Eocene                                 Middle      ,
                        Upper Bagshot Sands.       Lower       **
   The base of the formation is not sharply defined, but it coincides
with the final disappearance of several subtropical Mollusca, and
almost with the extinction of Nummulites in our area. The upper
limit is drawn at the base of the Lower Headon, where the brackish
 fauna gives place to one of fresh water.
   The conditions of deposition were examined at some length, and evi
dence in support of the estuarine origin of the formation was adduced.
The section in Christchurch Bay was described first, and the thickness
and characteristics of each subdivision given, the total reaching 170
to 180 feet.    It commences with 45 feet of whitish sand, and in
ascending order, a pebble-bed, 11 feet of greenish clay, and a band
of imperfect ironstone underlying the zone of Nummulites elegans.
Then 20 feet of stiff drab clay, 13 feet of drab clay with sand-drifts,
and 12 feet of the same, known as the Highcliff Sands.       The Lower
Barton terminates with the Pholadomya-bed. The fauna of this
division comprises many Bracklesham species, which range no farther
up, and a large number of peculiar species. The most convenient
base-line for the Middle Barton is the lowest of several bands of
Septaria, which distinguish the 50 feet of drab clays which are com
prised in it, and it terminates in a very remarkable formation known
as the shell-bed, which though only a foot or two thick at Highcliff,
thickens to about 15 feet to the east, and to 22 feet in the new
Christchurch cutting. The finest Barton fossils are obtained from
the Middle division; but though so many splendid species charac
terize it, few are absolutely confined to it. The upward range of
a further number of Bracklesham species ceases at the shell-bed.
The Upper Barton includes the Chama-bed, the Becton Bunny and
the Long Mead End beds.
   The Becton Bunny beds, 52 ft. thick, are sand in the lower half
and sandy clay above-Oliva Branderi is the characteristic fossil,
and a large number of bivalves and brackish Headon Gasteropods
come in. Opinions have differed considerably as to whether these
beds should be included in the Bartons.      The series closes with the
Long-Mead-End Sands, 20 ft. thick, with similar fossils, and for
merly known as the Upper Bagshot Sands of the Hampshire basin.
The section is continued without any break into the Lower Headon.

             Mr. J. S. Gardiner on the Upper Eocene.              445
   The next section described was that exposed in the cuttings for the
new line from Brockenhurst to Christchurch, and here great changes
in the relative thicknesses are seen, confirming the view that the
Barton formation is the local deposit of a limited estuary. The
Chama-bed remains 18 ft. thick, but the shell-bed thickens to 22 ft.
and the drab clay with Septaria is only 10 ft. The underlying
greenish compact clay looks like Lower Barton, but may belong to
the Middle. The Upper Bartons are much weathered and unfos
siliferous, but the Paludina-beds of the Lower Headon do not appear
for 3900 yards east. Some of these, 2330 yards west of the Brocken
hurst road, are violently contorted.
    The Alum-Bay section was then compared with those previously
given, and the authors also noticed the Bracklesham, Stubbington,
and Hunting-Bridge sections to show the transitional character of
the highest of the Bracklesham beds. The paper concluded with
an analysis of the fauna, and carefully revised and tabulated lists.
    Mr. Monckton, in his Appendix, stated that in the London basin
the Barton beds are represented by the Upper Bagshot Sand, a mass
of yellow or nearly white sand without clay-beds, though often
loamy. Its greatest proved thickness is 228 feet, and the base is
 marked by a very persistent bed of pebbles.
    Its extent is considerably greater than is shown on the Geolo
 gical Survey map.
    Casts and impressions of shells are abundant in some places, but
 recognizable species have only been found at Tunnel Hill near
 North Camp Station, Aldershot. A large collection from this place
 has been made by Mr. Herries and by the author.

    The following communications were read:—
    1. “On the Lower Beds of the Upper Cretaceous Series in
 Lincolnshire and Yorkshire.” By W. Hill, Esq., F.G.S.
    The Red Chalk which forms the basement-bed of the Upper Cre
 taceous in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire is a continuation of the Hun
 stanton Limestone.     Its thickness increases in South Lincolnshire
 to thin away again in the north of that county; but it again in
 creases north of the Humber for a while.        Near its most north
 westerly exposure on the Yorkshire Wolds the red colour is lost;
 but Inoceramus sulcatus and Belemnites minimus are found in a
 dirty yellow-coloured material of trifling thickness. Eastwards it
 regains its red colour and thickness, so as to be upwards of 30 feet
 at Speeton, where also it is less calcareous.   This section was de
 scribed in detail, and the results compared with those of other
  writers. The author speculated upon the probable limits of the
  Upper Cretaceous sea at this period on evidence mainly based upon
  the amount of matter of inorganic origin.   He noted that Am. inter
  ruptus has been found at Withcall, Am. rostratus at South Cave, and
  Am...? auritus at Wharram Grange.
     The base of the Chalk Marl through Lincolnshire continues to

 446                     Geological Society:—
 be marked by a bed of compact limestone, which is the representa
 tive of the “sponge-bed” of Hunstanton.       This can also be traced
 in Yorkshire as far as the north-western extremity of the Wolds.
 Above this a few feet of grey gritty chalk retain the character of
 the “Inoceramus-bed ” throughout the area above mentioned. At
 the north-western extremity of the Wolds the main mass of the
 Chalk Marl has diminished in thickness, but more than recovers
 this at Speeton, where, according to the chemical and microscopical
 evidence, there is a complete passage from the “Gault” to the
 “Chalk Marl.” The peculiar development of the latter at Speeton
 was very fully described. No bed such as the Cambridge Greensand
 or the Chloritic Marl can be taken as a line of separation.
    Throughout Lincolnshire and Yorkshire certain courses of grey
 coloured chalk are recognizable on the horizon of the Totternhoe
 Stone: these are known collectively as the “Grey bed.” Much
 comminuted shell and numerous Pectens characterize this bed, which
is faintly recognizable even at Speeton. The “Grey bed” deter
mines the upper limit of the Chalk Marl. The equivalents of the
 Grey Chalk vary less in thickness throughout the area than those
 already described. Certain lithological characters, which first
begin to manifest themselves in the marly beds just above the
Totternhoe Stone in Norfolk, become greatly developed in South
Lincolnshire, and throughout that county, as in Norfolk, the Grey
Chalk is usually of a marly nature. In Lincolnshire there is much
red coloration on this horizon. The occurrence of Belemnitella plena
in Lincolnshire has been recognized.      The band of bluish black
clayey material in which it occurs at Barton continues throughout
Yorkshire, but no Belemnite has yet been found. Allusion was made
to the characteristic features towards the base of the Middle Chalk.
Lists of fossils were given, and a new species of Holaster (H. rotun
dus) was described. Numerous chemical analyses and microscopic
details of structure were also given.
   2. “On the Cae-Gwyn Cave, North Wales.” By Henry Hicks,
M.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.; with an Appendix by C. E. De Rance, Esq.,
F.G.S.
   The author gave an account of the exploration of the cavern
during the latter part of 1885, and during 1886–7. He considered
that the results obtained during that time proved conclusively that
there was no foundation for the views of those who contended that
the drift which covered over the entrance and extended into the
cavern was remanié, but they proved that the deposits which lay
over the bone-earth were in situ, and were identical with the
normal glacial deposits of the area. These deposits had once ex
tended continuously across the valley, and the cavern (400 feet
above Ordnance Datum) had consequently been completely buried
beneath them.
   The cave must have been occupied by animals during the forma
tion of the bone-earth, before any of the glacial deposits now found
there had accumulated, and a thick floor of stalagmite had covered

               On the Cae-Gwyn Cave, North Wales.                 447
this “earth” before the cavern had been subjected to water-action.
This action had broken up the floor, and completely resorted the
materials, and added sandy and gravelly material to the deposits;
this sand and gravel had been examined by Prof. Boyd Dawkins,
who found that it agreed in every particular with the glacial sand
and gravel occurring in the valley a little way above. The large
limestone blocks in the cavern had also been evidently disturbed by
water-action; they were invariably found in the lowest deposits,
and were covered over by laminated clay, sand, and gravels. The
author considered it certain that the caverns had been completely
filled with these materials, and in the case of the Cae-Gwyn Cave
they appeared to have been conveyed mainly through the entrance
recently discovered under the drift. The stratification at this
entrance was so marked, and could be traced so continuously in
wards over the bone-earth, that there could be no doubt that this
was the main entrance. There was not the slightest evidence that
any portion of the material had been conveyed in through a swallow
hole, and the conditions witnessed throughout were such as to pre
clude any such idea.
   The author quoted a Report by Dr. Geikie, who considered that
the wall of the cavern had given way, but before the deposition of
the glacial deposits, which were subsequently laid down against
the limestone bank so as to conceal this entrance to the cavern.
   In conclusion, he referred to the presence of reindeer remains in
these caves, in conjunction with those of the so-called older Pleis
tocene mammalia, proving that these had reached the area long
before the period of submergence, and evidently at an early stage
in the Glacial period. It was important to remember that reindeer
remains had been found in the oldest river-gravels in which im–
plements had been discovered.      Man, as proved by the implements
discovered, was also present at the same time with the reindeer,
and it was therefore natural to suppose that he migrated into this
area in company with that animal from some northern source,
though this did not preclude the idea that he might also have
reached this country from some eastern or southern source, perhaps
even at an earlier period.
   Mr. De Rance, in an Appendix, confirmed Dr. Hicks's observa
tions as to the identity of the deposits outside the cavern with those
in its interior, and noted the occurrence of limestone blocks in the
lower deposits, not merely at the spot where the supposed broken
wall was situated, but also throughout the whole tunnel.           He
stated that the sand bed forming the uppermost cave-deposit re
sembled the sand associated with gravels in a pit 400 yards east of
the cave at a slightly higher level. The drift exposed in this gravel
pit he believed to be of the same age as that of the Mostyn and
Bagillt pits to the north, which were undoubtedly overlain by
Upper Boulder-clay. The westerly termination of the bone-earth
outside the cave had not been determined, which he regretted; but
traces of bone had been found at a point five feet from the over
hanging ridge of the cave.

    ON THE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF HARD AND SOFT STEEL.
                            BY F. KOEILRAUSCH.
 W     E know from Mousson *, and more particularly from the
          thorough investigations of Barust, that the electrical con
 ductivity of steel depends on its hardness, and, as Barus found, so
 closely that the hardening of a soft steel bar can increase its con
 ductivity two or three times.
    If, now, the relation proved by Wiedemann and Franzt to exist for
  different metals, that a metal conducts heat and electricity almost
  equally well, holds also for the influence of mechanical preparation,
 or molecular aggregation, it is to be expected that the thermal conduc
 tivity of steel will be powerfully influenced by its degree of hardness.
    The probability of an affirmative answer to this question follows
 from the fact that the statements respecting the conductivity in
 iron and steel lie much further apart than with other materials.
 Kirchhoff and Hansemann find in three kinds the numbers 0.096,
 0.137, and 0.142 grm. cal:/cm. Sec. The authors do not discuss the
 possible causes of this great difference, and seem to assign it
 principally to the different proportions of carbon and silicon. An
 observation, however, from which follows that the magnetic coercive
 force of the worse conducting iron was the greater, points to an
 influence of the hardness on the conducting power §.
    I used two cylindrical-turned and well polished bars of 1.2 cm.
 diameter, 30 cm. in length, and 270 grammes in mass ||. They
 were cut from the same piece; one was heated and cooled slowly,
 while the other was glass-hardened.
    Sensitive hands can at once tell by holding the cold bars, that
the soft steel conducts better than the hard. A lecture-experiment
on the rate of melting of wax or something similar is sufficient to
show the difference".
    In order to determine the numerical relations approximately, I
 made a few measurements by Despretz's method, which was also
that adopted by Wiedemann and Franz. The end of the bar was
heated by steam, and after the temperature was stationary the
excess of temperature w over the surrounding air was measured in
three equidistant sections *.

   | The soft bars weighed 271, and the hard one 268 grammes.
   * The following method is perhaps the most convenient. The bottoms of
the bars to be compared are placed in a freezing-mixture, of alcohol and
snow for instance, and the height is observed up to which a deposit of mois
ture or of ice takes place.
  * As the conductivity of iron from 0° to 100° does not vary more than
2 per cent, according to Lorenz, it was needless for my purposes to take
this into account.

   For this purpose a thermoelement was used consisting of very
thin German silver and iron wire soldered together; these wires
loaded with a small weight were so laid above the horizontal bar
that the junction was uppermost. At a distance of about 10 cm.
from this place both wires were soldered to thin copper wires,
which by means of a commutator were in connexion with a reflecting
galvanometer. When the thermoelement was in contact with the
bars, the temperature of the junction was obviously proportional to
that of the section in question.
   Loss of heat by radiation was prevented by screens and coatings
of wadding. The junction at the copper wires was sufficiently near
to the temperature of the air for my purposes. As the element
showed accidentally an electrical force nearly proportional to the
difference of temperature, the deflection of the galvanometer was
put for the difference of temperature.
   In order to get an approximate statement as to the absolute con
ductivity, the loss of heat to the surroundings was measured by
heating the entire bar and then observing its gradual decrease of
temperature with the thermoelement suspended over it. These
 observations were made by Mr. Sheldon. According to this the
temperature decreased in ten minutes in the ratio 1.67: 1; the
external conductivity for temperature in one second is therefore
 1.67/600–1=0.00086.
   This number multiplied by the specific heat 0.117 *, and the
 density 7-9, gives the external thermal conductivity reduced to
 unit section =0.00080, so that, denoting the internal conductivity
 by k, we have

that of hard. And as heating to temperatures like that of boiling
water produces an appreciable annealing, the conducting power
of the hard steel determined at a lower temperature would have
been even less.
   The electrical conductivity of the two bars was further determined
by transmitting a constant current, a branch of which was sent
by means of two knife-edges through a sensitive galvanometer in a
current of 5000 to 10,000 ohms resistance. The factor of reduction
to absolute measure was determined by means of a Clark's element.
The conductivities referred to mercury are, according to a measure
ment of Mr. Sheldon,
                      r hard = 3-3,    soft = 5.5.
   A heated and slowly cooled bar of wrought iron of the same dimen
sions was investigated. Its conducting power was about 40 per
cent. higher than that of soft steel:
                      k soft wrought iron = 7.6.
That its conducting power was greater in a similar ratio is shown
by an experiment in the freezing mixture (see p. 448, note). The
height of deposit in hard steel amounted to 72 mm., and in soft
steel to 92 mm., and in soft iron to 110 millim.
   We have thus found for the ratio of the thermal conductivity k
to the electrical conductivity k:—

   draw attention to what I conceive to be a mistake in his view of
   Appalachian structure. Great chains, as we all know, consist
   usually of a granite or metamorphic axis flanked on either side by
   tilted and often crumpled strata. Now Mr. Reade seems to think
   that the strata were pushed back and crumpled by the protruded
   axis. The Appalachian seems inconsistent with this view, but Mr.
   Reade thinks only seemingly so, because the crumpled strata on the
   eastern flank have been completely carried away by erosion.
      Now American geologists believe they have good reason to think
   that the metamorphic region of the Appalachian does not belong
   to the Appalachian chain proper at all, but evisted as land long before
   the Appalachian was born, viz. at the very beginning of the Palaeo
   zoic Era. The evidence of this is, that the very lowest Palaeozoics
   lie everywhere unconformably on the eroded edges of the crumpled
   Archaean, and even the outlines of the old Cambrian shore-line
   can be traced. The Appalachian was not formed until the end of
   the Palaeozoic.
      Perhaps it may not be amiss to call attention also to the struc
   ture of the coast-range of California. It is strongly crumpled,
   with at least five anticlines and corresponding synclines *, and yet
   in many places no sign of a granite or metamorphic axis.

    ON THE ACTION OF LIGHT ON THE ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY
       OF THE HALOID SALTS OF SILVER.            BY SWANTE ARRHENIUS.
      Two parallel silver wires were coiled, at a distance of 2 millim,
   about a rectangular glass plate (4x5 centim.), then painted with
   an ammoniacal solution of chloride or bromide of silver, and slowly
   heated until the water and ammonia had evaporated, so as to form
   a thin skin of chloride or of bromide of silver. The plate was
   covered with a screen with a slit 1 centim. in breadth, and there
   upon placed in various parts of a spectrum 7.2 centim. in length.
   The silver wires were introduced into the circuit of a battery of
   40 Clark's elements, in which was a very sensitive reflecting
*. galvanometer (1 div. =7 x 10-11 amp.). Without illumination the
 *
   galvanometer gave a constant deflection. With illumination this
   was greater, but returned to its former value on darkening. When
   the width of the slit which produced the spectrum was respectively
   0.60, 0.473, and 0.24 centim. in breadth, the action of the light for
   each part of the spectrum was proportional to the intensity of the
   light.   For the various colours, the action increased from the red
   to the line G, first of all slowly, then more rapidly, and sank then
   to the ultra-violet in the reverse direction.     The action is thus not

due to the heating, but corresponds to the strength of the photo
chemical action. According to the author, the velocity of the action
of two bodies, whose specific electrical conductivities are A and A1,
is proportional to the product A. \,; and thus in a mixture of
gelatine and chloride of silver the action must be nearly propor
tional to the conductivity of chloride of silver, since A must be
regarded as tolerably constant for the former. If sensitisers are
present, A, the conductivity of the sensitiser, is variable, and a
maximum is obtained for the colour which exerts an influence, and
which corresponds to a sharp absorption-band, together with the
other maximum without sensitiser.—Wiener Berichte, vol. xcvi.

      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
   In your issue of Febuary last (p. 156) Mr. Deeley brings forward
what he thinks is a new theory of Glacial Motion; but, if I am not
greatly mistaken, it does not differ essentially from that of James
Thomson. In regard to this theory, in 1882 I wrote as follows *:–
“Some time ago James Thomson brought forward a theory which
deserves far more attention than it has yet received. Thomson
shows that the fusing-point of ice is lowered by pressure, and
therefore that ice at or near its freezing-point (as is the fact in
glaciers) is promptly melted by pressure. Now it is obvious that
in the differential motion of a glacier, whatever point, at any
moment, receives the greatest stress of pressure must melt and give
way, and, the stress being relieved, must immediately again refreeze.
Meanwhile, by change of relative position of parts, the stress is
transferred to some other point which in its turn melts, gives
 way, and is refrozen ; and again transfers its stress to still another
 point, and so on. If we compare this theory with Tyndall's, in
 both cases the ice gives way at the point of greatest stress: in the
one case the stress is a stress of tension, in the other of pressure;
in the one case the giving way is by fracture, in the other by
 melting. The differential motion in the one case is by fracture,
 change of position and regelation; in the other by melting, change
 of position and regelation.”
    These of course are not Thomson's words, but only a condensed
 statement of my own of the view I got from studying Thomson.
                                             Very respectfully,

 1. Th: are three ways of defining the coefficient of self
          induction, which lead to the same result if the magnetic
 permeability of the medium is a constant quantity, but which
lead to three different results if it is a variable one, as in the
case of iron.
    The coefficient of self-induction L of a coil of wire through
 which a current C is passing may be defined as the ratio
 between the back electromotive force and the time-rate of
 change of the current C to which it is due; or it may be
defined as the ratio between the flux of induction through
 the coil and the current producing it; or it may be defined
with reference to the electrokinetic energy possessed by the
current C.
    The three definitions are expressed by the equations

force passing through the coil, T is its kinetic energy, and L

   2. If the magnetic medium is air, L1, L3, and La are identical.
If the medium be wholly or partially composed of iron, this is
no longer the case. The values of L differ from each other,
and vary with C. . The value of L1 can easily be found in
terms of L2 from the equation
                         Li=L2+C dL2
                                      dC’
which is an immediate consequence of the first two equations
of definition.
                                                         dL's
   We see that LI=L, only when C=0 or when dC =0,
 and that Li is greater than L2 for small currents where L2 is
increasing with C.
    Since  #. the magnetizing force, is proportional to C ; and
 since N is a measure of 8, the average value of the flux of
 induction per unit area, we see that L2 is directly propor
 tional to u, the average value of the coefficient of magnetic
 permeability for the magnetizing force represented by the
 current C.
    If, therefore, the medium be wholly of one kind, L, will be
 a measure of the permeability of that medium. In any case,
 however, if we know the relation connecting 8 with 5, we
 shall be able to determine the way in which the coefficients
 vary with the magnetizing force.                     -
    If OPKP" (see fig. 1) be the curve connecting 8 with 45
 (or N with C), the value of La for any point P, on it corre
 sponding with the current OC, and the flux of induction ON,
 will be represented by the tangent of the angle which the
 line OP1 makes with the line OC1.
    Since

   3. Maxwell's method of determining the coefficient gives L.,
because the quantity of electricity discharged through the
galvanometer is proportional to the number of lines of force
inserted by the establishment of the current C (or to the
number removed by stopping the current), while the steady
deflection due to a small derangement is proportional to C
directly. The method therefore gives the ratio of N/C or L2.
Professor Ayrton has generalized this method by altering the
current from one value to another, instead of establishing it
from zero to its full value. The quantity discharged through
 the galvanometer is proportional in this case to N1–N2, where
 N1 is the number of lines of force corresponding with the first
 current Ci, and N2 that corresponding with the other cur
 rent C2. If the steady deflection caused by a derangement

and if we multiply this by       o: U., we   shall obtain the value
of  'E', or the tangent of the angle which the chord PiP2
makes with the line OC.
   By observing the ratio     c.c. in addition to the ordinary
quantities measured in Maxwell's method, it is possible to
determine in this way the rate of slope of the curve of mag
netization. If (C1-C3) is very small compared with
# (C1+C2), the value obtained by Prof. Ayrton's method
is L1; but the result is practically the same if the curve of
magnetization does not bend verv much between the values
of  £  corresponding with C1 and C2.
                  Coefficients for small Currents.
   4. It follows from the shape of the initial part of the curve
of magnetization that the value of L2 must at first increase with
the current. The following experiments show that this is the
case. A bar of best Swedish iron, 14 in. long by $ in.
in diameter, was bent into the shape of a horseshoe. Each
end was surrounded by a bobbin, 2% in. in diameter and
44 in. long, wound with 400 turns of wire. The self-induction
of the two bobbins in series was obtained by Maxwell’s method.
The battery used was an ordinary Leclanché cell. The swings
were in most cases taken on breaking the circuit, since, if the
galvanometer-key be pressed just before the battery-key is
released, the error caused by a slight want of balance in the
bridge is reduced to a minimum. For a similar reason, the
deflection corresponding with a known derangement was
always estimated from #. difference between two deflections.
The current flowing through the coil was calculated from the
electromotive force of the battery and the resistances in the
network. The following numbers represent the mean of
several concordant values:—

through it. The experiments are in fair accordance with the
relation
                        L2+ 2A+ 0425.
Since A is proportional to $5, and L3 is proportional to $8/45,
the above experiments tend to show that the part of the curve
of magnetization between the points corresponding with the
currents 047 and 107 ampere is a parabola of the form
                        $8– a £5°+b £).
   5. It was, however, desirable to see whether this relation
would still hold good for smaller magnetizing forces. With
this view the experiments were repeated some months after
wards in a somewhat different way. The coefficient was
determined by comparing it with the capacity of a standard
condenser. £ arms, p, q, of a Wheatstone bridge (see fig. 2)
consisted of doubly wound resistance-coils of 10,000 ohms each.
 The resistance g of the galvanometer used was also about
                               Fig. 2.
 10,000 ohms. To the coil q was shunted a condenser of
 # microfarad capacity. The opposite branch r of the bridge
 contained the electromagnet whose self-induction was re
 quired. The resistance of the arm s was 5 ohms, and that of
 r was adjusted till there was balance. The battery used was

 more or less resistance into the battery-circuit. If the bridge
 is balanced for steady currents, and the battery-circuit be
 opened, the swing 61, produced will be proportional to
  La-Kps, where L, is the coefficient required and K is the
 known capacity. if one of the terminals of the condenser be

    This method, although only comparative, has several advan
 tages over Maxwell's absolute method. It is quicker and
 simpler; there are only two quantities to observe, and the
 readings may be taken immediately after each other. It is,
 moreover, not so necessary to have a good ballistic galvano
 meter. It will generally be best to work with the relations
                  p=q, p + r=29, Kps=2L.
 The best ratio, r/p, will be determined by the resistances and
 batteries available, and by the currents it is desirable to use.
 In the following experiments these relations were not adhered
to, because the galvanometer was sufficiently sensitive, and
because it was desirable to alter the currents flowing without
 rendering it necessary to readjust the bridge.
    In all swing methods it is necessary to have the bridge well
 balanced for steady currents. A fine adjustment can be con
 veniently obtained by sliding a bare wire of suitable thick
ness round a terminal, since it is not generally necessary to
know the resistance of the arm of which it is a part, and it
can of course be placed in the arm of unknown resistance. I
believe the device used in the Cavendish laboratory is to shunt
one resistance-box by another. The balance of the bridge has
to be so good that the heating caused by the momentary
passage of the current is often sufficient to destroy it.
   The annexed table indicates the results obtained with the
electromagnet with the iron core. The swings were obtained

   The values obtained for L2 are slightly lower than the
corresponding values obtained by Maxwell's method three
months previously. This is probably due to the fact that
the electromotive forces of the cells used were only approxi
''      determined. The differences, however, are small, and
may have been due to alterations in the state of the iron.
The values for L2 obtained for small currents are seen to be
much lower than those given by the equation
                         L2+ 2A+-0425.
They are, however, very much higher than that of the coil
with the iron core removed.      The coefficient in this case was
-0028 secohms.
   6. The coefficient was very much increased by keeping a
piece of soft iron pressed against the poles of the electro
magnet. As, however, under these circumstances, a large
fraction of the magnetism remained on removing the mag.
netizing current, the values obtained depended upon the
previous history. Thus the value of L2 obtained for a mag
netizing current of about :04 ampere varied between 337
secohm and 130 secohm, according as the flings were ob
tained on reversing the current, on breaking the battery
circuit, or on   £         it so as to include or exclude the
permanent magnetism. The numbers obtained showed,
moreover, that the curve of magnetization was not quite
symmetrical with respect to positive and negative currents.

different currents by the method of reversals. The resistances

   7. As the magnetic circuit in this case was entirely composed
of iron, it was easy to reduce the observations to absolute
measure. The values of the induction 8, the magnetic
force $5, and the magnetic permeability u were calculated in
C.G.S. units from the formulae
                  108             47tn             109/
          $3 =    #SL2A,     $ = In     A,   A =   £s"
where A was        the current in amperes, L, the coefficient of
self-induction     in secohms, S and l the mean values of the
sectional area     and length of the magnetic circuit in centi
metres, and n     the number of turns.
   The iron core was half an inch in diameter and 14 inches
long, and the distance between the poles was 3 inches. The
number of turns was 800.        Whence
                                   7T /2'54"Y2
    l=17x2'54=432, S=              #(#)        =1:27,    n=800.
If these values are substituted, we obtain
         $8=98,700 L2A, 45–23:3A, u =4,240 L2.
The numbers obtained very approximately fulfil the following
relations:-                              -
                          L2 =0.05+3.9A,
                            u=210+720 £),
                           $8=210 5+720.5°.
   The values were obtained for reversals of magnetizing force
whose semiamplitude £5 was       £ than 0.06 and less than
09 C.G.S. units. Beyond these limits the value of $8 pro
bably differs from that given by the above relation. By
employing the secohmmeter of Professors Ayrton and Perry,
it would have been possible to obtain values of L, for much

                 of the Coefficients of Induction.            461

magnetism.

   8. The coefficient of self-induction of a coil with an iron
magnetic circuit can far more easily be obtained for strong
magnetic forces when the magnetism is maintained by an
independent magnetic field than when the magnetism of the
iron has to be excited by the current through the coil itself.
In a transformer, for instance, where there are two coils
identically situated with respect to the iron circuit, the
coefficients of self and mutual induction are in the ratio
                             nt : n : n1n2,
where the ratio of the turns on the first coil to that on the
 second is n, : n2. This will be true whatever the state of
 magnetization. If, therefore, one coil is used to excite the
magnetism, and the other to test it, the values of the coeffi
cients can be obtained without the least difficulty. Again, it
is easy to obtain by Maxwell's method the value of L for the
armature of a Series dynamo when the field-magnet coils are
used independently to excite magnetism in the armature.
Experiments were made in February 1887, at Prof. Ayrton’s
 suggestion, to determine the coefficient of self-induction of the
armature of a Gramme dynamo of the A pattern. The
numbers obtained by Mr. S. Watney and the writer were as
 follow :—

    9. When, however,it is desired to determine the self-induction
 of the field-magnet coils of a dynamo when a strong current
 is flowing through them, several difficulties present themselves.
 If strong currents are to be maintained the resistances must
 be small, unless a large amount of power is to be wasted and
 unless very high electromotive forces are procurable. On the
 other hand, the self-induction to be measured is very large.
 The time-constant, which determines the rate at which the
 magnetism will change, will therefore be large; and unless a

462            Mr. W. E. Sumpner on the Variation
sufficiently ballistic galvanometer is to be had, it is not easy
to obtain L in absolute measure.
   At the suggestion of Prof. Ayrton some experiments were
made at the commencement of 1887 to determine the variation
of the self-induction of the field-magnet coils of a Ferranti
dynamo. The method” used was the modification of Maxwell’s
method already alluded to. (The coefficient has been since
compared with the capacity of a standard condenser by the
swing method; the value obtained for a current of 0.01
ampere was 0.61 secohm, and for larger currents larger
values were obtained.) When a strong current was flowing
 through the coils the resistance of the circuit was only a few
 ohms, and the coefficient was probably larger than 0-6. The
 time-constant was therefore generally larger than one tenth
 of a second, and the discharge could never be considered
 completed in less than a second. Probably no galvanometer
would have been sufficiently ballistic under these circumstances
to give good results in absolute measure. As, however, the
 only galvanometer conveniently situated with reference to the
 dynamos was one of the D'Arsonval type, with a short period
and large logarithmic decrement even when on open circuit,
 the hope of any but comparative measurements was abandoned.
    10. It is possible to calibrate any galvanometer for ballistic
purposes by charging a condenser to a standard potential and
 discharging it through a resistance in series with the galvano
 meter to be calibrated.      By suitably altering the resistance or
 the capacity the time-constant of discharge may be made to
 have any value. This was done with the D’Arsonval galva
 nometer, in order to interpret the results obtained. A con
 denser of 18.6 microfarads capacity was charged by a Latimer
 Clark’s cell, and then discharged through the galvanometer
 (whose resistance was 700 ohms) in series with a variable
 resistance, R ohms. The time-constant of discharge was
therefore           18.6(R+700)10-" seconds,
and the ratio of this to 1-66 was the ratio of the time-constant
to the period of the galvanometer, and is denoted in the
following table by the letter p., Observations were made
of the value of the first swing of the galvanometer-needle for
many different values of R. A few of these are given below.
  * This method, due to Prof. Ayrton, will be found more fully
described, together with several other methods, in a paper by the
present writer on “The Measurement of Self-Induction, Mutual In
duction, and Capacity,” Journ. Soc. Tel. Engineers, May 1887.

   Thus, for the particular galvanometer tested, the throw
produced by a given discharge when the time-constant is one
tenth of the period is only about 80 per cent. of that produced
by the instantaneous discharge of the same quantity; and
when the time-constant is equal to the period, the throw is
only about 20 per cent. of the corresponding throw for
instantaneous discharge. Experiments since made with a
high-resistance Thomson astatic galvanometer, with a period
of 10 seconds, have yielded practically the same results. In
the actual experiments on the Ferranti field-magnet coils, it
would have been possible to interpret the meaning of the
  alvanometer-swings if the time-constant of discharge had
£ any fixed value, or if this value had been known ; but
the resistances and self-induction were continually varying,
and the self-induction was always unknown. It would pro
bably have been impossible even to compare the results with
each other had it not been for the fact that, as the currents
increased, the resistance and self-induction of the circuit
diminished simultaneously, so that the time-constant of dis
charge tended to remain fixed in value.
   11. The experiments on the dynamo coils were carried out
by Messrs. Rossiter and Watney together with the writer.
   The electromotive force used was obtained from accu
mulators, and amounted to about 100 volts. The bridge
was kept balanced for steady currents. The only resistance
altered was that in the battery-circuit. The currents were
changed by switching resistances into or out of the battery
circuit. If Q is the quantity of electricity discharged through

repeated many times, both for positive and for negative
currents; and the numbers given in the following table are a

   The numbers obtained, although not altogether satisfactory,
leave no doubt about the way in which the coefficients change.
For increasing currents Li at first increases and then dimi
nishes, while for decreasing currents La begins at a lower
value than the corresponding value of Li and continually
increases as the current is decreased. This is exactly what is
to be expected when it is remembered that the value of L is
represented by the slope of the curve of magnetization. If
the curve connecting 8 with $ be like that indicated in fig. 1,
the curve connecting d8/d5 or L with $5 will be such that
for increasing values of £5 the ordinates L will at first increase .
and then diminish, while for decreasing values of £5 the
ordinates will continually increase. It is noteworthy that a
discontinuity will occur at the cusp K, and the value of L

                  of the Coefficients of Induction.           465
will suddenly diminish as the change of current alters from an
increase to a decrease, or vice versá.
   The general shape of the curve connecting L with $5 will
be the same whether the value of £5 has been diminished to
zero from positive or from negative values before the experi
ments are made. This follows from the fact that the slope at
a point on a Ewing's cycle increases from each cusp to the
point of inflexion. The coefficient L will be a maximum for
those values of the magnetizing current C at which the points
 of inflexion occur. As the cycle only has one point of in
flexion on each branch, the two parts of the curve connecting
L with C will each have one maximum point, and one only.
The two maximum values of L will not, however, occur at the
same value of the current. They will occur at a small positive
value of C for currents changing in the positive direction, and
at a small negative value of C for currents changing in the
negative direction. From this it follows that for increasing
currents, L will at first increase and then diminish; while for
currents decreasing to zero, L will continually increase. This
statement must be modified for small cycles, which do not
  enerally have points of inflexion. Here the coefficient will
increase continually from one cusp to the other, and decrease
discontinuously on rounding each cusp.
   Experiments were also made on the field-magnets of a
Gramme dynamo, the currents used varying in this case up to
30 amperes. The same kind of results were obtained.
   12. Several remarkable effects were obtained, due to pre
vious history of magnetization, which are easily explicable
on reference to the researches of Professor Ewing".
   Suppose the current has been altered until a point P (see
fig. 1) on the curve of magnetization is reached. The effect
# a small change of current will now depend upon whether
the current be increased or diminished.         If the current be
changed in the same way as it was altered last, a point A on
the curve of magnetization will be reached; while if it be
changed in the opposite direction, a point B will be reached.
The slope of the line PA will be quite different from that of
PB, and as these slopes represent the values of the coefficient
of self-induction at the point P, it follows that this coefficient
has always two distinct values whatever the state of mag
netization and however that state has been attained.          The
curves obtained by Professor Ewing imply that the coefficient
is greater for a change of current in the same direction as the
last than for one in the opposite direction; for if P be any

respond with changes of current in the same direction as
those immediately preceding, and these slopes are steeper
than those of PB and P'B', which correspond with reverse
changes of the magnetizing force.
   If the current be changed between the two values cor
responding with the points P and A, and the swings of the
ballistic galvanometer observed for each alternation, the first
fling will correspond with the slope PA, if the magnetization
has been increased up to the point P. All the succeeding
swings will, however, correspond with more gradual slopes,
AC, because the magnetization owing to hysteresis will not
return to the state P, but will proceed around a Ewing's
cycle between the two points A and C, if the current be
£ between the two values considered.                In the case of a
transformer, two or three successively diminishing swings were
often observed before the changes became cyclic. Whether on
the ascending or descending portions of the magnetization
curve, the first fling should be greater than the succeeding
ones if it corresponds with a change of current of the same
kind as that immediately preceding.
   The following experiments on the Ferranti field-magnets
illustrate these remarks:—

   The swings succeeding the first are seen to be all very
nearly equal. The negative swings are slightly greater than
the positive ones, because the current flowing is smaller, the
resistances in circuit larger, and the time-constant of discharge
smaller. Although the amount discharged is the same for

                  of the Coefficients of Induction.            467
the two cases, the swing which measures it will be greater in
that case for which the time-constant is the smaller.
   13. Evidence of hysteresis was obtained in a very marked
way from a 2 H.P. transformer lent to Professor Ayrton by
Mr. Kapp. The coefficient of self-induction of the primary
coil was measured when different currents were traversing
the secondary. The magnetizing current (denoted by A)
was obtained from accumulators, and varied up to 10 amperes.
It was sent in both directions, and its value was read by an
Ayrton and Perry ammeter. The coefficient was obtained
either by comparison with a standard condenser by the
swing-method already described or by the secohmmeter.
The test-current used to obtain the coefficient was            037
ampere for the swing method and 01 ampere for the sec
ohmmeter method. In the former case means were provided
for sending the test-current round the primary in either
direction at will, so that the swings obtained corresponded
either with the slope PA (see fig. 1) or with the slope PB. If
 the total current through the transformer-coils were alternated
 between two values corresponding with the points A and C,
 the slope AC was found not only to be less than the preceding
 slope PA but greater than the succeeding slopes      £     and in
 some cases several successively diminishing values were
 obtained. The coefficients corresponding with the slopes
 PA, AC, and CD will be respectively denoted by the letters
 L., L., and L. The values obtained could only be reproduced
 when the magnetic history of the iron was exactly repeated;
 and whatever the process of magnetization was, the numbers
 obtained at corresponding parts of successive cycles gradually
 diminished until the true cyclic values were      '.
    Thus the values obtained by the swing-method for the pro
 gressive coefficient, L, were 087 secohm or 192 secohm,
 according as the value of A had been diminished to zero from
 1 ampere or from 6 amperes. When A was 1 ampere, values
 of L, could be obtained varying between 074 and 130 secohm,
 according to the previous history, and simultaneously the
 values of the return coefficient L. could be varied between
 -032 and '053 secohm. The values of the cyclic coefficient
 L., (which were obtained by reversing the test-current several
 times before taking the swing) were, however, fairly constant,
 and were 029 secohm when A was zero and 016 secohm
 when A was 6 amperes.
    In order to obtain a complete set of values for the coefficients
  I, and Le, it was necessary that the iron should go through
  the same magnetizing processes before any reading was taken.
  The magnetizing current was therefore diminished to -10

468           Mr. W. E. Sumpner on the Variation
amperes before each observation, and then increased to the
particular value of A at which the value of L was observed.

swing method:—

   The values obtained with diminishing currents (i.e. for the
curve PA) were slightly lower. They were arrived at by
increasing the current to +10 amperes and then diminish
ing it to the value of A, at which Lp was required.
   The values of Le were much easier to obtain than those of
Lp, for the slightest variation in the main magnetizing
current A was sufficient to render it impossible to obtain
Lp until the previous magnetizing processes were gone
through again. Accumulators were used to provide a con
stant E.M.F.; but it was nevertheless found difficult to keep
A sufficiently constant, so that the test-swings for L, were
taken as quickly as possible to prevent values intermediate
between Lp and Le being obtained. These considerations
partially account for the unsatisfactory nature of the results
obtained with the Ferranti field-magnets; for, at the time
those experiments were made, the necessity of keeping the
current quite steady until the swing measuring L was ob
served was not realized. The numbers given do not show the
slight initial increase in the value of Lp for small increasing
currents, but more recent experiments have done so.
   The values of L. were also determined by means of the
secohmmeter of Professors Ayrton and Perry. This instru
ment necessarily only measures coefficients for cycles of
magnetism. The value of A was varied from zero to 10 am
peres positive, thence to 10 amperes negative, and thence to
zero again.    The value of each coefficient was determined for
three  £ speeds, and the mean taken.             The value of the
coefficient appeared to diminish slightly as the speed increased.
 (This effect has been observed in several cases when the mag
 netic circuit is wholly or partially composed of iron, and is
probably due to magnetic lag.) The coefficients L. obtained
for a complete cycle of current values are given in the four

                   of the Coefficients of Induction.             469

   The values obtained are slightly lower than those obtained
by the swing-method. This is accounted for by the fact that
the amplitude of the cycle is less. With the secohmmeter the
test-current was only .01 ampere, while it was 037 ampere
with the former method. The value of L. will be smaller, the
smaller the amplitude of the cycle. The secohmmeter is so
sensitive that it would have been easy by means of it to
measure L. for cycles of very small amplitude.

    14. It is a matter of both theoretical and practical interest
 to determine the way in which currents change when the
 impressed electromotive forces are given at every instant
 of time and when the coefficients of self-induction are given
 in terms of the currents which are flowing. In calculations
 concerned with alternating-current problems it is usual to
 assume that the impressed electromotive forces are pure sine
 functions of the time, and that the coefficients of induction
 are constant quantities. These assumptions are more con
 venient than true.      The coefficient of self-induction can be
 at once deduced from the curve of magnetization, and there
 fore can no more be expressed as a mathematical function of
 the current than electromagnetism itself. It therefore appears
 as if, in the treatment of such problems, graphical methods are
 to be preferred to analytical ones. If, in a simple circuit, the
 curve connecting the impressed electromotive force with time
 be given, together with the curve connecting magnetization
 with current, it is perfectly easy by purely graphical processes
 to obtain the curve connecting current with time.            For we
 have
                                     dN
                             RC +     # = E,

470            Mr. W. E. Sumpner on the Variation
where E is the impressed electromotive force, N is the number
of lines of force enclosed by the circuit, R is the resistance of
the circuit, C the current flowing, and t the time at which
the different quantities are evaluated.
   Now, if we can neglect Foucault currents, or possible mag
netic lag, or anything analogous which would make N directly
dependent on time, we may put
                           dN_ dN dC
                           di " dC dt’
where    # is the coefficient of self-induction, L.     If we put
                               E          L
                        Co = R’     T = R’
we obtain                  dC_ Co-C
                            I. --T--
Now C, is the value of the current which would be flowing if
there were no self-induction; and since E and R are given,
it is possible to plot a curve having Co for ordinates and time
for abscissae. Moreover, since the curve connecting N with C
is given, it is possible by graphical processes to find another
connectin £N or T with C.             This curve (see Plate III.
           8 R GO
fig. 3) should be plotted, with the values of C for ordinates
and the values of T as abscissae.     It will be found convenient
to plot T in the negative direction. The time-ratio T will
be in seconds if L is in secohms and R in ohms.            The two
curves should of course be plotted to the same scale for
current and time.
   The construction follows immediately from the equation
                           dC_ Co-C
                           dt -     T_*
 and is as follows:
     Suppose P1 (see Pl. III, fig. 3.) be the given initial point on
 the curve connecting C with time. Project it parallel to the
 axes to T1 on the curve T and to Q1 on the curve Co. Project
 Q1 parallel to the axis of abscissae to R1 on the current axis.
 Draw from P1 a line parallel to R1T, and choose a point P,
 on it not far from P1. P2 may be regarded as the next point
 on the current curve, and the process (which is indicated in
 Plate III.) may be repeated to obtain a third point Ps, and so
 on, until the whole curve connecting current with time is
 obtained.

   15. The curves are very readily drawn on squared paper, and
yield some remarkable results. If the impressed electromotive
force E and the resistance R are constant quantities, the
curve Co will be a straight line parallel to the axis of time
cutting the current axis in a point R. The inclination of the
line joining R to any point T on the curve T will represent
the rate at which the current is increasing when it has the
value corresponding with the point T. Now, if the self
induction is constant or nearly constant, this rate of increase
will be great at first but will continually diminish as time
goes on. If, however, the self-induction be very variable, the
result may be quite different and dependent to a great extent
on the value of Co. Suppose the self-induction to increase at
first, and then to diminish. Unless Co be very small, there
will now be points of inflexion on the current curve. The
current will increase very rapidly at first, slower afterwards,
then more rapidly, and will finally attain its maximum slowly.
If Cobe such as to magnetize the iron far beyond saturation, this
effect may be very marked, and the time taken for the current
to rise to a small fraction of its final amount may exceed that
taken to rise through the remainder. The writer is indebted
to Prof. Silvanus Thompson for the information that this fact
has actually been observed when accumulators have been con
nected in series with the field-magnets of a dynamo and with
an Ayrton and Perry dead-beat ammeter. The needle has
been noticed to move very slowly at first, and then with great
rapidity  '        the larger portion of the ultimate deflection.
The greater the value of C, the quicker will the current
attain a given fraction of its final value. This may be roughly
accounted for by the fact that the mean value of the coefficient
is less the greater the value of the final current.
   16. When the electromotive force E is alternating, the coeffi
cient L will not only be variable but two-valued. It will
depend not only on the value of the current, but also on
whether the current is increasing or diminishing. The curve T
will therefore consist of two parts—one for increasing current,
and the other for decreasing current. Although E and Co
may be pure sine functions, C will not be a simple sine
function if the coefficient L varies. Suppose a current curve
C’, drawn on the assumption that there is a constant coefficient
of self-induction equal to the mean of the different values.
The true curve C will, roughly speaking, differ from the
curve C' in rising more rapidly when L is less than the
average, and in rising less rapidly when L is more than the
average. The general effect of the variation of the coefficient
will therefore be to introduce   #ple into the      current curve.

472            Mr. W. E. Sumpner on the Variation
It is noteworthy that these ripples are dependent not so much
on the speed as on the value of the current.
    17. Plate III. fig. 4 shows an example worked out on the
basis of experiments actually made on the Kapp and Snell
transformer already referred to. The resistance of the circuit
is for simplicity assumed to be 1 ohm, so that the number
which represents the coefficient of self-induction L, in
secohms also represents the time-ratio in seconds. The
values of Lp given above were obtained for the primary
 coil when different currents A were traversing the secondary,
and should be plotted, not with the values of A, but with the
values of n2A/ni, where ni/ng is the ratio of the turns on the
 primary to those on the secondary. This has not been done,
 as it merely alters the scale of current. The values of L,
 differ slightly for increasing and decreasing currents; this
has been disregarded, as in the particular case taken the results
 would have been but very little altered. The electromotive
 force acting in the primary circuit (the secondary being open)
is   supposed to be a simple sine wave having a period of
 0.16 second, and is represented by the curve Co. The current
 curve obtained will depend for the first few alternations on
the initial circumstances. The curves C1, C2, C3, and C,
 represent the first half-wave for different initial values of the
current. Of these, C3 may be taken as the curve which
periodically repeats itself and to which all the others will
 eventually come. . It is not in appearance, so markedly
different from a sine curve as C1 and C2.           This is because
the impressed electromotive force is not sufficient to produce
a current capable of magnetizing the iron beyond the satura
tion-point, at which the value of the coefficient of self-induction
begins to diminish. Otherwise the current curve would have
sharp peaks in it, as indicated in the curve C. This may have
 something to do with the fact that it has been found best not
to allow the iron of transformers to be magnetized beyond the
saturation-point".
    18. It is usual to assume that the electromotive force given
by alternating-current dynamos can be represented by a sine
 function of the time with sufficient accuracy for practical
  urposes. In the case of a Ferranti dynamo at the Central
  nstitution, however, the approximation to a sine wave is not
very good.
    The field-magnets were excited with a small current by
 means of accumulators.           A resistance of 100 ohms was
 placed in the circuit to reduce the time-constant when the

                 of the Coefficients of Induction.           473
current was made. The armature was used as a test-coil, and
was coupled in series with a D’Arsonval galvanometer and
suitable resistances. A pointer was attached to the spindle,
and a scale to the framework of the machine, so that the
phase of the armature could be accurately read. The test
swings were taken both on making and on breaking the exciting
current, and were found practically identical. The swings
were taken for many different phases of the armature for one
complete alternation.    The results showed that the ordinates
of the curve of electromotive force gradually differed from
those of the most favourably drawn sine curve to the extent
of +5 per cent.
   The values of the maximum ordinates of the E.M.F. curve
were also compared for one complete revolution of the
armature. Five swings were taken in the neighbourhood of
each maximum in order to determine its amount.               The
curious result came out that these maxima varied alternately
between values denoted by the numbers 302 and 333. The
eight positive maxima did not vary more than 3 per cent.
from the value 333, nor did the eight negative maxima vary
more than this from the value 302.         Since the area of the
negative part of the curve must apparently be equal to that
of the positive part, it follows that the curve of E.M.F. must
be distinctly different from a sine curve. The result found in
this case was not at all that which was looked for.    It seemed
probable that the values of the different maxima would vary
£           and only repeat themselves after a complete revo
 ution of the machine. It was expected that the curve of
E.M.F. would be of the nature of a compound sine curve,
having as one term a sine of large amplitude and a period
corresponding with the current alternations, and having as a
second term a sine of small amplitude but long period corre
sponding with the revolutions of the machine. Professor
Perry has pointed out that, if the wave of E.M.F. is a sine
curve marked with minor ripples caused by the presence
of subsidiary sine waves of smaller period, the effect of
induction in the circuit is to flatten out the minor ripples so
that the current produced is more nearly a true sine wave
than the electromotive-force wave which is producing it.
This is, however, only true on the assumption that the minor
ripples have the shorter period. It is very possible that in
some alternating-current dynamos there is, due to some want
of symmetry, a ripple of small amplitude but having a long
  eriod corresponding with the revolutions of the dynamo.
   henever this occurs, the action of induction is to magnify
the minor ripples in comparison with the main alternating

474          Mr. W. E. Sumpner on the Variation
wave, and the consequent current curve will, especially at
high speeds, differ in a very marked degree from ' E.M.F.
curve of the machine.        If the self-induction is a variable
quantity, the current curves obtained will be still more
rippled, and these ripples will be present at whatever speed
the dynamo is revolved.
   The well-known pulsations to which electric lights fed with
alternating currents are subject seem to suggest that the
currents obtained from the dynamos used are much less like
sine waves than is generally assumed to be the case. These
pulsations are so marked in the case of one important London
installation that any quickly moving object, such as a walking
stick swayed rapidly to and fro presents, not a blurred image,
as it would do under a continuous light, but several distinctly
separate images, as if the light were at times very dim. The
pulsations are too slow to be due to the ordinary alternations
of the current, but might possibly be in time with the revo
lutions of the dynamo.
                      Condenser Discharges.
   19. It does not appear to have been noticed that self-induc
tion, although always delaying the rise or fall of currents, may
sometimes hasten the discharge of a condenser. The current
which discharges a condenser has both to rise and fall. Self
induction in the discharge-circuit delays the rise of current
less than the fall, because the potential-difference of the con
denser is high when the current increases and low when it
diminishes; the rate of change of current depends, not onl
on the coefficient of self-induction, but also on the E.M.F.
tending to cause the change. The well-known oscillations
produced when the self-induction is large are simply due
to the fact that the current is kept flowing too long. The
general result is that the time of discharge is lessened if the
self-induction is not too great.
   If a condenser of capacity K, charged to a potential Wo, be
discharged by a wire    £ a resistance R and coefficient of
self-induction L, the potential of the condenser at any time t

   The time taken to discharge is proportional to T, or to

values are less than KR, provided L4+ KR*; so that the
insertion of self-induction up to this value only hastens the
discharge. The time will be a minimum when L=}KR*,

the time of discharge of a condenser by using a suitable
amount of self-induction in the discharge-circuit.
   A lightning discharge is essentially the same as that of a
condenser, and it therefore seems likely that a small amount
of self-induction in a lightning-conductor will only improve it.
The value of K may be small, but that of R is large, since it
quite possibly includes the resistance of the air-gap between
the lightning-conductor and the charged cloud; so that the
product KR', which determines the allowable value of L,
may be quite comparable with the self-induction of iron
lightning-rods, and may indeed far exceed it.
   Quite recently Dr. Oliver Lodge has shown experimentally
that an iron conductor is better than a copper one for high
tension electric discharges, and has suggested that, owing to
magnetic lag, iron may have less self-induction for such dis
charges, than in cases where time is an unimportant factor.
The foregoing considerations offer quite a different explana
tion. Further experiments will no doubt be necessary to
settle the question; but in the meanwhile there seems to be
no real basis for the idea that self-induction in a lightning
conductor is necessarily a disadvantage.
   The writer, in conclusion, desires to thank Professor Ayrton
for many valuable suggestions received while the experiments
were being carried out.

LVIII. The Efficiency of Incandescent Lamps with Direct and
   Alternating Currents.      By W. E. AYRTON and JoHN
   PERRY*.                 -
IT is    now well understood that in order to economically
      distribute power by means of electricity it is necessary
to employ a high potential-difference, or P.D., between the
mains and a small current flowing through them, while con
siderations of safety require that the P.D. between the leads
in the houses shall not exceed 100 or 200 volts.      Hence some
system of converting a large P.D. and small current into a
small P.D. and large current has to be employed; and the
four systems of conversion that have hitherto been devised
consist in the employment of:—1. Motor-Dynamos, 2. Accu
mulators, 3. Alternating Current-Transformers, 4. Direct
Current-Transformers.
   Of these four methods the third is the one that is most
extensively utilized at the present time; indeed it is the only
system of conversion that is at all extensively used, at any rate
in this country. But in view of some direct current system
of conversion also coming into common use, there arises a
question of considerable importance to the consumer, viz. Is
more light obtained with the same expenditure of power with
direct or with alternating currents? And apart from con
siderations of the electric distribution of power on a large
scale, the answer to this question is of importance in supply
ing one factor towards the decision as to the relative ad
vantages and disadvantages of direct and alternating currents
for detached installations.
   Where the electric energy supplied to a consumer has been
charged by meter, people have, as a rule, been content to
measure only the number of coulombs supplied, ignoring
altogether any variation in the volts; but as electricity per se
apart from the P.D. is of no commercial value whatever, and
therefore is unlike water apart from pressure, it is clear that
in estimating the value of a supply of electric energy for
lighting purposes we must measure the watts and not
merely the current. The problem, therefore, that we have
attempted to solve is whether a Board of Trade unit (1000
 watt-hours) is more valuable for lighting by incandescent
 lamps when the current is direct or when the current is
 alternating.
    For a complete solution of this problem we must ascertain
 not merely the “efficiency of the lamp” or the candles per
    * Communicated by the Physical Society: read February 25, 1888.

              Efficiency of Incandescent Lamps.              477
watt with the two systems of supply, but also the life of the
lamp, since the cost of lamp renewals may be as important a
'          for the consumer as the bill for electric power.
   nfortunately, however, there does not exist, as far as we
are aware, any accurate information as to the life of an in
candescent lamp with various alternating P.Ds.; indeed the
data at our disposal for the life of a lamp with various non
alternating P.Ds. is at most meagre. And if any Member of
the Society can supply us with information regarding the
life of some fixed type of incandescent lamp either with
different direct P.Ds. or with different alternating P.Ds. we
shall be grateful for the information, as it will furnish us
with a further opportunity of using the method described in
our paper read before this Society for deciding “On the
 Most Economical Potential Difference to Employ with In
candescent Lamps.””
    For the present, therefore, we shall confine ourselves solely
 to the question of efficiency, and as it is known that the
 efficiency of an incandescent lamp increases with the current
 passing through the lamp, it is clear that to obtain an accu
 rate comparison of the efficiencies with direct and alternating
 currents, we must employ exactly the same current in both
 cases, or rather the same mean square of the current, for this
 will be most likely to develop the same rate of production of
 heat in the lamp, since this rate is proportional to the re
 sistance into the mean square of the current, whether the
 current be direct or alternating, and whether or not there be
 self-induction in the circuit in which the heat is developed.
 We say will be most likely to develop the same rate of pro
 duction of heat, since we must not assume without proof that
 for the same mean square of current the resistance of a
 carbon filament is the same whether the current be direct or
 alternating.
    Some writers have stated that the current, as measured by
 an electrodynamometer, required to be sent through an in
 candescent lamp when emitting a definite amount of light,
 had a different value when the current was an alternating one
 from what it had when the current was direct.          This dif
 ference might be due either to a defect in the dynamometer
 measurement or to some variation in the light standard. If
 the wire with which a dynamometer is wound be thick, then
 the current-density may be far from uniform when the current
 is alternating; and on this account, as observed by Captain
 Cardew some years ago, a dynamometer might give different
 readings for different rates of alternations of the current,
                       * Phil. Mag. April 1885.

 478        Profs, Ayrton and Perry on Incandescent
 while an incandescent lamp in circuit with it remained equally
 bright. To avoid this possible cause of error the dynamometer,
 which was constructed by Messrs. Shepherd, Vignoles, and
 Wheatley, the three of the students of the Central Institution
 who carried out the investigation, was wound with much finer
 wire than would usually be employed in the construction of a
dynamometer not required to read currents much below one
ampere. The dynamometer was for that reason unnecessarily
sensitive, and it required a fairly strong spring to control
the motion of the suspended coil. This led to an unnecessary
waste of energy in the dynamometer, but that was of no con
 sequence in this investigation, as our object was to measure
 the mean square of the current most accurately, and not to
 satisfy the condition, which is of considerable importance in
 the design of commercial measuring-instruments, of wasting
 as little energy as possible in the instruments.
    To the  £          coil of the dynamometer was attached a
mirror, and the values of the deflections of the spot of light
were determined by direct comparison with the simultaneous
readings of an accurately calibrated magnifying spring
ammeter when various direct currents were successively sent
through the circuit. The sensibility was such that a deflec
tion of 400 scale-divisions was produced on a scale 68-88
inches away, for a current of 2.53 amperes, which corresponds
with a deflection of 140 scale-divisions for 1.5 ampere,
                                              Q
and this was about the usual current passing through the
dynamometer in the actual lamp experiments. The value

          Lamps with Direct and Alternating Currents.      479
of the current could, therefore, be accurately measured by
this dynamometer, which is indicated by D in the figure, and
by knowing what fraction of the current passing through the
£                D passed through the non-inductive voltmeter
   , the current passing through the lamp is known.
    Any error that might have arisen from a variation of the
light-standard was eliminated by taking successive readings
with a direct current produced by a Gramme-dynamo G, and
with an alternating current produced by a Ferranti dynamo F,
the switches S and s being turned to 1, 1 in the first case and
to 2, 2 in the second. The Gramme-dynamo G was also used
to excite the field magnets of the Ferranti, a suitable current
being obtained by a proper adjustment of the resistance p.
By means of the resistances q and t the direct and alternating
currents passing through the incandescent lamp L could be
respectively varied; and it was found that if these resistances
were so adjusted that the reading of the dynamometer D was
the same in both cases, so also was the reading of the non
inductive voltmeter W.
    It is known when power is supplied by means of an
alternating current to a circuit of resistance r ohms and co
 efficient of self-induction l secohms that
               number of true watts _          :=,
            number of measured watts       Vl"T"+*T3
 where the measured watts are obtained by multiplying VAP,
 the square root of the mean square of the amperes as measured
 by the dynamometer, by VWP, the square root of the mean
 square of the volts as measured by the non-inductive volt
 meter, and where t is the time between one alternation and
 the next, or half a complete period. Therefore the
                number of true watts =
                                          rt VA*W*
                                         Ml"T* + Kr’
 where in our case r and l are the resistance and coefficient of
 self-induction of the carbon filament of the lamp. In the first
 set of experiments a lamp with a looped filament was em
 ployed; but the experiments seemed to indicate that the value
 of l was not quite small enough to make the term "r"
 absolutely negligible, or else that there was some slight
 mutual induction between the dynamometer-coils and a small
 brass vessel containing oil, in which moved a damping vane
 attached to the moving coil. The results were therefore
 discarded, and this vessel was replaced by one made of non
  conducting material, and all metal near the dynamometer

480            Profs. Ayrton and Perry on Incandescent
was as far as possible removed. The lamps subsequently em
ployed were first one with a         £           filament, and another
£ a simple horseshoe-shaped filament, each possessing
little self-induction.
    The light was measured by comparison with a standard
candle, the two being placed 130 centimetres apart on the
photometer P, and a screen composed of two pieces of paraffin
wax W, with silvered paper between them, was adjusted
until the two pieces of wax appeared equally bright, the
comparison being first made when the screen was looked
at through ruby-red glass and then through signal-green
glass.
    The following is a sample of the results obtained, a and b
being the distances respectively of the screen from the incan
descent lamp and from the standard candle.

    It will be observed that in the set of four successive observa
tions given in Table I. for green light, the candle-power of the
lamp appears to be steadily increasing, a result probably due to
the brightness of the candle slowly diminishing; but although
this would make the absolute determination of the efficiency of
the incandescent lamp inexact, it introduces no error in the
determination of the relative efficiencies of the lamp with
direct and alternating currents, since every observation with

                   Lamps with Direct and Alternating Currents.                             481
      the direct current was immediately followed by one with
      alternating current, so that the means of all the corresponding
      direct-current measurements may be safely compared with the
      means of all the alternating-current measurements. Similarly
      for this investigation it is unimportant whether the standard
      candle used on one day was slightly more or less bright than
      the standard candle used on the following day.                                £
      since for any two successive observations with the same
      coloured light with direct and with alternating current the
      screen was at practically the same distance from the lamp, the
      fact that the rays of light coming from the lamp made a
      somewhat different angle with the surface of the paraffin-wax
      from the angle made by the rays coming from the candle,
      introduced no error in this investigation of comparative
       efficiencies, although it might very likely do so in an absolute
      determination of the efficiency of an incandescent lamp. In
      fact the simple device of successively taking observations with
       direct and with alternating currents throughout the whole
      investigation removed most of the objections that usually
       may be made against photometric determinations carried out
       with a candle as the standard of light.
          Disregarding the experiments made with the lamp with the
       looped filament, for the reason given above, Table II, gives the

 482      Mr. Rimington on the Measurement of the Power
 drawn from them is that although the watts per candle for
 green light are not quite the same for direct and for alter
 nating currents, and although the volts per candle for red
 light are also not exactly the same for direct and alternating,
 still the difference between the results for the same colour is
 so small that it may be put down to experimental errors; and
 this, combined with the £ that the mean of all the 75 experi
 ments gives practically the same number of watts per candle
 for both direct and alternating currents, leads to the practical
 certainty that the efficiency of an incandescent lamp is the same
for both direct and alternating currents.

       at the Society of Telegraph Engineers, Professor Ayrton
 gave a formula for calculating the true power supplied to the

   In order to be able to make use of this result it is necessary
to know the coefficients of self-induction of P+A and B; the
latter may be found once for all by any of the well-known
methods and its value marked on the instrument; but the
former will require to be determined for the same values of
the currents in the primary and secondary coils of the trans
former as are flowing when the power is measured, since the
apparent coefficient of self-induction of the primary coil de
pends on the saturation of the iron of the transformer and
also on the current in the secondary coil. The best method
of measuring Li under these conditions is that due to Joubert.
   Connect an inductionless resistance R in series with the

    This method of calculating the mean power supplied to the
 primary of a transformer is, however, inconvenient, as it
 entails the use of a high-resistance dynamometer, with which
 two observations must be taken to obtain L1, in addition to
 the trouble of adjusting the resistances of the two circuits to
 obtain the same conditions as when the wattmeter-reading
 was taken.
    The following method, in which a high-resistance electro
dynamometer is employed, enables the power given to the
£          coil to be measured from one reading without the
  tnowledge of either the resistance or the coefficient of self
induction of the primary.

let the time-constants of the two coils be the same; this can
be easily effected by putting an inductionless resistance in
series with one or other of the coils.       Connect as in the
diagram.
   Let the primary coil be put in series with an inductionless
resistance R. Let the potential-difference between V, and V,

        LX. On the Polarization of Platinum Plates.
               By C. H. DRAPER, B.A., D.Sc."
TH:      fact of the decomposition of dilute sulphuric acid by
       the passage between platinum electrodes of electricity
through a voltameter containing it, involves an expenditure
of energy. This energy is made available by a sudden fall
of the current through a certain difference of potential nume
rically equal to the energy absorbed by the quantity of water
which one unit of    £         decomposes. The cause of this
sudden fall of potential within the voltameter over and above
that due to the resistance of the liquid as a conductor is the
modified condition assumed by the platinum plates, which
leads to the phenomenon called polarization. Those portions
of the gaseous products which come first into contact with
the platinum, especially in the case of hydrogen, either form
with the platinum a chemical combination, or undergo such
physical or chemical modification by occlusion or condensation
as results in a loss of energy and resulting fall of potential.
This modification of condition progressively diminishes in
the successive layers as we proceed outwards from the pla
tinum plate, until a layer is reached which is beyond the
reach of the influence of the platinum, and where the gas
escapes freely as fast as it is formed. The result of this
polarized condition of the electrodes is manifested as an
electromotive force opposed to that which produces the cur
rent. The electromotive force of polarization has for each
electrolyte a theoretically fixed maximum value, and expe
rimentally there appears to be an approximately constant
maximum value which is always above the theoretical value
when any considerable current is passing, and which varies
with the conditions of the experiment. Thus Professor Tait,
in some experiments described in the ‘Philosophical Maga
zine’ for September 1869, found (taking the electromotive

    The objects with which the experiments described below
 were undertaken were to ascertain whether the electromotive
 force of polarization has a sensibly constant value beyond a
 certain maximum limit, and what is the effect upon it
 of change of temperature. The method of experimenting
 was to pass currents of various known strengths through a
 voltameter filled with dilute sulphuric acid, and to note
 the difference of potential between the electrodes by means
 of a quadrant-electrometer. Since Ohm’s law is true for
 electrolytes, at least within the limits of probable error
 in experiments of this kind, there will be a difference of
 potential between the electrodes just as between the two
 ends of a wire.       If R be the resistance of the column of
 liquid, and C a value of the current which is not less than
 that value corresponding to e the maximum value of the
 electromotive force of polarization, and if E be the dif
ference of potential observed between the electrodes, then
E=e+CR. Any increase in the value of C will now be
the accompaniment of an increase in the value of E. If,
 then, the observed values of E and C be marked out along
axes at right angles to each other,

the axis of potential (Oy), and the
resistance of the voltameter being
indicated by the tangent of the
#       which the straight line makes el

If, then, the temperature at which
the process takes place has an effect                       *
on the amount of the maximum po- 9
larization, this will be manifested by
a change in the value of the intercept, while the change in
the slope of the line will indicate the change in the resistance
of the voltameter.
   Apparatus.—The circuit consisted of a battery, B, and a
voltameter, V, connected through a commutating-key, K,
with a tangent-galvanometer, G, the electrodes of the volta
meter being connected also with the terminals of a quadrant
electrometer, E. The voltameter was placed inside a large

                Polarization of Platinum Plates.              489
water-bath, and a thermometer, t, was suspended dipping
into the liquid of the voltameter. A battery of Grove cells
 was used, the number of cells varying from 1 to 10. The
voltameter was a glass tube of an inch in diameter, and six
inches high. The electrodes were strips of platinum about
1% inch long and nearly $ inch wide, connected by pieces of
platinum wire which passed through the glass to binding

vessel, and heated by a Bunsen burner.
   The electrolytic liquid consisted of a 10-per-cent. solution
of pure sulphuric ' (sp. gr. 1:842) in distilled water. The
voltameter was emptied and refilled at the commencement of
each day’s experiments, so that the solution never varied much
in strength. The thermometer employed was one whose
error had been previously found to be negligibly small; and
it being necessary that the temperature of the     £       in the
voltameter should be accurately known, it was suspended
with its bulb dipping into the liquid. Some experiments
were made to see whether error was likely to be introduced
by this; and it was found that when the stem of the thermo
meter was actually between the electrodes, it had a small but
appreciable effect on the resistance of the column of liquid,
but when the bottom of the bulb was above the top of the
plates there was no measurable effect. It was concluded
that the thermometer might be placed with its bulb dipping
into the liquid but above the platinum plates, and that any
small alteration in its position from day to day would not
introduce sensible error. The voltameter was always filled
quite full, so that the introduction of the thermometer did
not alter the resistance by raising the level of the liquid.

490                  Dr. C. H. Draper on the

and with rather weak currents, the tangent-galvanometer

Here evidently the current was increasing faster than the
potential-difference; and the inference was that the polariza
tion was increasing in amount, and did not reach a steady
value with such currents as could be measured by this galva
nometer. A galvanometer with a single ring was therefore
used in the greater part of the experiments. To obtain a
deflection as high as 45° on this galvanometer it was neces
sary to use eight or ten Grove cells; and the potential
difference with such strong currents was such as to send the
spot of light off the scale when the distance from mirror to
scale was that for which the divisions represented equal diffe
rences of potential.    The scale was therefore moved nearer the
mirror and calibrated. A current was sent by five Leclanché
cells through 12,000 ohms resistance, while the electrometer
was joined to two movable points in this resistance. Between
these two movable points various resistances were included,
from 1000 to 12,000 ohms; the readings being taken up one
side of the scale and back, then up the other side and back to
zero, in order to eliminate the ' of loss of charge in the
electrometer. The scale was thus divided into twenty-four
parts, corresponding to equal differences of potential, and a
table was drawn up from which the value of any deflection
could be obtained in terms of the central scale-division.   The
scale was put as accurately as possible at the same distance
from the mirror on each day; but in order to ensure absence
of error from displacement of the scale, as well as to have a
less arbitrary unit than a scale-division, the deflection pro
duced by a standard cell was taken at the beginning and end
of each set of observations.
   The Standard Cell.—The cell chosen was a modified form
of the Daniell, resembling that described by Professor Lodge
in the Philosophical Magazine for January 1878.            In a

                 Polarization of Platinum Plates.              491
small glass bottle, AA, was placed a weak           Fig. 3.
solution of zinc sulphate, which reached to
the level, a a. The bottle was closed by a
cork, through which passed two glass
tubes, B, C, of about !-inch bore, and open
at each end. C contained a strip of amal
gamated zinc, which could be lowered into
the zinc sulphate or raised out of it as
required. The tube B contained a thick
copper wire, which was gutta-percha
covered (except for about half an inch
where it passed beyond the lower end of the tube), and
passed into a test-tube, D, through a cork, E. This test-tube
was filled up to the level a a with a saturated copper sulphate
solution, and the naked part of the copper wire was embedded
among crystals of copper sulphate placed at the bottom of the
test-tube. The level of the liquids was about half an inch
below the top of the test-tube. Scarcely any diffusion of the
liquids is possible; and this form of the Daniell, though useless
as a means of producing currents, has a very constant electro
motive force.
   Readings.—A series of experiments was made at the tem
peratures 40°, 60°, 80°C., and with the water in the bath
boiling. The readings were taken in sets, proceeding from
weaker to stronger currents and back again, so as to elimi
nate the effects of possible leakage of the electrometer. The
galvanometer-deflections were corrected for torsion of the
suspending fibre, and the electrometer-readings for scale
error. In the following table, E indicates the electrometer
readings and 6 the deflection of the galvanometer-needle.

The readings taken with the liquid boiling were, as might be
expected, somewhat irregular, but in all the potential value
for the same current was considerably lower than at 80°.
    It is evident, on comparing the values of E and tan 6 at the
different temperatures, that for any given value of the current
 the potential-difference diminishes with rise of temperature.
 It was then decided to reduce the results to absolute measure,
so that something more than comparative values might be
indicated.
   Reduction to Absolute Measure. (1) The Current.—For
this it was necessary to find the galvanometer-constant and
the horizontal intensity of the earth’s magnetism for the
position of the galvanometer.
    Galvanometer-constant.—The single ring had a mean dia
meter of 43:21 centim., and its calculated constant was thus
‘2908; as determined by the quantity of hydrogen liberated
in the electrolysis of water it was 2902. The mean of these,
‘2905, was taken.
   Determination of H.—The value of the horizontal com
ponent of the earth's magnetism for the position of the
galvanometer was determined by means of a Kew unifilar
magnetometer to be 1830.
   (2) The Electromotive Force.—To reduce the electrometer
readings to absolute units the E.M.F. of the standard cell
had to be ascertained, since the E.M.F. of a Daniell cell has
been variously given from 978 volt (Latimer Clark) to 1:137
volt (Kohlrausch), depending on the strength of the solutions
emploved.
      £ion          of the E.M.F. of the Standard Cell.—The
following method was adopted to find the E.M.F. The sen
sitive galvanometer employed in Poggendorff’s method was
replaced by a condenser and the galvanometer was placed as
a shunt to the condenser.                     -
   The accompanying figure shows the connexions. B a
battery of two Daniell cells of the gravitation-pattern is
connected through CK, a commutating-key, with a circuit
containing SG, a standard tangent-galvanometer, and MN,
a resistance-box containing 12,000 ohms. B2, the standard
cell, has one terminal joined to P, a movable plug in the
resistance-box, and the other terminal to one coating of the
condenser, C, of which the other coating is joined to Q, another
movable plug. R G is a delicate reflecting-galvanometer
joined, through a contact-key, K, with the condenser C. A
steady current was allowed to flow round the circuit B MN,
and the resistance PQ was so adjusted, without altering the
whole resistance MN, that on depressing the key K there

                    Polarization of Platinum Plates.          493
was no deflection on the reflecting-galvanometer. The E.M.F.
of B, is then equal to the difference of potential between the
points P, Q in the primary circuit.

                                Kt
   The tangent-galvanometer had two equal parallel coils of
approximately square section placed at a distance apart nearly
equal to their mean radius, which was about 18:25 centim.
Each coil consisted of 22 layers of 20 turns each. The de
flections were read by a telescope placed underneath the scale,
 which was straight and was divided into centimetres and
millimetres.        The distance from mirror to scale was 345-44
 centim. The galvanometer-constant y was calculated to be
 1/0:004618, so that, neglecting torsion, the absolute strength of
a current measured on this galvanometer is 0-004618 H tan 6.
   Torsion.—On turning the torsion-head through 360° the
 needle was deflected through 118'. The factor needed to

   Value of H.—The value of H for the position of the galva
 nometer was ascertained by comparing the time of vibration
 of the magnetometer-needle in that position with the time of
 vibration in the place for which the value of H had been
 accurately ascertained. The mean of two determinations of
 the period of vibration was 4,314 seconds. In the room
 where the value of H was 1830, the time of vibration was
 4,2085 seconds; so that the value of H in this spot was
 -183x (4.2085)”--(4:314)”, whence H=-1742.
    Readings.—The resistance in the main circuit was about
 4000 ohms, and 10 microfarads was the capacity employed,
 and the arrangement was sensitive to within 25 per cent. of
 the quantity to be measured. Readings of the galvanometer
 were taken on both sides of zero, and the mean of four, which
 were very close together, gave

   If 6 be deflection of needle, tan 26=44:64––345.44="1292,

torsion, 6=3°42' 5" and tan 6=.06469; whence if C =
current in absolute measure, C = 004618 x 1742 x 06469.
The resistance between the points P, Q=2110 x 10" in abso
lute units; therefore E.M.F. of cell = CR=2110 x 10'x
-004618 x 1742 x 06469=1.098 x 10°, or 1.098 volt.
   Here and throughout the old value of the ohm is taken.
   After the results were reduced another correction was
applied for the effect of the platinum wires to the end of
which the electrometer-wires were joined, and which, being
in the battery-circuit, caused the potential-readings to be
higher than would have been the case if the electrometer had
been joined directly to the electrodes. Their resistance at
16°, as determined by the Wheatstone-bridge, was 22 ohm ;
and from Siemens’ formula,
               r1=r,{-03969T + 002164T-2413}.
   The resistance at 40° is thus 253 ohm, and at 80° is
•283 ohm.
   The following table gives the reduced observations for 40°
and 80°, and the curve in the accompanying figure shows the
relation between them.           The observations for 60° and 100°
are not given, as they would only serve to confuse the figure.
The current-values are in amperes, and the differences of
potential in volts.

   The characteristics of both lines are the same.      At both
temperatures, for values of the current lower than 5 ampere
the line is concave to the axis of current.     An accident to
the voltameter during the time that this part of the curve was
being investigated rendered these readings less trustworthy
than the rest. The course of the lines is therefore only
roughly indicated by dots (–.— ...— ...—) in this part, but
it may be noticed that they seem to tend towards a common
point on the axis of potential at about 1.5 volt. The curved

part of the line extends to a point    where the current-value
was about 1.3 or 1:4 ampere, the current-strength required
for the establishment of maximum polarization being some
what greater at the higher temperature. Beyond this point
both lines are for some distance straight, a deviation becoming
again manifest when the current-value reaches 3:5 amperes,
where the line turns up and becomes convex to the current

496             Profs. Ayrton and Perry on the
axis. The explanation of this seems almost certainly to be
an increase in the resistance of the liquid column, owing to
the presence in considerable quantity of the gaseous products
in the path of the current. A straight line dotted thus .....   •
has been ruled through those points which lie on the straight
part of the curve, to cut the axis of potential. Representing
this straight line by the equation E=e+CR, and putting in
the numerical values of E and C, a series of equations was
obtained containing e and R. The mean value of e at 40° is
2:32, and at 80° 2'08; and these values of the intercept on the
axis of potential represent in volts the values of the maximum
steady electromotive force of polarization at these tempera
tures under the conditions of the experiment. The difference
“24 volt, produced by a rise of 40° in temperature, gives 26
per cent, as the rate of variation per degree at temperature
40°. The other constant R of the straight line, representing
the tangent of its angle of inclination to the axis of current,
being the quotient of potential by current, indicates the resist
ance of the voltameter under the conditions of the experiment.
The mean values of R obtained from the equations were for
40°, 69, and for 80°, -67; these numbers representing in ohms
the working resistance of the voltameter.
    Conclusions.—(1) The opposing electromotive force of
polarization which arises in cells when at work depends
on the value of the current passing through them when that
current is below a certain value, increasing, but more and
more slowly, with the current.
   (2) There is a maximum value of the polarization regarded
only as a function of the current-strength, beyond '. any
increase in the strength of the current has no effect upon it.
   (3) The electromotive force of polarization varies with
temperature, its value decreasing about 1 per cent. for a rise
of temperature of 4°C.
   The method of experiment was suggested by Professor
Carey-Foster, in whose laboratory the experiments were
made.

   We shall speak indifferently of the drum or Hefner-Alteneck
and the cylindric Gramme armature—that is, the Gramme
armature which receives its induction through its cylindric
surface from two pole-pieces. It is easy to make the slight
changes in the formulae required for flat gramme ring
armatures like those of the Victoria, Gulcher, and Schückert
machines, which receive induction through their flat sides,
and for all machines with more than two pole-pieces.

          sq. cm. of cross section. Of course p is greater than
          the specific resistance of copper, as the space is partly
          occupied by insulating material, p is greater with finer
          wire; but for some practical purposes it is advisable to
          assume p constant for all kinds of winding.

E6, the rate of loss of heat in watts per square centim. of

        usually taken to be 0:2 in modern machines furnished
        with some ventilating arrangement. The value of
       ^\/# may, we find, be practically taken as 288 in
       such machines; we shall call this constant q, as
        machines made by different makers differ greatly in
       its value, even where there are the same methods of
       ventilating and the same sizes of wires. With finer
       wires p is greater, as the space is less occupied by
       copper, so that q is less. If two thirds of the space
       be taken as occupied by copper, q=288 if E6=0.2.
       In some armatures, which are always perhaps too safe
       from heating, we have found q to be as little as 150.
        In some cases it is considerably more than 300.

 S', spires on the coils of the field-magnet part of one
        magnetic circuit.     In the Edison-Hopkinson and
        Kapp machines there is only one magnetic circuit, and
        S is here the total number of spires on the field-mag
        nets; but in the Manchester, Crompton, A-Gramme, and
        other forms there are two magnetic circuits, and S is
        here the number of spires on only one of the magnetic
        circuits.
 A', amperes in each spire of the field magnet-coils; or
  a', amperes per square centimetre of cross section of the
        winding.
   Any person who has engaged in making measuring-instru
ments or dynamo machines is aware that for a given volume
of winding, whether the wires are small or large, for the
same distribution of temperature there will be the same
number of ampere-turns and there will be the same rate of
loss of energy by heating, if the volume of insulating material
is always in the same ratio to the volume of the copper.
With fine wire the volume of insulating material becomes
greater, but not to such an extent as to make useless this
very important roughly correct practical rule for the makers
of instruments and dynamo machines. This rule we have
regularly used since 1881 in our measuring-instruments.
   This has led us to speak of a the current in amperes per
square centimetre of cross section of a coil, rather than the
density of current in the copper alone, and we have been led
to some general rules of considerable practical interest in
consequence.
   To make our rules more complete, we begin with one which
is well known. It will be observed that we use Mr. Kapp's

   It is on the combination of (5) and (4) that we have based
an important generalization regarding the magnetic circuit
of the dynamo, which gives the title to our paper. Members
of the Society are aware of the methods adopted by Mr.
Bosanquet, Dr. Hopkinson, and Mr. Kapp in dealing with a
magnetic circuit. Consider a closed tube of small cross
section everywhere, passing through the iron of the armature,
the air-spaces, the limbs of the field-magnet, and the yoke.
Let the section vary so that the total induction is everywhere
the same. Then, in a short length of the tube l, the line
integral of the magnetic force required to produce this
induction is
                                l

place, is 1 for air, and where its value for iron is given in

 the accompanying figure for various values of 8. The curve
 B, fig. 1, is that given by Mr. Bidwell in his paper (Proc.
 Royal Society, No. 245, 1886). The curve            #   has been
 obtained from Dr. Hopkinson's experiments on wrought iron
 in the Philosophical Transactions, 1885, plate 47. We wish
that Dr. Hopkinson had in this paper given his experimental
numbers, instead of plotting them in curves to such scales
that one feels very great uneasiness in making measure
ments. We have determined the curve H1 by taking a
medium curve between Dr. Hopkinson’s curves for rising and
falling magnetizations. It is quite probable that, in view of
the great differences in the behaviour of the same and
different kinds of iron, under different circumstances, Dr.
Hopkinson did not feel that he was justified in drawing his
curves on paper too finely divided. It will be observed that
from 8=10000 to 8=16300 we may take u=5221–0.30718.
Unfortunately for easy methods of calculation in many
machines much larger values of 8 than 16300 are often used.
   Curve H2 is computed from Dr. Hopkinson's results for
cast iron, and it shows how very important it is, when cast
iron is used in the magnetic circuit of a machine, to have its
section much greater than that of the wrought iron portions
of the circuit, if throttling the induction is to be avoided.
   Curves K1, K2, and K2 are computed from the formulae
given in Mr. Kapp's paper for the wrought iron used in the
armature, field-magnets, and yoke respectively of a dynamo
machine.                                                          )
   The differences among these curves throw great light upon
the fact that it is really impossible to predetermine the
“characteristic” of a dynamo machine. Mr. Kapp gets over
discrepances by calculating a value of his leakage-resistance
which suits the actual observations made on an already con
structed dynamo machine; and Dr. Hopkinson's curves, al
though calculated on the basis of actual measurements of the
leakage made on an already constructed dynamo, and although
only computed for a very small portion of that part of the
characteristic where the iron magnetic resistance is important
(the only portion about which there is any difficulty), repre
sent this small portion very indifferently indeed. Methods
of calculating the leakage which have been put forward we
can in no way believe in, for reasons given      ' one   of us in
the discussion on Mr. Kapp's paper at the Society of Tele
  raph Engineers. We are not in any way detracting from
# merits of Dr.      Hopkinson's beautiful theory. We are too

    In the above investigation, the iron resistance is supposed
 to be given, and also the exciting power in ampere-turns.
 At present this seems a sufficiently practical basis for the
 calculation, as we usually fix first the size of armature, then
 arrange as short a magnetic circuit as possible, which must
 leave sufficient room for the exciting coils. We see, however,
 that a larger generalization is possible when we know with
 certainty what is the limiting thickness of winding on the
 field-magnets. We were allowed to assume in the armature
 winding that tal” is constant, 21 being the greatest permanent
 current per square centimetre allowable. When the winding
 is thin, so that the temperature is nearly uniform in the
 winding, and only when this is the case, is such a rule allow
 able, and it is not allowable in cases where the winding is of
 the thickness usual in field-magnet coils. We are at present
 experimenting on this subject, but there are considerable
 difficulties in the way of obtaining practical rules. We have
 no doubt, however, that there is such a rule as
                              S.A.' =pA.
 That is, the greatest number of ampere-turns which can use
 fully and permanently be applied on a field-magnet coil of
 length X is proportional to A. If l is given, the configuration
 of the   £          enables X and therefore S2'A3' to be fixed.

 dimensions are fixed. Should 81 be great, considerations of
 cost of the field-magnet winding may come in, to alter com
 pletely the design of the machine, but for a given configura
tion of machine this is the practical method of working.
    From experiments, the results of which were published
before this Society on March 12th, 1887, we came to the
conclusion that there is a definite resistance at a joint in a
magnetic circuit; and Professor Ewing found that by cutting
a bar into two, four, and eight pieces, the magnetic per
meability seemed to alter from 1220 to 980, 640, and 480
respectively, the joints being tooled up in the usual way.
When the joints are carefully scraped he also found that
they materially increased the £ resistance unless con
siderable pressure was applied. Now as a stress of less than
one quarter of the ordinary stresses to which wrought iron is

               Magnetic Circuit of Dynamo Machines.              505
subjected in machinery materially diminishes the permeability
of iron, it is obvious that all joints in the magnetic circuit
ought, as much as possible, to be got rid of, consistently with
easy manufacture; or, when they exist, they ought to be
made of as large area as possible, by letting one piece into
another to a considerable depth.
   In the design of a machine, the question of possible leakage
is of considerable importance. It will often be found that in
the effort to make l short and as large, machines are designed
with enormous amounts of leakage not only from one pole to
the other, but from either pole to the       #. of a neighbour
ing field-magnet coil.
   One of the best ways of finding the nature of the probable
magnetic leakage in a dynamo, before it is constructed, is to
construct a small model of the same kind of iron, exciting the
field-magnets, and exploring by means of a ballistic galvano
meter. Another simpler way, which gives a considerable
amount of information, and which we ' employed, is to
make a model of wood, covering certain judiciously selected
parts, such as the poles and armature, and half the field
magnets with metal, immerse the model in a barrel of rain
water, and find the electric resistance between one part
and another when electric potential-differences are established
between them.       On account of the ease with which the model
may be rearranged in configuration, this method of working
gives interesting results; but these results, when applied in
 the magnetic case, must be used judiciously and with the
knowledge that the permeability of iron is not a fixed quantity.
    It is obvious that the best section of a field-magnet limb is
the circular, but considerations of possible leakage to the
middle of the limb from the armature or a pole-piece, and
other considerations relating to the configuration of the
machine, often cause us to give to the section a rectangular
or oval section.
                 The Characteristic of a Dynamo.
   In a letter written by one of us from Japan, in January
 1879", before he had seen a dynamo, the necessity was shown
for establishing an algebraic relation between the E.M.F.
developed in the armature and the current exciting the field
 magnets. It was pointed out that E the E.M.F. in the
armature was proportional to the field and speed, and that
this led to                              QC
                     E = p + qc +   25+.     . . .     . .    .  (14)

for any given speed. It was also pointed out that a tangent
function might also be employed, but that it would not lend
itself so readily to calculation. We had, both, in 1878 used
a curve to express this relationship, but it was not until 1881,
when we met M. Deprez, and learnt of his work, that we had
any conception of the many calculations which might be
made by graphical methods, using the curve as a fundamental
relation. Herr Fröhlich uses one term of the above expres
S1On :
                            E=#. . . . . . . . (15)
He regards p the permanent field as 0, and he has no term which
remains proportional to the current. We shall speak of (15)
as the Fröhlich formula, because it usually goes under that
name. It is, of course, an empirical formula, like (14).
   The reasoning which led us to regard (14) as a rational
formula, was based on a magnetic theory which need not here
be expounded.
   A very great necessity exists for having some such em
pirical formula as (15), but, as is well known, it is quite
incorrect when c is small. It is not nearly so incorrect as
we might imagine it to be from the statements made by
Mr. Kapp (p. 529, Journ. Soc. Tel. Eng. and Elect. vol. xv.
1887), who has given in his fig. 3 a most absurdly unsuitable
Fröhlich curve, or by Dr. Hopkinson (plate xvi. Phil. Trans.
1886), whose Fröhlich is also not the most suitable.        It is
obvious that the Fröhlich ought not to be expected to agree
with the real characteristic near the origin. It ought to be
made to agree most perfectly with the working part of the
characteristic. To effect this purpose let the observed values
of #and   E be plotted as the coordinates of points on squared
paper. The    £         line which lies most evenly among the
points for the working values of E satisfies the equation
                        # b + E=a.
The measured coordinates of two points on this straight line
enable b and a to be calculated.

ampere-turns in one coil of the machine, or the magneto

   The uses made by Herr Fröhlich and Prof. Rücker of (15)
in a theory of compounding show how important it is to have
a simple empirical formula. Indeed in our patent specification
of 1882 we base the theory of compounding on the simplest
of all empirical formulae,
                             E=aC. . . . . . . . (16)
And it is by means of this formula that the theory can be best
put before students; if our easy reasoning is properly grasped,
the practical electrical engineer will be able to use the results
graphically with actual characteristics in the manner employed
by the most experienced men at the present day.
   Instead of speaking of E the E.M.F. produced in the arma
ture, which is proportional to N the magnetic field and n the
speed, as shown in (1) it is preferable to speak of N the field
itself. And instead of referring merely to the current exciting
the field-magnets, it is preferable to speak of the ampere
turns S.A., or, better, of the magneto-motive force in C.G.S.
units, : S2A2.
   We have tried in vain, during perhaps two months of very
hard work, to express the two constants a and b of (15) in
terms of the dimensions of a dynamo machine. We now
believe that this cannot be effected. We have already given
the reason why the linear law connecting the 8 and u cannot
be used in obtaining a formula. In any case such a formula
would be very different from that of Fröhlich. But in view
of the important relation (12) which we have established, that
when the machine is giving its best permanent output, -
   The air magnetic resistance of the space occupied by wind
      ing on the armature = all other magnetic resistance,
it is not difficult to arrive at practical rules of working. It
will be noticed that in existing machines we may, in general
calculations, neglect the resistance of the clearance-space d.
   The most important fact to be kept in mind by constructors
of dynamosis, that the magnetic air-resistance is the governing
factor. Until half the highest induction is reached we may
neglect altogether the resistance of the iron; and indeed for
many calculations it is sufficient to take
                        N = 47T. (t2

Manchester dynamo described by Dr. Hopkinson (Trans. Roy.
Soc. 1886),
                   an=220.5 square centim.,
                   a2=839.5        25    55
                   8 =     0.8 centim.
   Taking 81=18,460 lines per square centim., we find
                        a181 =4,07 x 10".
Now
                         4t as  =660.
                         10 28
So that N=660 S.As represents the straight part of the
characteristic.
   Again,             N1= a181=4'07 x 10",
and
 -                  a181=330 S2A2,
Or                           4-07 x 106
                     S2A2  - TööUT      - 12330.
   Plotting N=4,07 x 10" and S2A2=12330 as the coordinates
of a point on squared paper, and plotting also the straight line
from the origin N=660 S2A2, a man who has seen charac
teristics before, will be able to draw the characteristic of this
machine with a fair amount of accuracy, especially if he
recollects that the iron is near saturation. Those, however,
who have less experience may find the Fröhlich, which for any
dynamo passes through the point on the straight line which
represents. N=10,000 ai, and the second point just found,

             Magnetic Circuit of Dynamo Machines.            509
rounding off the straight line into the Fröhlich by hand.     In
applying our rule to the Manchester dynamo we employed
neither of these methods, as one’s judgment is vitiated when
one has seen the actual observations; and we have assumed
that the very roughly correct rule,
                     N=p tan" (h S2A2),
                                   •
may be applied, making its slope the same as that of the
straight line at the origin, and making it pass through the
point whose position we have calculated. In this case
                          ph=660;
and it will be found that
                       p=34:65 x 10",
and
                       h=19:03 x 10"
for this case.
   As Dr. Hopkinson has given his characteristics, not in
terms of ampere-turns S.A2, but in absolute units, calling
# S2A2 by the letter F to denote the magneto-motive force in
absolute units, the above formula becomes for this comparison,
             N=34.65×10" tan- (15:15 x 10"F).
   In the figure we have plotted the curve obtained by calcu
lation as A.; B shows Dr. Hopkinson's calculated curves;
the dotted line passes as nearly as possible through the points
determined by experiment. It will be observed that the
Drs. Hopkinson have only ventured to calculate the charac
teristic up to F=12,000 on the ascending, and 9500 on
the descending part; whereas the observations extend to
F=29,500. As the very straight part near the origin pre
sents no difficulty, it may be said that all their elaborate
calculation represents only the characteristic from about
F=6000 to F=12,000, and that part very indifferently. It
is, besides, to be observed that in an actual dynamo there are
no such differences between observations made with steadily
increasing and with steadily diminishing magneto-motive forces,
as the theory requires.
   In the above calculation we have neglected the clearance d,
as we did not know it. It would have been easy to calculate
a value of d, possibly not very different from the real value, to
make our curve agree more closely with the observations. In
conclusion we would say that, in our opinion, it is impossible,
until a machine is constructed, to compute its characteristic

with sufficient accuracy for such purposes as the determina
tion of coils in compound winding. But the probable charac
teristic may be determined in the way here described, with
sufficient accuracy for a number of useful purposes. It is
based on the facts:—(1) When a machine is working at its
best permanent output, its iron magnetic resistance plus the
air magnetic resistance of the clearance is equal to the air
magnetic resistance of the space on the outside of the arma
ture occupied by winding. (2) At the beginning the air
resistance is alone of any importance.
LXII. On the Recalescence of Steel. By H. F. NEwALL,
   M.A., Demonstrator in Experimental Physics, Cambridge
    University".                   -
IN a      Note published in the Philosophical Magazine for
        November 1887, I stated the results of a number of
experiments made with a view to investigate the recalescence
of steel. I propose in the present note to give an account of
the experiments on which !' base those results.
    I. Reglow, or recalescence, is not due to chemical action at
       the surface of the steel, nor is it due to occlusion of gases.
    A steel wire with copper terminals was put in a glass tube,
the terminals passing through indiarubber stoppers, which
closed the tube tightly at its two ends. The tube was ex
hausted by means of a mercury-pump till the air-pressure was
a very small fraction of a millimetre. The steel wire was
heated again and again by the passage of an electric current
from storage-cells. Pressure rose slightly after the first three
or four heatings    £          because of the setting free at high
temperatures of the air-layers condensed on wire and tube
 surfaces), and was reduced by further pumping. Both dark
ening and reglow were observed with undiminished distinct
 ness after fourteen heatings, and the process was not repeated.
Nitrogen was admitted to the tube and produced no effect
that could be detected on the brilliancy of reglow.
    II. Reglow is not due to difference in conductivity at
       different temperatures, as suggested by Forbes.
    A wire (.5 millim. diameter) was hammered flat and still
 showed reglow. A thin steel plate, hammered till its thick
 ness was less than 1 millim., as measured by a screw-gauge,
 still showed reglow. Either we must believe that there can

 Society, January 29, 1888. Communicated by the Author.

                       Recalescence of Steel.                511
be the considerable difference of temperature evidenced by
reglow, within 0.5 millim, or we must relinquish the ingenious
theory suggested by Prof. Forbes. See also next paragraph.
   III. A rise of temperature takes place throughout the mass.
   A rod of steel, 1 centim, in diameter and 7 centim. long, was
softened, and a hole, 1 millim. in diameter and 3 centim. long,
was drilled down its axis. A thermoelectric couple of PtCu,
composed of wires No. 36 B.W.G., was inserted, precautions
being taken that there should be contact with the tube only at
the junction of Pt and Cu, if at all. The free ends of the
couple were attached to a galvanometer which was most satis
factorily dead-beat, a vane dipping in water being attached to
the magnet and mirror. The galvanometer-indications were
those denoting unmistakable rise of temperature with the
reglow during the cooling, and a fall of temperature with the
appearance of “darkening” in the heating.
   Considerable difficulty was experienced in showing the
actual change of sign in the temperature-variations, until it
was realized that care must be taken to apportion the proper
masses to the PtCu wires and the steel tube.        If the wires
were larger than No. 30 B.W.G., only a pause in the rise or
fall of temperature was observed; the thermoelectric couple
did not truly denote the temperature of the enclosure, the heat
coming into the couple being conducted along the thick wires
too quickly to admit of a rise of temperature at the actual
junction. This was obviated by enclosing the steel tube in a
massive brass tube in order to diminish the rate of cooling of
the steel, and also by making the thermoelectric couple with
finer wire; the latter plan being found most satisfactory,
inasmuch as the reglow could be easily observed. The gal
vanometer-indications denote that the temperature of darken
ing is higher than that of the reglow.
   IV. Peculiarities in thermoelectric properties.
   Allowances being made for differences in magnitude, the
peculiarities exhibited by a thermoelectric couple of steel and
platinum are similar to those exhibited by ' PtCu couple
when heated or cooled in a steel tube, as just described. In
fact, part certainly of the peculiarities observed and graphi
cally represented by Prof. Tait may be explained by the rise
of temperature in the cooling steel, which may, I think, now
be taken as proved.
   The same difficulties that I have experienced in proving the
rise of temperature inside a block of steel, as a certain point
is reached in the cooling of the block, would be met with in

512               Mr. J. Parker on an Extension
an exaggerated degree in measuring the temperature of a
couple of which one element is steel, by means of a second
couple placed inside an enclosure side by side with the steel
couple. The accession of heat in the enclosure due to the
reglow of the steel in the thermoelectric couple is not enough
to produce an effect on the thermometric couple.
    £ is another peculiarity in the thermoelectric properties
of steel, to which Mr. Tomlinson refers (Phil. Mag. Jan. 1888).
A piece of steel wire is connected up with a galvanometer,
and is heated by a flame at a point remote from the galvano
meter connexions.      There are no signs of a resultant E.M.F.
in the circuit, even when the flame is moved, until “darkening’
has occurred. Then, however, if the flame be moved along
the wire so that reglow takes place behind it in the cooling
  art, and darkening in front in the part being heated, an
   .M.F. results, and persists only so long as the flame is kept
moving.
    In proving the rise of temperature throughout the mass of
steel during recalescence, I have shown that the temperature
of recalescence is different from that of darkening, the latter
being higher. This difference of temperature of what may be
regarded as the junctions of the hot altered steel with the cold
steel on each side, determines the E.M.F. in the circuit.
LXIII. On an Extension of Carnot's Theorem. By J. PARKER,
      B.A., late Scholar of St. John's College, Cambridge".
IT is well known that no engine can be more efficient in
       transforming heat into mechanical work than Carnot's
reversible engine, and that all reversible engines are of the
same efficiency. It is also generally believed, without, how
ever, being proved, that no irreversible engine can be so
efficient as Carnot's. This is the point we propose to examine.
    One of the principal conditions imposed on a system sub
jected to a reversible operation is that, at every instant, the
system is in mechanical and thermal equilibrium. This con
dition, however, also belongs to a certain class of irreversible
processes, as we shall presently see.
    Thus, when a saturated solution of sodium chloride is heated
with an excess of the salt, the salt is dissolved; but if the
temperature is again reduced, the solution deposits, not the
anhydrous salt, but crystals of the bihydrate. Again, a salt
is neutral to pure ice at the freezing temperature of its cryo
hydrate; and if heat is slowly imparted, the liquid cryohydrate
                   * Communicated by the Author.

                      of Carnot's Theorem.                     513
will be formed at this constant temperature. The system is in
mechanical and thermal equilibrium throughout the process;
but the process is not reversible, for if heat is slowly abstracted
from the liquid cryohydrate, it is not dissociated—it is simply
frozen.
   We define an “equilibrium path ” to be a path at every
£ of which the system         under consideration is in equili
 rium, which may be either stable or unstable, provided, of
£, that the equilibrium is not broken at any point of the
path.
   A reversible path is always an “equilibrium path,” but an
“equilibrium path” is not necessarily reversible, as we have
already seen. All the irreversible equilibrium paths I have
noticed correspond to an absorption of heat—that is, an in
crease of entropy.
   Now it is ''known that in a complete cycle the energy
                   *
dissipated  ––. #. where dq denotes a quantity of heat
absorbed, and to is the temperature of the refrigerator.
Clausius has shown that this quantity cannot be negative, and
that when the cycle is reversible it is equal to zero. It is
then generally assumed that in all irreversible cycles the
energy dissipated has a positive value.
   The study of Solubilities has compelled me to adopt a dif
ferent view. I have been led to conclude that in any irrever
sible equilibrium-cycle the energy dissipated is zero, but that
in all other irreversible cycles the energy dissipated has a
positive value. Any irreversible equilibrium-engine is, then,
as efficient as Carnot's perfectly reversible engine, and all
other irreversible engines are less efficient than Carnot's.
                                    dq
   We have already seen that \, =0 for any equilibrium
cycle. Suppose, then, that a system travels from one position
A to another position B by an irreversible equilibrium path,
and let the cycle be completed by the reversible path BCA.
£ been shown
      ?
                       by Clausius that, for the reversible path
                                  A

S” the entropy in the position B.      But  |%    =0 for the com
plete cycle: hence, for the irreversible equilibrium path AB,

we have
                      s—s.- A dq*   B
                                         =0.
Thus, if the system can pass from the position A to the po
sition B by several irreversible equilibrium paths,
has the same value for all the paths.
                                                         then.  B
                                                               A *
                                                                  dq
    Again, when the temperature is constant throughout the
modification, the heat absorbed will be
                           t(SB-SA).
An example of this will be found in equation (4), page 408
(May 1888).
    In particular, consider the formation of unit weight of a
liquid cryohydrate under a pressure equal to the pressure of
the saturated vapour of ice. The cycle may be completed by
the following operations, performed at constant temperature
and pressure:—
    (1) Let the cryohydrate be dissociated by evaporation into
the saturated vapour of ice and the anhydrous salt or a hy
drate. In the latter case, the cryohydrate is supposed to have
been formed from the hydrate and ice.
    (2) Let the aqueous vapour be separated from the salt, and
then condensed into the solid state.
    Since the pressure is constant throughout the cycle, the
 total work done and heat absorbed are both zero.
    But if S be the entropy of the cryohydrate, and S1 the sum
 of the entropies of the salt and ice of which it is composed, the
 heat absorbed in the reversible parts of the cycle will be
                             t (S1-S).
                              -
Hence the heat absorbed in the formation of the cryohydrate
—an irreversible process—will be
                          Q=t. (S-S1).

 AN interesting inaugural address by Mr. Ralph Richardson,
       treating of the discoveries of Fossil Mammalia in Scotland,
  with a map and lists of the places at which the individual species
  have been found, commences this number of the ‘Transactions.”
 Following this, Mr. John Henderson treats of the Sands and

                        Geological Society.                     515
trees; and in a second paper the same author describes an ancient
Lake-basin at Holyrood. Other papers on Stratigraphical Geology
are given:—Mr. Hamilton Bell writes “On Exposures of the Old
Red between Callender and Crieff;” Mr. T. Wallace, “Upper
Stratherrick;” and Mr. M'Diarmid, “On a Boring at Dumfries.”
In this boring, at 149 feet from the surface, a bed of Permian
breccia, composed of fragments of Silurian Rocks, Porphyry, and
Felstone, was met with, and proved to be 283 feet in thickness.
   The Palaeontological papers include:—Mr. Tait Kinnear, “On
the genus Fenestella,” and “On a new Crustacean from Ardross.”
The first paper deals with the revision of species of this typically
Carboniferous genus of Polyzoa; and the second notices a new
fossil Schizopod for which Mr. Peach proposes the name Rostrocaris.
Mr. James Thomson contributes one of his illustrated papers on
the Corals—with figures of the genus Lithrostrotion; and Mr. John
Young discusses Ulrich's Cystodictyonidae, a family of Carboni
ferous Polyzoa.
   A Petrological paper is given by Mr. A. Johnstone, who treats
of the “Evolution and Classification of Igneous Rocks;” while
Physical Geology includes a paper by Dr. Black on “Brighton
Beaches after Storms of October and December 1886,” and an
address by Mr. James Melvin on “Hutton's views of the Vegetable
Soil or Mould, and Vegetable and Animal Life.”
   Perhaps, however, the most important contribution to the pre
sent number is Prof. E. A. Claypole's paper on “The Lake Age in
Ohio.” By a careful study of the glacial deposits in the Northern
United States, Prof. Claypole is enabled to map out the old Lake
 Basins caused by the Ice-dams and other obstructions, his views
being rendered much clearer by a series of sketch-maps which
 accompany the paper. These old lakes were apparently much
larger than any now existing, their size and extent varying con
 stantly, according to the advance, retreat, or breaching of the
 Ice-dams. The nature and violence of the glacial floods are fully
 discussed, and attention is drawn to the enormous and often
 repeated denudation which occurred during this period.

                            in the Chair.
 THE following communications were read:—
      1. “Report on the Recent work of the Geological Survey in the
 North-west Highlands of Scotland, based on the field-notes and maps
 of Messrs. Peach, Horne, Gunn, Clough, Hinxman, and Cadell.”
    At the outset a review was given of the researches of other

516                      Geological Society:—
observers, in so far as they forestalled the conclusions to which the
Geological Survey had been led. Reference was made to the obser
vations of Macculloch, Hay Cunningham, C. W. Peach, and Salter;
to the prolonged controversy between Sir Roderick Murchison and
Professor Nicol; to the contributions of Hicks, Bonney, Hudleston,
Callaway, Lapworth, Teall, and others. It was shown that Nicol
was undoubtedly right in maintaining that there was no conformable
sequence from the fossiliferous quartzites and limestones into the
eastern schists. It was also pointed out that the conclusions of
Professor Lapworth regarding the nature and origin of the eastern
schists involve an important departure from Nicol's position, and
are practically identical with those obtained independently by the
Geological Survey.
   The results of the recent survey work among the Archaean rocks
may be thus summarized:—(1) the eruption of a series of igneous
rocks of a basic type in which pegmatites were formed; (2) the
development of rude foliation in these masses, probably by mechanical
movement, and their arrangement in gentle anticlines and synclines,
the axes of which generally run N.E. and S.W.; (3) the injection
of igneous materials, mainly in the form of dykes, into the original
gneisses, composed of (a) basalt rocks, (b) peridotites and palaeopicrites,
(c) microcline-mica rocks, (d) granites; (4) the occurrence of mecha
nical movements giving rise to disruption-lines trending N.W. and
S.E., E. and W., N.E. and S.W.; (5) the effects of these movements
on the dykes were to change the basalt-rocks into diorites and
hornblende-schists, the peridotites and palaeopicrites into talcose
schists, the microcline-mica rocks into mica-schists, and the granites
into granitoid gneiss; (6) the effects on the gneiss resulted in the
formation of sharp folds trending generally N.W. and S.E., the
partial or complete reconstruction of the original gneiss along the
old foliation-planes, and finally the development of newer schistosity
more or less parallel with the prominent disruption-lines.
   There is an overwhelming amount of evidence to prove that all
these various changes had been superinduced in the Archaean rocks
in Pre-Cambrian time.
   After reviewing the facts bearing on the denudation of the Ar
chaean land-surface, the order of succession and thickness of the
Cambrian strata were given, from which it is apparent that the
deposits gradually increase in thickness as we pass southwards from
Durness to Loch Broom.
   Prior to the deposition of the Silurian sediments the Cambrian
strata were folded and extensively denuded. By these means
various Cambrian outliers were formed far to the east of the present
limits of the formation.
   The order of succession of the Silurian strata along the line of
complicated structure from Eriboll to Ullapool was described, refer
ence being made to the further subdivision of the “Pipe-rock” and
the Ghrudaidh Limestones (Group I. of Durness section). None of
the richly fossiliferous zones of Durness is met with along this line,
as they occupy higher horizons. An examination of the fossils

                On the Horizontal Movements of Rocks.                517
 recently obtained by the Geological Survey from the Durness Lime
 stones confirms Salter's conclusions that they are distinctly of an
 American type, the Sutherland quartzites and limestones being
 represented by the Potsdam Sandstones and Calciferous Sand Group
of North America.
    After the deposition of the limestones, the Cambrian and Silurian
 strata were pierced by igneous rocks, mainly in the form of sheets,
 producing important alterations in the sedimentary deposits by con
tact-metamorphism, the quartzites becoming crystalline, and the
limestones being converted into marble.
    When this outburst of volcanic activity had ceased, terrestrial dis
placements ensued on a stupendous scale. By means of powerful
thrusts the Silurian strata were piled on each other, and huge
slices of the old Archaean platform, with the Cambrian and Silurian
 strata resting on it, were driven westwards for miles. With the
 view of illustrating the extraordinary complications produced by
 these movements, a series of horizontal sections was described drawn
 across the line between Eriboll and Ullapool.
    The evidence relating to regional metamorphism was next referred
 to, from which it is obvious that with each successive maximum
 thrust there is a progressive amount of alteration in the displaced
 masses, as the observer passes eastwards to the higher thrust-planes.
 Eventually the Archaean gneiss is so deformed that the Pre-Cam
brian foliation disappears and is replaced by new divisional planes;
 the Cambrian grits and shales are converted into schists; the Silu
 rian quartzites into quartz-schists; the limestones become crystal
 line; the sheets of intrusive felsite, diorite, and granitoid rock pass
 into sericite schist, hornblende-schist, and augen-gneiss respectively.
    These researches furnish a vast amount of evidence in support of
 the theory that regional metamorphism is due to the dynamical and
 chemical effects of mechanical movement acting on crystalline and
 clastic rocks. It is also clear that regional metamorphism need not
be confined to any particular geological period, because in the N.W.
 Highlands, both in Pre-Cambrian time and after the deposition of
 the Durness Limestone (Lower Silurian), crystalline schists and
gneiss were produced on a magnificent scale.

tical area known as the “San Rafael Swell.”          After alluding to
Dutton's suggestion that the phenomenon referred to is analogous to
the action of creeping in deep mines, the author discussed the nature
of such “creeps,” which he defined as the thickening of the parts of
beds from which a load of superincumbent rock has been lifted,
caused by a thinning of the adjoining parts which remained loaded,
some of the substance of the latter having been squeezed out to
furnish the material for the thickening, and suggested that some
of the subsidiary plications found on the flanks of mountains are
caused by the thrusts arising from creeps. He also paralleled the
 fissures in the precipices of the Grand Cañon District with those
 produced in the pillars of coal owing to the strain induced by the
 slight inequality in the yielding of the bed supporting it, and pointed
 out how such fissures would facilitate denudation, giving instances
 recorded by Dutton, and that an appreciable influence might be
 thus produced in all cases of mountain-denudation.
    The author next considered the case of a body of molten rock
 below a considerable mass of solid rock. The pressure upon the
 molten mass would cause movement to take place towards the point
 where the superincumbent weight was least, provided that absolute
 equilibrium did not exist. The overlying rocks being more or less
 plastic, some horizontal movement of the solid rocks at the confines
 of the molten mass, and subjected to its influence, might be looked
 for. Any such yielding would tend to draw apart the solid crust
 resting upon the molten rock, and the ground would open along lines
 of weakness, such as would be produced by the presence of joints,
 the crust in some cases breaking up into larger or smaller fragments.
    When a large mass of molten matter occurred near the surface,
 and a fissure was produced in the way described, the weight of the
 ruptured crust would, if the plastic mass beneath were sufficiently
 liquid, cause the latter to rise in the fissure, producing dykes.
 Attention was called to the fact observed by Dutton that basaltic
 vents frequently occur on the brink of cliffs, but never at their
  bases; also to the existence of dykes having a strike parallel to
  the Colorado River.     In most cases the vertical fissures which
  received the molten rock would begin to open from below, and the
  upper strata might altogether escape rupture.
     The author discussed the case of the Henry Mountains, and
 explained the formation of flat-topped and flat-bottomed dykes
  according to his views. He next called attention to the influence
  which the motions of the rocks had exercised in determining direc
  tions of drainage when fissures left unfilled became occupied by
  streams. He next alluded to river-valleys, the existence of which
  had been accounted for by “antecedent” and “superimposed”
  drainage, and suggested difficulties in the way of accepting the ex
  planations hitherto advanced, and considered them to be instances of
  fissuring produced by movements of the strata due to the pressure
  of a mass of molten or highly plastic rock spreading laterally.
     After treating of the formation of faults with normal hade, which

he referred in some cases to rupture of the solid crust by the spread of
a vast mass of viscous matter lying beneath it (the faults being some
times replaced above by monoclinal folds), he referred in conclusion
to the extent of the horizontal compression of the earth's superficial
crust which is seen to be associated with the elevation of mountain
ranges, and called attention to some evidence that the thickening of
the strata caused thereby would be more considerable and general
than ordinarily supposed.

  May 9.—W. T. Blanford, LL.D., F.R.S., President, in the Chair.
    The following communications were read:—
    1. “The Stockdale Shales.” By J. E. Marr, Esq., M.A., Sec.G.S.,
and Prof. H. A. Nicholson, M.D., D.Sc., F.G.S.
    The Stockdale Shales extend in an E.N.E.—W.S.W. direction
across the main part of the Lake District, parallel with the under
lying Coniston Limestone Series and the overlying Coniston Flags,
with both of which they are conformable. They also occur in the
neighbourhood of Appleby, and in the Sedbergh district. They are
divisible into a lower group of black and dark grey and blue Grap
tolite-bearing shales, interstratified with hard bluish-grey mud
stones containing Trilobites and other organisms, and an upper
group of pale greenish-grey shales, with thin bands of dark Grap
tolitic shales. The lower group (Skelgill Beds) are well seen in the
stream which runs past Skelgill Farm, and enters Windermere near
Low Wood; while the upper group (Browgill Beds) occurs fully
developed in the Long Sleddale Valley, and its beds are very fossili
 ferous in Browgill.
    The authors divide these shales into a series of fossil-zones in the
following order:—

 to run persistently across the district, with the exception of the
 zone of Rastrites maximus, which has only been discovered in the
 Sedbergh area. The thicknesses, lithological characters, and fossil
 contents of these zones were considered, and comparisons made
 between these beds and the corresponding deposits of other areas.
  The whole group attains a thickness of from 250 to 400 feet, of
  which the Skelgill beds usually make up about one quarter.
     The authors correlate the Graptolite-zones with those of the
  Birkhill and Gala groups of Professor Lapworth as follows:–

     The zones of M. convolutus, M. argenteus, and M. fimbriatus con
 tain abundance of M. gregarius, and the zone of Dimorphograptus
 confertus also contains Diplograptus vesiculosus in considerable
 numbers.
     The beds were also compared with the corresponding beds in
 Sweden, Bohemia, Bavaria, &c., and the fossils other than Grapto
 lites were shown to occur elsewhere in strata of Llandovery-Tarannon
 age, from which it was concluded that the Stockdale Shales occupy
 that horizon.
     A fault occurs everywhere between the Middle and Lower Skelgill
 Beds, except perhaps in the Sedbergh district; but it does not seem
 to cut out a great thickness of rock, and the authors gave reasons
 for supposing that it was produced by one set of beds sliding over
 the other along a plane of stratification.
     The beds are found to thicken out in an easterly direction, and
 the possibility of the existence of land in that direction was suggested.
     The authors directed attention to the importance of the Graptoli
 toidea as a means of advancing the comparative study of the strati
 fied deposits of Lower Palaeozoic age.
   A description was given of the following new species and varieties:–
Phacops elegans, Boeck & Sars, var. glaber, Cheirurus bimucronatus,
Murch., var. acanthodes, Cheirurus moroides, Acidaspis erinaceus,
Harpes judex, H. angustus, Ampyw aloniensis, Proëtus brachypygus,
and Atrypa flexuosa.
    2. “On the Eruptive Rocks in the Neighbourhood of Sarn, Caer
narvonshire.” By Alfred Harker, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
   The rocks in question occupy an area about 5% miles long from
north to south and 24 miles broad near the south-western extremity
of Caernarvonshire. They were described by the author under the
following heads:

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            521
    (i.) Granite occupying the northern and north-western part of
the district. The ordinary type is a fairly normal biotite-granite;
but a variety at Meillionydd shows an exceptional structure, the
biotite moulding the other constituents in ophitic fashion. The
granites are intrusive in the Arenig shales.
   (ii.) Gabbro, diorite, &c. in two small patches only. The rock,
originally a gabbro, passes into diorite, the diallage becoming am
phibolized, and the iron-ores disappearing with the production of
granular sphene. Near a bounding-fault this hornblendic rock
becomes locally schistose and gneissic.
   (iii.) Diabase, in the centre, forming the mass of Mynydd-y
Rhiw, and occurring in dykes and sheets near Sarn.
    (iv.) Hornblende-diabase showing various relations between the
augite and hornblende. Besides the conversion of the former
mineral to the latter, a closely similar hornblende has grown as an
original border to augite-nuclei. The “secondary enlargement”
of hornblende-crystals is also exhibited.
   (v.) Hornblende-picrite in several varieties, forming stratiform
banks to a thickness of 250 feet and surmounted by hornblende
diabase.     The two rocks seem to be in close relation to one another,
and to have been injected as laccolites between the Upper Arenig
strata near Penarfynydd and Rhiw.
   (vi.) Dolerite-dykes cutting all the other rocks, and probably
 Post-Carboniferous and Pre-Permian.
   With the exception of the last all these rocks were referred, on such
evidence as is available, to the Bala age.

       GENTLEMEN,
I    AM glad that Prof. Le Conte has called attention to the views of
     American geologists regarding the boundaries of the Appalachian
Chain. When I suggested" that the Appalachians were only
apparently an exception to the general rule, that a great mountain
range consists of a central gneissic core with largely involved rocks
on either flank, I was aware that many American geologists con
sider that the folded sedimentaries making up what Prof. Le Conte
calls the “Appalachians proper,” were originally laid down against
continental land, of which the crystalline rocks to the eastward are
the remnants.
   Though much indebted to the ideas of American geologists, I
confess that this is one I have never been able to assimilate.
   In what respects do these crystalline rocks differ from those of
the Alps and other mountain-ranges in which they form the core?
They are both folded with the sedimentaries, and although denu
   * “The Geological Consequences of the Discovery of a     Level-of-no
Strain in a Cooling Globe” (Phil. Mag. March).

522            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
dation has gone much further in the Appalachians than in the Alps,
Palaeozoic rocks are still found in troughs of the gneiss. The
Silurians that are in contact with the gneiss are, according to
the Sections by H. D. Rogers, the most folded of the sedimentaries,
and as we recede to the westward the sedimentaries take on more
gentle folds.
   Considering that the sedimentaries are estimated to be from
8 to 10 miles thick, and that in mountain-chains the site of the
thickest deposits is also usually the site of greatest disturbance, it
is difficult to realize how the sedimentaries at the thinning-off on
a shore-line could be the most folded.
   When also, on the other hand, we see, as in the Urals—which
in respect of age may be more correctly compared with the
Appalachians,—the same folded crystalline rocks forming the
core, we should have very good grounds indeed before we make
an exception of the Appalachians. A comparison of the little
maps of the Appalachians and of Switzerland in my ‘Origin of
Mountain-Ranges’ will, I think, show that if one side of the gneiss
core of the Alps were denuded, as I imagine has been the case
with the Appalachians, both maps would present very much the
same appearance.
   I offer the idea only as a suggestion. That the sedimentaries
should be unconformable to the Archaeans is what might be ex
pected ; and, I venture to think, is no proof that the gneissic area
of the Appalachians has not been deeply covered with sedimentaries
since denuded.
   At the same time I freely admit that either view may prove
tenable, and shall only be too glad to get further light upon the
subject.                                 Yours &c.,

 ON THE MAGNETISM OF ORGANIC BODIES,            BY S. HENRICHSEN.
   The following summary of the results of a series of researches
on organic compounds belonging to the fatty-acid series is given
by the author:
    1. All bodies as yet examined are diamagnetic.
   2. For each CH, which is introduced into the formula of a body,
the molecular magnetism increases by a value which in the mean
is 1632, taking the molecular magnetism of water at 10.
   3. The molecular magnetisms of isomeric and metameric bodies
are equal if the manner of binding is the same.
   4. The molecular magnetism, however, depends on the mode of
binding of the atoms. A double binding appears to diminish the
molecular magnetism.
   5. The specific magnetism for primary and normal compounds
is greater than for secondary and iso- compounds; in like manner
it is greater for the acids than for the corresponding ethers.
   6. With certain assumptions the atomic magnetisms of the in

      ON THE INSULATING ACTION OF WARIOUS SUBSTANCES IN
            RESPECT OF RADIANT HEAT.            BY H. C. VOGEL.
    The heat from a Locatelli’s lamp fell upon a sensitive thermo
 pile, which was within a metal box with double sides filled with
water, and only opened towards the lamp. In front of this the
 materials to be investigated were placed in the form of plates.
The transmissibility of the various substances was measured by
the increase of temperature which the front solderings experienced
when a stationary condition had been established.
   The screening action of the polished metals was greatest; the
thickness of the metal layer was almost entirely without in
fluence. Glass and ebonite kept heat off the least. The most
perfect protection was afforded by several polished plates separated
from each other by layers of air. The following table gives the
increase of temperature over that of the surrounding air which
was attained with the various materials:—

   Direct radiation gave in the galvanometer 30°. Hence, if on a
system (for instance "pillars which support instruments) slow
changes of temperature are to be transmitted as uniformly as
possible, they must be protected by bad conductors; rapid local
changes of temperature, for instance, such as are caused by the
bodily heat of the observer or by the lamps) are best kept off by
polished metal screens, behind which the air can circulate freely.
   As regards protection against changes in the external tempera
ture, similar rules hold generally, except that in this case the
thickness of the protecting layer comes into play.—Astron. Nach
richt, vol. cxviii. p. 97.—Beiblåtter der Physik, No. 4, 1888.
