        I. Some Points in Electrolysis.     By J. SWINBUBNE*.
       ET a cell be considered, with its external circuit closed
          through a resistance so high that in comparison the
 internal resistance is negligible. The cell discharges, and
 in passing from one pole to the other each coulomb does a
 certain quantity of work proportional to the difference of
 potential of the poles, E. This is really a mere de<U+FB01>nition : if
 difference of electric potential between two points is de<U+FB01>ned
 as what is measured by the work done on unit quantity of
 electricity passing from one to the other, the work done is
(numerically equal to E. The work done on the coulomb
 passing onward through the cell to regain its original position
 is equal to the work done when it passes through the-,external
resistance. This work done on the coulomb may be supplied
at the expense of chemical energy, or there may be local
 cooling somewhere. There may be chemical energy supplied
 at some points, and absorbed at others, and heat may disappear
 at some points, and may be evolved at others, but the
 algebraical sum comes out equal to E. Call the poles of
the cell 12 and n, the positive pole being, for example, pla
tinum and the negative such a metal as zinc, and suppose the
 electrolyte to be one homogeneous <U+FB02>uid.          Part of the work
 done on the coulomb in passing from n to the electrolyte may
 be supplied chemically and may be called EM, another part
 may be supplied by local cooling EM, a standing for chemical

and h for heat.    If there is really local heating this will be
negative. There is no work done by the homogeneous
electrolyte, and the work done on it, in overcoming its re
 sistance. is assumed to be inappreciable. The work done on
the coulomb passing from the electrolyte to the plate forming
the pole p is similarly EM+EPF We have thus
                     E = Epc + Em- + pr + Enh’
 First assume that the chemical work done is not dependent on
the temperature of the cell.      Let it discharge one coulomb
at temperature 91 and do work equal to Eal joules ; E, being
the electromotive force of the cell at that temperature.         Of
this work E,,,,;l+E,,cql is supplied by chemical changes, and
E,;9,+E,,Ml by cooling of the cell. Let the cell now be
heated to the temperature 6, and let it be treated as a
secondary element, and charged with one coulomb. The
work done upon the cell is then E0 ; so
                  E0=En00 + Epc<U+FB01> + Em +Eph9
The chemical work EM and EM is common to both pro
cesses.   If E, were equal to En, the same work would be
done at the two temperatures, or lil,,;,.<,l+E,,;.@l Would be equal

0 Bélt on letting the temperature of the cell fall to 6, again
I___1 (EM0+EPM) is available for external work ; so that we
    0
should have perpetual motion.      E0 must therefore be greater
than E01, so that a margin is allowed for the available Work.
We thus, by simple reasoning, arrive at Helmholtz’s equation,
                     E_EM+E,,+0@~.     an
    The electromotive force needed to do the chemical work
may also vary with the temperature. For instance, if the
chemical changes involved in discharging are brought about
in a calorimeter at different temperatures, di<U+FB02>’erent heats may
be evolved. Suppose EM and E” are less at a high tempera
ture, and suppose at the lower temperature 01 there are
no Peltier effects at the plates, so that, for that temperature
at least, the cell obeys Sir William Thomson’s law. If the
cell could be charged at 0 with a low electromotive force of
Eco, needed to brin the chemical changes about, and then
discharged at 0, wit a higher electromotive force, perpetual
motion would be obtained. There must therefore be an
absorption of electric energy at ‘9 in addition to that needed

                       Points in Electrolysis.                 3
  to produce the chemical work. This must be liberated as
 heat, and some of this must be available; the cell must there
 fore not only have a Peltier effect at the higher temperature,
 but though the chemical work done at that temperature is less,
 the electromotive force must actually be greater. By taking
 a cell whose E. varies with the temperature round the usual
 Carnot cycle, we get
                         dE __ E}, _ dEc
                         a; - 0        0’
 which shows that the temperature-coe<U+FB02>'icient of the cell is not
 affected by the variation of chemical work with the tempera
 ture. The term —dEc/0 is the remains of the extra work
 that had to be allowed in compensating for the reduction of
 the chemical work in the example just taken. Cutting it out
 we get
                                   dE
                             EFaH—é’

                            E =Ec+ 035’
 which is Helmholtz’s equation again. Writing the equation
in full, with separate terms for the poles, we have
                                      dEn      dE,
              En+Ep=EM+Epc+0—d + 0 <U+FB02>y".
The cell may be made up with the plates in separate vessels
with a tube of electrolyte to connect them; and the vessels
can be heated to di<U+FB02>'erent temperatures. As E", E,,., and
G‘s—133 depend on the temperature of their vessel, the last
equation can be split up into two :—
                 E.=E...+0fid£; 01- E...=0‘—€,h—,",
and
                 1<1,=E,,+0‘f,hé" or E,,,=0‘%;
and, as the temperature-coef<U+FB01>cient of each contact can be
found, the Peltier e<U+FB02>'ect at each contact can be obtained
separately.
     The hypothetical cell discussed has only one <U+FB02>uid, and is
reversible. It might be dif<U+FB01>cult to <U+FB01>nd such a cell. If two
<U+FB02>uids are used, their junction can be arranged in a third

4                      Mr. J. Swinburne on some
intermediate vessel, and their Peltier effect, or difference of
potential due to heat-formation, may be found as in the case
of the plates.
     Several workers, for instance M. Bouty and H. Gockel,
have been investigating and measuring the temperature
coe<U+FB02>icient or the Peltier effect directly.
     Prof. J. Willard Gibbs has, of course, discussed the subject.
 In a letter to Dr. Lodge " he took a theoretical case in which
 this cell could be heated to the temperature of dissociation.
 He has written a second letter going more fully into the
 subject 1-.
      This leads at once among the various con<U+FB02>icting views of
 electrolysis. One view, which seems tenable, is that electro
 lysis is always a case of double decomposition : that there is
 really a change. According to orthodox chemistry, if 2HCl
 is electrolysed H2 and C1, are obtained, and not 2H and 201.
 The hydrogen and chlorine form combinations with themselves.
 Dissociation does not always split a compound in the same
 way as electrolysis, and the results of it are often “ free
 atoms.”       It might be urged that in such a case as the electro
 lysis of NH4Cl free atoms of NH4 cannot exist, so NH», and
 HCl are produced by a sort of secondary action.
     The cells discussed have been assumed to be reversible;
 and some question may arise as to what the chemical work
 means. For instance, in a Daniell cell are we to take such
 data as Zn,0;85,430 and Cu,0=37,1601 from a convenient
 treatise on Thermochemistry, and to consider that the conver
 sion into sulphate and other actions in the cell are secondary?
 It is to be regretted that writers on Thermochemistry seldom
 give their data so that their meaning is clear.          Zn,O, for
 instance, often-means that metallic zinc is burned in gaseous
 oxy en. Allowance must then be made for the physical states
 of t e components before, and of the products after the
 combination.
      Returning to the reversible cell, however, before discharging
 a coulomb there are certain quantities of certain substances in
 certain physical and chemical conditions. After the discharge
 certain chemical and physical changes have taken place.
 Suppose any one of these is a secondary, or non-adjuvant
 action. For instance, suppose in discharging a Daniell cell
 that the conversion of zinc into oxide is a primary action, and
 the conversion of zinc oxide into zinc sulphate secondary or

 non-adjuvant.      Some heat will be evolved, and the change
 from oxide to sulphate will not appear as external electrical
 work.     On charging again there is only enough electromotive
 force at that contact to cope with the attraction of zinc for
 oxygen and not with the greater attraction for S04.            The
 result is that the cell is not reversible. Any secondary or non
 adjuvant action in the cell thus means non-reversibility. We
 thus have to deal not merely with Zn,SO4 or ZnO,SOsaq, and
 so on, but in a reversible cell, like a Daniel], we have to
 consider the attraction of Zn for S04 ; the physical change of
 Zn from a solid to a liquid state, which is      enerally included
 in the ‘_‘ heat of combination,” as given; t e solution of the
 ZnSO4; and perhaps such small matters as change of volume
 of the cell. The copper salts must be dealt with similarly.
 Even if the heat of solution were non-adjuvant' the cell would
not be reversible.
    Since 1883 I believe I have been alone in holding that not
only is lead sulphate formed on both plates of a secondary
battery, as shown by Dr. Gladstone and Mr. Tribe in 1882,
but that its formation is the cause of the action of the cell,
and not a secondary reaction at all.        That is to say, there is
no intermediate formation of PbO. To <U+FB01>nd out E0 of a cell
we must open a sort of book. On one side put the heat of
formation of every compound formed on discharge, and on the
other of every compound broken up on discharge ; the balance,
including the physical changes, giving EC. For instance, in
a storage cell we credit the formation of PbSO4 on the spongy
plate, includin , of course, the change of the S04 into the solid
state, and on t e peroxide plate we again credit PbSO4. Two
equivalents of H20 are also credited.           Two equivalents of
H2304+ Aq are debited, also two equivalents of H2804,
and one equivalent of Pb02, allowing for the 02 becoming
liquid.
   It has been repeatedly urged that as the formation of
PbSO4 takes place on both plates it must cancel out. As in
the case of a Daniell cell we have to deal with the difference
between the heat of formation of two sulphates, it is assumed we
must also deal with differences in a secondary battery. A
little consideration will show, however, that the cases are
different.    In a discharging Daniel] sulphate of zinc is formed
and sulphate of copper is decomposed, so one goes on the
credit side, the other on the debit. In a secondary battery
sulphate is formed on both plates on discharge, and is there~
fore credited twice.
    The doctrine of the Conservation of Energy also teaches us
that electrolytic or nascent oxygen and hydrogen, which many

 6                   Mr. J. Swinburne on some
 chemists regard as such valuable reagents, do not exist. What
 is the evidence in favour of the existence of nascent hydrogen?
 If some such metal as magnesium, or sodium amalgam, is put
 in dilute acid, bubbles come off. Many other metals act simi
 larly. , If such a compound as persulphate of iron is put in, too, ‘
it is reduced to proto-sulphate. From frequently observing
 eEervescence when reduction is effected, it is easy to assume
 the o<U+FB02>'ervescence is the cause of the reduction. The theory is
 that the energy supplied <U+FB01>rst produces hydrogen. A power
 ful attraction has just been overcome, and has been satis<U+FB01>ed
 neither by combination with more hydrogen nor otherwise.
 The hydrogen then seizes on the persalt of iron, and takes
 away some of the acid radical, forming free acid, which in its
 turn acts on the oxide of the metal. This action is secondary,
 and may be supposed to evolve heat. There is thus waste of
.heat, arid the cell is irreversible. A better explanation would
 be, that the metal can dissolve if it either reduces the persalt or
 evolves hydrogen. The reduction of the persalt needs less
 energy, so that takes place. When there is no reducible salt
 available, hydrogen is evolved ; and as it has to be expanded
 into the gaseous form, a good deal of work has to be done on
 it. Evolution of hydrogen and reduction of the salt are thus
 alternate, not consecutive results. Similarly in an engine-—
 the steam either works the engine or comes out at the safety
 valve; it does not begin to lift the safety-valve, and then
 change its mind and work the engine in a nascent state. It
 must he remembered that the term oxidize has come to denote
 many other things than adding oxygen. For instance, adding
 any electronegative radical is called oxidizing. If sulphur
 had been as common as oxygen, no doubt we should always
 talk of sulphurizing. The use of the term“ oxidize” has
 also led to the tacit assumption that in electrolysis the water
 is electrolysed and the other results are secondary actions of
 electrolytic oxygen and hydrogen.          If there were such a
 thing as nascent hydrogen, putting a depolarizer, such as
 nitric acid, round the carbon plate of a Bunsen cell would not
 increase its electromotive force ; it would merely make it heat
 more on discharge.
     So far the cells considered have been reversible. It does
 not follow that a cell is always reversible, but, if not, there is
 at least one non-adjuvant action. As a good example of non
 reversibility, aluminium and its solutions may be taken.
 Aluminium does not dissolve in dilute nitric or sulphuric
 acid, yet it cannot be deposited electrically from any
 known solution.     Aluminium and caran in nitric acid give
 only a small fraction of a volt.

                     Points in Electrolysis.                    7
   From the de<U+FB01>nition of electromotive force adopted in this
paper, the “seat of the electromotive force” is in the cell
and not between the positive and negative metals outside.
Yet the electrometer behaves as if there were a contact elec
tromotive force. Dr. Lodge has attempted to explain this in
accordance with the “chemical theory.” He argues that
when, for instance, zinc is exposed to the air, the oxygen
either begins to combine with it, or actually combines with it,
the particles of oxygen giving up their charge to the zinc on
combining.     This produces a difference of potential which
increases till the oxygen’s attraction for the zinc is counter
balanced by it. There is thus an electromotive force set up.
Air being an insulator, the circuit is not completed. If the
tendency to combine with oxygen can produce an electric
stress which prevents combination, actual combination must
either charge the metal, if insulated, or produce a current, if a
path is allowed.    If a clean piece of sodium is put on an
insulating stand it goes on oxidizing, the amount of oxide
formed corresponding to an enormous number of coulombs.
Where do they go to? If the metal charges electrostatically,
it must soon be millions and millions of volts below the
potential of the air, and must discharge disruptively. More—
over, the millions of volts are far more than equivalent to
Na2,O.    Dr. Lodge assumes that a single element is an
electrolyte, whereas a cell can only discharge by double dc
composition. That is to say, to produce such an effect the metal
must tear the oxygen from a combination, the other radical
combining with another less electropositive metal, or remov
ing an electronegative radical from it. It might be argued
that zinc and copper plates in chlorine water will give a
current, and chlorine is a single radical like oxygen. But
immediately the plates are inserted the chlorine combines
directlyr with both metals, without giving any current. A
three-fluid battery is thus produced. The zinc is in a solution
of zinc chloride, and the copper in copper chloride, and the
intermediate liquid is chlorine water.       The cell then dis_
 charges like a Daniell.
    Though the oxygen form of the corrosion theory of contact
 electromotive force may not hold, it is quite possible that the
 Volta effect may be produced by thin <U+FB01>lms of water. Water
is even more difficult to get rid of than oxygen, and might
 easily cause the electrometer readings. It must be remem
 bered in connexion with this, that water must be present to
 enable even a combination of 'a metal with chlorine to take
 place. It is well known that dry chlorine will not attack a
 dry metal._ Even sodium may be left in contact with chlorine.

  8                On some Points in Electrolysis.
     Even if the Volta effect is due to the presence of traces of
  an electrolyte, such as water, and not to a non-electrolytic
  combination with free oxygen, the “seat of the electromotive
  force ” still depends on a mere de<U+FB01>nition. The term “ electro
  motive force ” is continually used in two senses. It is some
   times used to denote the di<U+FB02>'erence between the potentials of two
   points, and sometimes to denote the rate of fall of potential.
   Maxwell gives it the latter de<U+FB01>nition formally, but frequently
   writes of the electromotive force when he means the line
  integral of the electromotive force, that is to say the difference
   of potential. In connexion with cells, “ electromotive force ”
  is always used to mean di<U+FB01>'erence of potential, so the stricter
  meaning, rate of fall of potential, may be disregarded just now.
  If we de<U+FB01>ne the difference of potential between two points as
  proportional to the work done on a unit quantity of electricity
  moving from one point to the other, we have a clear statement
  of what we mean. But if we attempt to make the measure
  ment, we <U+FB01>nd the unit quantity of electricity must have some
  carrier ; and when we use an electrometer, we do not measure
  the work done on a unit quantity of electricity moving from
  one point to the other; we really measure the work done
 when a particular conductor is used as carrier. It is not
 necessary to consider any part of the circuit as the seat of the
 electromotive force. There is a circuit, and the potential is
 gyclic. Similar cases occur in other branches of electricity.
    or instance, a “unipolar” dynamo may be made up of a
 rotating magnet with a stationary circuit. If the resistance of        .
 the internal circuit is negligible in comparison with that of the
                                                                        -
 external, the whole expenditure of power is in the external            _,
 circuit, and the fall of potential over the external resistance is
 sensibly the whole potential or electromotive force of the          -.._‘
                                                                       -
machine. There is, however, no way of <U+FB01>nding the seat of
this electromotive force. If the rotating magnet is sup
posed to carry “lines of induction ” round with it, they cut
the external circuit and produce electromotive force there,
so that becomes the seat of the electromotive force. 1f the
lines of induction are taken as stationary, the rotating part of
the circuit cuts them and becomes the seat of the electromotive
force.    The effects on the external resistance are the same in
both cases. If it is a voltmeter the readings are the same,
and they remain so it' the lines of induction rotate faster or
slower than the magnet, or in the opposite direction.       If the
voltmeter is replaced by an electrometer, it is still impossible
to say where the seat of the electromotive force is. The
readings would be the same whether the lines of induction
were stationary. or revolved and cut the leads to the elec-

trometer, 0r revolved and passed through the electro
meter as if it were a zigzag gateway, without cutting the
metallic part of the circuit anywhere. 1f the electrometer is
removed and a proof-plate is used, by touching one terminal
with it and measuring the work done when it moves to the
 other, the result is the same. If the lines are stationary, the
proof-plate is charged by one terminal and repelled by it and
attracted by the other.      If the lines rotate, the proof-plate is
urged forward by the lines of induction cutting it at right
angles to its path.      The reading is the same in both cases.
The lines of induction are a mere convention, and there is no
way of <U+FB01>nding the seat of the electromotive force. All that
can be said is that it is cyclic, and that the difference of
potential of any two parts ot'the circuit of the same metal can
be measured. In some cases the seat where power is spent
can be determined, and in others it cannot.
    Similarly in the cell, the seat of expenditure of power can
sometimes be told, as when there is a resistance in circuit;
sometimes it cannot, as when the cell works a unipolar, or, by
extension, any other motor. The difference of potential be
tween any two points of the same material can be measured,
but all that can be said is that the electromotive force of the
whole circuit is cyclic.

THERE is a general tendency at present among elec
      tricians to dispense as much as possible with the “Vector
Potential,” but I believe that many of the dif<U+FB01>culties which
have led to the restriction of its use may be removed. At
any rate there seems room for the following renewed dis
cussion of some well-known equations.
   I was led to the investigation through an attempt to <U+FB01>nd
the magnetic effects of currents distributed through space in
such a way that the lines of <U+FB02>ow should be identical in form
to the lines of induction in certain simple magnetic systems.
We might, for instance, Wish to <U+FB01>nd the components of mag
netic force which are produced by currents in an unlimited
homogeneous conductor, the electrical potential at every
point being the same as the magnetic potential due to a simple
magnetic shell.      The case could be realized by a conductor in

which a constant electromotive force is distributed over a
<U+FB01>nite surface.
   Any one attempting the solution of such a roblem would
probably be led into the same dif<U+FB01>culties which encountered,
and although he would doubtless soon get over them, the
following discussion may save him some trouble.
    I begin by writing down the well-known equations refer
ring to the Vector Potential in Maxwell’s form, taking in the
<U+FB01>rst place the magnetic permeability as constant.

     This conclusion is not, however, justi<U+FB01>ed. The second
 terms on the right-hand side of equations (5) disappear
  altogether from equations               If therefore F,’ G’, H’ are
  solutions of (1), the value of x is not restricted to that given

in (4.), but is arbitrary.     If, on the other hand, F’,G’, H' are
not solutions of (1), they cannot be converted into solutions
by the terms involving x.
   That F, G, H, as given in (5), do not necessarily satisfy (1)
may be shown as follows. Writing F,, G1, H1 instead of
F, G, H on the left-hand side of (5), we obtain from these
equations,

it is not correct to draw the conclusion that F, is a solution

the quantities F, G, H. The correct conclusion is that

   We may treat equation (5) in a different way, and deduce
from them
         dF1     (1G1     dH1 _ dF’        (Ki’      dH’
         %        dg/ + T. -a.; my +75”
If, then, F1, G1, H, were equal to F, G, H, as Maxwell puts
them, it would follow that

 and this would show that F’, G’, H’ are solutions of (1)
 without the addition of the terms involving x.
    It may be shown that in all legitimate cases equation (8) is
 satis<U+FB01>ed ; but before proceeding to discuss the conditiOns on
 which this depends, 1 shall treat of a special case which will
 bring out clearly the points to which I wish to draw attention.

The triple integral vanishes, and the surface integral has to
be taken over the boundary of the region which is considered.

equation has to be taken over this in<U+FB01>nitely small sphere and
will be <U+FB01>nite.    It is owing to this fact that the condition

    This may perhaps be more clearly seen in another way.
Maxwell’s equations fall to the ground unless the currents

    In this case the currents are completed at the origin by a
<U+FB02>ow parallel to the axis of X.
    As regards the surface conditions to be satis<U+FB01>ed bv the
vector potential, there seems no dif<U+FB01>culty when the magnetic
permeability is uniform throughout space, but for the surfaces
of two media having a different permeability special conside
rations seem necessary. I am not aware that this point has
been investigated.
    If the medium through which the currents <U+FB02>ow is subject
to magnetic polarization, we may write for the vector potential
at the point z, y, z,

    A, B, C are the components of magnetization of the medium.
If these are due to the distribution of currents alone, we have

Maxwell’s expression cannot be made to satisfy the surface

   In order to determine the discontinuities of the differential

two media, and let l, m, n be the direction-cosines of the
normal to the surface drawn towards the inside of the medium

   Returning for a moment to the investigation which has led
to equations (10), we may write the vector potential due to a
conduction current 4w through a linear element ds at the
origin, the currents being completed by displacement cur
rents :—

                                —         d_z Tdé'.
  As far as the magnetic forces are concerned, the terms in
volving the di<U+FB02>'erential coef<U+FB01>cients disappear, and we might
put equally well

neglected the displacement currents altogether: a well
known result.

components of the currents inside may be unknown, though
of course they are determined by the surface values.
III. The Theory 0 Dissociation into Ions, and its Consequences.
     By SPENCER      MFBEVILLE PICKERLNG, M.A., F.R.S.*
THE supporters of the present physical theory of solution
       holdt at the majority of salts, acids, and bases, when
dissolved in a large excess of water, are entirely resolved into
their component ions. That the facts of the case warrant such
      Communicated by the Physical Society : read March 20, 1891.

             Dissociation into Ions, and its Consequences.                  21
  a conclusion I have already disputed (Phil. Mag. vol. xxix.
  p. 490, and ‘Nature,’ xlii. p. 626); but theoretical objections of
  a fundamental character can, I believe, be raised against this
  dissociation theory, and, thou h I have alread alluded to
 these, they have not yet been ully discussed. litany of the
 questions which are asked in the following pages can no doubt
 be answered satisfactorily, but as far as I am aware this has not
 yet been done, and it is certainly incumbent on the supporters
 of the theory to give physicists and chemists a clear concep
 tion of what their theory involves.
     When hydrochloricpacid gas, for instance, is dissolved in
 water, the molecules, which were intact to start with, become
 resolved into their ions, so that each of these acts as if it were
 a separate unit. This I believe is, according to the theory, the
 total and only change which occurs : the water remains in the
 same state in which it was to start with. The resolution of
 HCl into H and 01 atoms has been held of necessity to involve
 an absorption of heat, an absorption considerably in excess of
 that which we know occurs when it is resolved into hydrogen
 and chlorine molecules ; and, whether the ions are identical
 with free atoms or not, we have the positive statement of
 Arrhenius, the originator of the present dissociation theory,
 that the resolution of a body such as hydrochloric acid into its
 ions absorbs heat‘. If then this, which is the only change,
 absorbs heat, whence comes the 17,300 cal. which are, as a
 matter of fact, evolved during dissolution?
     In the communication to which reference has been made,
 Arrhenius does not consider the thermal results of dissolution,
 and a subsequent consideration of these seems to have led
 some of the supporters of the theory to hold a view diametri
 cally opposed to that just quoted. They now hold, I believe,
 that the decom osition of molecules into their ions evolves
 heat ; that that eat, which they still admit must be absorbed
 by the decomposition of the molecules into ordinary atoms, is
more than counterbalanced by the combination of the atoms
 with electric charges. This change of front must rather be
    * Arrhenius, Bitray till Kongl. Svemka Vetemkapa-Akademiem Hand
lingar, Stockholm, 1883-4. Out of several sentences I may quote the
following italicised passage :—“ La transformation de l’état inactif en l‘état
 actif d’nn hydrate (faible) est accompagnée par une absorption de
chaleur;” and the heat absorbed in the transformation is named
 “chaleur d’activité.” The terms used in the above must be translated
into the more modern language of the dissociationists, thus : inactive =
 undissociated; active=dissociated into ions; hydrate=any hydro en
com ound, such as an acid or base; feeble=not much dissociated. bee

 22              Mr. S. U. Pickering 0n the Theory of
 inferred indirectly from the writings of dissociationists than
 from any de<U+FB01>nite retraction which they have published ; nor
 does it appear to have been followed by all the supporters of
 the theory, for the explanation given by Arrhenius of the
 constancy of the heat evolved on neutralizing acids with bases
 is that it is in all cases due to the combination of the ions H
 and OH to form H20, and this explanation was quoted as
 recently as September last (B. A. meeting) by Shaw as being
 one of the strongest arguments in favour of the theory. It
 ma      also be remarked that up to Jul 1889 Ostwald seems
 to ave held both views, and to have adbpted either just as the
 exigencies of the case suggested : he explains the normal
 heat of neutralization as being due to the heat evolved in the
 formation of a molecule from its ions (‘Outlines of General
 Chemistry,’ 1890, p. 368), and the abnormal heat of neutraliza
‘tion as, being due ‘to heat evolved in the formation of ions
from a' molecule, though not, of course, the same molecule as
"in the previou's'case (p. 369).
     The <U+FB01>rst point, therefore, on which the dissociationists
 should give us de<U+FB01>nite information is, whether the dissociation
 of a molecule into ions is supposed to evolve or absorb heat.
     Presupposing that the answer will be that heat is evolved
 (at an rate in cases similar to that of hydrochloric acid),
 their t eory cannot be said to he primd facie inconsistent with
 the conservation of energy ; but other very serious dif<U+FB01>culties
 arise which call for explanation.
     The idea of heat being evolved by the combination of a
 charge with an atom involves the conception that the charge
 is originally independent of the atom: indeed the main idea
 of the theory seems to lie in the distinction between an ion, or
 charged atom, and an ordinary or uncharged at0m*. We
 may ask, therefore, whence come these charges?                       All the
 ordinary means by which bodies become charged seem to
 be absent in the present case. No external energy has been
 expended, no friction can be supposed to exist except such as
 might result indirectly from an attraction between the water
 and the acid ; but even if the existence of such an attraction
 were admitted, it could never cause su<U+FB01>icient friction to over
      C'f. Ostwald, loc. cit, p. 275 :—-“ \Vhat actually exists in the solution
is single potassium atoms with enormous electrical charges.         We do not
know what those charges are in reality, but this we do know, that the
chemical properties of substances are greatly altered by electrical charges.
. . . As soon as the potassium atoms in solution lose their charge, as they
do, for example, when led by an electric current to a platinum wire, where
they can give up their electricity, potassium with its ordinary properties
is at once produced, as is seen in its ability to decompose water with
evolution of hydrogen.”                    '

           Dissociation into Ions, and its Consequences.         23
 come the very attraction which is the original cause of it, to
 say nothing of the still stronger attraction which holds the
 atoms together: induction cannot apply, as both water and
 acid are supposed to be uncharged to start with, and even if
 there were a contact difference of' potential between these two
 substances, it would not result in communicating both the +
 and—charges to one only of the bodies brought into contact,—
the acid.                                                    ,     .
    In the second place, how can we imagine that an electric
charge, which we must at present regard as an affection of
matter, can combine with matter to produce heat and itself
remain in statu quo? Such a view islittle less than endowing
the charges with some of the exclusive properties of matter,
and calling this new matter into existence just when and
where may be most convenient to the theory.
   In the third place, how can it be maintained that the
positive electri<U+FB01>cation of the hydrogen, and the negative
electri<U+FB01>cation of' the chlorine, would dissolve the union between
them? Accordin to all our experience of electricity, such
electri<U+FB01>cation wou d make them cling together all the more
<U+FB01>rmly. Further, if these so-called + and — charges repel
each other, why are they attracted by the — and + charges
respectively on electrodes during electrolysis? or why, again,
do the similarly charged atoms not attract each other (as
dissimilarl charged ones are supposed to repel each other)
and form ydrogen and chlorine molecules?
   That a molecule, when decomposed by some force superior
to the attraction of' its constituent atoms, gives rise to free
atoms which are possessed of a certain amount of free energy,
and that this free energy, which we call chemical affinity,
may really be of the nature of an electric charge,has received the
support of the greatest chemists and physicists whom Science
has known ; but the present theory seems to have nothing in
commonwith such aview—indeed, it seems to be directly opposed
to it. On the 01d theory the atoms when separated have more
free energy than when combined, on the new theory they have
less: on the old, the electric charges are the consequence of
decomposition by some superior force, and form an integral
part of the stuff resulting from the decomposition; on the new,
they are the cause of this decomposition and are something
outside and independent of the matter itself. The old theory
attributes chemical af<U+FB01>nity and combination to the existence
of these charges ; the new theory considers the charges to be
antagonistic to chemical af<U+FB01>nity, and to be the cause of
chemical decomposition.
   The view has been suggested, I believe, that the supposed

24            Mr. S. U. Pickering 0n the Theory of
dissociated atoms, though no longer held together by chemical
attraction, may be still held together by the electrical attraction
of their charges. This seems to be but an attempt to over
come a dif<U+FB01>culty by changing a name, and so far from really
diminishing the dif<U+FB01>culty, it would appear only to increase it :
for heat has been evolved, and, therefore, the state of com
bination is more intimate than it was before dissolution, so
that the matter must be held more <U+FB01>rmly together by these
electrical charges than it was by its chemical af<U+FB01>nity: how
does this help the statement that they are less <U+FB01>rmly united
now—so much less <U+FB01>rmly according to the theory, that they
act as independent units? The dif<U+FB01>culties as to the origin of
the charges and the antagonism of chemical and electrical
attraction are, moreover, not removed by this method of ex
pressing the theory.
   Another view, again, was suggested at the recent meeting
of the British Association : that, instead of regarding the
ions as atoms with electric charges, they might be regarded
as allotropic modi<U+FB01>cations of the atoms themselves. This
appears to me to be but hypothecating a new form of matter
to satisfy a theory which is inconsistent with known matter,
and, inasmuch as atoms of the same substance cannot differ
from each other except by possessing different quantities of
energy, it practically amounts to the conjuring away a stock
of energy that the theory may not be said to be contradicted
by the principle of the conservation of energy. But surely
such a process is in reality as much a violation of this principle
 as writing 2:4 Would be. The energy equation will not
 equate, so the excess of energy on the one side is boldly struck
 off by imagining a new form of energyless atom, just as on
 the electric-charge theory the same is done by saying that
 the su erabundant energy has been expended in combining
 with charges which have come from nowhere.
    Whereas the potential energy of the ions of a substance
 such as hydrochloric acid must be regarded as less than that
 of the molecules when gaseous, it would appear that it must
 be greater than that of the molecules when solid—at any rate
 in such cases where the solid dissolves with an absorption of
 heat. Thus, in the case of potassium chloride, 74'5 grams of
 the salt dissolve in water at 0° with an absorption of 5184 cal.
 Let P and K represent the potential and kinetic energy of the
 solid (KCl) and of the ions (K + Cl) respectively, then
     P(KOl) +K(K01) =P(K + 01) + K(K + 01) ——5284 cal.
    The kinetic energy of the solid, K(KCl), is possibly an un
 known quantity, but it is certainly a positive quantity; the

           Dissociation into Ions, and its Consequences.        25
kinetic energy of the dissolved substance, K(K+Cl), can,
according to the osmotic-pressure theory, be calculated. With
a monatomic gas no intramolecular work is possible, and
therefore the pressure caused by that gas is a measure of its
total kinetic energy (cf. Ostwald, loc. cit. p. 76) ; the pressure
of each ion is in this case, ex. hyp., the same as that which an
ordinary molecule produces, and the pressure-producing energy
of a gram-molecular proportion of such a gas is 34,008,000,000
ergs, or 819 cal., so that
                     K(K+ 01) =2 x 819 cal.,
        and P(K01)= P(K + 01) -3646 cal.-K(KOI);
thus the otential energy of the ions must be considerably
greater tffan that of the solid molecule.
   The same substance might have been taken as an instance
of a gas dissolving with evolution of heat and a solid with
absorption of heat; and in such a case the potential energy
of the substance in solution must be intermediate between
that of the gaseous and solid molecules. It is certainly
dif<U+FB01>cult to imagine that this substance can consist of uncom
bined atoms.
   But a still greater dif<U+FB01>culty arises in some cases : a solution
of calcium nitrate, for instance, absorbs heat on dilution, and,
as the only change produced by diluting an already dilute
solution is, according to the theory, to dissociate into ions
some of the molecules still remaining intact, and as these mole
cules are present in the uncombined and gaseous condition, it
follows that the dissociation of gaseous calcium nitrate mole
cules must absorb heat; therefore the gaseous salt onvbeing
dissolved in excess of water must absorb heat, the liquid salt
would absorb more than the gas (by an amount equivalent to
the heat of vaporization of this salt), and still more would be
absorbed by the solid ; yet direct experiment shows that this
last, instead of giving a large absorption, actually evolves 4000
cal. when it is dissolved.
   The conception that salts &c. in solution are entirely de
composed into ions has been regarded asa development of the
theory of Clausius that a few free ions exist at any given moment
in a mass of solution. But these two views appear to me to
be radically different. Clausius’s conception (Phil. Mag. 1858,
vol. xv. p. 100) was of a two-fold nature. (1) That the molecules
in any <U+FB02>uid, being at different temperatures at different times,
owing to the impacts to which they have been subjected, some
 of them may occasionally be so hot as to be above their dis
sociation temperature, and that some temporarily free atoms
 would therefore be present. (2) That two similar molecules

 MR and M'R' might collide under such circumstances that M'
 might come nearer to R than M was, and, consequently, M'R
 would be the result ; whether, however, M and R' would <U+FB01>nd
 themselves in such close proximity that they would instantly
 combine together, or whether they might remain for a time
 actually free, is a question which our ignorance of the distances
 and forces concerned do not allow us to settle. Williamson’s
 theory (Phil. Mag.) was practically identical with Clausius’s
 second proposition—continual interchange of radicals, but
 not necessarily the presence of free atoms.    Clausius’s theory
 was proposed to account for the facts of Electrolysis, William
 son’s to account for Chemical facts. Nothing which has come
to light since that time seems to have shaken the idea of a
continual interchange of atoms in the molecules of a liquid;
there seem, however, to be decided objections to the concep
tion of free atoms being present. Whether it is probable that
in a liquid at ordinary temperatures there can be any mole
cules as hot as the dissociation temperature (which is probably
1000° to 20000) or not, is a matter of opinion; but if any
free atoms are present the chances of their meeting atoms
of the same nature would be equal to those of their meeting
atoms of the opposite nature: with the former they would
combine just as they do with the latter, and the result would
be that hydrogen and chlorine gas would be formed, and the
acid would gradually become entirely decomposed: nor can
it be argued that the similar charges on the free atoms of the
same substance would prevent these combining, for in the
analogous case of hydriodic acid we know as a fact that free
iodine is produced when the acid is heated to its dissociation
temperature.

believe, are that although an             of <U+FB01>nite magnitude is
required to produce sensible electrolysis, i. e. the liberation of
gas, &c. in recognizable quantities, any electromotive force
will produce results indicative of electrolysis, these results
being a gradual leakage of electricity, and a reverse or
polarization current on removing the battery. The leakage
may be explained by the electrolysis of those molecules which
happen to be at a temperature above that of the average
molecule, and decomposable by a lower                 than is the
average molecule, or else by the action of the            on those
dissimilar atoms which at the moment when they lose their
original partners <U+FB01>nd themselves comparatively very far apart
from each other (M and R' in the case above cited). As to

the polarization current I venture, though with considerable
di<U+FB01>idence, to ask whether it really is evidence of actual elec
trolysis. It is explained by the statement that a coating of
liberated ions is formed on the electrode, and that these can
not be discharged so as to become ordinary atoms till the
potential of the electrode attains a certain value, they conse
quently remain there and cause a reverse current. But
might not such a current be caused by a similar coating of
simple but undecoinposed molecules; such molecules are, I
believe, not fully saturated compounds, but still possess a
certain amount of residual af<U+FB01>nity, or, on the older electro
chemical theory, a certain amount of unnentralized charge;
these would be attracted to the electrodes and would present
their + and — ends to the — and + electrodes respectively:
a charge would thus be retained on the electrodes after the
battery was disconnected, and this charge would cause a
reverse current when the two electrodes were connected
together. The action in fact would be similar to that in a
condenser. Such an explanation may obviate objections
which can, perhaps, be urged against the idea of a coating of
ions, for it seems diiiicult to see why a certain E.M.F. should
be reached before the atoms can discharge themselves, unless
we imagine a de<U+FB01>nite attraction between an atom and its
charge, or why the E.M.F. required to effect this discharge
should not always be the same whenever the same element is
liberated; it also obviates the necessit of regarding an ion
as possessing any form of charge which, a free atom does not.
   Whatever be the value of these sug estions, and of the
objections raised against that part of (J ausius’s conception
which supposes the presence of afew free atoms in a liquid owing
to the accidental superheating of some of the molecules, it
must be home in mind that this _view is totally distinct from
the modern dissociation theory, that all the molecules are dis
sociated, and that too not by heat but by their af<U+FB01>nity for
electrical charges of incredible origin, and possessing hitherto
unknown characteristics.
 IV. On Changes of Voltaic Energy of Alloys during Fusion.
                   By Dr. G. GORE, F.R.S.*
M J. REGNAULD has observed that liquid gallium is
      o electropositive to solid gallium in a neutral solution
of gallons sulphate (Comptes Rendus Acad. Sci. June 10,
1878 ; ‘ Chemical News,’ vol. xxxviii. p. 33). He states that
                  “ Communicated by the Author.

 28                 Dr. G. Gore on Changes of
this “ categorical experiment renders manifest, in a very simple
 case, the in<U+FB02>uence exercised by the heat of constitution upon
the energy of its chemical properties ;” and that “the available
chemical work which a body possesses depends not only
upon the speci<U+FB01>c nature of the atoms, but also upon the
total of calories which its maintenance in the physical state
determines.”
   The object in making the following experiments was to
ascertain whether, consistently with the above observation, the
change of physical state of an alloy from solid to liquid by
fusion, and the large absorption of heat which then occurs, is
usually attended by a correspondingly large increase of voltaic
electromotive force, and whether the converse e<U+FB02>'ect occurs
during solidi<U+FB01>cation. The apparatus employed in the experi
ments is shown by the annexed sketch.                      ‘
   A is a glass cup, B a tobacco-pipe with a wide bowl, and C a
bent glass syphon-tube provided with a tap. A bar of the
alloy was placed vertically in A, and a second portion of the
alloy was melted in the bowl and some distance up the stem
of the pipe B, so as to exclude the production of thermo
electric currents at the junction with the connecting wire,
and then allowed to solidify and cool.
  'The electrolyte, at atmospheric temperature, was poured
into A and B, and a portion raised by suction into C so as to
connect the portions in A and B. The terminals of the
portions of alloy were connected by iron wires with a suitable
astatic galvanometer of 100 ohms resistance, and the needles
allowed to settle at zero. Heat was then gradually applied
by means of a small <U+FB02>ame to the bowl of B until the alloy in
it melted, and the temperature of the electrolyte was raised
nearly to the boiling-point ; the <U+FB02>ame was then removed.
The amounts of de<U+FB02>exion of the needles of the galvanometer
at de<U+FB01>nite intervals of time, during the heating and cooling,
and especially at the fusing and solidifying points, were care
fully observed and recorded.

             Voltaic Energy of Alloys during Fusion.       '   29
    Three electrolytes were used, viz. one composed of 1 part
by weight of absolute h drochloric acid in 100 of water; a
second, of 1 part of ch oride of sodium and 100 of water;
and a nearly saturated solution of that salt.
    In the following experiments: 1st, on applying heat, the
heated portion of the alloy became gradually electropositive
to the cold portion up to its fusion-point ; and, 2nd, a more or
less sudden increase of electromotive force occurred during
the further heating of the alloy and the electrolyte up to the
boiling-point of the latter, and this sudden increase appeared
to coincide in point of time with the melting of the alloy, but
this could not be accurately determined, especially with the
amalgams in experiments No. 4, 5, and 6, because the fusion
point was not suf<U+FB01>ciently sudden or distinct.        Substantially
the reverse of these phenomena happened after removing the
<U+FB02>ame, during the processes of evolving latent heat and subse
quent cooling. A partial exception to the phenomenon of
 sudden increase of electromotive force during the act of
 fusion took place with cadmium amalgam in experiment N0. 7.
    Experiment 1. Fusible alloy of bismuth 70 parts, lead 40,
 tin 20, and cadmium 15. Melting at about 660 O. In the dilute
 acid at 16° C. The amount of sudden effect by gradual
 heating in this case was quite large, and the galvanometer
de<U+FB01>exion increased from 20° to 60°. Experiment 2. The
 same alloy in the weak solution of sodium chloride at about
 16° C. The amount of sudden increase of current by gradual
 heating was again large.     Experiment 3. An alloy of bismuth
 8 parts, lead 8 parts, and tin 3.      Melting at about 107° C.
 In the concentrated solution of sodium chloride. The sudden
 increase of current by gradual heating was considerable.
     As in each of these instances there was a more or less sudden
 change of physical state of the alloy, but no such change of the
 electrolyte, the coincident rapid increase of electromotive force
 must have been due to the alloy and not to the electrolyte ;
 it could not have been due to a sudden rise of temperature,
 because that of both substances must have remained nearly
 stationary during the act of fusion in consequence of the heat
 becoming latent.
     The next three experiments were made with mercurial
 amalgams. Experiment 4. An amalgam of bismuth 10 parts,
 tin 3'5, lead 3'2, and mercury 2'0, in the weak solution of
 common salt. Experiment 5. Amalgam of zinc 1 part, and
  mercury 7, in the same liquid. Experiment 6. Amal am of
  tin corresponding in composition to the formula Snjlg<U+FB01>, in'
  the same solution. This amalgam was soft at 16° 0., and
  mercury drained out of it after standing a bar of it some

time in a vertical position. Each of these amalgams gave
only a small amount of sudden increase of current at the
period of liquefaction, probably because the liquefaction was
more gradual, andthe effects of solution in mercury of the
other metals present masked those of fusion.
   Experiment 7. An amalgam of 1 part cadmium and 4 parts
of mercury, in the weak solution of common salt. The
amalgam was more solid at 16° C. than the other three, but it
easily lique<U+FB01>ed in boiling water. When it was heated and
had become pasty, the current began to increase; but just
previous to complete liquefaction the current suddenly and
considerably decreased, and the liquid amalgam became electro
negative to the solid one; the period of reversal was very
brief, and on further heating the current suddenly increased
to a slightly higher point than it was at previously. The
annexed curve approximately represents the results obtained
with a freshly prepared portion of the amalgam, and shows
that the phenomenon is much more complex than a simple
measurement of the total amount of heat evolved or absorbed
would indicate. The sudden depression of electric ener y
was probably due to a sudden act of chemical union of t e
ingredients and a corresponding loss of potential (i. e. latent
or speci<U+FB01>c) heat.

 have examined this interesting circumstance (see “ Changes
 of Property of Amalgams by Repeated Fusion,” Phil. Mag.
 September 1890, p. 228).
    The mixtures of metals which produced the most sudden
 increases of current in these experiments were those which
 exhibited the most sudden liquefaction. An explanation I
 venture to suggest of the increase of voltaic energy during
 liquefaction is, that the molecules of the lique<U+FB01>ed alloy are
 usually in a state of more active motion than those of the solid
 substance,partly because the liquid has absorbed more potential
heat ; and that the suddenness of the increase of the current
at the period of liquefaction is due to absorption of heat being
promoted, and chemical and voltaic action facilitated by the
 sudden occurrence of convection currents in the liquid alloy.
    As energy is indestructible, the effect of each unit of heat
 absorbed by the alloy upon its total amount of energy of
 molecular motion must be the same whether the heat is
 absorbed as speci<U+FB01>c heat and raises its temperature, or as
 latent heat which, without altering its temperature, changes
 its physical state by fusion, or its other properties, as in the
 case of iron at its “ critical point.”
    The results of the experiments show that changes of voltaic
 energ may be used in the above manner to detect physical
 and c emical changes in metallic alloys.
   V. A Kinetic Theory of Solids, with an Experimental
           Introduction. By WILLIAM SUTHERLAND *.
 THE present work started in an experimental inquiry
         having a twofold object,——-t0 try to ascertain whether
 there is a general law connecting the elastic properties of metals
 with temperature, as is the case with gases, and to discover it
 if possible, and, failing that, to obtain empirical means of <U+FB01>nd
 ing the values of the elastic constants of the metals at absolute
 zero, at which temperature they would be specially interesting,
 as the molecules would be at rest.                    -
    The <U+FB01>rst result was that a general law unfolded itself with
 singular ease, namely that the law of variation of the rigidity
 of the metals with temperature is the same for all : if n is the
 rigidity at absolute temperature 0, and N that at absolute
I                          e-ei
 zero, while T is the melting-point, then
 a law almost as simple as that of perfect gases.

 32                  Mr. W. Sutherland on a
    It next a peared in a similar manner that the law of
 variation of Toung’s modulus of elasticity with temperature
is nearly the same for all metals, and nearly, though not
quite, as simple as that for rigidity.
   As these results amounted to an experimental proof that
rigidity (and elasticity generally) is essentially a kinetic
phenomenon I was encouraged to proceed with a kinetic
theory of solids, which had been in view when the experi
mental inquiry was undertaken.
   The present paper will be divided into two parts :—
Experimental Introduction and Theory.
                 EXPERIMENTAL INTRODUCTION.
   This will be divided into two parts, Rigidity and Young’s
Modulus, in which the matter will be taken in the following
order :—<U+FB01>rst, an account of my own experiments on the effect
of temperature on elasticity; second, a compilation of all
available data on the same subject; third, a compilation of
all the available data as to the absolute values of Bi 'dity and
Young’s Modulus at about 15° C. ; and fourth, esta lishment
of the general law connecting these elastic constants with
temperature, and determination of their values at absolute
zero. -
                             Rigidity.
   1. Experimenta—The variation of rigidit with tempera
ture has been worked at by Napiersky, K0 lrausch, Pisati,
and Tomlinson ; but these experimenters have almost con<U+FB01>ned
their attention to the nobler metals with high melting-points.
As I expected that in the case of the metals with low melting
points the law of variation would be easier to discover, it was
necessary to make a study of these metals.
   I used the torsional method of measuring rigidity both in
its static and kinetic form, and found the two forms to give
pgreeing results ; but as the static proved less accurate, I will
not waste space by giving its results here. The kinetic
method was worked in the usual manner. The metal to be
experimented on was taken in the form of a wire, with a
cylindrical ,vibrator of thin sheet iron soldered to one end, and
a strip of thin iron to the other by means of which it could
be clamped.     As chamber in which to produce variations of
temperature, a wooden box about 65 centim. by 20 by 27 was
taken and <U+FB01>xed with its long edge vertical. The top and
bottom had a hole bored at each middle point to let the wire
pass through freely. The iron strip was clamped to the top
of the box, and the vibrator either swung just outside or inside

                     [finetz'c Theory of Solids.                  33
  the box according to the length of the wire.         It Was con
  venient to have the vibrator swinging outside when it was
  necessary to largely increase the moment of inertia of the
  vibrator. To heat the chamber I used as a preliminary ex
  pedient a gas-<U+FB02>ame burning inside it at one of the bottom
  corners with vent-holes so distributed as to prevent the con
  centration of a stream of hot air on any one point of the
  wire.   The mean temperature of the chamber could be regu
  lated by the size of the <U+FB02>ame, and was measured by a
  thermometer the bulb of which was almost in contact with
  the middle point of the wire. Although this was intended
  to give only rough preliminary measurements, it worked so
  well and was so simple and handy that I retained it through
  out. It was tested repeatedly in the following manner :——a
  gas-<U+FB02>ame was turned on suf<U+FB01>cient to maintain a constant
  temperature of say 70° 0., as recorded by the thermometer,
  and the period of vibration of the wire under experiment was
  observed. The <U+FB02>ame was then increased till a temperature of
   105° C. was reached, when the <U+FB02>ame was turned 011', and the
  vent-holes closed; the temperature of the chamber then fell
  slowly and the period of vibration of the wire was again
  observed while the temperature fell from 71° to 69°; the
  di<U+FB01>'erence in the two values of the period never amounted to
  more than what would correspond to an uncertainty of 2°
  in the reading of the temperature, and in most cases was
  actually inappreciable. This was a degree of accuracy quite
  suf<U+FB01>cient for the purpose in view.         7~
     In determining the period of vibration of wires with such
   molecular viscosity as those of lead, tin, and zinc, there is this
  dif<U+FB01>culty, that when vibration is started it tends to die away
- after a very few swings, so that accuracy in the measurement
   of the time of a single swing is not possible without some
   method of periodically reinforcing the swing. I found the
   simplest and best plan of doin this'to be the application of a
   slight impulsive couple with t e hands to the vibrator at the
   middle of every nth swing. With a little practice it was soon
   possible to make a large number of measurements of the
   period of a lead wire not differing amongst themselves by
   more than 1 in 300. Each determination of a period of
   vibration was made by observing with the seconds hand of a
   watch the time of between 100 and 300 swings.
      The rigidity is calculated from the experimental data by
   the formula

the measurements, the rigidity is given in ynes per square
centim., but as the gramme weight is the unit of force most
employed by elasticians it will be used here.
   When the vibrator swung outside the chamber, a small
length of the wire was not heated directly but only by conduc

Rigidity at 21° (3., 90 x 106 grammes weight per sq. cm.
   To control the absolute value found, a large number of
measurements were made on a longer wire with a lighter
vibrator; length 238'7 centim., mass 88 gm., density 114,
moment of inertia of vibrator 3350 gm. centimf, temperature
17° 0., and half-period '7365 see. These values give a
rigidity 90 x 106 at 17° 0., in close agreement with the value
found from the shorter wire.                             '
   To make still surerof getting this absolute value of the rigidity
of lead thoroughly tested, I carried out some experiments on
a much larger scale, using a piece of stout lead pipe instead
of wire. For vibrator a rectangular plank 179'7 centim. long
and 14'6 centim. wide was taken ; a hole was bored at its
centre through which the pipe was pushed till a short length
projected which was slit and hammered back in four <U+FB02>aps,
then strongly nailed to the plank; a conical plug being driven
into the pipe, there was no doubt about the rigidity of the
connexion between pipe and vibrator.               The plank weighed

                      [finetic Theory of Solids.                  35
 2649 gm. The other end of the pipe was similarly secured
to a plank which was clamped as rigidly as possible to the
 beams of a roof. In the case of a hollow cylinder of external
 radius r, and internal radius r1 rigidity is given by the formula
                           _ 879112;)
                          "— —t°m(r§+rf)'
The moment of inertia of the plank could be increased by
 adding weights.

 7176000 gm. cm.”, the period was “717 sec. ; the moment being
increased to 10577000 the period became '881 sec., and wit
 the moment a ain increased to 20684000 the period rose to
 1222 see. Tghese values give for the rigidity the values
89'3 x 10“, 872 X 106, and 88'6 X 106 respectively, the differ
ences being due doubtless to imperfect rigidity in the sup
porting of so heavy a vibrating system. The mean value
 884 X 106 at 23° is close enough to the former value 90 x 106
at 17° to make it pretty certain that the absolute value of the
 rigidity of lead at 20° can differ but little from 89 X 106
grammes weight per sq. centim.
     Zinc.—To get a wire of zinc I had a strip about '3 centim.
wide cut from a sheet of rolled zinc '3 centim. thick. The rod
of square section was then roughly trimmed to circular section
with a <U+FB01>le, and, <U+FB01>nally, by longitudinal scraping while kept
revolving it was converted into a fairly uniform circular wire.

I did not succeed in etting uniformity or true circulari of
section, so that a reliable absolute value of the rigidit of tm is
not obtainable from these experiments, but the rigidity ratio
being independent of the foul]; can be accurately got.

   2. Compilation of Data as to Variation of Rigidity with
Temperature.—The most extensive work yet done on‘this
subject is that of Pisati (Wied. Beibl. i.), who studied silver,
copper, gold, aluminium, iron, steel, and platinum from zero
to 200°, and in some unannealed specimens up to 300°; but
the results at high temperatures on unannealed specimens are
of no use for our present purpose, because mixed up with the
pure temperature effect there is an annealing e<U+FB02>'ect.                     How
ever, from zero up to 100° the proportional change of rigidity
of the metals with high melting- 0th is nearly the same in
the unannealed as in the anneale state. The other sources

 of knowledge on this subject are Kohlrausch and Loomis
 (Pogg. Ann. cxli.), Napiersky (Pogg. Ann., Erganzbd. iii.),
 and Tomlinson (Proc. Roy.. Soc. xl.), who do not go beyond
 100°.     The simplest way of comparing the results of different
 experimenters will be to tabulate the ratio of the rigidity at
 100° to that at zero as found by each. I will also give from
 Pisati the ratio for rigidity at 200°. Where a specimen is
 known to have been unannealed it will be marked

   The discrepancies in the above table are such as have
hitherto proved inevitable in elastic experiments on account
of differences in purity of specimen and elastic state. But in
Pisati’s experiments up to 200 for the metals with high
melting-point, and in my own up to 100° for those with low
melting-point, there is a large enough variation of rigidity to
be only slightly perturbed by accidental circumstances, as will
be seen when the law of variation is under discussion.                 In the
case of zinc, where there is pronounced disagreement between
Tomlinson’s result and my own, Tomlinson’s is to be preferred
as he experimented on a true wire.

    4. General Law ofthe Variation ofRigidity with Temperature.
The method of procedure in discovering this law was as
follows :—For no single metal was the temperature ran e
large enough to show clearly any simple law, but if t e
molecules of the different metals behave like similar dynamical
systems, then, in passing from the rigidity of rest at absolute
zero to the vanishing point of rigidity at the melting-point,
the different systems must show close similarity in behaviour.
The <U+FB01>rst thing to do, then, was to <U+FB01>nd some empirical formula
with which to extrapolate for a <U+FB01>rst approximation to the
rigidit at absolute zero. In addition to the experimental
data, t ere‘was the valuable fact that in each case the. rigidity
is known to‘vanish at the known melting-point, so that,
although only a small arc of the whole curve of rigidity and
temperature was known in each case, the curve could be pretty
safely completed by sentiment down to the point of zero
rigidity at the melting-point. The curves thus drawn looked
as though they could be fairly represented by the empirical
formula
                                      (:9
                         1=a+b 10H’
                         'n
 T being the melting-point. This makes the rigidity vanish
 at the melting-point, and allows the three constants a, b, o to
be determined from three values of the rigidity at different tem
 peratures : the formula therefore represented a large stretch
 of curve, and could with some confidence be used for extrapo
 lating over about 300° down to absolute zero.       this manner
 a. preliminary series of values of N, the rigidity at absolute
 zero of the various metals, was found. Then it was possible
 to express the value of the rigidity of each metal at all
 temperatures in terms of the value at absolute zero as unit,
 and, further, it was promising to express temperature for each
 metal in terms of its melting-point as unit. When the
 rigidity ratios so found for the different metals were plotted
 as ordinates to the temperature ratios as abscisare, the points
 for all the metals were found to lie on one curve, a parabola
 with the equation                                _ ,__

     The temporary exponential form can now be discarded;
 and we will proceed at once to the proof that the simple rela
 tion just given is the actual law of the variation of rigidity
  with temperature.    The best way to proceed with the data

40                     Mr. W. Sutherland on a
already given in this paper will be as before to measure
rigidity for each metal in terms of that at common tempera
tures (about 15°) as unity, and then according to the data
given in the earlier part of this paper for lead, zinc, tin, and
niagpesium, and in Table 1., after Pisati, to calculate a value
0 /n1 from equation (1) for each value of n given for the
different values of 0.
    For example, in the case of tin we have the following
values, T: 5030 (absolute) :—
           0... 289°       324°      339°      359°      376°
      Mm... 1-0           '854      '804      -727      '666
 which give respectively the following values of N/n1 :—
                1'492    1'461     1'472     1'480    1'510,
 with a mean value 1483, the departures from which are
within the limits of experimental error.
    In the case of zinc, as already mentioned, there is dis
 crepancy between Tomlinson’s results and my own; Tom
 linson gives for the rigidity of zinc at any temperature the
 formula
                    m=no (1—‘00108t—‘0000049t2),
 by means of which I have calculated the rigidities at the
 same temperatures as my own determinations were made at
 in terms of that at 18° as unit in the following, T=690° :—
    0 .......... .. 291°      321°       336°       355°        370°
    112/121 (Toml.) 1'0       '955       “932       '896       '865
 These give the following values of N/nl :—
                     1'217:    1°218     1'221     1'218     1'215 ;
 while at the same temperatures my own experiments give
      1.2/1.1 .... ..1-0        -952       9063     s42       '784
      NM, .... ..1~217         1-215     1-1ss     1-145     1-101
     Thus, while Tomlinson’s values con<U+FB01>rm the formula with
  wonderful accuracy, my own fail to do so, the reason being I
 believe that my specimen of zinc was not a genuine wire,
  whereas Tomlinson worked with a properly drawn wire ; the
  mean value of N from his experiments is 1218, with a
  maximum departure in the individual experiments of '25 per

the law.

  one for iron, and all for platinum and magnesium are omitted.

 VI. Note on Kohlrausch’s Theory of Ionic Velocity. By
     W. O. DAMPIER WHETHAM, B.A., Contts Trotter Student
     of Trinity College, Cambridge *.
        OHLRAUSCH calculates his numbers for the speci<U+FB01>c
           velocities of different ions from measurements of the
 conductivities of salt-solutions, and of their migration con
 stants, on the supposition that all the molecules of the salt
 present in solution are actively concerned in conveying the
 current.      The values thus obtained were found to agree with
 experiment in certain cases by Prof. Oliver Lodge, and an
 investigation I am now engaged in carrying out seems also
 to con<U+FB01>rm them. It seems to be generally supposed that this
 is inconsistent with any theory (such as that of dissociation)
 which supposes only a certain part of the salt to be active (sec
 Lodge, B. A. Report, 1886, p. 391), though some such form of
 theory seems to be required by the relations shown to exist by
 Arrhenius, Van’t Ho<U+FB01>', Ostwald, and others. If we examine
 the matter a little more closely, however, I think the two sup
 positions can be reconciled. Suppose that the ratio of the
 numbers of the active and the inactive molecules (which is
  generally supposed to measure the “dissociation ’f) represents in
  reality the average ratio of the time during which each molecule
  is active to the time during which it is inactive.   Every mole
  cule is in turn active, but at any instant only a certain fraction
  of the molecules are active. [In terms of the dissociation
  hypothesis, the dissociation ratio measures the ratio of the
  mean free time to the mean paired time of the ions.] This is,
   of course, equivalent to supposing a certain <U+FB01>xed fraction of
  the whole number of molecules to be active, as far as statical
   effects, such as osmotic pressure, are concerned, but when we
   consider the velocities of the ions the case is different.

44          On Kohlrausch’s Theory of Ionic Velocity.
   Kohlrausch calculates the relative velocity of the two ions
U=u +1; from the molecular conductivity k/m, where k=spe
ci<U+FB01>c conductivity of the solution, and m its contents in gramme
equivalents of salt, U1=u+u=lc/m. If new we suppose that
at any instant only 1/nth of the number of molecules are active,
we should apparently have to put U2=f;—;L in order that the
same current may be carried, which would give U2=nU1.
   But this U, represents the actual velocity of the ions while
they are “free,” and if we take a “dynamical” view of the
dissociation equilibrium, they are only free for 1/nth of their
time; while combined they have no relative velocity, and so
their average velocit for any long time is 1U2=Ub the same
as on Kohlrausch’s hypothesis.               n
   The investigation alluded to above, at which I am now
working, seems to yield excellent
results for certain cases, though it is
of somewhat limited application. It
consists in observing the phenomena
at the junction of two salt-solutions,
one of which is differently coloured
to the other, when a current of elec
tricity is passed across it. Salts are
chosen which have one ion in com
mon and the other different. Let
us represent them by AB and CB,
and consider the junction pheno
mena. The effect of the molecular
interchanges will be a motion of B
ions in one direction, and a motion
of C ions and of A ions in the other.
When a 0 ion crosses the boundary,
it again forms CB, but the colour of GB is different to that
of AB, hence the boundary between the colours will move.
   The method will be discussed when more experimental
results are obtained ; it appears that by measuring the rate of
this motion the velocity of the ions can he arrived at. The
present is merely a preliminary communication in explanation
of the experiments shown to the Physical Society of London
on the occasion of their recent visit to Cambridge.

.VII. On the Solitary Wave. By J. MCUOWAN, MA., 13.80.,
   Assistant Lecturer on Natural Philosophy, University
    College, Dundee‘.
IN his Report on Waves to the British Association in 1844,
       Scott Russell gave an account of experiments he had
made on the propagation, along the surface of still water in
a straight channel with rectangular cross-section, of a wave
consisting of a single elevation or depression, and which he
called a wave of translation or solitar wave to distinguish it
from waves forming part of atrain. hrom these experiments
he concluded that the solitary wave was unique, having
characteristics entirely its own :—-it had a de<U+FB01>nite form de
pending only on the depth and the volume of the water
composing it, and this form, in the case of a wave of elevation,
appeared to be propagated with constant velocity and without
any change- except such degradation in height as might
reasonably be attributed to frictional and other disturbances.
   In 1845 EarnshawT sought to give a theory of these waves,
but it was unsatisfactory as involving a discontinuity in the
pressure within the liquid.
    In his Report on Recent Researches on Hydrodynamics to
 the British Association in 1846, Stokes, commenting on
Russell’s experiments and Earnshaw’s theory, concludes
 that the observed degradation of the wave is not to be attri
 buted wholly, nor even chie<U+FB02>y, to friction, but is an essential
 characteristic of the motion ; and, again, in 1847, in a paper
 “ On the Theory of Oscillatory Waves”i, he reiterates this
 opinion and offers a proof involving, however, an oversight
 which I shall be able to point out.
    It has been thought by some that the solitary wave is in
 cluded in the general theory of long waves, but this is
 certainly only so to a very rou h approximation, for its
 velocity does not agree closely with that of the long wave,
 nor does it gradually increase in steepness in front as the long
 wave does, the change which does take place in it being
 simply a diminution in height and consequent increase in
 length such as might be caused by a dissipation of its energy
 by friction, &c.
    The <U+FB01>rst sound approximate theory of the wave was given
 by Boussinesq in 1871§, who obtained an equation for its

form and the same velocity of propagation as Russell deduced
from his experiments. In 1876 Lord Bayleigh‘ gave another
method of approximation leading to an equation for the sur
face similar to that of Boussinesq and the same velocity of
propagation. These theories, however, give little further
information regarding the wave, and I am not aware that
anything further has been done.
   In the following paper I propose, after brie<U+FB02>y discussing
the general theory, to proceed to a somewhat detailed ex
amination of the wave based on a simple but close approxima
tion. It will be found that the results are in substantial
agreement with Scott Russell’s experiments, and con<U+FB01>rm his
0 inion as to the unique character of the solitary wave of
e evation.
   It will be seen further that an approximate account of the
phenomena of the breaking of waves on passing into shallower
water follows naturally from the results obtained.

without alteration in form and wit constant velocity along
a straight channel of rectangular cross-section has not been
established on theoretical grounds, yet the result of experi
ment is such as to show that a method based on this assump
tion must lead at least to a highly approximate account of the
 motion. We shall assume, then, the invariability of the wave
 motion, understanding it of course to be two-dimensional,
 and shall in the <U+FB01>rst place suppose it reduced to steady motion
 by having impressed upon it a velocity equal and opposite to
 that of the wave propagation.
    Take the axis of a: in the horizontal bottom of the channel
 along the direction in which the wave is propagated, and that
 of a vertically upwards. Then noting that the motion is
 essentially irrotational as being propagated into (incompres
 sible) liquid at rest, and putting therefore :1) for the velocity
 potential and 1]! for the current function, we must have
 11r+t¢ a function of z+m. (LE ~/ —1).
    At a great distance from the wave the liquid will practically
 be at rest, and therefore in the corresponding steady motion
 it will be <U+FB02>owing uniformly: hence for the steady motion it
 is convenient to take
                 \[r+t¢= —U(z+ue) +f(:+ta:),          .  .  .  (1)
 where U is the velocity of propagation of the wave.

    To determine the form off (Haw) We note that (i.) as the
wave is to be solitary it must be non-periodic as regards :11,
(ii.) it must be <U+FB01>nite and continuous throughout the liquid
including the boundin surfaces, (iii.) when a: is in<U+FB01>nite
(+0r —) it must vanis<U+FB01> or have a <U+FB01>nite value independent
of z or .r, and (iv.) if we take 11r=0 at the bottom, it must be
an odd function of (2+ are).

and for this the coef<U+FB01>cients a1, a3 . . . may be determined by
the method of successive approximation, but for the present
at least we shall content ourselves with examining to what
degree of accuracy this condition can be satis<U+FB01>ed by taking
the <U+FB01>rst term only.

the equations (4) and (5) give the current function and
velocity potential, and (7) and (8) the velocity components
of a steady motion which, to the degree of accuracy indicated
by (15), satis<U+FB01>es the condition that its surface, which is given
by (11), may be a free surface.
   Thus to this degree of approximation the form of the
solitary wave is determined by (11), and we see that, since
by (17) ma is essentially positive, the wave consists solely of
an elevation, and that there cannot be a wave of depression
capable of propagating itself unchanged with constant velocity:
a result in accordance with the observations of Scott Russell.
   We proceed to consider in greater detail the character of
the approximation we have adopted for the free surface.
     3. The Surface Pressure in the Approximate Theory.
   The pressure at any point of a liquid in steady irrotational
motion is given by the equation
                     p=constant—§pgg-gz,          .   .   .  .  (19)
where p and p are the pressure and density respectiVelg'.
Over the free surface p ought to be constant: hence if p
denote the excess of pressure at any point of the surface given
by (11) over the pressure at the mean level h in the motion
just investigated, we have by (15) and (19)
           8p: —4m3'r)2(’170—'r7)pUQ cot mh cosec2 mh,
or
           3}): —4gpm2172(470—n) cosec2 mh.     .   .   .   .
Thus there is a defect of pressure everywhere but at the crest
and the mean level.        Note, however, how this negative
pressure is distributed :-—At the crest 8p vanishes, and as it
contains the factor 110—1) and the crest is the oint of maxi
mum elevation, it remains very small over a long range on
either side of the crest. Again, 3]) vanishes at mean level
and remains very small over an in<U+FB01>nite range. Finally, 8};
is a maximum at the point where 17=§170, having then the
value —%$}gpm9noa cosec2mh (only         of what the maximum
would have been had we taken 3ma=2 sin92 mh) : but this is at
the point of in<U+FB02>exion (accurately when no/h is very small)
where '17 is increasing most rapidly, and therefore this maxi
mum pressure occurs where it can have least range. Thus we
see that the pressure-error, small at its greatest, is so dis
tributed as to be least effective.

the form of the solitary wave is given by the equations (11),
(17), and (18), and its velocity of propagation by (16).
“Te may from these eliminate, when required, any two of the
three constants a, no, and m, but it is in general convenient to
retain them, as each has a direct physical si ni<U+FB01>cance.
    For purposes of approximation it shoul be noticed that
when mh is regarded as a small quantity of the <U+FB01>rst order,
then, by (17) and (18), ma will be of the second, and mm, of
the third order.       We proceed to consider certain rough
approximations.
    If in (11) we neglect m‘th2 in expanding the cosine, &c., it

 measurements, and it need only be pointed out that the
 experiments on which Russell relied to establish (24) were
 made in a long trough 20 or 30 feet long, and that, so far as I
 am aware, no allowance was made, nor I think could well
 have been made, for the in<U+FB02>uence of the successive re<U+FB02>exions
 from the ends.

                        5. The Wave-length.
   The solitary wave cannot directly be regarded as having
any <U+FB01>nite length as the elevation approaches the mean level
asymptotically towards w: + co and ——00 . Practically, how
ever, Scott Russell found its length to be suf<U+FB01>ciently de<U+FB01>nite
to admit of his giving measurements of it. To obtain a
measure Rayleigh suggested that the wave might be con
sidered to end where its elevation became some de<U+FB01>nite and
fairly small fraction, say 1/10, of its maximum elevation.
Comparing, however, the formula (16) for the velocity with
that in the ordinary theory of a train of waves, or the corre
sponding formulae for da, 1]", &c., it is natural to take for the
wave-length 7\.=27r/m.       If for an approximation we take the
value of m given by (23), this gives
                    k=21r4/{h*(h++§no)/3<U+FB02>o};          . . . (25)

for in this case, as we shall see later, mhl—Tl.
   Curiously enough the formula (26) is that taken by Russell
to represent approximately his experimental results, and it
agrees well with (25), for all fairly high waves, such in fact as
would be best suited for measurement.            He noticed further
that low waves were longer than high ones, which is also in
accordance with (25) ; and thus altogether his results ma be
taken as giving a practical basis for the de<U+FB01>nition we have
chosen, in addition to the theoretical one on which it is
founded.
   It should be noted, further, that this de<U+FB01>nition is practically
of the kind suggested by Rayleigh, for, taking for the moment
(21) as an approximation to the free surface, we see that
taking h=21r/m is equivalent to regarding the wave as end
ing where 17/110: 8601127112 é-fO'lS, or where the elevation is a
little less than one sixth of the maximum.

  wave-motion- of all particles in the same vertical line is
  approximately the same, and that therefore each will be dis
  placed through nearly the same distance as the wave passes

  obtained, for as the wave passes completely across any section
  of the channel it must convey over it a quantity of liquid
  equal to its own volume, and this being done by the dis

 forward from rest at an inclination, 9=mz, proportional to'
 its distance from the bottom and inversely proportional to
 the length of the wave; its velocity goes on increasing till
 x+E=Ilt, when it moves horizontally with its maximum

 the particles.

      The path of any particle is given by (39), (41), and (43),

 as an approximate equation to the path described by any
 particle originally in the plane z. To this order, therefore,
 each particle initially at a distance zfrom the bottom describes
 that part of the parabola given by (46) which lies above the
 level z. This gives 2a for the maximum horizontal displace
 ment, and 1i a tan m: for the maximum elevation, of a particle,
 but more exact values have already been given in (44)
 and (40).
                     9. The Energy of the Wave.
     The potential energy of the wave per unit breadth is
                  V=§ypf nqdw=ypf 172 da';

Hence, substituting for U, we have to the same order

so that the kinetic and potential energies are equal to this
order of approximation at least.
              10. The Limiting Height of the Wave.
    It is found by experiment that there is a limit to the
height of the solitary wave depending on the mean depth of
the liquid : when an attempt is made to form a higher wave,
it breaks at the crest.
    Since Q2 cannot be negative, the limiting form will be that
for which q=0 at the crest, and therefore by (14) and (16),
the greatest elevation of crest will be given by
                          2mn0=tan mh. .       . .   .  .  .  (50)
Now by (6) we see that when u=0 at the crest
                      ma = 2 cos2 %m(h + 17°),
and therefore by (18)
                        mno=sinm(h+1lo)-       . .   .  .  .  (51)
 Solving (51) and (52) for mh and mm, we <U+FB01>nd
                       mh'=_ 1'1, m'qo'=_ '9 . . .      .  .  (52)
SO that the wave will break for an elevation rather less than
the mean depth. It is needless to seek to specify the breaking
elevation more exactly, for the approximation is here pushed
 to an extreme limit._ In fact, b (4), the crest when q=0
 becomes a double point on wk: —{Th, and the branches cut at
 right angles, whereas Stokes has shown that for a free surface
 the crest angle must be 21r/3 at the breaking-point. Our
 approximation, however, considering the extreme circum
 stances, is suf<U+FB01>ciently fair to indicate that the conditions (52)
 for breaking should not be far wrong. Scott Russell’s
 experiments con<U+FB01>rm this : he found that the wave broke when
 the elevation was about equal to the depth; but from some
 experiments of my own I am inclined to think that n0= 3/4h
 is a closer approximation for the elevation at the breaking
 point.
               11. Approximate Theory of Breakers.
    Some account can be given of the gradual increase in height
 and ultimate breaking of waves rolling in on a gently sloping
 beach.

             Mr. J. M°Oowan on the Solitary Wave.             57
   We have seen that to a <U+FB01>rst approximation the volume of
the wave per unit breadth of channel is 20th, and to the same
order we easily obtain also
                             2             —
                  v=2ah=;7\n70=4\/170h3/3 , -         -  ~  (53)
the approximations being fair for low waves.
_ Now as the wave rolls in its volume remains constant, and
therefore its height increases and length diminishes as the
depth diminishes, or exactly
                                _  3 '02 .                   54
                              <U+FB02>o—EF,------()
so that the elevation varies inversely and the length directly
as the cube of the depth. As the wave becomes higher it will
be necessary to take the more exact formulw instead of (53).
 By (52) when the wave is on the point of breaking mhL—jl
and ma'=_ 2/3, and so using the more exact formula (31) for
the volume we get roughly
                      v=1'5h2 or h='8
which gives the depth in which the wave will break.
    Thus the big waves will break <U+FB01>rst, and the depth in which
they break will vary as the square root of their volume.
       12. The Views of Sir George Stokes—Conclusion.
    Having thus examined in some detail the approximation
 to the solitary wave which is obtained by taking the <U+FB01>rst term
 only of (2), and having seen that even this <U+FB01>rst approximation
 satis<U+FB01>es to a hi h degree of accuracy the condition for the
 propagation of t 0 wave without change, we are naturally
 led to examine the argument given by Stokes, in his paper
 “On the Theory of Oscillatory Waves,” already cited, against
 the possibility of the propagation without change of form or
velocity of any other form of wave than the in<U+FB01>nite train of
 “ oscillatory ” waves which he there discusses—t0 a degree of
 approximation not quite so close as that with which we have
 been occupied in the foregoing sections. .

 only one value (i) of m for a given value of U, there can

58       Mr. S. T. Preston on an Acoustic Thermometer.
only be one form for each velocity.           In the light of equation
(16) above, the oversight in discarding the “imaginary”
value is obvious. It is too hastily concluded that such a
value would imply in<U+FB01>nite velocity &c. either when .r= +00
or when 0:: —oo , but this is not necessarily so, though it is
too frequently assumed in such like investigations, for in fact
the value of ¢ given in (5) above gives a well-known expan
sion of the form EAeu‘tb‘ such as is considered by Stokes,
but the “ real” coef<U+FB01>cients p are discontinuous, changing sign
with .v, so that e!” vanishes both for at: +30 , and for .v= —oo .
    We may conclude, then, that we have obtained just as
satisfactory evidence for the unchan 'ng propagation of the
solitary wave as there is for that of t e in<U+FB01>nite train investi
gated b Stokes. In a Supplement to his paper published in
1880*, lie has carried his approximation one step further, and
we may with advantage employ a somewhat similar method
in proceeding to higher degrees of approximation for the
solitary wave. Proceeding on the same principles by which
we obtained (1) and 2), we may take instead

which leads to the higher approximations with considerably
less labour, though to the order with which we have been
occupied it offers no advantage, in fact rather the reverse from
its indirect character.
           VIII. Acoustic Thermometer—a Suggestion.
                       By S. TOLVER PREsTONt.
THE following may have more theoretical than practical
       interest (illustrative of a connexion between acoustics
and heat); but perhaps ingenuity might give the suggestion
also a practical value. The idea is simple enough, and relates
to the varying note afforded by a resonance-tube according
to the temperature of the enclosed air or gas; the notion
being to em loy this in some way as a measure of tempera
ture. I sha 1 only illustrate, however, the simplest aspect of
the case.
   Thus, for mere theoretical illustration, we may suppose a
tube, closed at its inner end, to be inserted somewhere in the
wall of some furnace, or buried in some less heated object,
whose temperature is to be estimated.              Of course a tuning
fork of a certain vibrating period will, at normal temperature,

          Mr. S. T. Preston on an Acoustic Thermometer.       59
 vibrate in resonance with the tube possessing a certain length.
 Then it will be seen at once that changing the temperature
 of the object where the tube is placed will alter this state of
 affairs. Another fork of different vibrating period must now
 be selected in order to resound with the tube. Of course
 there are certain relations between the vibrating period and
 the temperature, and it is to illustrate the extreme simplicity
  of these relations under the kinetic theory of gases that is
  one point in the present paper.
     Maxwell showed, in his celebrated paper, “ On the Dyna
  mical Evidence of the Molecular Constitution of Bodies,”
  published in ‘Nature,’ March 4, 1875, that it was demon
  strable mathematically that “ the pressure of a gas cannot be
  explained by assuming repulsive forces between the particles.
  It must therefore depend, in whole or in part, on the motion
  of the particles ” (Maxwell’s paper, p. 358).
     Hence it appears so far clear, as we may say, that we must
  have recourse to a dynamical theory in order to explain one
  of the simplest and most fundamental properties of a gas.
     A con<U+FB01>dence in the dynamical theory led me (Phil. Mag.
  June 1877) to suggest its application to illustrate the me
  chanism of the propagation of sound in gases; and the very
  simple relation showed itself, viz. that the velocity of propa
  gation of sound could only depend on the velocity (normal)
  of the molecules of gas themselves, and on nothing else; in
  fact, that the sound-wave moved independently of the density
  and pressure of the gas. Indeed, according to the kinetic
  theory, the molecules of the gas have of course no distant
  action on each other, and can therefore only in<U+FB02>uence each
  other by impact (so that the velocity of the normal motion of
  the molecules of the gas alone comes into play in propagating
  the wave).
     Now this applies very simply, as will be apparent at once,
  to our proposed acoustic thermometer. For it is this normal
' motion of the molecules of the gas (in the tube), the energy
  of which motion we call the “temperature,” which is the sole
  factor in determining the velocity of sound, of which the
  tuning-fork (we employ with the tube) is the mechanical in
  dicator.   The velocity of sound being as the velocity of the
  gaseous molecules, and velocity of the molecules being as the
  square root of their energy, then, since the temperature is
  the energy, the velocity of sound in a gas is proportional to
  the square root of the temperature, as we see.
      If we have a tuning-fork whose vibrating eriod is me
   chanically adjustable, it is easy to perceive, t on, from the
  above, that the temperature (in the tube) is inversely propor

60                   Mr. R. A. Lehfeldt on a
tional to the square of the vibrating period of the fork; or,
if the length of the tube be adjustable, i. e. if the tube be
telescopic, the temperature of the air in the tube (therefore
of the heated receptacle or what not, in which the tube is
placed) is evidently proportional to the square of the length
of the adjustable tube.
    Zero Centigrade being 273 above the absolute zero, the
 Centigrade zero is then, of course, 273 when expressed as
absolute temperature. At 273 above zero C. (which is 546
 of absolute temperature) the molecules of air have, of course,
twice the energy they have at zero 0. At 4 X 273 absolute
 temperature (819 above zero C.) the molecules of air will
 possess, in the same way, four times the energy possessed by
them at zero 0., and therefore twice the velocity which they
had at zero C. (velocity being as the square root of energy).
 Sound would then be propagated in air (in such a tube)
 whose temperature is 819° C. at twice the Velocity of its
 transmission in air at 0° C.   So that a tube of air at a tem
 perature of 819° 0. would be in resonance with the same
tuning-fork as a tube of half the length resounds to at 0° C.
This is suf<U+FB01>ciently clear; and so it is evident that varying the
length of a telescopic tube and employing a constant fork
serves the same object as (conversely) varying the vibrating
period of an (adjustable) fork and keeping the length of the
tube constant. Some may see a way to propose some modi
<U+FB01>cation of the above, in a mechanical point of view, which
might be more sensitive.       It is the principle, or rather
the theoretical aspect of the case, with which we are chie<U+FB02>y
concerned.

   in <U+FB01>g. 2 the shaded parts represent solid brass or copper pieces:
the dark circles binding screws, the light ones mercury-cups.
The coils to be compared are put between 1 and 2 and 1' and
2'. The terminals of the resistance-box are connected to
H, K, so that by inserting a plug it can be put in parallel
with either of the coils.
   1 and 1' are then connected by copper bars either to 3 and
4’ or to 4 and 3'. The equal resistances )3 and 7 are of course
wound on the same reel, and may be soldered permanently in
place. M, N are the battery terminals, O,P those of the
galvanometer.
   If the coils to be compared differ as much as a B.A. unit
does from a legal ohm, the resistances taken from the box
will give the difference to '0002 ohm, and interpolation by
means of the galvanometer de<U+FB02>exions need only be resorted
to beyond that. The sensitiveness of the method is of course
limited by that of the galvanometer.

        X. A Steam-Engine Indicator for Ifz'gh Speeds.
                  By Prof. JOHN PERRY, F.R.S.*
MEMBERS who are not practically acquainted with the
         errors of the ordinary steam- or gas-engine indicator are
referred to a paper in the ‘ Proceedings of the Institution of
Civil Engineers’ (vol. lxxxiii. 1885) by Professor Osborne
Re nolds, and an exhaustive discussion of the subject.
      hether we do or do not share Prof. Reynolds’s view that
 even at low speeds of engines the errors in calculating horse
power are very considerable, because of the friction of the
 paper barrel and the stretching of the cord or wire which
gives to the paper barrel a miniature motion of the engine
 piston, it is obvious that there will be more con<U+FB01>dence in an
indicator in which the motion-copying mechanism gives a
very short stroke, is opposed by very small forces, and requires
no string or wire. I do not pretend to get rid of the error
in a spring which is due to change of temperature, but where
great accuracy is required it is always worth while, when
using this or any other indicator, to have a “ boiler-pressure ”
line drawn upon the diagram, as well as an “atmospheric
line ;” and these two lines, with a pressure-gauge on the
boiler, will give the scale to which the indicator at the time

64             Prof. J. Perry on a Steam-Engine
represents pressure and prevent error due to change of tem
perature of the spring.
   In these days of high-speed machinery the most important
defect of an indicator is its slow natural period of vibration.
1f the natural period of vibration is from £5 to 315 of the
time of revolution of an engine, it is found that the diagram
is not deformed by waviness, ordinary <U+FB02>uid friction destroy
ing the natural vibration; if it is as much as {-5, a con
siderable amount of pencil pressure must be employed to
obtain a frictional stilling of vibration; but if it is as low as
T16 it is almost impossible, even with great pencil friction,
to obtain a decent diagram. To make an indicator have a
quicker natural vibration it is necessary to use a stiffer spring,
and this means that pressures are indicated to a very small
scale. Introducing seven per cent. of inaccuracy in area. of
diagram, either by friction or smallness of scale, may possibly
allow the very best existing indicator to be used on engines
of as high a speed as 400 revolutions per minute ; but this is
a matter on which assertions are made of higher and ver
much lower limits of speed than what I have stated. I think
that users of indicators will generally agree that I have not
exaggerated this defect; but unfortunately there is scarcely
ever any kind of check which can be applied to a measure
ment of indicated horse-power, so that mere assertions are of
Very little value.
    Indicated horse-power is now the sole standard of the
values of engines, so that its accurate measurement is very
important; but for the inventor and improver of engines,
and for the physicist, that there shall be no local deformations
 in the shape of the indicator-diagram is of greater importance
 than that its area should be correct. Now the natural period
 of vibration of the indicator before you is about 51,—0 of a
 second; allowing twenty periods to one revolution of the
 engine, I <U+FB01>nd that this indicator will give diagrams with no
 wave-deformations until the speed of the engine exceeds 1500
 revolutions per minute.      I can, however, by changing the
 disk make the natural period of vibration $6 or @15-0 of
 a second, or, indeed, what I please, so that there is practically
 no speed at which this indicator will not give a true diagram.
    Specimens of the indicator are before you, but I will throw
 upon the screen drawings of it. Fig. 1 is a section, and
 <U+FB01>g. 2 an elevation.    It consists of a very shallow circular
 box, E, of metal (in some of my specimens it is of cast iron,
 in others of gun-metal) closed by a thin disk of steel, D.
 Here, for example, is one an inch and a quarter in dia
 meter, and about <U+FB01>lo of an inch thick, which I use for
                                                                   L

                    Indicator for High Speeds.                65
maximum steam-pressures of about 30 lb. to the square inch
above the atmosphere. It was my intention to use corru.
gated disks, but as these could not be obtained cheaply, ex
cept in quantity, I have hitherto used plane disks, and found
them quite satisfactory for such sizes of diagram as I have
hitherto dealt with. I am, however, making arrangements
for obtaining corrugated disks for use in the indicator.

    Now when this box E is put in communication with the
c linder of a steam-engine in the usual way, that is through
tli’e pipe A and the indicator-cock, the disk yields more or
less as the pressure is greater or less. To magnify this yield
ing I <U+FB01>x upon the disk, about halfway between its centre
and circumference, a small mirror B such as is used in elec
trical laboratories. This mirror has a light frame of metal,
and can be screwed to or unscrewed from any of these disks
quite readily.    I let a beam of light from an ordinary oil
lamp fall upon the mirror, and it is re<U+FB02>ected and falls upon a
sheet of white paper which it illuminates at a small spot.
Now the yielding of the disk under <U+FB02>uid pressure is evidenced
by the movement of the spot of light on the paper. For
example, if steam of 10, 20, or 30 lb. pressure per square
inch (above the atmosphere) is admitted to this box with its
present disk, and the spot of light is on a sheet of paper
about 4 feet away from the mirror, the spot will be seen to
travel one, two, or three inches from its original position.
If there is a partial vacuum inside the box, the spot travels in
the opposite direction. It will be seen, therefore, that I have

66          '    Prof. J. Perry on a Steam-Engine
used a re<U+FB02>ected beam of light as if it were a rigid pointer
four feet long. By using a lens, by using magnesium light
instead of a common oil-lamp, and by taking certain pre
cautions which are quite obvious to the members of this
 Society, I could throw a well-de<U+FB01>ned spot upon a screen
forty feet away from a mirror upon a small corrugated disk,
whose motion would be with great exactness proportional to
the pressure, for motions of as much as <U+FB01>ve or six feet.
    The end of the arm F receives a miniature motion of the
piston of the engine by sti<U+FB02>' rods, and this causes the spot to
 move at right angles to its former motion; and when both
motions are being given the spot travels round on the screen,
its position at any instant indicating the pressure of the steam
and the position of the piston in its stroke.
    Now, although I have never heard of such a method being
used, I feel that many people must have thought of using it.
I myself thought of it many years ago; but the making of a
photographic record seemed to me to introduce great dif<U+FB01>culty,
so I never tried it". What I have now discovered is this, that
a photographic method of recording is quite unnecessary.
 In fact, even at speeds of 60 revolutions per minute the image
of the spot remains on the retina suf<U+FB01>ciently long to enable a
man to draw upon the screen the path of the spot.               He <U+FB01>rst
turns the indicator—cock, so that there is atmospheric pressure
under the disk. The spot now travels in a straight line, and
this is the atmospheric line. When I wish to check the scale
I do what I should like to see done with all indicators, I let
steam at boiler-pressure underneath the disk and mark out
another straight line parallel to the atmospheric line. I now
let the box communicate with the cylinder, and I draw the
actual diagram. A very little practice will enable anyone to
draw the diagram quite accurately, even when the engine
makes only 60 revolutions per minute.            But at such speeds
as 150 revolutions per minute, the diagram is quite 'con
tinuous as a thin line of light on the paper, and the most un
skilled person need not make errors of as much as one per
‘cent. in drawing a pencil line, which remains quite visible in
the middle of the thin line of illumination.                      '
    Using a common oil-lamp, a'diagram about six inches long
and four inches broad, formed of a band of light one tenth of
an inch broad, is quite visible even in a well illuminated
room. If the room is darkened the diagram becomes quite

engine, which some of my students made to drive testing

of light with a pencil. As a matter of fact, the engine was

if an instantaneous photograph had been taken of the arrange
ment actually working, it would not have been very different
from what I here show, except that the line of light forming
the diagram would have been <U+FB01>ner.
   “’e have only been able to run this toy engine at a maxi
mum speed of about 900 revolutions per minute, and indeed
at this speed it was rather dangerous to run it, as, through
want of balance, it set the <U+FB02>oor and everything in the room
a-shaking; but even at this high speed there was no evidence
on the diagram of any waviness due to the natural vibrations
of the disk of the indicator. There was, however, a musical
note in evidence of the existence of such vibrations.
   Mr. Holland has used a tapering wooden box as if it were
a camera for photographing the diagram and its atmo
spheric line, and he tells me that it is quite easy to take
such photogra hs. He is, however, accustomed to such work,
and I do not t ink that an ordinary engine-driver would care
to try the photographic method.          I here exhibit some of Mr.
Holland’s photographs. This one, <U+FB01>g. 4, required an ex
posure of one minute, the light being that of an ordinary
                                 Fig. 4.

seconds, the light being obtained by the burning of a piece
of magnesium strip behind the hole.
   I have, however, used Mr. Holland’s box with sheets of
tracing-paper instead of photographic plates, and the indicator

                   Indicator for High Speeds.                 69
diagram is now an object which is very easily observed and
traced.
    1 exhibit a few drawings made on tracing-paper in this
way by Mr. Holland. First, we have a few taken at about
the same time; these taught us that we had better make con
siderable changes in the valve of our engine. We made
these changes, and here are some others taken subsequently.
The speed and other necessary information are given on each
sheet of paper, so that the effect of change of speed on our
toy engine may be noted.       ‘
    With an ordinary indicator the instrument must be stopped
in its action, and a sheet of paper taken from the drum, before
the diagram can be looked at. But here the diagram is
visible all the time. To the student or improver of steam
engines it is very instructive to keep looking at the diagram
whilst altering steam-pressure, or speed, or load of the engine,
and it is an amusement of which one does not very soon
become tired. Even with this toy engine of mine I have
already observed such changes in the shape of the diagram
as have thrown a perfectly new light upon the condensation
phenomena occurring inside a steam-engine cylinder.
    The <U+FB01>rst form of this new indicator is lying on the table.
You will see that to give it the piston motion in miniature
required considerable force to be exerted, a fault which I
have corrected since. Now the very <U+FB01>rst time the instru
ment was tried a very curious phenomenon was observed,
namely, that the indicator-diagram was not one continuous
line of light, but a series of “blobs ” or spots, connected by
a much fainter line.      I easily saw that these indicated a
vibration going on in the rods which gave to the box the
motion of the piston in miniature. I found that the cause of
this was due to the bad <U+FB01>tting or “backlash” in a lever
which my students had been in the habit of using with ordi
nary indicators on the same engine.       With an ordinary in
dicator there was no possibility of observing from the diagram
that such a fault existed, and was probably greatly accen
tuated by the use of a cord instead of our rod; here it was
very evident. Indeed, although only to a small extent, it
 will be observed in the photographs that there are regular
 changes of intensity of light in every diagram, and that this
 vibration of the piston-motion mechanism has not been
 altogether done away with even in our more carefully <U+FB01>tted
 stiff rods.

    In the discussion which followed the reading of the paper

70              Mr. R. T. Glazebrook 0n the Value of
it was suggested by Mr. Swinburne that the most useful
function of such an indicator would be to continually show
the diagram on a screen in an engine-room, so that at every
instant the engineer would not only know the pressure of
steam in his boiler, but also the pressure at every instant in
the cylinder.
    I quite forgot to put this in my paper, although its im
 portance was not unknown to me. 1 am now attaching an
 indicator to each end of the cylinder of my driving-engine
 at Finsbury. These will receive their miniature piston-motion
 from one rod. One gas-jet will throw from the two mirrors
 two diagrams upon a screen some seven feet away from the
 mirrors, and these diagrams will be visible from nearly every
 part of the engine-room at all times. In the room at present
 there are not only very visible pressure- and vacuum-gauges
 and a speed-indicator (not a counter), but also a dynamo
 meter coupling, which shows at a glance the actual horse
 power which is being transmitted along a shaft. If, instead
 of tracing the diagram With a pencil, 1 were to trace it with
 the point of a planimeter, the reading might represent the
 horse-power.
     It is unnecessary to describe here how the indicator might
 be <U+FB01>xed to the valve-chest or receivers, or to other parts of
 an engine, such as the air- and force-pumps ; or to pumping
.machinery generally; or to engines driven by <U+FB02>uids.            In
fact it may be said that I have made the discovery that the
 beautiful method of observation of vibration of M. Lissajous
 has hitherto been neglected in its applicability to all sorts of
 practical purposes. Quite a number of other applications of .
 the re<U+FB02>ected beam of light principle suggest themselves.

 IN a paper read before the Physical Society * on May 23,
         1885, I described the results of a comparison between
  the original standards of the British Association and some
 copies of the mercury unit representing Legal Ohms made

               some illercury Resistance Standards.            71‘
 The mercury with which the tubes were <U+FB01>lled in 1885 has re
 mained in them since that date. Now recent observations had
 seemed to indicate that a small change had taken place in some
 of the platinum-silver standards, and it became desirable to
 compare them again with M. Benoit’s tubes. The method
 was the same as that of my former paper. The tubes im—
 mersed in melting ice were compared with the B.A. standards.
 The temperature of the room was kept very low, from O°'5 to
 3° 0., and thus the errors caused by the conduction of heat into
the tubes through the copper connecting rods were avoided.
 The connecting pieces used to connect the tubes to the bridge
 differed from those employed in 1885, being a modi<U+FB01>cation
of the platinum cups described in my paper* on the speci<U+FB01>c
resistance of mercury. Ahollow platinum cup, about 3'5 cm.
long and rather more than 1 cm. in diameter, is secured <U+FB01>rmly
into an ebonite tube ; the outside of the tubes are turned to
<U+FB01>t the ground portion of the glass vessels which form the ends
 of the mercury tubes, thus taking the place of the stoppers
which usually close the tube ; the platinum cups dip into the
mercury, the surface of contact being about 12 sq. cm. The
cups had previously been platinized ; on the present occasion
they were merely cleaned with nitric acid and distilled water.
Stout copper rods, well amalgamated, <U+FB01>t tightly into the inside
of the cups ; the other ends of these rods are in contact with
the bridge.    Thus the connexion with the bridge is made
through the rods and across the platinum of the cups, avoiding
contact between the mercury and copper.
   The resistance of the connexions was determined, and it was
shown that the resistance of the platinum was negligible.
This was done by. making the rod and cup part of a circuit,
the resistance of which was measured. The rod was then
removed from the cup, and the latter was removed, so that the
part of the copper which had been in the cup was now in direct
contact with the mercury into which previously the cup had
dipped. No change in the resistance of the circuit was produced
by this. To secure this result it was necessary that a consider
able area of the platinum should dip into the mercury ; 'and
this condition was in the experiments always carefully at
tended to. The resistance of these connecting-pieces was thus
found to be '00291 B.A. unit.
   The tubes were compared both with the B.A. units and also
with the Legal-Ohm standards. In the comparison with the
B.A. units, a large amount—about 300 divisions, or ‘015 B.A.
unit—of the bridge-wire was used. Since the resistance of the

bridge-wire is known at 15°, this required, when the tempe
rature of the room was as low as 10 or 2°, correcting for
temperature; but as the whole correction amounted to less
than 2 per cent. of the bridge-wire used, while this again was
only 1'5 per cent. of the resistance measured, no very accurate
knowledge of the temperature of the wire was needed.                   In
some cases a coil of 100 B.A. units was put in multiple arc
with the mercury tube; and the resistance of the combination,
which amounted to a little over 1 B.A. unit, was compared
with the wire standard.

   With regard to the observations on No. 37, it will be seen
 that they are extremely close, the greatest difference between

                 some Mkrcury Resistance Standards.                      73
any two is '00012 B.A. unit, or rather more than 1 in 10,000 ;
and no appreciable change was produced by passing the mer
cury through the tubes. The observations on No. 39 are not
quite so close.      On January 6 a distinct change was caused
by passing the mercury through ; after that date the results
are fairly consistent, and no further alteration was observed ;
the mean of the values found after this date may be taken as
the resistance of the tube to an accuracy of about 1 in 10,000.
   The two results therefore are:—
             No. 37 ......              1'01106 B.A. units.
             No.              .... ..   1'01032 B.A. units.
   The observations in 1885 were reduced to Legal Ohms,
using the value for the resistance of mercury in terms of the
B.A. unit adopted by the B.A. Committee in that year, and
based on Lord Rayleigh’s experiments. According to this
1 Legal Ohn1=1'0112 B.A. units.
   If we take these values we have as the resistances in Legal
Ohms the following :—

   Comparing the last two columns we see that the tubes have
apparently fallen in value relative to the standard Flat in the
5%» years by '00004, but this quantity is too small to be really
certain of. The results of the experiments therefore prove
within this limit that the platinum-silver coil Flat has not
altered relative to the mercury-tubes in this interval. The
difference between the values found by Benoit and myself
depends on the value used for the resistance of mercury in
B.A. units.       According to Lord Rayleigh *, the resistance of
a column of mercury 100 cm. long, 1 sq. mm. in section, at
0° C., is '95412 B.A. unit, and this is the value which has
been used in the above. The value found by Mr. Fitzpatrick‘l'
and myself for this resistance was '95352. Practically the
same number has been obtained by Wuilleumeier i, Hutchin
son §, and Salvioni II.       If this number be adopted, then
              1 Legal Ohm=106 x '95352 B.A. unit.
                               =1'01073 B.A. units.

and these numbers show an extremely close agreement, thus
proving that the resistance of a column of mercury 100 cm.
in length, 1 sq. mm. in section, as given in this indirect way
by Benoit’s experiments, is very close to the value '9535
B.A. unit.
    In my previous paper * are given some values for the change
of resistance of mercury with temperature. On January 3 I
observed the resistances of the tubes Nos. 37 and 39 at a
temperature of l2°'9 C. The results were :—
                                          Resistance at 12°-9.
                     37.. .............. ..     1'02254
                     39.. .............. ..     102193
From these we get as the values of the coefficients per 1° (1.,
'000875 and '000870 respectively. Thus the mean coefficient
between 0° and 13° is '000872. This agrees well with the
values found in 1885, the mean value between 0° and 10°
being '000861, and between 0° and 15° '000879. From these
we have as the value between 0° and 13°, '000872.
    Benoit'l' and Streckeri give higher values than the above,
Strecker’s Value between 0° and 13° being '000906.
    In the paper on the speci<U+FB01>c resistance of mercury, Phil.
Trans. A, 1888, I have called attention to some of the .conse
quences of this difference. The value of the coef<U+FB01>cient be
tween 0° and 10° found by Mr. Fitzpatrick and myself in
1888 was '000876. Kohlrausch§ and Strecker || <U+FB01>nd as the
values for the resistance of mercury in B.A. units, '95338 and
'95334; these are less than the value found by Salvioni,
Hutchinson, Wuilleumeier, and myself, and the difference is,
I believe, mainly due to the uncertainty in the temperature
coefficient. They both worked with their tubes in a bath at
about the temperature of the room, and reduced their results
to 0° by the use of Strecker’s coef<U+FB01>cient. The mean tem
perature adopted by Kohlrausch was 10°, he puts
                                 a-0 = —610

       XII. 0n the Mutual Solubility of Salts in Water.
                          By J. E. TREVOR *.
    NTEREST in this problem has been a ain aroused by a
      new investigation by Dr. W. W. J. icol 1', in which is
presented a review of the older literature, together with new
solubility determinations and a series of interpolation formulae
to express the results. Inasmuch as no mention is made of
the recent investigations which have shed so much light
upon this hitherto dark subject, I take this opportunit to
call attention to the solidly grounded explanations which
characterize the more recent progress in the study of the
complicated phenomena which are here presented.
    That the addition of a salt to the saturated solution of
another sometimes increases, sometimes diminishes the solu
bility of the latter, has been long known. The explanation Was
<U+FB01>rst given in 1889 by Nemst I, in a simple application of
the famous Law of Mass Action§ to the conditions of electro
lytic dissociation shown by Arrhenius II to exist in aqueous
solutions of electrolytes, to which class of bodies the inorganic
salts belong. This theory, as is well known, indicates the
necessity for assuming the dissociation of a certain portion of
the dissolved electrolyte into its ions, and is intimately con
nected with the van’t Hoff theory of osmotic pressure 1i, which
shows the entire analogy between the conditions of bodies in
gaseous form and in solution. The undissociated dissolved
molecules and the dissociated ions produce the same pressure
effects as the undissociated and dissociated molecules of a
gas.   Direct application of the laws of gases explains the

76                  Mr. J. E. Trevor on the Mutual
phenomena of solution. If to a saturated volume of a partially
dissociated gas be added one of its gaseous dissociation pro
ducts, as for example NH's to dissociated NH4Cl vapour, the
partial pressures of this constituent are added together and
the dissociation is decreased, solid ammonium chloride is pre
cipitated. An indifferent gas, as nitrogen, produces no such
e<U+FB02>'ect. In the same way, if one of the dissociated ions be added
to the saturated solution of a dissociated salt, the dissociation
will decrease and solid saltwill be precipitated. For example,
in Dr. Nicol’s experiment with the chlorides: in KCl solution
a considerable proportion of the salt molecules are dissociated
into K and Cl ions. Cl ions alone cannot be added to the
solution; addition of NaCl, however, adds Cl ions, together
with an equivalent amount of Na ions, which latter act in
di<U+FB01>'erently, just as the nitrogen in the case of dissociated
ammonium chloride. The partial (osmotic) pressure of these
Cl ions is added to that of those already present and solid
salt is precipitated, the solubility of the KCl is decreased.
   This consideration applies generally to cases of the mutual
in<U+FB02>uence of dissociated bodies with a common ion upon the
solubilities of one another, including Dr. Nicol’s “Fresh <U+FB01>eld
of investigation” in determining the solubilities of one salt
in solutions of various degrees of concentration of another.
The requirements of the theory have been shown by Nernst *
and Noyes 1' to hold quantitatively in cases of rather slightly
soluble substances, as, for example, a. Brom-iso-cinnamic acid
with oxanilic acid, AgBrO3 with AgN03 and KBrOa, and
many more. In the cases of ver soluble salts, where the
osmotic pressure is measured by undreds of atmospheres,
the question becomes far more complicated, owing to the
serious variations from the simple laws of gases, which are
manifested at such high pressures in solutions as well as in
gases proper. For this reason it is impossible to calculate
quantitatively the results in the cases which Dr. Nicol has
given, yet without the simple explanation which the above
mentioned recent researches have made clear, the phenomena
would be entirely unintelligible, for in the case of any pair
of salts it could not be foreseen whether an increase or de
crease of mutual solubility would take place.               A continuation
of this line of work has brought a simple explanation of those
anomalous cases where the solubility of an electrolyte is in
creased by the addition of a dissociated body with a common
ion.    A striking example is the strong increase in the solu
              " Nernst, Zeitschr. fiir phys. Chem. iv. p. 372.

                      Solubility of Salts in Water.                      77
bility of mercuric chloride (HgClg) caused by the addition of
hydrochloric acid (with the common Cl ion) to the solution.
For this and a number of allied cases the explanation has
been shown by Le Blane and Noyes* to lie in the combina
tion of HgGl2 and HCl to form double molecules, a different
substance with a different solubility.                The determinations
were made by observation of the freezing-points of the
solutions, the lowering of the freezing-point being, as has
been shown by Raoult and others 1', a function of the number
of molecules (or free ions) in the solution.
    Further work in this same directioni has applied, with
quantitative results, the Law of Mass Action to cases of the
mutual in<U+FB02>uence of the solubilities of pairs of salts which do
not possess a common ion. This work is of extraordinary
interest, since without the above indicated theoretical explana
tion the observed phenomena would seem entirely without
meaning, the results could not in any way be foreseen. The
possibility of quantitative experiment is in this entire <U+FB01>eld
limited only by such concentrations which produce an osmotic
pressure in the solution not so great that the laws of gases no
longer hold.
    That these results already obtained agree over such a range
as that including inorganic salts and organic acids is strong
evidence for the soundness of the assumptions upon which the
work is based, more especially so since, so far as my informa
tion goes, no other explanation whatever has been able to
account for the facts.
    It will be of interest to state that the above developed con
siderations explain the action of a method used by Dr. Nicol
in purifying the chlorides and nitrates used by him, that of
precipitating the former by hydrochloric acid and the latter
by nitric acid. In this case the common ion Cl or NO, added
decreases, in the way explained, the solubility of the salt,
which is consequently precipitated. In the same way, to
increase the insolubility of a precipitate a little sulphuric acid
is by analysts added to the wash-water in washing out lead
sulphate, or, in general, an addition of some of the precipitating
 reagent to increase the insolubility of a precipitate.
    As bearing upon this question 1 take the opportunity to
 communicate some results recently obtained by me § in a case
of mutual solubility where the formation of a double salt is

possible. The salts chosen were the sulphates of potassium
and copper, from whose common solution the well-known
double salt KeCu(SO,,)2.6H20 is easily obtained. That the
components were not, at least to an appreciable extent, com
bined to double molecules in the concentrated solution of
the double salt, was shown by the possibility of separating
them by diffusion ; and the interestin fact was further
brought out, that a saturated solution of t e two salts together
was possible, in which both were present in the approximate
ratio of their separate solubilities; this condition of solution
was, however, rendered unstable by the tendency of the more
insoluble double salt to crystallize out.        This result had been
already foreseen and theoretically explained by Ostwald *.
It was further shown that either salt, added in solid form,
will not drive the other entirely out of its saturated solution,
as had been maintained by Riidor<U+FB02>“, but that in each case a.
de<U+FB01>nite state of equilibrium occurs where the solution is not
 changed by further additions.         These equilibria are the same
whether the salts be added each to the saturated solution of
the other, or directly to that of the double salt.
    By such investigations as the one just quoted, by means of
 diffusion, and more particularly by the method of determina
 tion of the lowering of the freezing-point of solutions, made
 use of by Le Blanc and Noyes, are the answers brought to the
 objection of Dr. Nicol that we cannot tell whether the double
 molecules be formed in the solution or only at the moment
of separation of the solid salt.
    To answer this objection it is not even necessary to assume
 the electrolytic dissociation; the simple fact shown by Riidor<U+FB01>',
 whose work Dr. Nicol quotes, that from saturated double salt
 solutions the constituent salts may be separated by diffusion,
 demonstrates that the double molecules cannot to an appreci
 able extent be present.
    The main question, however, that of reciprocal solubilities,
has, as 1 have endeavoured to point out, already been answered.
 The extension of the theory quantitatively to concentrated
 solutions of very soluble salts is seriously complicated by the
 variations from the simple laws of gases which occur with
 the high osmotic pressures there found, and this extension
must come from a study of these variations and not from
.the building up of interpolation formulae to represent solu
bilities.

   Liquids. By S. SKINNER, MA, Demonstrator at the
   Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge".
THE special features of the apparatus are (a) its very large
       bulb, (b) an arrangement to facilitate the <U+FB01>lling and
emptying processes. The volume of the globe is 1300 cubic
centimetres, so that a small alteration of pressure, such as
half an atmosphere, produces a considerable movement of the
index in the capillary tube of which the capacity per cm.
is '003 cubic centim. To facilitate the introduction of liquids
a second tube, closed by a stop-cock, is sealed in at the lower
portion of the globe, and this is connected by a rubber-tube
with a side reservoir. If a liquid be poured in the reservoir
and the stop-cock be opened, the liquid will <U+FB02>ow into the
globe.    The apparatus is supported on a base-board through
which the tube carrying the stop-cock passes. A bell-jar
stands on the base-board and is in connexion with a condensing
air-pump and a mercurial pressure-gauge.
   The behaviour of the apparatus has been tested by using it
for a determination of the compressibility of water, with the
following results :—

   The apparatus has been applied to the comparison of the
compressibility of solutions with that of the solvents, and the
results exhibit the same general relations as with other
properties of solutions.    The solutions divide themselves into
two classes, which may be broadly termed electrolytic and
non-electrolytic. In the <U+FB01>rst there is a very considerable
decrease in compressibility, as much as 8 per cent. with a
3-per-cent. solution of NaCl; whilst in the second there is
but a slight diminution, quite beyond the limits of accuracy
of the apparatus. For instance, a 5-per-cent. solution of
naphthalene has a diminution of under 1 per cent.
   A strict interpretation of the theory of osmotic pressure in
solutions has been made by Prof. J. J. Thomson, in his
“Applications of Dynamics to Physics and Chemistry,” § 97,
where he <U+FB01>nds that l gram-equivalent per litre would decrease
the compressibility by 1 part in a thousand. Non-electrolytes
in dilute solution appear to follow this law; this is in agree
ment with their other properties, such as alteration in boiling
or freezing-points.
   The diagram will serve to explain the general arrangement
of the apparatus.

       “Hertz’s Emperiment.” By FRED. T. TROUTON*.
OWING to the requirements of certain refraction experi
        ments in which I was engaged, it became necessary to
investigate more fully than had been previously done‘l‘ the
in<U+FB02>uence the size of the re<U+FB02>ector has in determining the
position of the nodes in Hertz’s now well-known electro
magnetic interference experiment.
   Radiation of a suitable period was produced by Hertz for
this experiment, as is well known, by taking advantage of the
alternating character of the discharge of an electric condenser.
For this purpose two similar conductors, generally speaking
two brass cylinders, are placed together end to end with a
spark-gap between them, and are charged by an induction
coil, with the poles of which they are connected.    The rapidly
alternating current which occurs between them at each dis
charge originates electromagnetic waves which spread out
into space. In these waves the electric component is parallel
to the common axis of the cylinders, while the magnetic com
ponent lies at right angles.

Hertz employed in his interference experiments a simple
circle of wire interrupted at one place by a short gap, the
wire being of such a length that the period of electric oscil
lations from end to end on it is the same as that of the radia
tion with which it is to be used, so that the currents induced
in the wire by a series of waves are s chronously reinforced
until the ends, always oppositely c arged, over<U+FB02>ow, and a
spark occurs.
    By means of perpendicular re<U+FB02>exion from a metallic sheet
a beam of the same period travelling in the opposite direction
is obtained which will interfere with the direct one, and a.
series of loops and nodes result, just as in an organ-pipe.
The position of these nodes Hertz detected by the use of the
resonating receiver, the nodes and loops being distinguished
by the variation in the intensity of the sparking across the
gap as the distance of the resonator from the re<U+FB02>ector was
changed. The ma etic and electric forces in these stationary
waves are everyw ere complementary, that is, where one is
a maximum the other is a minimum. The <U+FB01>rst magnetic
node or place of minimum intensity of that force is situated
at one quarter the wave-length from the re<U+FB02>ecting sheet,
and so on for the others, in the usual sequence of loops and
nodes.
    Some time since I observed that the distance of the nodes
from the re<U+FB02>ector was in<U+FB02>uenced by its size, and a short
account was given in a paper in ‘Nature,’ vol. xl. p. 399, but
until the present no determinations were described systema
ticall made with various sized re<U+FB02>ectors.
    W en a number of square sheets of various sizes were tried
as reflectors, it was found that as the sheet became smaller
the distance of the node from the sheet became greater.
The increase seemed to tend towards becomin one eighth of
the wave-length as the size of the re<U+FB02>ector       iminished, but
with small sheets the intensity of the re<U+FB02>exion is very slight,
and so it soon becomes impossible to make any satisfactory
determination.
    Perhaps the most noticeable thing in connexion with re
 <U+FB02>exion from sheets of limited size is the great difference in
 the effect, where the sheet is rectan ular in shape, according
 as its long dimension is parallel to t e direction of the mag
 netic or electric component of the incident wave.      This un
 doubtedly is connected with the accumulation of charge on
 its edges, according as they lie in the direction suitable for it
 or not. A long narrow strip (say anywhere between one
 quarter and one half the wave-length in width) held with its

82            Mr. F. T. Trouton on the Irp‘luence of
length parallel to the magnetic direction, has the node nearly
as far out as if it were a square. But with the same strip
held at right angles, parallel to the electric direction, the node
is practically at one quarter the wave-length, just as it would
be for an in<U+FB01>nite sheet.
   It was thought desirable, in making the experiments, to
use long strips for re<U+FB02>ectors, as being a somewhat simpler
case than square plates. In the present determinations the
position of the node was found for a number of long strips of
regularly increasing widths, <U+FB01>rst, when the long dimension
of the re<U+FB02>ector was held in the direction of the magnetic
component, in which case the great shifting outwards of the
node occurs; and, secondly, when held at right angles, or in
the electric direction, in which case there is generally little
or no effect to be found.
    Nothing further as to the character of the effect than had
been previously observed was noticeable in the <U+FB01>rst case; but
in the second case, that is where the length of the strip is
 held in the electric direction, a distinct peculiarity was found
when the strip was very narrow. It may be remarked that
 good re<U+FB02>exion can be obtained from strips in the second case
 quite too narrow to afford re<U+FB02>exion when held at right angles
in the magnetic direction as in the <U+FB01>rst set.       And it is with
 these very narrow strips that the peculiarity is noticed. The
node, which until the strip is very narrow is practically un
 affected by the width of the strip, is now situated nearer the
 re<U+FB02>ector than one quarter the wave-length. This has con
 siderable interest attached to it because it was really observed
 by Hertz in his original experiments, though be attributed it
 accidentally to quite another cause.
    The vibrator or source of radiation employed in the follow
 ing experiments consisted of two brass cylinders with rounded
 gilt ends (about 13 cm. long and 3 cm. in diameter), placed near
 each other in the focal line of a cylindrical parabolic mirror
 so as to give a parallel beam. It afforded radiation containing
 waves of a variety of periods*, but that selected by the “ re
 sonator ” employed had a wave-length of 68 cm. The reso
 nator, which was of the circular type, was placed in the centre
 of the beam at about 2 m. from the vibrator, in front of the
 metallic sheet used as re<U+FB02>ector. It was always held so as to
 receive the magnetic component only, that is in the plane
 containing the axis of the vibrator, and with the diameter of
 the circle throu h the spark-gap parallel to this axis ; in this
 position, only t e magnetic lines of force can take effect.
 Thus throughout the following the magnetic force alone is

      dealt with, and so, in speaking of the nodes, the places of
       minimum magnetic force alone are meant.
          Care was taken, when determining the wave-length, to
      have as re<U+FB02>ector a sheet suf<U+FB01>ciently large so that no increase
      in size could produce any change in the distance of the nodes
      from it. When this is the case, it may be considered in<U+FB01>nite
      in extent. The large sheet was then replaced in turn by
      smaller sheets, and the, position of the node in each case
      observed. The experiments, as mentioned before, divide
      themselves into two parts. First, where an in<U+FB01>nite re<U+FB02>ector
      is, so to speak, gradually shortened in the direction of the
      electric component of the wave, but remains unaltered at
      right angles, whilst the accompanying change, if any, in the
      position of the node is observed; and, second, when the
      shortening takes place in the direction of the magnetic com
      ponent.
         The general results of the <U+FB01>rst set of experiments are seen
      at a glance by means of <U+FB01>g. 1. The abscissae here represent
      the length of the re<U+FB02>ector in the direction of the electric
      component, while the ordinates represent on the same scale
      corresponding to each sized re<U+FB02>ector the distance of the re
      sonator from the re<U+FB02>ector when placed in the <U+FB01>rst position of
      minimum sparking. The length of the re<U+FB02>ector in the direc
      tion of the magnetic component was 90 cm., as that was found
      to be amply suf<U+FB01>cient, i. e. increase was found to produce no
      e<U+FB01>'ect. The resonator was held in front of the centre of the
      re<U+FB02>ector.

   The effect produced in the re<U+FB02>ected wave by shortening
the re<U+FB02>ector in the direction of the electric component can
be considered equivalent to an acceleration or~change of
phase on re<U+FB02>exion. This equivalent change of phase is at
least double that corresponding to the distance the node is
shifted, because of the double journey back and forwards
which the re<U+FB02>ected wave has to make. But the complete
change in phase must be really greater than this, for it is to
be remarked that the node observed in these experiments is
peculiar, and differs from that ordinarily considered where
two non-divergent beams travelling in 0p osite directions
interfere. The beam re<U+FB02>ected from a sma                re<U+FB02>ector is di
vergent, and consequently diminishes rapidly in intensity on
proceeding outwards. This causes the node or minimum
sparking-position to be a little nearer the re<U+FB02>ector than the
true position of opposite phase. The intensity of the re<U+FB02>ected
vibration at this point, before it can be subtracted from the
incident one, has no doubt to be diminished in proportion to
the cosine of the difference in phase between them; but this
is more than made up for by the increase in intensity due to
its nearer position, so that the approximation towards com
plete interference is better here than at the true phasial
position. That the interference, then, is comparatively slight
is seen by the fact that with the smaller sized re<U+FB02>ectors it is

                          sheets are employed as re<U+FB02>ectors.
                             Without being able to calculate in the case of a given sized
                          re<U+FB02>ector what the amount of the equivalent acceleration in
                          phase should be, it can be seen that there should be a difference
                          in phase between the current induced in the reflector and the
                          incident wave when the re<U+FB02>ector is short in the electric direc

                          reach its zero value sooner than when there are no edges for
                          the accumulation of char 0.
                            The problem of<U+FB01>nding the re<U+FB02>exion from a re<U+FB02>ector of limited
                          size presents considerable dif<U+FB01>culties. An approximation, how
                          ever, has been obtained by the author* by taking advantage
                          of Hertz’s solution in the case of his “vibrator.” The short
                          re<U+FB02>ector is assumed equivalent to another vibrator, and Hertz’s
                          equations of the wave are found for it, by making the total
                          magnetic force due to both primary and secondary vibrator
                          behind the sheet zero. This necessitates assuming that the
                          re<U+FB02>exion comes from the central part only. This condition
                          renders it very limited in its application; nevertheless calcu
                          lation made by it of the position of the node shows it dis
                          placed at all events in the right direction, and to an extent
                          comparable with observation.           This method leads naturally
                          to looking at the cause of the displacement, from the point of
                          view of an increased velocity of the wave in the neighbour
                          hood of the re<U+FB02>ector, for so it appears in Hertz’s theory of
                          his “ vibrator.”

 86             Mr. F. T. Trouton 0n the In<U+FB02>uence of
 displacement of the node or minimum sparking-position is
 absent in this case.
    On reaching comparatively small dimensions the inward
 shifting of the node takes place.         This is probably best attri
 buted not to a change in phase on re<U+FB02>exion or diminution in
 velocity in transit, but to the fact that the beam is rapidly
 diminishing in intensity on passing outward from the re
 <U+FB02>ector, and, as mentioned before, the minimum sparking-posi
 tion is a compromise between the phase and the intensity.
    It might be thou ht that this action would never displace
 the node bya sensib e amount, but the following consideration
 shows this not to be so. Let

tion, the value found for m is about 15'8—which is a shifting
inwards considerable in de<U+FB01>cit. It is thus evident that, apart
from other considerations, a rapid falling-off in the intensity
of the re<U+FB02>ected disturbance is quite competent to effect an
appreciable inward displacement of the node. However, it
must be remembered that in cases like the present, where the
intensity of one component changes rapidly with the distance,
the minimum sparking-position must only be considered as a
kind ofpseudonode, not a true phasial one.
   Taking a long shaped strip of zinc about 20 cm. wide, the
experiment alluded to above, one somewhat analogous to
Stokes’s ‘Experimentum Crucis,’ is easil made. The posi
tion of the node when the strip is stretched in the electric
direction, that is with its small dimension in the magnetic,
will be found to be distant about one quarter the wave
length, much the same as with an in<U+FB01>nite sheet; but on
rotating the strip through 90° into the magnetic direction
the node will be displaced outward, showing clearly the
dependency of the effect on the two directions.

from which the second curve was plotted.      In the <U+FB01>rst column

   It will be seen that it was possible to obtain determinations
with much narrower re<U+FB02>ectors in the present experiments
than was previously found possible when dealing with the
strips held so as to be short in the electric direction. Thus a
given sized strip evidently must re<U+FB02>ect less strongly when
held so that its longest edge is the one which becomes charged

88            Mr. F. T. Trouton on the In<U+FB02>uence of
each oscillation, that is to say, with this edge at right angles
to the electric component. And, indeed, this is as we should
expect, since on comparison we see that in this case there is
less area which can act effectively as a source of re<U+FB01>exion
through the passage on it of current each oscillation. For
all the electricity of course does not go to the very edge, but
there is gradual accumulation of charge over the surface ap
proaching the edge, increasing no doubt up to it.         Conse
quently the current diminishes in intensity towards the edges,
and thus it is only those parts of the re<U+FB02>ector remote from
the charged edges which can be considered completely effec
tive in producing the magnetic com onent of the re<U+FB02>ected
beam. Each centimetre of charged e ge, so to speak, reduces
the effective area of a re<U+FB02>ector, so that with a rectangular
sheet strongest re<U+FB02>exion is obtained when the edge charged
is shortest.
   A very slight increase in the nodal distance is seen by the
table to occur when the reflector is somewhat less than half
a wave-length wide; this may require further experiments of
a more sensitive character before being <U+FB01>nally accepted. If
it be the case, it would seem as if there were really an accele
ration of phase on re<U+FB02>exion from mirrors small in the mag
netic direction also, but so slight as to be [almost entirely
masked by the inward tendency due to divergency in the
re<U+FB02>ected beam. If we look at it from a purely optical point
of view, Fresnel’s theory indeed represents a linear re<U+FB02>ector
as having an acceleration of phase of g-rr; however, this is
omitting all considerations of direction in the vibration ;
but we have seen that the whole phenomenon requires a
treatment introducing a difference depending upon the mag
netic and electric directions. An acceleration of gs might
suit very well in the magnetic case, but it is certainly insuf
<U+FB01>cient when the re<U+FB02>ector is narrow in the electric direction,
as is seen from Table I.        With a quarter wave-length of
 17 cm., the effect of a change in phase of gun- on re<U+FB02>exion
would be to shift the node out to 21'25 cm., that is out
through T16 the wave-length; but this is seen by the Table to -
 be much too little, especially so when we remember that the
 observed minimum sparking-position must always be some
 what nearer the re<U+FB02>ector on account of the divergency effect
 than the true position of opposite phases.
    The result of diminishing the re<U+FB02>ecting sheet simultaneously
in both directions was also examined, but though it was very
 evident that the reduced dimension in each direction tended
 towards possessing its own respective effect, no simple rela
 tion between them exhibited itself ; thus with a re<U+FB02>ector

            Size of Re<U+FB02>ector in “Hertz’s Experiment.”          89
24 cm. square, the node was found at 224 cm., a little further
than 21'8, which it is at when the sheet is long in the
magnetic direction (Table 1.), and this is as it should be,
shifted out owing to both. Again, a re<U+FB02>ector 24 cm. in the
electric direction, and 10 cm. in the magnetic, had a node at
21‘5 cm., a little less than with a long sheet, and this also is
in the direction to be anticipated.       Some few other experi
ments were made, but in the absence of a workable theory
for the whole phenomenon, it was thought undesirable to
pursue the matter further at present.
    An interesting point arises in connexion with those ex
periments made with the re<U+FB02>ector narrow in the magnetic
direction, in which an inward shifting of the node was ob
served. In Hertz’s original determinations he found that
the <U+FB01>rst node was situated not quite so much as 1,1 the wave
length from the re<U+FB02>ector. He attributed this to imperfect
 re<U+FB02>exion arising from imperfect conductivity in the material
 of his re<U+FB02>ector, which was a large sandstone wall with a
number of gas-pipes across it, and had on it besides to in
 crease the effect a zinc sheet 2 m. long in the magnetic
 direction and 4 m. long in the electric; there were also wires
 attached to the ends of the sheet for leading off the charges,
 so that it must have been equivalent to a much longer one in
 the electric direction. Now it seems probable that the sheet
 was sensibly the only thing that re<U+FB02>ected, and that the in
 ward dis lacement was really due to its comparatively small
 size in the magnetic direction, for the wave-length he em
 ployed was nearly 10 m., so that the re<U+FB02>ector was about
 % the wave-length in width. This corresponds to about a
 14 cm. mirror with a wave-length of 68 cm.
    Hertz found the inward displacement correspondingly
   reater than is given in Table 11., but his incident beam must
 gave been divergent, as he worked nearer the vibrator in pro
 portion to the wave-length, while my beam was rendered
 fairly parallel by the parabolic mirror employed.
    To make quite sure that in re<U+FB02>exion off a large sheet the
 <U+FB01>rst nodal distance 17 cm. was really one quarter the wave
 length, the position of' the second node was redetermined and
 found to be distanced from the re<U+FB02>ector about 51 cm.—the
 mean of <U+FB01>ve determinations*. The vibrator in these experi#
  ments was over three wave-lengths away from the re<U+FB02>ector.
     It is very convenient, in carrying out these experiments, to
 have an arrangement for moving the resonator backwards and
  forwards a known amount. A simple arrangement for effect.
  ing this is to support the resonator at one end of a rod
       *2nd node..|l 49} l    51% l 60% l 50 l 51       H 50-6

pivoted in the middle, and kept vertical by a weight attached
to the other end.      By means of two screw-stops the excur
sion to either side of the vertical position is limited to any
desired amount. The method of procedure in identif ing a
node is, then, to <U+FB01>nd a position for the resonator such t at on
moving it an equal amount to either side, sparking just takes
place. This can of course be done with facility in a darkened
room.
   When possible, it is still more convenient to move the re
<U+FB02>ector backwards and forwards a known amount, instead of
moving the resonator, and the node is found similarly to
before as the position where sparking just occurs in the ex
treme position of the re<U+FB02>ector ; this admits of being done
when the re<U+FB02>ector is small. The re<U+FB02>ector was suspended by
vertical cords about 3 m. long, and could be thus moved
backwards and forwards practically parallel to itself with
the greatest ease even in the dark, the amount of the move
ment being limited by stops. The advantage of this arrange
ment is that the adjustment of the resonator is unaffected, for
when it is the resonator that is moved the disturbance is very
liable to alter the spark-gap.
   I have much pleasure here in thanking Prof. Fitzgerald
for his advice and material encouragement on many occasions
throughout the investigation.
   Note—Since sendin off to the printers’ I have learnt that
MM. Sarasin and De a Rive (Phil. Mag. June 1891) have,
unlike Hertz, observed no inward displacement of the node
towards the re<U+FB02>ector.       Their experiments are quite in agree
ment with the explanation given above, for their re<U+FB02>ector
was about a wave-length in the direction of the magnetic
component.
XV. Mr. Sydney Lupton’s Method of Reducing the Results
   of Experiments. By SPENCER UMFREVILLE PICKERING,
   M.A., 1111?..15'3I
     HE conclusions which I drew from an examination of
       various properties of sulphuric-acid solutions (Chem.
Soc. Trans. 1890, pp. 64 and 331 ; Phil. Mag. xxix. p. 427)
have recently been made the subject of an adverse criticism
by Mr. Sydney Lupton in the pages of this Magazine
(vol. xxxi. p. 418).                   '
                     f Communicated by thelAuthor.A ,

               Reducing the Results of Experiments.                   91
     The properties examined by me were the heat of dissolu
tion, electric conductivity, heat capacity, freezing-point,
 densities (4 sets of determinations at different temperatures),
 contraction on mixing and expansion by heat (for 3 different
 intervals of temperature); and, as I repeatedly insisted, the
 whole strength of my conclusions rested on the fact that all
 these different properties, forming <U+FB01>gures differing s0 entirely,
 as they did, from each other in general appearance (see Phil.
 Mag. xxix. pp. 430, 431), yet indicated the existence of
 changes of curvature at the same oints. The indications
 were obtained by examining both the experimental <U+FB01>gures,
 and also the curves representing the rate of change of the
 properties with change of composition (the direct <U+FB01>rst differ
 ential), with the help of a bent ruler ; totally different methods
 of plotting, moreover, were adopted, without in any way
 modifying the conclusions drawn, and these conclusions were
 further strengthened by the fact that the various sections in
 which the whole <U+FB01>gures have to be drawn all appeared to be
 curves of a similar nature—parabolas of a certain order—as
was proved by their yielding straight lines on further differ
 entiation, and also by the fact that these changes, wherever
it was possible to draw any conclusion at all on this head,
occurred at simple molecular proportions of the acid and
water.
     Thus the main feature of the evidence 011 which I relied
 was its cumulative character, and this Mr. Lupton seems to
have entirely ignored. My determinations numbered 1100 ;
 of these he has examined 10: the indications of changes of
 curvature numbered 102*; of these he has examined one, and
 by disproving this one he thinks he will discredit the whole
 work.
     This being the character of my work and of the criticism
 levelled against it, it is rather surprising to <U+FB01>nd Mr. Lupton
 opening his remarks with the following sentence :—“ In the
hurry of modern life experimentalists are apt to omit the test
of accuracy afforded by obtaining the same results by several
 different methods. Thus long rows of <U+FB01>gures are frequently
given which have in reality no experimental basis to rest
11 pIon.’
       scarcely think that I shall be unfair if I accuse Mr.
Iiupton of attacking my work before he has made himself
master of the description of it. He complains of the absence
of those very details which he might have found by looking
    * N0t, however, at 102 dg'ferent percentages, as Professor Armstrong
imagines (see Chem. Soc. Proc. 1891, p. 106).

92      Mr. S. U. Pickering on Mr. Lupton’s Method of
through my papers: he raises numerous minor objections,
nearly all of which I have fully answered, and his chief
weapon of offence is the representation of a small portion of
one of the sets of my density results by a parabola deduced
mathematically, and which, if strictly applicable, would nega
tive the existence of one of the changes of curvature which I
considered probable, in ignorance of the fact that I myself
had applied the same method of examination to the same
portion of all but the same curve, and had shown why the
results obtained did not negative the existence of the change
in question (Chem. Soc. Trans. 1890, p. 78). From this ex
amination Mr. Lupton arrives at a similar provisional conclu
sion to what I did, “if the limits of accuracy are <U+FB01>lm,” then
this small portion of this series of my “results can be ex
pressed by a single curve.”       But, apparently, “ the hurry of
modern life” prevented Mr. Lupton from ascertaining whether
the experimental error was 55166, and whether, therefore,
this result led to any argument against my conclusions.
But 000 is a somewhat large quantity when it refers to the
weight of 25 c.c. of strong sulphuric-acid solutions; it is
about 8 milligrams; and had Mr. Lupton taken the trouble to
ascertain from the numerous values available for this purpose
 (Trans. 1890, pp. 70, 71 ; Phil. Mag. xxx. p. 402) what the
probable experimental error really was, he would have found
that it was not FOLD?” not 56%“, and scarcely even ~561W6.
   As Mr. Lupton’s argument depends entirely on t e con
cordance between the values calculated from his equation and
the experimental values, it was certainly incumbent on him
to make sure that his calculations were correct ; but this he
did not do, and of the two errors which he made one was a
very important one *.      I therefore take the liberty of iving
the following amended version of the <U+FB01>rst and last co umns
of his table, in which a: is the percentage strength of the
solution, and u calc. — u obs. the differences between the
actual densities and those calculated according to Mr. Lupton’s
equation, which represents these results as forming one con
tinuous parabolic curve. In two cases only out of the 10
results which Mr. Lupton investigated (50 to 68 per cent.)
does the difference even approach to 575%6—0, while the average
difference is W, that is 50 times greater than the probable
error mentioned above, and 23 times greater than the liberal
maximum which I allowed as, and also found to be, the limit
of error in the majority of cases (Chem. Soc. Trans. 1890,
p. 71) ; but, independently of this, the arrangement of the

    In the above table Mr. Lupton has, somewhat unfairly,
included two results (those in brackets), which, as I pointed
out (Chem. Trnas.) p. 70, table ii. p. 43, and plate 21'), were
evidently erroneous ; it is immaterial, however, whether they
are inserted in the above table or not; but I have omitted
them in the following sketch (p. 94), which gives a far more
striking illustration of the untenable nature of Mr. Lupton’s
contention that “the equation expresses the results with far
greater accuracy than could be attained by even the most
careful drawing.” As the densities themselves are unmanage
able for diagrammatic purposes, I have had to take the
differentials deduced directly from them.
    It is certainly extraordinary that Mr. Lupton should have
imagined that he could disprove by such means not only the
 one particular break in question, but also the 101 others
 described in my paper, and most of which were far better
 marked than this particular one. Indeed, it is by some strange
 accident that Mr. Lupton was led to attack the only one
   * These values are not given in Mr. Lupton’s table.
   1' The tables (100. cit), not the plates, must be taken as giving the
 correct values. The cross in plate 2 at 62 per cent. is misplaced, and
 should stand for the three differential points in its neighbourhood show
 ing the accidentally large errors. In the last column of the table on
 p. 142 for 5271 read 5301, and for 46'65 read 46-87.

   94     Mr. S. U. Pickering on Mr. Lupton’s Method of
   break in the density-curves which I mentioned as being “of a
   very doubtful character;” and it is by a still stranger accident
   that the only hydrate on which his investigation “ seems to
   throw very grave suspicion,” is the very one which actually
   does exist, which has been isolated in the crystalline con
   dition (Chem. Soc. Trans. 1890, p. 339), and t0 the isolation
   of which I was led by a reliance on the very method which
   Mr. Lupton considers to be fallacious and worthless.

      So much for Mr. Lupton’s main argument ; it remains but
   to answer the minor objections which he raises.
'     1. Mr. Lupton (p. 420) is “astonished ” to <U+FB01>nd that I give
   the composition of the solutions to the <U+FB01>fth decimal place;
   but, as the relative composition of these solutions was correct
   to one unit in the fourth place (lac. cit. p. 73), I was only
   following precedent in so doing ; surely Mr. Lupton would

                Reducing the Results of Experiments.                   95
not quarrel with me for giving accurate tables merely because
the special application made of them did not require the full
degree of accuracy attained.
   2. Mr. Lupton is then “startled” to <U+FB01>nd that “in the
case of experiments, the whole object of which is extreme
accuracy,” there is a difference of <U+FB01>lm, on each side of the
mean in the ei ht analyses made of the stock acid *—analyses,
by the way, w<U+FB01>ich were not my own, and the results of which
I did not take.        But will he tell me how the accuracy of my
results would have been affected by a constant error of even
<U+FB01>lo—6 in the strength of all the solutions used? Or how my
conclusions would have been affected if, for instance, I had
found 5808 instead of 5814 per cent. as the position of a
change, when, for other reasons, this position could not, as a
rule, be correctly ascertained within 0'5 or 1'0 per cent. ?
    3. Mr. Lupton complains (p. 420) that I have given no
details as to my method of drawing curves.                  I had thought
that the details on p. 68, 69, and 184, 100. cit., would have
been su<U+FB01>icient, and t e only important omission I appear to
have made was that I did not mention that the <U+FB02>exible
ruler was held at its extremities, the middle portion only
being used for the drawing ; but this omission cannot account
for Mr. Lupton’s extraordinary conclusion, p. 421, that “ hence
the hydrates of sulphuric acid are apparently made to depend
upon the <U+FB02>exibility of the steel lath used.” Let Mr. Lupton
convince himself of the fallacy of this statement by a little
experimentation on the curves depicted above with laths of
different <U+FB02>exibility.
    4. Mr. Lupton refers to Prof. Lodge’s “word of warning ”
to experimentalists on the over-pressure of formulae (‘ Nature,’
July 18, 1889; see also my answer, August 8, 1889).                     It
is certainly remarkable that Mr. Lupton should consider that
this warning applies to me, who used not a single formula,
and not to himself, who is relying entirely on empirical
formulae.
    5. In the same way Mr. Lupton refers to Prof. Arrhenius’s
 premature criticism of my work, mentioning with approval
 that Arrhenius pointed out “that my equations for sulphuric
 acid required the introduction of nearly sixty constants.”
 Mr. Lupton is apparently in ignorance of my answer to
 Arrhenius (Phil. Mag. xxix. p. 433), and of the fact that since
 the time when this answer and the details of my results were
 published Arrhenius has never made good his criticism.                  I
   it Why does Mr. Lupton make only a partial quotation from my table
 of analyses (loo. cit. 72) P And why does he not calculate the probable
 error of the mean 0 these analyses P   It is only 15153633.

96       Mr. S. U. Pickering on Mr. Lupton’s Method of
 need onl      answer Mr. Lupton, as I did Arrhenius, by chal
 lenging him to point out one single equation or one single
 constant in the whole of my papers.
     6. Of the objections which Mr. Lupton considers “impugn
 the extreme accuracy of the experimental results ” (p. 425), but
 which apparently, “even if admitted, do not impugn their
great accuracy” (p. 429), the <U+FB01>rst is, that these results do not
 agree with those noted by Mendelée<U+FB01>‘l’. This is incorrect;
 I clearly stated t at the latter “showed such a very good
 general concordance with my own results that the may be
taken together with these as affording a further il ustration
of the effect of temperature on the <U+FB01> re ” (loc. cit. p. 79).
It was only in my interpretation of t e results that I dif
fered from Mendeléeff; and if Mr. Lupton will but com are
together the two <U+FB01>gures on page 81, Ice. cit., I scarcely t ink
that he will say that I was not justi<U+FB01>ed in doing so, or that
the accuracy of my results is impugned by the expression of
this difference of opinion.
    7. Mr. Lupton alludes to the well-known objections against
the piknometer. I have nothing to say in favour of this
instrument in its usual imperfect form: the only question
worth considering is whether the particular instrument which
I used gave correct results or not, and I have                'ven Mr.
Lupton ample means for judging for himself on that point.
I have shown that the error was less than that which might
reasonably be attributed to the errors of the balance and
thermometer used, that they were as small as those expe
rienced by the best experimentalists when using a Sprengel
tube, and moreover that the actual values which I obtained
with water at different temperatures agreed most completely
with those of Kopp and Pierre (lac. cit. p. 70, and Phil. Mag.
xxx. p. 406).       It may be worth mentioning that the only one
of the well-known objectionsto the ordinary piknometer which
Mr. Lupton cites is a mistaken objection, namely “that the
stopper does not go in to exactly the same position when un
equally pressed.” Such a defect would cause an error which
would be greater the greater the density of the liquid used ;
whereas the reverse is the case, as Mr. Lupton might have
ascertained by experiments with a faulty bottle. The real source
of inaccuracy in density-bottles is the fact that the imperfect
   * The italics are Mr. Lupton’s.
   1' Mr. Lupton quotes me as having said “ Mendeléeff’s values; ” but I
was careful to pomt out that the values used by Mendeléeff were col
lected from the results of other physicists (p . 66, 79). It would ill
become me to impugn the accuracy of any of        ndelée<U+FB01>’s-own deter
minations.

             Reducing the Results of Experiments.               97
<U+FB01>tting of the stopper offers other capillary openings besides
the legitimate one through the stopper; and this, from its
very nature, is a defect which may be absent either through
accident or through careful manufacture in a particular bottle.
   8. Mr. Lupton then complains that I do “ not mention any
precaution taken to reduce the <U+FB02>ask and weights to their true
weights in vacuo.”      The complaint is just, and my only
excuse for the omission must be that every text-book on
physics contains an account of the necessary “precaution.”
   9. The next complaint is that I mentioned no precautions
taken to remove the air dissolved in the solutions, or that
retained between the liquid and the glass. Again Mr. Lupton
is right ; I mentioned none, and, what is more, I took none,
because I did not see how they could be taken without alter
ing the composition of the solution in the one case, or altering
the capacity of the bottle by heating it to redness in the other.
I did mention, however, that I had satis<U+FB01>ed myself that the
air contained in the water used was insuf<U+FB01>cient to affect its
density (p. 73), and dfortiori it would be insuf<U+FB01>cient to affect
the density of the solutions made with it; while the numerous
determinations of the water-contents of the bottle, both after
it had been left dry in air for a long time, and also after it had
been in continuous use throughout the day, were suf<U+FB01>cient to
assure me that no a preciable error was introduced by any
air-<U+FB01>lm adhering to the glass.
   Mr. Lupton seems to imagine that 25 cubic centim. of a
liquid in which '0007 gram of air is dissolved will weigh '0007
gram more per 25 cubic centim. Matters are not quite so
simple as this, for the volume, as well as the weight, is altered
by the gas ; and if the effect of the air is similar to that of,
say, hydrochloric acid, the weight of the 25 cubic centim.
 would be increased b only '0001 gram.
    10. Mr. Lupton t en attacks me for applying the term
differentiation to the method which I adopted in analysing
 curves, on the ground that a true differential (as I pointed
out myself on p. 67) is of in<U+FB01>nitesimal magnitude. As, how
 ever, I explained fully the nature of the process which I
 adopted (for which there is no proper appellation), the name
 given to it was a very secondary consideration.
    11. Mr. Lupton then says that “ the smoothing process
 applied to my <U+FB01>rst differential diagram ought, if accurately
 performed, to get rid of those slight changes in-<U+FB01>rst differences
 which in the second differences mark changes of curvature, and
 therefore changes of hydration.” But why “ought”? Surely
 only on the strength of a fore one conclusion that there are no
 changes of curvature or of hydration. I must ask Mr. Lupton,
    Phil. May. S. 5. vol. 32.1%. 194. July 1891.           H

98            On Reducing the Results of Experiments.
just as I asked Prof. Arrhenius (from whom he seems to have
borrowed this argument, see Phil. Mag. xxix. p. 429), to
explain what he means b “accurate” or “ proper ” smoothing.
Why does he not take t e whole of one of my <U+FB01>rst differential
 density diagrams, and show how it may be accurately smoothed
 so as to obliterate all changes of curvature? Surely he cannot
 think that he has suf<U+FB01>ciently illustrated the feasibility of this
 by taking only a small portion of the most regular part of one
 of these <U+FB01> ures. And even if he does, I scarcely think that
 any one w o glances at the result depicted above (woodcut,
 p. 94) will consider that he has succeeded in the attempt.
     12. Lastly, Mr. Lupton says that I am self-condemned
 by having dealt with second di<U+FB01>'erences deduced from the
  smoothed <U+FB01>rst differential curve, while I admit that the indi
 vidual determinations through which the smooth curve was
  drawn are scarcely accurate enough for the direct deduction
  of second di<U+FB02>'erences. Mr. Lupton has evidently not carefully
  read p. 123 of my paper. To any one acquainted with phy
  sical methods it must seem absurd to state that the mean of a
  number of determinations, or the straight line or curve drawn
  through a number of determinations, is not, as a rule, more
  exact at any given point than are the individual experiments.
  Mr. Lupton might as well say that no statement could be
  made as to the inclination of a bank of stones, because the
  lines drawn between two neighbouring stones showed all sorts
  of different inclinations.
     Mr. Lupton has apparently had little experience in the
  practical manipulation of series of results; and if I have
  shown any de<U+FB01>ciency in forbearance towards him, I must
  crave his forgiveness, for he has entered on a task which
  should have been undertaken in no light mood, and only after
  a thorough mastery of the results which he proposed to
  demolish.     There are very few who can be expected to enter
  into the details of work such as that now under discussion,
   and the majority will consent to be led by the opinion of
   a critic who has presumably made himself acquainted with
   the intricacies of the subject, especially when he makes an
   effective bid for their con<U+FB01>dence by a display of whole pages
   of equations. If, however, Mr. Lupton can for a moment
   place himself in my position and imagine that he has a
   thousand and more determinations of a most tedious cha
   racter, the constant care and unremitting labour of two whole
   years, which are in danger of being blown to the winds by the
   breath of a super<U+FB01>cial critic, he will forgive me for an
   Warmth of expression which he might at <U+FB01>rst sight be inclined
   to resent.

 XVI. A Consideration of some of the Objections raised by
     Mr. Lupt0n* to Mr. Pickering’s ZVIethods of reducing
     Experimental Results. By EDWARD HAROLD HAYES,
     MAL, Fellow of New College, Oxford 1'.
‘     FEAR that it may appear very presumptuous in an in
       dividual whose work in a chemical laboratory has been
con<U+FB01>ned to the simplest cases of qualitative analysis, and
who has had no practice in dealing with any im ortant series
of experimental results, to attempt to question tlie validity of
the arguments advanced by an expert like Mr. Lupton. It
chances, however, that I have studied with considerable care
Mr. Pickering’s paper on the Nature of Solutionsi ; and have
gradually become convinced of the very great value of the
methods of dealing with experimental data there described,
especially as re ards the use of a bent lath in drawing the
curves. Mr. ickering would be the <U+FB01>rst to admit that
mathematics are not a subject in which he is deeply versed,
so that there would appear to be a danger lest, on some of
the points raised by Mr. Lupton, judgment may be allowed
to go by default, and an impression be thereby created that
there is something essentially unsound from a mathematical
point of view in Mr. Pickering’s methods.
     When a uniform naturally straight lath is acted upon by
a system of coplanar forces, the form of the curve assumed
by a portion of it throughout which none of the applied
forces act is such that the product of the radius of curva
ture at any point and the distance of the point from some
<U+FB01>xed straight line is constant, provided that the radius of
curvature is very great compared with the thickness of the
lath§. It immediately follows that the general differential
equation of the curve is
              d9                d   9   %
              twig:                       {lm+my+n}“,

   II For a discussion of this curve see Minchin’s ‘ Statics,’ vol. ii. pp. 203—
209.   Mr. Pickering is not justi<U+FB01>ed, mathematically s eaking, in saving
that the bent lath “ does not form a curve of any particular nature.” This
statement, however, is practically equivalent to a recognition of the high
degree of generality which the curve possesses.                           .

100 Mr. E. H. Hayes on Objections to Mr. Pickering’s
diiferential equation of the second order, the equation of the
curve (which can be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals)
contains <U+FB01>ve constants. It is therefore of a generality equal
to that of the conic
                     am2+hwy+by9+gx+fy=l,
or of the curve
                     y=a+bw+cwz+dw3+ew‘ .                  .  .  .   .   (1)
   In the bent lath therefore we possess a means of drawing a
curve through the experimental points, which is of a more
general nature than those usually dealt with by arithmetical
methods, and in which there can be no abrupt change of
curvature, however slight, still less change of direction.
To the former change corresponds an abrupt change of
direction in the <U+FB01>rst di<U+FB02>'erential curve, and a breaking up of
the second di<U+FB02>’erential curve into two curves which do not
meet; to the latter a breaking up of the <U+FB01>rst differential
curve into two curves which do not meet *.
   Dif<U+FB01>culties of accurate drawing excepted, there appears to
be no it prior-i reason why the bent-lath curve should represent
the actual facts less faithfully than an equation such as (1)
above, the arithmetical treatment of which would be terribly
laborious. It is also tolerably obvious that a single equation
of this nature would be incapable of representing within the
limits of experimental error the results of a single series of
Mr. Pickering’s experiments (0. 9. one of the direct <U+FB01>rst
di<U+FB01>'erentials of the densities): so that more than one equation,
probably three at the very least if the number of constants in
each was <U+FB01>ve or thereabouts, would have to be employed;
and their precise number, as well as their respective ranges,
would be a mere matter of individual taste.
   If it were possible to divide the experimental results into
groups in all sorts of ways, calculate the constants for the
equation representing each group, and determine in every
case the difference between the observed and calculated
values, curves <U+FB01>tting the experimental points as closely, if
not more so, than Mr. Pickering’s might no doubt be ob
tained, and most valuable evidence deduced from them as to
the presence or absence of breaksT at particular points.

  1" The word break is used to denote a point at which, in an ideal
curve which gives an absolutely correct representation of the facts, the
values of one of the differential coef<U+FB01>cients of the ordinate with respect to
the abscissa either become discontinuous or exhibit a rate of chan e
enormously great as compared with that in the neighbourhood of tie
point.

            Method of reducing Experimental Results.           101
 But Mr. Lupton has not done this ; and without some such
 process of trial and error, which might occuPy years, it is
 dif<U+FB01>cult to see how any evidence bearing on this question of
 breaks, which is the pivot of the whole controversy, can be
 obtained by the method which he advocates.          If we decide
 with Mr. Lupton to represent a certain arbitrarily selected
 series of results by a continuous function, any break which
 may occur within the range of the function will necessarily
 be smoothed out.       This is “excessive smoothing” * with a
 vengeance.    It seems clear therefore that in any satisfactory
 investigation as to the real existence of breaks some method
 differing from that favoured by Mr. Lupton must be
employed.
    Now with a bent lath the process of trial and error alluded
 to above can be carried out to almost any extent; 1'. e. any
number of continuous curves of great though not excessive
 generality can be compared with the ex erimental points
 until those are discovered which <U+FB01>t best. T e test for a break
 consists not only in the good <U+FB01>tting of the lath throughout.
each of the two groups formed by several consecutive points
 on either side of the break, but also in the impossibility of
getting it to <U+FB01>t to an extent in harmony with the experi
mental errors when a group of points is chosen which in
cludes the break. In such a case two different continuous
curves meeting at the break must be drawn, if the experi
mental values are not to be departed from to an unwarrant
able extent.                                         '
    It is obvious that breaks, if suf<U+FB01>ciently slight, might get
smoothed out by this process, and that the method is far more
likely to cause such disappearances than to introduce a break
where it does not really exist ; a consideration which explains
why a particular break might be undetected in one or more of
the different series of experiments dealt with by Mr. Pickering.
The extent to which the process of trial and error was carried
by him may be gathered from the following quotation.
“Drawings on several different scales, and with several
different points as origins, were made in all cases, and the
labour entailed in the treatment of the results has by far
exceeded that of the determinations themselves ” 1'.
   Mr. Lupton’s preference for a process “which will give
the same result in all hands” irresistibly suggests a com
parison between a barrel-organ and a violin.         The latter is
undoubtedly the superior instrument, and yet it can neither
be denied that in the manipulation of the violin “a strong

                    1' “Nature of Solutions,” p. 68.

102     Mr. E. H. Hayes on Oly'ections to Mr. Pickering’s
personal element is introduced,” nor that “considerable
care and practice are requisite before it can be safely used.”
Uniformity of results can be no real argument in favour
of a method, which, as I have above endeavoured to show,
would seem by its very nature incapable of being applied
in practice so as to deal effectively with the question at
Issue.
    Mr. Lupton attempts to clinch his argument by applying
an arithmetical process to some ten or a d0zen density deter
minations forming only a small part of one of Mr. Pickerin ’s
series of experiments. In order to exhibit the value of t e
 method, he is, of course, compelled to take them so that
 they include an assumed break, but minimises this disad
 vantage by choosing them in a region where, according to
 Mr. Pickering, the curve “is of a very doubtful character.” *
 Although under the circumstances the chances in favour of a
 very fair agreement between the observed and calculated
 values were considerable, the result is most unsatisfactory
 from Mr. Lupton’s point of view. He seems to have been
 misled by a statement of Mr. Pickering as to 00002 gram
 being a safe limit of error; but, since the piknometer held
 25 0.0., the corresponding error in the density is, as Mr. Picker
 ing says, only 0'000008, which is far exceeded by every one
 of the differences between observed and calculated values
 tabulated by Mr. Lupton. Even if the limit of error were
 ten times as great as the above, it would only mend the
 matter in two cases, and this occurs in spite of the fact that
his equation contains three arbitrary constants. Comment is
needless.
    There are several minor points in Mr. Lupton’s paper
which call for some remark. After making an assertion
concerniu the equation of the second degree which is untrue
 unless it appens to represent a parabola whose axis is
 parallel to the axis of y, heproceeds to say,“ Hence the
 hydrates of sulphuric acid are, apparently made to depend
 upon the <U+FB02>exibility of' the steel lath used.” 1' It is extremely
 dif<U+FB01>cult to fathom the precise meaning of this statement, still
 more so to see how it depends upon the preceding one. It ma ,
 however, be as well to point out that any two uniform latlis
 may be: bent so as to form identical curves (provided of course
 that the bending does not exceed a certain limit), although if
 the <U+FB02>exural rigidity (stiffness) were too great the operation
 might be trying to the <U+FB01>ngers.
    Mr. Lupton very rightly remarks that “the assumption
                    * “ Nature‘of Solutions,” p. 76.

  that           can be expanded in ascending powers of a: is by
   no means universally true.” * This fact tells to a certain
   extent in favour of methods (such as Mr. Pickering’s) in
   which no such assumption is made.
       Exception is taken to Mr. Pickering’s “dealing with an
   abscissa of 50'06998 . . . . and a corresponding ordinate of
‘ 1'404296 ” T.       It may be freely conceded that as regardsthe
  abscissa, the last two <U+FB01>gures cannot affect the diagram, but
   it may be presumed that the actual experiments have some
   value apart from the present application. Mr. Lupton appears
  to have momentarily forgotten that Mr. Pickering’s chart
   refers to the <U+FB01>rst differential.      He will <U+FB01>nd if he looks again
   at the table 212, that in the values of $ the <U+FB01>gures in the
   sixth decimal place have been deliberately omitted. The
   <U+FB01>gures in the <U+FB01>fth place would tell, even on the small scale
   of the published diagram.
       It is a little hard too on Mr. Pickering that he should be
  attacked for his use of the term “ differentiation,” in which
  he is only following others, when he so carefully explains
  what he means by it§.             He notes the distinction between
   differences and differentials, and even goes so far as to call
   attention to the fact that irregularities will be caused if the
   intervals are not equal. It is interesting to notice that if the
   curves dealt with are parabolas whose equation is of the form
  y=a+bw+cw’, the value of ‘12 I; (called by Mr. Pickering
                                            1
  a differential) is actually the same as that of Z—Z (the true dif
   ferential coefficient) at the point whose abscissa is
       Before concluding these remarks I wish to call attention to
   what is really the strongest, though not perhaps the most
  striking argument in favour of Mr. Pickering’s conclusions :
  the general agreement of the results obtained from the study
  of various properties, and the apparent absence of any in
  explicable discrepancy in special cases. It is strange that
   Mr. Lupton should not only have ignored this aspect of the
  question, but should even have used an expression [I which
  would seem to imply that there was an absence of con<U+FB01>rma
  tory evidence derived from different sources. The importance
  of the omission can scarcely be overrated.

methods the fact that a s ring (or lath) may be pinned down
so as to coincide to any esired degree of accuracy with any
number of experimental points, and trust that I may be
excused if I attempt to answer the objection. The use of an
unlimited number of' applied forces (one at each pin) is open
to the same theoretical objections as would apply to an equa
tion containing an unlimited number of constants.                 As
Mr. Pickerin      used for drawing his curves a part of the lath
throughout w ich no applied forces were acting, two distinct
curves of the kind used by him would meet at each pin,
and a discontinuity would exist, which can be shown by
mathematical analysis to involve an abrupt change in the
value of 3%,, i. e. there would be a break at these points. Rapid
changes too in the value of (ii—air], might take place if the applied
forces were large, or the <U+FB02>exural rigidity of the lath small.
In fact the pinning-down process simply masks any real
breaks which may exist by substituting a (probably much
larger) number of others. It would even seem to be theoreti
cally possible that experiments as to the minimum number of
applied forces re uired might indicate the points at which the
breaks occur.— . H. H.]

in some quarters with surprise and incredulity. The evidence
on which it has been rejected appears to rest mainly on two,
well-known facts.       Firstly, that the Siemens electrical pyro
meters have always shown large and continuous changes of
 zeroT; and, secondly, that platinum wires .then used as

            Construction of Platinum Thermometers.           105
<U+FB01>laments for incandescent lamps undergo more or less rapid
deterioration.
    The Siemens pyrometer is a commercial and nota scienti<U+FB01>c
instrument. I have myself examined some of the most recent
pattern, and I should have been surprised if they had not
been found to exhibit changes of zero when used at high
temperatures. The wire is wound on common clay, which is
apt to attack it, and is inclosed in an iron tube without
su<U+FB02>icient protection from the metallic and other vapours
which are sure to be present.
    In the case of lamp-<U+FB01>laments which are heated by a cur
rent in vacuo, it might appear at <U+FB01>rst sight as though the wire
were perfectly protected from strain or contamination; but
this is far from being the case. The sudden heating and
cooling» of the wire when the current is turned on or off, and
the intense radiation which keeps the surface at a lower tem
perature than the central portions, must be a severe strain on
the wire.     It is also evident that any crack or flaw in the
surface will tend to be intensi<U+FB01>ed by the local development
of greater heat; and if the wire is heated to a temperature
near its melting-point where it begins to be appreciably vola
tile, this action must inevitably produce serious results. If a
 wire which has been thus treated be examined under the
microscope, its surface will generally be found to be cracked
 and scored in a manner which is of itself amply suf<U+FB01>cient to
account for the increased resistance and brittleness.
    The wire of a platinum thermometer which is properly pro
 tected does not undergo any alterations of this kind, if treated
 with reasonable care.     I have recently succeeded in making
 these thermometers of a very convenient and accurate form ;
 and I have reason to believe, from inquiries which have reached
 me from various sources, that a description of the pattern
 which I have found to give the best results would be useful
 to other observers who require a sensitive and trustworthy
 thermometer.
    The simplest form of platinum thermometer is made by
 fusing or welding a coil of <U+FB01>ne wire to leads of relatively low
 resistance. The coil and leads must be suitably insulated and
 supported ; for most purposes it is convenient to inclose the
 instrument in a tube of similar. dimensions to an ordinar
 thermometer. For use at temperatures below 700° C. the
 leads may be of copper or silver, and the tube of hard glass.
     For rough work at temperatures below 1000° 0. very fair
 results may be obtained by the use of a wrought-iron tube.
 The leads should also be made of iron. Copper and silver are
  too volatile. Their vapours will attack the platinum, and

106                Mr. H. L. Callendar on the
very small traces of either are su<U+FB01>icient to ruin the wire for
thermometric purposes.
   For accurate work at high temperatures it is necessary to
use platinum leads, and to inclose the coil in a tube of glazed
porcelain or silica.
   For insulating the coil and leads I have found nothing that
answers so well as mica.      Biscuit porcelain is fairly good,
but most varieties of clay are apt to attack the wire at high
temperatures. If the wire is wound on a clay cylinder, the
relatively large mass of the clay has also the e<U+FB01>'ect of mate
rially reducing the sensitiveness.
   The wire is preferably doubled on itself like an ordinary
resistance-coil, and wound on a thin plate of mica. The
leads are insulated by being made to pass through a series of
mica wads cut to <U+FB01>t the tube containing the instrument. This
method has the advantage of giving very perfect insulation,
and of preventing convection-currents of air up and down the
tube.
   The resistance of such an instrument may conveniently be
measured by means of an ordinary post-of<U+FB01>ce box. If the
resistance-coils are of German-silver wire, the temperature of
the box must be taken at each observation and a correction
applied. It is better therefore to use a box with coils of
copper-nickel-manganese, or one of the many_other alloys
that do not change appreciably in resistance at ordinary
temperatures.
   With the above simple arrangement it is not diliicult to
obtain results consistent to a few hundredths ofa degree at
500° 0., provided that the resistance of the leads is relatively
Very small and fairly constant, and that the stem of the ther
mometer is always immersed to nearly the same extent. There
are some objections, however, to the use of thick leads. They
are necessarily wanting in lightness and <U+FB02>exibility, and they
tend to cool the bulb of the thermometer by conduction along
the stem.
   For most purposes it is better to insert in the stem of the
thermometer a second pair of leads similar to those of the coil
itself, so that their resistance can be measured separately.
It is then possible to use leads of any convenient length and
<U+FB02>exibility, and to make the observations of temperature inde
pendent of the length of stem immersed.
   In the ordinary method of measuring a resistance with a
post-of<U+FB01>ce box, it is necessary to observe galvanometer
throws in order to <U+FB01>nd the last two <U+FB01>gures of the value of the
resistance.   If, however, a divided bridge-wire be used in
conjunction with the resistance-box for determining the frac

            Construction of Platinum Thermometers.            107
tions of an ohm in the manner now to be described, the appa
ratus can at the same time be arranged so that the variable
resistance of the leads is eliminated. The reading of the
bridge-wire scale when the balance is found is then independ
ent of the length of stem immersed, and gives the temperature
of the thermometer-coil without the necessity of observing
,lgalganometer-throws or of measuring the resistance of the
 ca s.
   The annexed <U+FB01>gure represents, somewhat diagrammatically,
the arrangement of the apparatus.
   AB, B0 are equal resistances forming the arms of the
balance.    The battery is connected at A and C, and one
terminal of the galvanometer G at B. D E represents a set
of resistance-coils, which together with A B and B C may be
supplied by an ordinary post-of<U+FB01>ce box. F K represents a
straight bridge-wire with a divided scale attached. The other
terminal of the galvanometer is connected to the contact
piece H, which slides along this wire.     The leads A M, K N,
from the pyrometer-coil P, are connected to A and K ; and the
compensatin leads C L, L D, the resistance of which is equal
to AM, K ,are connected to C and D.             These four leads
may be of any convenient length; they are symmetrically
arranged so that corresponding parts are always at the same
temperature.     When the balance is found by unplugging
suitable resistances in the arm DE and sliding the contact
piece H, it is plain that, since the resistances AB, B C are
equal, the resistance of the pyrometer and its leads, plus that
of the length HK of the bridge-wire, will be equal to the
resistance of the remaining ortion FH of the bridge-wire
together with that of the coils E and the compensator CL D.
Thus the changes of resistance of the pyrometer-leads AM,
 K N are compensated by the equal changes in the leads C L,
 L D ; and the resistance of the p rometer-coil itself is directly
given by the sum of the coils DE and the reading of the
bridge-wire.
   It is convenient to graduate the bridge-wire scale so that
 100 or 1000 divisions are equivalent to the unit coil in the
 mm D E.      It is also convenient to adjust the resistance of the

 108                Mr. H. L. Callendar on the
pyrometer-coil, so that the change of its resistance between 0°
and 100° C. may be equal to 1, 10, or 100 units. The divisions
of the bridge-wire will then represent degrees of temperature
on the platinum scale, and the temperature can be deduced
from the observed resistance by simply subtracting its zero
value.
   The arrangement, however, will work equally well with an
arbitrary scale. The really important point is that an obser
vation of temperature is reduced to a single scale-reading,
and that it is independent of the length of stem immersed.
   The chief errors to be apprehended with this form of appa
ratus are changes in the screw and plug contacts, especially
the latter. Instead of the ordinary plug for short-circuiting
the terminals of a resistance-coil, I prefer to use a <U+FB02>at nut
screwing down on to two <U+FB02>at plates. I <U+FB01>nd that better con
tact may thus be secured, and, what is more important, that
the contact-surfaces may be more easily kept clean and good.
It is almost impossible to keep a plug-hole free from grit and
grease, even if the plug <U+FB01>ts perfectly ; whereas the screw-nut
can be kept screwed down when not in use, and the <U+FB02>at sur
faces are easily cleaned if necessary. Moreover lthe wedge
like action of the plugs almost invariably loosens the blocks
between which they are inserted, so that taking out one plug
alters the contacts of its neighbours. This cannot occur with
the screw-nuts. Among minor advantages it may be men
tioned that the screw-nuts, not being loose, are not so liable
to get lost or soiled.
   Perhaps the best way to make the sliding-contact at H is
to connect the galvanometer to a <U+FB01>xed wire of the same
material as FK and stretched parallel to it. Connexion is
made between the two wires by pressing down a button carry
ing a short cross-wire <U+FB01>xed to a spring on the lower side of
the slidin contact-piece. The advantages of this arrange
ment are t at the wire from the galvanometer is not attached
to the sliding-piece itself but to a <U+FB01>xed binding-screw, and
that there is less danger of thermoelectric effects being
produced by the warmth of the hand at H.
   The current used in measuring the resistance must not be
too large or the <U+FB01>ne wire will be heated. It appears that a
platinum wire of 0015 centim. ('006 inch) diam., which is a
convenient size to use for these thermometers, will take a
current of one hundredth of an ampere when cooled by air
contact, without heating much more than one hundredth of a
degree 0. If a higher order of accuracy is desired, the
current-heating must be measured and allowed for.
   The degree of sensitiveness and accuracy attainable with

              Construction of Platinum Thermometers.                 109
these instruments depends largely on the adjustment of the
galvanometer and on the perfection of the optical means for
reading its de<U+FB02>exions.          A convenient method is to use a
microscope " with a micrometer-eyepiece, and to observe the
re<U+FB02>ected image in the galvanometer-mirror of a scale attached
to the objective. The power of the microscope in magnifying
the de<U+FB02>exions is proportional to the length of its body and to
the power of the eyepiece, and does not depend on the focal
length of the objective. A telescope does equally well, but
the arrangement is then less compact. Either method is
superior to the lamp and scale in point of accuracy and for
other reasons, particularly in not requiring a darkened room.
This is a great advantage, because a. good light is preferable
for reading the scale of the bridge-wire and noting down the
observations.                                                    '
   With regard to the formula to be used for reducing the
observed platinum-temperature pt to the temperature t by air
thermometer, the very careful experiments made by Griffiths
on the boiling- and freezing-points of various substancesT
seem to show that the simple parabolic formula
                  t—pt=8{Z/T(W|2—t/100}            .   .   .  .    .  (d)
holds over a wide ran e even more accurately than I had
previously imagined.          he values of t for various boiling- and
freezing-points, deduced by the aid of this formula from
observations with thermometers of very different patterns and
with different coef<U+FB01>cients, were rarely found to differ from
 each other by more than a few hundredths of a degree over
 the range O°-450° 0. The value of the constant 3 for any
 thermometer may be readily deduced from a single observation
 of the boiling-point of sulphur or mercury as described in the
 paper above referred to I.
    The air-thermometer experiments § on which this formula
 was founded did not extend beyond 650° 0., but I have
 recently succeeded in verifying it roughly at a higher tempe
 rature by an observation of the freezing-point of silver. This
 point appears to be very clearly marked and well adapted for
 a high-temperature standard. Several independent observa
 tions with a platinum thermometer gave the same result,
 982°‘l 0., within a small fraction of a degree. The specimen
 of silver, however, was not perfectly pure, so that the result

 Cambridge, to whom I am also much indebted for the care and skill
 bestowed on the construction of my apparatus.

 110                  Mr. H. L. Callendar on the
 is probably a little too low. Moreover, on account of the
 wide discrepancies at present existing in the estimates of the
 temperature of the freezing-point of silver on the air
 thermometer scale, according to different authorities, the
 result would in any case serve only as a rough verification of
 the formula (d). The dif<U+FB01>culties in the way of making
 accurate determinations with an air-thermometer at this
 temperature are undoubtedly considerable; but I have
 recently succeeded in devising a special form of instrument
 with which I hope to be able to obtain more trustworthy
 results.
    Sir Wm. Siemens was the <U+FB01>rst to attack the problem of
 determining the variation of electrical resistance at high
 temperatures. He showed that the formula given by
 Matthiessen,
                         Ro/R,=1—at+<U+FB01>t9. . . . . . (m)
 was entirely inapplicable except between the limits 0° and
 100° 0.       His own experiments led him to suggest the
 formula
                        R=aT5+BT+7.              .   .  .   .  .   .
   This formula has been very widely quoted and adopted,
but it does not, so far as my experience goes, represent the
results of observation so well as the simpler formula
R/Ro=1+at+ Bte, which was used by Benoit, and which is
equivalent to formula (d).
   1 have only recentl           succeeded in <U+FB01>nding a published
 account of Sir Wm. giemens’s experiments".                   It appears
from this that they were undertaken rather with a view of
graduating a commercial pyrometer than of investigating the
law of change of electrical resistance.            Temperatures up to
350° were determined by mercury thermometers in an air- or
oil-bath, and it does not ap ear that any corrections were
applied to their readings.            e individual observations are
somewhat irregular, and often show divergencies amounting to
2 percent. and over. Only three observations at higher tem
peratures are given; they show a mean deviation of about
30° C. A copper ball-pyrometer was used to determine the
temperatures, which are given as 810°, 835°, and 854° 0.;
the corresponding temperatures deduced by formula (S) from
the observed resistances of the platinum pyrometer were
772°, 811°, and 882° C.
   The formula Siemens gives for iron makes the rate of in
crease of its resistance diminish considerably with rise of
temperature. The formula given by Benoit makes it increase

 very largely.    All the specimens I have tried a ree very
 closel with Benoit’s formula.     I am inclined to t ink that
 the Siemens formula must be wrong.          It is at least note
 worthy that two of his observations differ by 6 and 3%; per
 cent. respectively from his formula in the direction of agree
 ing with Benoit’s, and that if allowance is made for the
 probable errors of the mercury thermometers at 350° the
 discrepancy may be still further reduced. The resistances appa
 rently were only measured to about 1 per cent. in most cases,
 and the temperatures are given only to the nearest degree.
 The Siemens formula is undoubtedly superior to that given
 by Matthiessen, but the evidence in its favour is hardly suf<U+FB01>
 cient to justify its continued use in preference to the much
 simpler and more convenient formula (d).
     The superior capabilities of platinum thermometers as
 compared with instruments in general use do not appear as
 yet to be suf<U+FB01>ciently appreciated. It will perhaps help to
 bring out more clearly several of the points mentioned in
 their construction, if I give a brief summary of some of the
 advantages which they present in point of range, constancy,
 and sensitiveness, as compared with the best mercury
 thermometers.
     The range of a mercury thermometer is obviously limited
 to temperatures between —40° and +400° 0. That of a
 platinum thermometer may extend from absolute zero to above
 1500° C.             .
, The superiority of the platinum thermometer is still greater
 in point of constancy. It is a fact familiar to those who have
 studied mercury thermometers, that if a new thermometer be
 kept at a temperature of 350° C. for a week or so, its zero
 will be found to rise by 10° or 20° owing to the contraction
 of the glass. After a time this rise reaches a limit ; but if a
 thermometer which has been thus annealed and allowed to
  cool slowly be again heated to 350c for a few minutes and
 allowed to cool rapidly by free exposure to the air, its zero
  will be found to be depressed by a quantity which varies with
  different thermometers, but which generally amounts to
  about 2°. A similar depression, but less in amount, is ob
  served if the thermometer is heated to some intermediate
  point of the scale.   The extent of depression also depends on
  the time during which the thermometer is heated, and on the
  rate at which it is cooled.   Thus even in the best mercury
  thermometers, which have been carefully annealed by a.
  special process, the position of the zero is constantly shifting
  in a manner which depends on the past histor      of the instru
   ment.   It is consequently very dif<U+FB01>cult, an in many cases

112       On the Construction of Platinum Thermometers.
impossible, to attain an accuracy of the order of a tenth of a
 degree even at temperatures as low as 200° C.
     n the other hand, when a platinum thermometer has once
been annealed (a process which can be completed in a few
 minutes), its zero will not be found to vary even by a
hundredth of a degree—if it is properly constructed—when
used at any temperatures up to 500° C. ; and in some
thermometers which I have used at temperatures as high as
 1300° 0., I have not found any changes of zero amounting to
more than a tenth of a degree.
   Sensitiveness and rapidity of observation are often of con
siderable importance. A mercury thermometer with an open
scale must necessarily contain a relatively large mass of
mercury, since there are objections to unduly diminishing the
bore of the tube. Thus it cannot be made so sensitive as a
 platinum thermometer in which the actual mass of metal may
be very small. A still more important point is that, owing to
the imperfect elasticity of the glass, it is desirable to allow
the mercury thermometer some time to settle before taking
a reading. This is of course unnecessary in the case of the
platinum thermometer.
   In ordinary work with mercury thermometers it is ener
ally necessary to expose some portion of the stem to the air.
If a volume of mercury corresponding to any considerable
number of degrees be thus exposed, the error becomes serious.
It may amount to as much as 10° at 350° C. This correction
is so uncertain that it is now generally considered inexpedient
to attempt to apply it. The only way to avoid it, and at the
same time to secure a suf<U+FB01>ciently open scale for accurate work
without unduly increasing the length of the stem, is to use a
series of thermometers of “limited scale.” Each of these
must have at least two points of its scale specially determined.
It has hitherto been the custom to graduate such thermo
meters by means of substances of known boilin - and freezing~
points ; but, as Gri<U+FB02>iths * has shown, the gra uation may be
much more easily and accurately effected by comparison with
a single platinum thermometer, a method which has the
further advantage of saving the trouble of calibrating the
stem.
   It is easy to construct a platinum thermometer with a scale
of 1 centim., or even 10 centim., to the degree, whose reading
shall be entirely independent of the length of stem immersed.
The divided wire on which the readings are taken need not
be more than 20 centim. in length, and can be made to corre
spond to any part of the scale y simply unplugging a few

 work of a whole series of mercury thermometers, and that
 with far greater accuracy and without the necessity of
 applying any troublesome and uncertain corrections.
      t may be objected that the use of a platinum thermometer
 requires electrical apparatus and some knowledge of electrical
 measurement. I quite admit that it requires some special
 skill and experience to make a good thermometer, but the
.rest of the apparatus required is obtainable in almost any
 laboratory, and it is easy to take the readings quickly and
 accurately after a little practice. The great superiority of
 the platinum thermometer in range, accuracy, and durability,
 will be found in the end to save so much time and expense as
 will more than compensate for the small trouble of learning
 to use it.
 XVIII. On a probable Relationship between Speci<U+FB01>c Inductive
     Capacity and Latent Heat of Vaporization. By EUGENE
    OBACH, Ph.D., F. C.S.*
 THE discovery of a near relationship between physical
         constants hitherto considered independent of each other
 seems of suf<U+FB01>cient interest to merit a place in the Philosophical
 Magazine, notwithstanding that the experimental data which
 can be brought forward in support of such relationship are
 somewhat meagre and not particularly accurate.
    I have recently been led to investigate whether speci<U+FB01>c
 inductive capacity and latent heat of vaporization of a
 liquid are in any way related to each other, and I <U+FB01>nd this
 actually to be the case, at least as far as certain series of
 chemically related organic compounds are concerned, viz. the
 esters of formic, acetic, and benzoic acid, and the monatomic
 alcohols. For these bodies, as will be shown hereafter,
 inductive capacity and latent heat are directly proportional. ,
    The numerical values of these two physical constants ob
 tained by di<U+FB01>'erent observers are in many cases very discordant;
 and it was therefore considered desirable to adhere as far as
possible to the <U+FB01>gures given by one and the same authorit ,
 and to introduce those of others only where absolutelgr
necessary.
    The speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacities here adopted are those
published by S. Tereschin'l' in 1889, and the latent heats of

 and Silbermann 1', whereas for methyl formatei, propylic
 alcohol, and the benzoic esters the had to be calculated by
 ,Trouton’s§ relation from the molecular weight and the
 absolute boiling-temperature. This relationcan be expressed
 by the formula N=C%, where N is the latent heat of vapori

  weight, and C a constant; and since it has been entirely con
  <U+FB01>rmed by Schiff’s subsequent researches, it can con<U+FB01>dently be
  applied to the calculation of the latent heat of most bodies,
especially thatof intermediate members of aseries of chemically
  related compounds.         The average value of the constant 0,
  found by Schi<U+FB02>“, is 20'8 ; but for the alcohol series I adopted
  the <U+FB01>gure 25'86, deduced from Favre and Silbermann’s de
 termination of the latent heat of water, which gave practically
  the same result as that found by Regnault, Andrews, and
  Berthelot. This constant is not very different to that deduced
‘directly from the alcohols, 'viz. 26'14.
      In the following Tables I. and IV. the calculated values of
 the latent heats are enclosed in brackets in order to distinguish
 them from those actually found by experiment.

    I] The boiling-temperatures are mostly taken from the latest edition of
 Beilstein’s Handbuch der organise-hen Chemie, and 'nearly all refer to

the complete series are given from 11:0 to n=5, the <U+FB01>rst
members being formic acid, acetic acid, and water respectively,
and the last the amyl compounds *.                For the acids the speci<U+FB01>c
inductive capacity is not known, but I have calculated it from
the mean ratio % of each particular series. If these calculated
values of K should in future be compared with those found
by direct observation, it must be borne in mind that the values
found by Favre and Silbermann for the latent heat of these
acids are probably not quite accurate. For the speci<U+FB01>c in
ductive capacity of water, E. B. Rosa’s'l' value, viz. 75'7, is
adopted, Tereschin’s <U+FB01>gure, 83'8, being notably higher ;
whilst the results obtained by the same observers for ethylic
alcohol are almost identical, viz. 25'? and 25'8 respectively.
    It will be seen from Tables I., II., and IV. that the devia~
tions of the individual values of the quotient 12% from the
mean are no greater than one would expect, considering that
the two constants were obtained by different observers and
with entirely different samples of liquid. In the case of the
acetates and alcohols, which form two almost complete series,
                                          7\.
the constancy of the quotient                 is particularly satisfactory;
                                          K
and when the observed values are plotted out, taking the
latent heats as abscissae and the inductive capacities as
ordinates (vide the diagram), the points of intersection are
nearly equally distributed on both sides of a straight line,
thus unmistakably showing the linear dependency of the two
physical constants. Returning to Table lII., which embodies
the results for <U+FB01>ve different ethyl esters, it will be noticed
that the ratio % is not quite so constant, but rather seems to
increase with the molecular weight; however, if the <U+FB01>rst
member of this group, viz. ethyl formate, is disregarded, the
deviations from the mean are by no means very great.
    In order to show the legitimacy of employing calculated
values of latent heat, where no direct determinations are
available, (2.9. for the benzoic-acid esters, I have also calculated
them for those bodies where experimental values actually do
   ' Schi<U+FB02>'s determinations of the latent heat refer to the isoamyl esters,
but it is doubtful if this is also the case with Tereschin’s speci<U+FB01>c inductive
capacities. The normal amyl formate is not mentioned in Beilstein’s
Handbook.

 116       Dr. E. Obach on Relationship between Speci<U+FB01>c
 exist, viz. for the various esters of fatty acids and for the
 alcohols.
     Tables I.a, II.a, III.a, and IV.a contain the results of these
                                                                               I
 calculations, they show that the constancy of the quotient %
 is quite as good as in the corresponding tables centaining the
 observed values of 7t. We are, therefore, justified in regarding
 the results obtained for the benzoic-acid esters given in
 Table V. with the same degree of con<U+FB01>dence as those of the
 other series, and to conclude that these compounds also show the
 direct relationship between inductive capacity and latent heat.
 This is the more interesting, as the benzoic esters belong to
 the entirely distinct class of aromatic compounds.
     It will be observed from Tables I. a and II. a that the latent
 heats of the free acids, calculated with Schiff’s constant 208,
 differ widely from those actually found, and in order to
 obtain a better agreement the constant would have to be
 reduced to 151 ; but if in place of the boiling-temperatures
actually observed, those which Would follow from the position
 of the acid in the particular ester series were employed, viz.
 283° for formic and 311° for acetic acid, the resulting latent
heats of vaporization would become 128 and 108 respectively *,
which is in better accordance with the experimental results,
and gives for K the more probable values 13'1 and 8'8. How
ever,the higher members of the series, viz. butyric and valeric
acid, also examined by Favre and Silbermann, do not conform
to this rule. Table VI. gives, for direct comparison, the mean
values of the ratios % and 71% for all <U+FB01>ve series hitherto con
sidered, and it will be seen that there is practically very
little difference between them. There “is also only little
difference between the mean ratios of the formic and benzoic
esters, and, again, between those of the acetic esters and the
esters of the higher acids, whereas the alcohols give a notably
lower ratio.
   1* Trouton (Lo. p. 5) increases the theoretical vapour-density of formic
acid in the ratio 2'68 : 1'62, and that of acetic acid in the ratio 3'19: 2'08,
for the calculation of his constant. If the molecular weights are similarly
increased, the latent heats, calculated from the actual boiling-temperatures
with Schilf’s mean constant, are about 20 per cent. below the observed
values; but if the constant derived from water, which I applied to the
alcohol series, is taken, the results are practically the same as those given
above, viz. 127 and 110 respectively.

   In place of the molecular weights, Trouton originally used
the vapour-densities D based on H2 as unity; the value of
his constant consequently lies between 10 and 13. It will be
noticed that these <U+FB01>gures are not very diiferent to the con
stant vy obtained for the various ester series. .In those cases
where the two happen to be identical, the relation between
speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacity, vapour-density, and absolute
boiling-temperature, can be expressed by the extremely simple
formula KD=T. ‘
    De Heen has shown* that the absolute boiling-temperature
 T at 760 millim. pressure and the coef<U+FB01>cient of expansion do
 at 0° are inversely proportional, or aoT=constant ; it there
 fore follows that aoKM=constant, i. e. the coe<U+FB02>icicnt of expan
 sion at 0° is inversely proportional to the molecular inductive "
 capacity. The product anKM is perfectly analogous to the .
<U+FB01>rst term aopoM in de Heen’s equation for intramolecular
 work, which represents that part of the heat spent for physical
 dissociation as contradistinguished from chemical dissociation
 forming the second term, and to which electrolytical decom
 position would here correspond.
    Tereschin has already tried if there is any direct connexion
 between the speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacity of the various bodies
 which he examined and their molecular weight, and found,
 that the two formulae K=a+b§a and K=n9(l+A1\£,[),
 where a, b, and A are constants, c- the speci<U+FB01>c gravity, and
 n the refractive index, fairly represent his observations;
 These formulae are more complicated than the one which I
 have proposed, viz. K=O’ 1%, without affording a notably.
 better agreement with the experimental results, as will be
 seen on comparing Tereschin’s calculated values given in the
 Annalen with those in the following Table VII. :—

         The series of chemical compounds so far considered are all
      characterized by the fact that the alcohol radicals are indi
      rectly linked to the carbon through the interposition of an
      oxygen atom; but if the radicals are directly bound to the
      carbon, which, for instance, is the case with the benzene
      hydrocarbons. proportionality between speci<U+FB01>c inductive
      capacity and latent heat of vaporization no longer holds good.
      This is evident on comparing the latent heats of these hydro
      carbons found by Schiff with the inductive capacities obtained
      by Negreano *, where, with increasing molecular weight of
      the series, the former diminish and the latter slowly rise.
         Besides the compounds which have already been mentioned
      only a few more remain, for which fairly reliable values of
     both speci<U+FB01>c induction and latent heat exist: these are ethylic
      ether, carbon tetrachloride, carbon disulphide, and oil of tur
      pentine; but even for these bodies the inductive capacities
      are by no means certain, as the results obtained by different
      investigators and different methods show considerable varia
      tions. Carbon tetrachloride has been examined by Tereschin,

          It will be seen from the above table that the quotient % is
      totally different to that obtained previously, but it is not im
      possible that the four bodies may belong to two distinct groups
      as indicated in the table ; however, before trustworthy con
      clusions in this and other directions can be drawn, considerably
      more experimental data would be required.
          There is no doubt that a better agreement between the two
      constants could be obtained if the same samples of liquid were
      used for both determinations on account of the almost un
      avoidable presence of foreign bodies, especially of water, which
      in this case would affect both measurements in the same di
      rection. More uniform results might also be expected if the
      speci<U+FB01>c induction and latent heat, which are known to vary
      with the temperature, were determined at the same or corre
      spondin g temperatures.

   By means of a device which I have called the Wed ge-Divider,
   this value may be accurately and quickly determined.           A
   triangle (<U+FB01>g. 2) of which the sides AC, B0 are equal is
   ruled on a piece of plate-glass ; the base A B is divided into
   any number of equal parts, and each division is joined to C by
   straight lines.   I usually divide A B into 100 parts, and each
   tenth line is dotted as well as ruled. To use the wedge-divider,
   the trace is removed from the chronograph, and after being
   ruled, is varnished with very thin photographic varnish. The
   divider is then placed upon the trace with its ruled side in con
   tact with the trace, and moved at right angles to the trace till
   A C and B C out the trace in N and M, the ends of avibration

er a half vibration-length. Thus by similar triangles the length
M N is divided into the same number of equal parts as A B.
This being the case, any length such as N P can be at once com
pared with a length N M, and consequently the time value of
the length NP. I <U+FB01>nd that for accuracy, the method compares
very favourably with the micrometer method, while the advan
tage in time of working is as about four to one. When a large
number of determinations have to be reduced the question of
time is important. If a well-made aluminium stylus draws a

 a microscope appears to have a bright line situated midway in
 the cutting excavated by the stylus, this line is always used

 Outline is usually rather like the teeth of a mason’s saw. For
 many determinations, such as those of wave-motions in solids,
 it has been found convenient to use a fork having a period of
 $0 second ; by using the wedge-divider, the         second may
 be at once read. The surface velocity of the glass is arranged
 so that each vibration is about 0'8 centim. long. My <U+FB01>rst
 experiment, which led up to the wedge-divider used in con
 junction with a microscope, was to put a trace into a projec-
 tion lantern, and measure the image on a cardboard screen
 carrying a triangle, divided as I have described. By using
 the we ge-divider in close contact with the trace, in the
 <U+FB01>eld of a microscope, the distorsion inherent in the lantern
 method is eliminated.

 Telescopic Work for Starlight Evenings. By WILLIAM F. DENNING,
                    ERAS. (Taylor and Francis.)
 UNIVERSALLY recognized as one of the greatest living author
         ities on the subject of Meteoric Astronomy, Mr. Denning
 has also discovered two comets, and made numerous and accurate

128                 Notices respecting New Books.
observations and drawings of planetary details and other celestial
phenomena. For many years he has been a proli<U+FB01>c writer in
astronomical serials and the Proceedings of learned societies. A
work from his facile pen will therefore be read with much interest
and expectation by all lovers of the “ sublime science.” And his
readers will not be disappointed. This is a very interesting and
valuable work. Emanating as it does from a distinguished astro
nomer, and founded as it is on the results of the author's practical
experience, it is of course worthy of more attention and con<U+FB01>dence
than books which are merely compilations from the writings and
observations of others.
    The book opens with an interesting chapter on the invention
and development of the telescope. The second chapter discusses
the relative merits of large and small telescopes, in which it is
clearly shown that the utility of small instruments is not to be
despised. The author thinks that future development in telescopes
will take place in the size of re<U+FB02>ectors rather than in refractors,
which have now nearly reached their limit of aperture, and in this
conclusion he is most probably correct. In Chapter iv. most
useful hints are given to the amateur observer on telescopic obser
vations, and the best methods of arriving at useful results. Mr.
Denning very justly says (p. 78), “Some amateurs take an in
credible amount of pains to look up an object for the simple satis
faction of seeing it. But seeing an object is not observing it. The
mere view counts for nothing from a scienti<U+FB01>c standpoint, though
it may doubtless a<U+FB01>ord some satisfaction to the person obtaining
it ”; and again (p. 81), “ It need hardly be said that every dif<U+FB01>culty
may be surmounted by perseverance, and that a man’s enthusiasm
is often the measure of his success, and success is rarely denied to
him whose heart is in his work.”
    Interesting chapters follow on the Sun, Moon, Planets, and
Comets, and contain much information and many useful practical
hints. The chapter on “ Meteors and Meteoric Observations” is,
as might be expected from Mr. Denning, especially good.
    The concluding chapters of the work treat of the Stars, Nebulae,
and Clusters. These include some useful tables of some remarkable
objects; but the list of variable stars is rather short, some interest
ing objects—for instance R Leonis—being omitted. In a second
edition this list might with advantage be extended to, say, two
pages instead of one.
    It is the duty of a reviewer to look for misprints and errors in
the book he reviews.     Mr. Denning’s book has passed through this
ordeal very satisfactorily. Of misprints none have been detected.
Of inaccuracies there are very few. On p. 114 the moon’s mean
distance is given as 237,000 miles. This should be 238,800 miles.
Mann’s orbit for Sirius, referred to on p. 307, is now known to be
incorrect. The companion has certainly not yet passed through
the periastron, and probably will not do so for a few years to come.
In the List- of Variable Stars, p. 311,the minimum of o Ceti is
given as 0, or complete invisibility even with a telescope. This is

                      Notices respecting New Books.                      129
    incorrect, as the star never descends below magnitude 9%, and in
    fact always remains visible in a telescope of 3 inches aperture, or
    even 2 inches. The minimum of 1; Argus is given as 6 magnitude;
    but the star has been seen as faint as 7 5} (in 1886), and is at present
    about the 7th magnitude. Its period, if it has one, has not yet
 i been satisfactorily determined. These are trivial matters, however,
    and do not detract from the value of a book which it is to be hoped
    will meet with the success it deserves. All telescopists should
    procure a copy of the work without delay. The book is well printed
    and bound, and contains numerous excellent illustrations.

    A Treatise on Analytical Statics, with numerous examples.         By E.
       J. ROUTE, Sc.D., F.R.S.        Vol. I.    (Cambridge: University
       Press, 1891; pp. xii+407.)
    WE approach this new work by Dr. Routh as if it were the work
    of a “blessed Glendoveer ” (“ ’tis mine to speak, and yours to hear”).
    We never had the good fortune to sit at his feet and so have had
    a more thorough enjoyment in reading it than any one of his
    numerous “sons” Who are familiar with his methods can have.
    He himself opens his preface with the words: “During many
    years it has been my duty and pleasure to give courses of lectures
    on various mathematical subjects to successive generations of
    students. The course on Statics has been made the groundwork
    of the present treatise. It has, however, been necessary to make
   many additions; for in a. treatise all parts of the subject must be
   discussed in a connected form, while in a series of lectures a
   suitable choice has to be made.” We trust that Dr. Routh will
   not only complete his work on Statics, of which this is a first
   instalment, but also, in due time, give students the results of his
   many years’ labours in other parts of the mathematical curriculum.
   Our author’s mode of procedure is to “examine <U+FB01>rst how the
   elementary principles of statics are connected with the axioms
   required for the more general problem of dynamics, and secondly
   how they may be made to stand on a base of their own.” J.
   Walsh wrote to De Morgan: “ In mechanics the parallelogram of
  forces is quackery, and is dangerous ; for nothing is at rest, or in
  uniform, or in rectilinear motion, in the universe. Laplace’s
  demonstration of the parallelogram of forces is a begging of the
  question” *. Dr. Routh gives both Newton’s and Duchayla’s
  proofs.    We do not intend, however, to go through the treatise in
   detail. The matter and the manner happily call for no comments
  of ours, we propose only to indicate what facts are taken up in
. this <U+FB01>rst instalment. Chapters i. to iv. take us through the ele
  mentary portions, such as forces acting at a point, parallel forces
  (theory of couples), forces in two dimensions, illustrated by a store
  of carefully selected examples, many worked out and others with
  pregnant hints for their solution. Chapter v. discusses friction;

Chapter vi. the principle of work, here we have an account, with
examples, of Rocking Stones, which it will be remembered the
author has also treated in his Rigid Dynamics. In Chapter vii.,
on forces in three dimensions, we have an account of much that
is given in Sir R. S. Ball’s work on screws, and which will put
the student into a position to pro<U+FB01>t by a study of that treatise.
Chapter viii. is devoted to graphical statics and the consideration
of Maxwell’s and Cremona’s theorems. Centres of gravity <U+FB01>ll up
Chapter ix.; and the fullest treatment we have met with of strings
occupies Chapter x. The machines are rapidly gone through in
Chapter xi. The fact of the text being grounded on successive
annual courses of lectures readily accounts for Dr. Routh’s great
skill in meeting the dif<U+FB01>culties which occur to students, and the
result is a work which few will be able to pass over without loss.
 The practice has been kept up of referring “each result to its
 original author.”     It is a pity one cannot do this for so many of
 the beautiful problems in which the College papers abound. The
 printing matches the text, but two <U+FB01>gures (pp. 58 & 275) are
 incorrectly drawn. We have noticed only <U+FB01>ve small mistakes
 besides the few pointed out in the errata. The only evidence of
 haste appears to be in the numerous cases towards the end of the
 book where after questions we have “ May Exam,” “ Coll. Exam.,”
 “ Tripos Exam.,” and the like, whereas in the greater part of the
 work we have, as we ought to have, the “ year ” or the name of
 the College.
         The Foundations of Geometry.      By EDWARD T. DIXON.
       (Cambridge: Deighton, Bell, & Co., 1891 ; pp. viii+l43.)
 MR. DIXON in the treatise before us does not provide milk for babes,
 but strong meat for adult geometers. So he does not enter upon
 “the question whether beginners could readily be brought to under
 stand his book or not.” This inferior matter is postponed until his
 present reasoning is admitted to be sound. We have read all
 with great interest and can certainly commend the “ foundations ”
 to authors, teachers, and all other students of geometry, bar the
 babes, for in it they will <U+FB01>nd many valuable suggestions and acute
 criticisms. The author has rightly stated that “the crux of my
 [theory lies in my de<U+FB01>nition of direction, for it has been chie<U+FB02>y
  owing to the want of such a de<U+FB01>nition that all previous attempts
 to make use of direction in Elementary Geometry have failed.”
 We give here the implicit definition of Direction : “ (a) a direction
  may be conceived to be indicated by naming two points, as the
  direction ‘from one to the other.’ (b) If a point move from a
  given position constantly in a given direction, there is only one
 path, or series of positions, along which it can pass. (Such a path is
 called a ‘ direct path,’ and a continuous series of points occupying
  all positions in it, is called a ‘ straight line.’) (0) If the direction
  from A to B is the same as that from B to C, the direction from
  A to C is also that 'same direction. (d) If two unterminated

                     Notices respecting New Books.                131
direct paths, which intersect, are each intersected by a third'
direct path in two separate points, any unterminated direct path
extending in the same direction as the last one, which intersects
one of the two former, will also intersect the other.” There are
besides three axioms: on the possible transference of geometrical
<U+FB01>gures, the possible extension of a straight line and the three—way
extension of space, but the implicit de<U+FB01>nition we have quoted
above in extenso is the crucial point in the theory. Our readers
are now furnished with the key to Mr. Dixon’s method, and,
whether they agree with him or not, they will <U+FB01>nd much of
interest in this elaboration of his argument. In Part i. he writes
on the Logical Status of the Science of Geometry. In Part ii. we
have a“ subjective Theory of Geometry deduced from the two
fundamental Concepts, Position and Direction.            Herein the
student is carried through the equivalent of great part of Euclid’s
books i. and xi. with the exceptions of those propositions in book i.
which deal with plane areas. Part iii. dilates on the applicability
of the foregoing subjective geometry to the geometry of material
space. This contains some very interesting remarks upon what
Mr. Dixon prefers to call “ Geometry of four independent direc
tions ” in place of the common “ Geometry of four dimensions,”
and an account of a method of forming diagrams in material      space
which are “ orthogonal projections of the true <U+FB01>gures” (p.      101).
The printing is very well done and the <U+FB01>gures are good and      clear.
We have detected only three typographical errors, one           being
“Faucoult’s” pendula (p. 22); and on p. 53 occurs the funny
expression “ a cornery path.”
          Ewplication de Z’chh Quaternaire sans Hypotheses.
  Par H. HERMITE. Neuchatel, Attinger Fréres, Editeurs. 1891;
 To anyone who has speculated on the causes of geological epochs
 the title of this work is calculated to raise an incredulous smile.
 That a period the characteristics of which are themselves more or
 less matters of surmise can be explained Without recourse to hypo
 theses seems impossible.     A careful perusal has not shown us that
 M. Hermite performs his promise, for a greater collect-ion of
 unsupported assumptions it would be dif<U+FB01>cult to <U+FB01>nd put together.
    The author commences by attempting to show that the <U+FB01>gure
 of the earth is not an ellipsoid of revolution on the assumption of
 homogeneity, and that Newton’s calculations give a larger equatorial
 diameter compared to the polar diameter than measurement has
 proved to exist.
    By what he calls “ the principle of the Equilibrium of the Seas,”
 he thinks that this difference between theory and observation can
 be explained. We confess our inability to follow the reasoning by
  which he arrives at this conclusion ; but it is connected with the
  greater. salinity, and, as he thinks, consequent density of the seas
 at the Equator than at the Polekl. But he takes no account of the
                                       2

132                Notices respecting lirew Books.
difference of temperature which acts in the opposite direction. He
even suggests that the pronounced <U+FB02>attening of the poles of the
planet Jupiter may be caused by the excess of salinity of its equa
torial water. His conclusions on the Equilibrium of the Seas are
summed up in these words :—-“ We see then, without striving at
too much precision, that to a diminution of the density of the
seas corresponds a lowering of their surface.” This is certainly the
opposite of what we should expect, but how there could exist any
great permanent diiference of level in a fluid having free com
munication it is difficult to understand. This great principle of
the equilibrium of the seas being established to the author’s satis
faction, he goes on to explain the origin of the Quaternary Rains.
Most English geologists are disbelievers in the excessive rainfall
supposed by some to have distinguished the Quaternary climate,
 but the author takes the great precipitation as an established fact,
 and proceeds to explain it, as he seems to imagine, “ without
 hypothesis.”
    The explanation is the greater prevalence of Volcanic energy
 from the Tertiary period gradually diminishing to the present time.
 These Tertiary and Quaternary volcanoes emitted vast quantities
 of steam saturating the atmosphere with vapour, which, being con
 densed by admixture of air from the seas, supplied the enormous
 rainfall M. Hermite considers necessary to hollow out the river
 valleys as they now exist. These great rains were the cause of vast
 detrital deposits, which, collecting in basins, pressed down the
 Earth by their weight, as supposed by many other geologists of the
 present day. M. Hermite, who disbelieves in central heat, is, how
 ever, singular in accounting for the increase of heat downwards
 in the Earth’s crust by the mechanical Work done on the lower
 beds by the bulging caused by these sedimentary loads. Another
 and important e<U+FB01>ect of this bulging is to create faults and <U+FB01>ssures,
 which allow the seawater to penetrate to and ignite hypothetical
 beds of iron pyrites, creating volcanoes, which again are the cause
 of the immense Quaternary Rainfall, and so on ad in<U+FB01>nitum, in a
 sort of cycle of perpetual motion. The later phenomena of
 Quaternary times, such as parallel terraces or raised beaches, are
 accounted for by the author’s great principle of the equilibrium of
 the seas. The Quaternary precipitation being excessive reduced the
 density of the polar water.   Every such variation made itself felt
 by the surface of the sea sinking when the water was fresher, and
 therefore less dense, or rising when or where more saline and
 denser. The parallel terraces, which are frequent at the poles and
 absent at the equator, are supposed to be records of the changes in
 the equilibrium of the seas.
    The whole plan and scope of the work is so at variance with
  what English geologists have been taught to consider the true prin
 ciples of Geology, that it would be a waste of space to give further
 examples of what the author perhaps is alone in thinking is an
 explanation of the Quaternary Epoch without hypothesis.

       1. “ Manod and the Moelwyns.”                   By A. V. Jennings, Esq.,
F.L.S., F.G.S., and G. J. Williams, Esq, F.G.S.
   The area described by the authors is on the \l. side of the
Merionethshire anticlinal of Lower-Cambrian rocks, and contains
Lingula Flags, Tremadoc and Arenig rocks. The authors correct
what they think is an inaccuracy of some importance in the correla
tion of beds in diiferent parts of the range, as interpreted in the map
and memoir of the Geological Survey, and trace with greater com—
pleteness the position and constancy of the beds of slate in the Arenig
series—a point of considerable local and practical importance to those
engaged in slate-quarrying. They offer also what seems to them to
be conclusive evidence to show the intrusive nature of the great crys
talline mass known as the syenite of Tan-y-Grisiau, and to its intrusion
are due, in their opinion, the peculiar physical characteristics of the
surrounding country. Though in the immediate neighbourhood of
 Festiniog there is no direct evidence of unconformity between the
Tremadoc and Arenig series, it seems probable that an unconformity
does exist; for when traced toward the west the Tremadoc beds thin
out and the Lingula Flags are overlain by graptolite-bearing slates of
Areni g age, while eastward, near Llyn Serw, the grit comes close upon
Upper-Lingula Flags. The division of the Arenig volcanic rocks into
 Lower Ashes, Felstone, and Upper Ashes, while true of some districts
 and useful as a generalization, conveys an idea of uniformity of strata
 all round the Anticlinal which more detailed examination of different
districts does not support.

   134                      Geological Society :—
      He discusses their relationship with other drifts, and arrives at
   the following conclusions :—
      1. The glacial deposits are divisible into Upper and LOWer
   Boulder Clay, with an Intermediate series.
      2. The Lower Clay is a continuation of the Basement Clay of
   Holderness, and is the product of the <U+FB01>rst general glaciation of the
  .area. The Intermediate series passes laterally into the Purple Clays
   of Holderness, and has been deposited at the edge of the ice-sheet.
  The Upper Clay includes the Hesslc Clay of Holderness, and marks
   the latest glaciation of this region.
      3. The fossiliferous beds of Sewerby (“Buried-cliff Beds ”) and
   Speeton (“ Estuarine shell-bed ”) are older than the Basement Clay,
   and therefore than the earliest glaciation.
      4. The glaciation was effected by land-ice of extraneous origin,
   which moved coastwise down the North Sea, and did not over<U+FB02>ow
   the greater part of the Yorkshire Wolds.
      5. Neither the Boulder Clays nor the Intermediate gravels are of
   marine origin, the shells which occur in them being derivative.
      6. The ice-sheet seems to have <U+FB01>lled the North-Sea basin in this
   latitude from the commencement of the glaciation until its close.
   There is no clear evidence here for a mild interglacial period, but
   only for extensive <U+FB02>uctuations of the margin of the ice.
      3. “On a Phosphatic Chalk with Belemm'tella quadrata at
   Taplow.”    By A. Strahan, Esq, M.A., F.G.S.
     Two beds of brown chalk in an old pit near Taplow Court owe
  their colour to a multitude of brown grains. These grains are almost
  entirely of organic origin, foraminifera and shell-prisms forming the
  bulk of them. Mr. Player has analysed specimens of the brown
  chalk, and <U+FB01>nds that it contains from 16 to 35 per cent. of phos
  phate of lime. The tests as well as the contents of the forami
  'nifera seem to haVe been phosphatized, the phosphate appearing as
  a translucent <U+FB01>lm in the former case, and as an opaque mass in
  the latter. In the case of the prisms of molluscan shells, the whole
  of the phosphate appears to be in the opaque form. Minute
  coprolites also occur, together with many small chips of <U+FB01>sh-bone,
 "in which Dr. Hinde has recognized lacunae, while some have been
  identi<U+FB01>ed by Mr. E. T. Newton as portions of <U+FB01>sh-teeth.
I ' Mr. Player observes that the phosphate occurs in such a con
  dition that it would not improbany serve as a valuable fertilizer,
  without conversion into superphosphate. This condition is probably
  due to the partial replacement of carbonate of lime by phosphate
  in the organisms. The removal of the remaining carbonate leaves
  the phosphate in a honeycombed state, peculiarly favourable for
  attack by the acids in the soil.
     The author comments upon the resemblance of the deposit to the
  phosphatic chalk with Belemnitella quadruta which is largely worked
  in Northern France, and upon a less striking resemblance with that
  of Ciply, which is at a. higher horizon.

     1. “The Cross Fell Inlier.” By Prof. H. A. Nicholson, M.D.,
  D.Sc., F.G.S., and J. E. Marr, Esq., M.A., Sec.G.S.
     The tract of Lower-Palaeozoic rocks lying between the Carboni
 ferous rocks of the Gross-Fell range and the New Red Sandstone
  of the Eden Valley is about sixteen miles in length, and little more
 than a mile in average breadth ; the Inlier extends in a general
 N .N .W. and SSE. direction, and the normal strike of the rocks is
 about N.W. and           The tract is divided along its entire length
 by a fault, which separates the Skiddaw Slates (with the Ellergill
 Beds of one of the authors and the Milburn Series of Mr. Goodchild)
 from higher beds on the west. A detailed classi<U+FB01>cation of the
 Skiddaw Slates is not attempted, but the authors describe the suc
 cession of the rocks in the faulted blocks of the western portion.
Their classi<U+FB01>cation is as follows :—

    A brief comparison of these rocks with those of other regions is
made by the authors.
    Two Appendices are added. One by Mr. Alfred Harker, M.A.,
F.G.S., contains petrographical notices of certain sedimentary and
volcanic rocks in the Skiddaw Slates, of the volcanic rocks of the
Eycott and Rhyolitic groups, and of the principal varieties of

By Bernard Hobson, Esq., M.So., F.G.S.
    Omitting the Foxdale Granite, the oldest igneous rocks of the
island appear to be the diabase dykes of Langness &c.. intrusive in

intrusive in these beds, and though its age is dif<U+FB01>cult to <U+FB01>x,
it is probably newer than the Foxdale Granite, which appears to be
of post-Lower Silurian and pre-Carboniferous age.
    Next come the volcanic rocks of Lower—Carboniferous age—an
augite-porphyrite series consisting of mid, breccia, agglomerate,
bedded lava, and intrusive masses exposed in a narrow strip
extending from Poolvash to Scarlet Point. A vent seems to
have been opened during or after the deposition of the Poolvash
limestone, from which <U+FB01>ne volcanic ashes were ejected to form
marine tu<U+FB02>'. At intervals between. the eruptions the Poolvash
marble was deposited, and became interstrati<U+FB01>ed with the tu<U+FB01>'.
The vent then probably became plugged up, and a violent explosion

 Lava then welled forth, and <U+FB01>nally the volcano become extinct, and
the intrusive mass of the Stack, regarded by the author as a

close of volcanic activity that a melaphyre dyke was formed
resembling the porphyritic olivine-basalt of the Lion’s Haunch,

    At Poortown an intrusive mass occurs, provisionally termed

to be of post-Carboniferous age.

    1. “Results of an Examination of the Crystalline Rocks of the
Lizard District.”    By Professor T. G. Bouncy, D.Sc., LL.D., F.R.S.,
V.l’.G.S., and Major-General C. A. McMahon, F.G.S.
   The authors, in company with the Rev. E. Hill, spent a consi
derable part of last August in examining anew those sections in the
Lizard district which had any bearing upon the questions raised
since the publication of Professor Bonney’s second paper in 1883.
They had also the advantage of occasional conference with Mr. Teall
and Mr. Fox, whose valuable contributions to the knowledge of the
crystalline rocks of this district are well known.
    That the Lizard serpentines are altered peridotites may be regarded
 as settled, but doubts have been expressed as to their relation to
 other associated rocks, and as to the meaning of a streaky or banded
structure exhibited by certain varieties.
   The authors, after re-examination of a large number of sections,
feel no doubt of the accuracy of their original view that the peridotite
was intruded into the hornblende schists and handed “ granulitie”
 rocks, after these had assumed their present condition. In it they
<U+FB01>nd no signs of any marked pressure-metamorphism, either prior or
posterior to serpentinization. They have failed to connect the
streaky or banded structure with any foliation or possible pressure~
structure in the schists, and they can only explain it as a kind of
<U+FB02>uxion-structure, viz. as due to an imperfect blending of two magmas
of slightly different chemical composition, anterior to the crystal
lization of the mass.
   The Porthalla sections have been examined with especial care, not
only because the serpentine is nowhere so conspicuously banded, but
also because its intrusive character has been denied, both it and the
hornblende schists being ascribed to the alteration of a series of
sedimentary rocks of suitable composition. For this view the

     On a Sphemlz'tic and Perlitz'c Obsidian from ZlImz'co.       137
authors have failed to discover any evidence, and consider it
contrary to stratigraphical and petrographical facts.
   In regard to the genesis of the crystalline schists, which for pur
poses of reference were divided by Prof. Bonney into a “ granulitic,”
a “hornblendic,” and a “ micaceous ” group, the authors show that
in parts of the <U+FB01>rst the more acid rock breaks through the more basic,
as if intrusive, in others they appear to be perfectly interstrati<U+FB01>ed,
the one passing backwards and forwards, though rapidly, into the
other.    But between these extremes, intervals can be found where
the two rocks seem as if partially drawn out together. The authors
are agreed that certainly one, probably both, of these rocks are
igneous, that when the basic rock was solid enough to be ruptured
the acid magma broke into it, and sometimes softened it suf<U+FB01>ciently
.to allow of the two <U+FB02>owing for some little distance together, after
 which crystallization took place. In regard to the hornblende schists,
 the authors are not yet satis<U+FB01>ed that either <U+FB01>uxion or mechanical
 crushing will account for every structure which they have examined,
 and prefer to leave the question, in certain cases, an open one. The
 most distinctive features of the micaceous group appear due to sub
 sequent earth-movements, so that, though it exhibits some special
 characteristics, the authors are doubtful whether it is any longer
 worth while separating it from the hornblende schists.
    Of the igneous rocks newer than the serpentine, the gabbro has
 received the closest attention. It exhibits in places (especially in
the great dyke-like mass at Garrick Luz) a very remarkable foliation
or even mineral banding, which has been claimed as a result of
dynamo-metamorphism. The authors bring forward a number of
instances to establish the following conclusions :—(a) That this folia
tion occurs most markedly where the adjacent serpentine does not
show the slightest sign of mechanical disturbance; (b) that it must
be a structure anterior to the consolidation of the rock ; (c) that it
sets in and out in a very irregular manner: (d) that when it was
produced the rock was probably not a perfect <U+FB02>uid. Hence they
explain it also as a kind of <U+FB02>uxion structure, produced by differential
movements in a mass which consisted of crystals of felspar and
pyroxene, <U+FB02>oating thickly in a more or less viscous magma.
   The authors’ investigations tend to prove that (a) structures
curiously simulative of strati<U+FB01>cation may be produced in fairly
coarsely crystalline rocks by <U+FB02>uxional movements anterior to crys
tallization; and that (6) structures which of late years have been
claimed as the result of dynamo-metamorphism subsequent to con
solidation must have, in many cases, a like explanation. This is
probably the true explanation of a large number of banded gneisses
which show no signs of crushing and are holocrystalline, but in their
more minute structures differ from normal igneous rocks.
   The authors have seen nothing which has been favourable to the
idea that pressure has raised the temperature of solid rocks suf<U+FB01>
ciently to soften them.
   2. “On a Spherulitic and Perlitic Obsidian from Pilas, Jalisco,
Mexico.” By Frank Rutlcy, Esq., F.G.S.
   The specimen described is a leek-green rock with waxy lustre.

1358                    Geological Society :—
The sequence of the structures developed in it is made out to be as
followsz—First, the development of <U+FB01>uxion-banding; next, the
formation of spherulites; and then the setting up of a perlitic
structure, the <U+FB01>ssures of which were <U+FB01>nally sealed by the intro
duction of chalcedonic matter.
   A wavy transverse banding in the spherulites is apparently due
to a temporary check which the <U+FB02>uxion-bands have exerted on the
development of the crystalline bundles of the spherulites.     In one
case a spherulite has been developed prior to the formation of a
similar but larger one which encloses it. Some of the spherulites
envelop small crystals of triclinic felspar.
   The author considers it very probable that the obsidian has been
subjected to hydrothermal agency since its solidi<U+FB01>cation, and sub
sequent to the development of its perlitic structure, and gives
reasons for this view.

    1. “ On a Rhaatic Section at Pylle Hill or Totter Down, Bristol.”
By E. Wilson, Esq., F.G.S.
   In a deep railway-cutting at Pylle Hill, the Rhaetic beds, having a
thickness of not more than seventeen feet, are exposed between the
Tea-Green Marls and the Lower Lias. There is no doubt as to the
division between the Rheetic and Keuper beds in this section, but
the line of demarcation between the Rhaetic and the Lias has always
been a matter of uncertainty in the West of England. In con
nexion with this subject the term “ White Lias,” as applied to beds
some of which are Rhaetic and others Liassic, is held to be unsatis
factory. The author takes a limestone which is the equivalent of
the Gotham Marble as the highest Rhaetic bed in the section described.
He divides the Rhaetic beds of the cutting into an Upper-haetic Series
and Avik'uIa-contorta Shales. The intimate connexion betwixt the
Tea-Green Marls and the Red Marls of the Upper Keuper is well
displayed, whilst there is a sharp line of demarcation between the
former and the Avicula-contorta Shales. Most of the characteristic
fossils of the British Rhaetie are met with at Pylle Hill, together
 with a few forms which are new to England, and same of these
possibly to science.
    A detailed section of the subdivisions of the Rhaatic and adja
cent beds and a list of Rhaetic fossils found in the section are
 given by the author.

                    Transition Beds resting on Upper Lies.
     The strata are described, and the results of microscopic examination
  of the different beds given. These latter con<U+FB01>rm the author’s
  views as to the important part which Girvanellw have taken in the
  formation of oolitic granules ; whilst an examination of the borings
  referred to by Prof. Judd in the discussion of Mr. Strahan’s paper
  “ On a Phosphatic Chalk ” convinces the author that these have no
  connexion with the genus Gimanella.
     In the second part of the paper the insoluble residues left after
  treating the various deposits with acid are considered. They contain
  chie<U+FB02>y detrital quartz, felspars, zircons, tourmaline, chips of garnet,
  and occasionally rutile. In the argillaceous beds silicate of alumina
  was found to occur plentifully. The detrital material is considered
  to be due to denudation of crystalline felspathie rocks, and not of
  strati<U+FB01>ed ones. This view seems to be supported by the quantity
  of felspar and its good state of preservation.
     The paper concludes with a consideration of the quantity of
  residue and the size of the quartz-grains in the di<U+FB01>'erent deposits,
  which are summarized in the following table :-—
                                                        Percentage    Size of

     This shows a great falling-off in the percentage of residue above
  the Transition Beds. That of the Freestones is remarkably low, and
  it would appear that these rocks were formed under conditions which
  allowed of very little sediment being deposited.

further mentions that there is evidence to show that these deposits
have extended in a S. and SW. direction across the Brent and Silk
Valleys, and now occur on most of the heights in the parishes of
Kingsbury and Willesden. As the sands, gravcls, and Boulder—clay
which cover the Hendon plateau and the neighbouring heights are
found to rest on an undulating <U+FB02>oor of London Clay, and to follow
the contours of the hills and valleys, the author considers that it- is
clear that the main physical features of this portion of N .W. Mid
dlesex were moulded at a. very early stage in the Glacial period, and
before the so-called Middle sands and gravels and overlying Upper
Boulder-clay with Northern erratics were deposited. He believes
that at this time there could have been no barrier of any import
ance to prevent these deposits from extending into the Thames
Valley, and that the evidence clearly points to the conclusion that
the implement-bearing deposits on the higher horizons in the Thames
Valley should be classed as of contemporaneous age with the un
doubted glacial deposits at Hendon, Finchley, and on the slopes of
the Brent Valley, which they so closely resemble. The author is
therefore satis<U+FB01>ed that man lived in the neighbourhood of the
Thames Valley in the early part of the Glacial period; probably, he
thinks, in pre-Glacial times.

   1. “ Note on some Recent Excavations in the Wellington College
district.” By the Rev. A. Irving, B.A., D.Sc., F.G.S.
   This paper furnishes new facts of Bagshot stratigraphy obtained
from open sections since the author’s last paper was read on Nov.
12th, 1890. The whole sequence of the beds, as given in the
published section of the College Well, has now been veri<U+FB01>ed at their
respective outcrops; percentages of clay in the beds laid open in
excavations in March last along the critical portion of the ground
are given as results of mechanical analyses of samples of them; and
the northerly attenuation of the green-earth series and of the quartz
sand series is reduced to a question of mere measurement, for which
 the requisite data are now to hand.
   The author claims to have demonstrated that the mapping of the
Geological Survey contradicts itself; that later workers in adopting
this as the basis of their work along the SE. Railway have fallen
into serious error; and that a complete contradiction is given by the
facts to the adverse criticisms offered on his corrected section along
the railway, which was exhibited in November last, and is repro
duced for the present paper.

Coast of England.” By Alfred Bell, Esq.          Communicated by R.
Etheridge, Esq., F.1t.S., F.G.S.
   The author’s object- in this paper is to trace the successive stages

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              141
 in the development of the present coast of the north side of the
English Channel, and to ascertain the sources of the diversi<U+FB01>ed
 faunas.
    The <U+FB01>rst traces of marine action on the South Coast in Post
 Tertiary times are found on the foreshore in Bracklesham Bay. The
 author’s reading of the section is somewhat different from that of
 the late Mr. Godwin-Austen; and he divides the marine series into
 (1) an estuarine clay with Mollusca common to estuarine <U+FB02>ats ;
 (2) a compact hard mud ; and (3) abed of <U+FB01>ne sandy silt with many
 organisms. These beds indicate a change from estuarine to deep
 water conditions. A full list of the Selsey fossils is given, including,
 amongst other animals, upwards of 200 Mollusca. Of 35 species of
 Mollusca not now living in Britain, the majority exist in Lusitanian,
 Mediterranean, or African waters ; furthermore, nearly 45 per cent
 of the Mollusca are common to the older Crags of the Eastern
counties. The author considers the fauna of the Portland Bill
 shell-beds to indicate the further opening of the Channel subsequent
to the formation of the Severn Straits, and believes that this fauna
represents the deposits wanting between the Selsey mud-deposits
and the erratic blocks which, according to him, overlie the mud;
these Portland shells indicate an intermediate temperature “ rather
southern than northern ” according to Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys.
    In conclusion, details concerning still newer beds are given, and
lists of fossils found therein; and the author observes that there is
no evidence to show when the English Channel <U+FB01>nally opened up,
beyond the suggestion of Mr. Godwin-Austen that, if the Sangatte
beds and the Coombe Rock are of the same period, it must have taken
place after their formation.

 sky, N the number of dilfracting particles contained in unit volume
 of air, a the amplitude of the incident vibration of wave—length A,
 and p a factor constant for all values of A.
    As the greater part of my observations could not be calculated
 by this formula, I have sought the reason for the disagreement.
    The formula % is based on the hypothesis that the number N of
 particles contained in unit volume of air is sensibly the same for
all dimensions of these; it will therefore not be veri<U+FB01>ed unless this
 hypothesis is realized.
    If we compare the particles to spherical globules of density D
 and with di<U+FB01>erent radii r, falling in a medium of density p, they
 will take, at the end of a. very short time, a constant velocity of
fall in the resisting medium given by the formula
                            U:         79

    1n air we should have
                               V=A~/;.
    If, at the beginning, the di<U+FB01>racting particles, equal in number
for all dimensions of the same order as the A’s of the incident light,
are uniformly distributed in the unit volume of air and left to them
 selves, they will take different velocities according to their dimen
 sions, and we may assume that, when the permanent state is
 established, the number contained in unit volume varies, for each
 dimension of the particles, in the inverse ratio of the velocity; in
‘this case we should have

XXIII. Chemical Action at a Distance. By Prof.W. OSTWALD".
A PIECE of amalgamated zinc, as is well known, is not
          attacked by dilute acids ; if, however, a platinum wire
be wound about it, solution in the acid takes place at once
with evolution of hydrogen. Zinc, armed with platinum,
cannot be dissolved in solutions of neutral salts, as, for
instance, potassium sulphate; if a few drops of acid, as sul
phuric acid, be added to the liquid, solution again ensues.
     For the platinum to exercise its action, it is only necessary
that it remain in contact with the zinc at a single point. If
zinc and platinum be made into a curved piece, with its arms
some slight distance apart, and these be so placed in a
potassium-sulphate solution that the portions of the liquid
surrounding each arm are separated by a wall of porous
material, such as unglazed earthenware or parchment-paper,
then the question can be decided which metal, zinc or pla
tinum, must come in contact with the acid that solution may
result.
     At <U+FB01>rst sight the question seems absurd; for since the zinc
is to be dissolved, it seems self-evident that the acid belongs
with the zinc. However, if the experiment be tried, one
<U+FB01>nds exactly the reverse : the zinc does not dissolve (with the
exception of traces which would go into solution in any event)
when the potassium-sulphate solution about it is acidi<U+FB01>ed; it

is rapidly dissolved, on the contrary, with evolution of h -
drogen, when the liquid about the platinum is acidi<U+FB01>ed.      Tli'e
hydrogen appears on the platinum, as it always does when
these two metals are in contact. In order, under the de
scribed conditions, to bring the zinc into solution, the solvent
must be allowed to act, not upon the metal to be dissolved,
but upon the platinum which is connected with it.
    Zinc behaves in a solution of common salt in exactly the
same way as in one of potassium sulphate; cadmium shows
the same behaviour. Tin is quite easily dissolved in a solu
tion of common salt when the metal is connected with platinum
and the liquid about the latter is acidi<U+FB01>ed. Yet in a solution
of potassium sulphate, tin armed with platinum is dissolved,
 even with the aid of sulphuric acid, but very slowly, just as
this metal alone is attacked only in slight degree by dilute
 sulphuric acid. The behaviour of aluminium is similar to
 that of tin ; yet the experiments therewith are not so striking,
 because with a neutral solution of common salt it develops
 bubbles of hydrogen upon its own surface (which is pre
 sumably to be referred to the carbon contained in the metal);
 still, at least, solution takes place far more rapidly when the
 solution of salt is acidi<U+FB01>ed at the platinum. In potassium
 sulphate also there ensues almost no solution upon acidifying
 at the platinum, just as dilute sulphuric acid scarcely acts
 upon aluminium.
     The phenomena described agree in this, that the metals in
 question when brought, in contact with platinum, into neutral
 salt-solutions, are dissolved when the ordinary solvents of
 these metals are allowed to act upon the platinum. It ma
 be asked whether the metals which are dissolved, not wit1
 evolution of hydrogen, but only with the accompanying action
 of an oxidizing agent, may be brought into solution according
 to the same fundamental principle. Experiment answers this
  question af<U+FB01>rmatively ; even the more resisting metals, when
 connected with platinum, upon which their speci<U+FB01>c solvent is
 allowed to act, are dissolved in liquids which otherwise never
 attack them.                                              ,
     So, for instance, after a few minutes one <U+FB01>nds considerable
  amounts of silver dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid, when the
  metal has been connected with a platinum wire near which a
  few drops of chromic-acid (or potassium-bichromate) solution
  have been added to the sulphuric acid.        At the same time
  every caution ma be employed to protect the silver from
  contact with the c romate, and yet the action will be found :
  the experiment decides unequivocally, that the contact of the
  platinum with the oxidizing agent conditions the dissolving

        Prof. Ostwald on Chemical Action a! a Distance.        147
action.    Similarly silver can be dissolved in a solution of
sodium acetate.
   In the same way gold may be dissolved in a solution of
common salt, when the platinum is brought in contact with
chlorine (with a salt-solution saturated with chlorine). After
but two or three minutes, in the solution which surrounds the
gold, the characteristic reactions of this metal with ferrous
sulphate or stannous chloride may be obtained.
   I have for the most part carried out the experiments brie<U+FB02>y
described here by bringing into a small beaker an open short
tube of about 2 centim. diameter, closed below with parch
ment-paper, and then <U+FB01>lling both with the indifferent liquid,
taking care at the same time to have the level in the tube
always above that in the beaker.        In the tube was placed the
metal to be dissolved, the platinum wire connected therewith
went to the bottom of the beaker. The solvents added were
so chosen that they were heavier than the indifferent liquid;
when a few drops thereof were brought with a pipette upon
the bottom of the outer vessel they remained lying there
without approaching the parchment-paper partition, which
remained in the upper part of the liquid. After the close of
the experiment the contents of the glass could then be easily
investigated.
   These phenomena, which were in part already known, I
have termed chemical action at a distance ; because the ap
pearance in every case is as if the speci<U+FB01>c solvent of the
the metals, when ap lied at the platinum, exercises its action
at a distance upon t e metal in question. As concerns the
explanation, therefore, there can plainly be no doubt that the
electrolytic relations play here the decisive role. In fact the
simplest means of deciding whether solution ensues or not is
to switch a moderately sensitive galvanometer into the circuit
between the metal and the platinum.               While compounds
which exert no action give a current of only short duration,
which falls at once to a very slight amount, addition of the
acting substance (acid or oxidizing agent) to the platinum
causes at once a strong de<U+FB02>exion of the needle. No de<U+FB02>exion,
on the contrary, is observed when the acting substance is
brought into contact with the metal to be dissolved.
   As before mentioned, certain phenomena of this kind are
already known. Thomsen, thirty years ago *, described a
galvanic element which consists of copper in dilute sul
phuric acid and carbon in a chromate mixture; on closing
the connexion by means of a conductor between the copper
and the carbon, the metal, which alone is not soluble in sul

phuric acid, goes into solution as sulphate. It is also known
that the solution of zinc and similar metals in dilute acids is
extremely accelerated by the presence of “electronegative ”
metals, and the text-books with the mention of this fact do
not neglect to emphasize the “ galvanic contrast” which con
ditions the effect. Yet I do not know that an attempt at a
 closer analysis has been made, an effort in the direction of an
explanation of the way in which the “ galvanic contrast” can
produce such action. In fact these actions, like so many
others, seem to belong with those for which a satisfying
 explanation can be <U+FB01>rst gained on the ground of the Theory
 offree ions, of Arrhenius. They then assume the following
form.
    Assume a metal, as zinc, to be in contact with the solution
of an electrolyte, as potassium sulphate. The zinc may only
go into solution by its atoms becoming loosened from the
 metal in the form of ions with their corresponding charges
 of electricity. In what manner this charging with electricity
 takes place, and in what it consists, are- questions which we
 cannot at present answer ; but since by taking positive elec
 tricity from the ions of the metals we can get the latter
 with their familiar properties again, we are justi<U+FB01>ed in looking
 upon the taking up of positive electricity as the characteristic
 of the transition of a metal into the condition of ions.
    As positive ions leave the originally neutral zinc, the latter
 becomes charged negatively and the solution positively. This
 lasts until a certain de<U+FB01>nite difference of potential has been
 established between the metal and the solution, according to
 which just as many positive ions are attracted out of the
 solution by the negative charge of the metal, as go into the
 solution as a result of the “solution-tension” of the zinc*;
 then equilibrium occurs.      On account of the very great quan
 tities of electricity carried by the ions the necessar quantities
 of metal are extremely slight, in general too sight to be
 shown by analytical tests.
    The zinc is accordingly hindered from further solution by
 the excess of positive ions which exists in the liquid, and in
order to make further solution possible these ions must be
 removed.     If another metal, for example platinum, be con
 nected with the zinc, this assumes the same negative charge
 as the zinc. If the platinum be dipped into the liquid this
 negative charge acts electrostatically upon the excess of
 positive ions, and these collect at the platinum.
    Now the facts of galvanic polarization show that the elec
   * Refer to W. Nernst, Zeitschri<U+FB02> fiir physikalische (Jimmie, iv. p. 150
(1889).

        Prof. Ostwald on Chemical Action at a Distance;      149
trical charge can only be directly removed from the ions when
they come into contact with electrodes of the same nature.
According to the present condition of our knowledge this
occurs only in cases of positive ions, which consist of metal
atoms, in contact with electrodes of the same metal. A
system, for example, of two zinc plates in zinc-sulphate solu
tion allows the weakest galvanic current to pass through and
takes up no charge (not considerin the secondary actions
from alterations in concentration, w 'ch do not concern us
here): while, for example, a system of two platinum plates in
dilute sulphuric acid allows a continuous current to pass only
upon the application of electromotive forces of de<U+FB01>nite amount
 (over 1'8 volt), after a not inconsiderable quantity of elec
tricity has gathered upon the plates in the form of a charge.
We must conclude from this that, for the transfer of electricity
from an ion to a heterogeneous electrode, a de<U+FB01>nite difference
of potential is in general requisite, which is to be regarded as
dependent upon the nature of the ion as well as upon that of
the electrode.
   To return to the above-mentioned case, it will depend upon
the nature of the positive ion and of the electrode whether
the former, under the in<U+FB02>uence of the difference of potential
caused by the presence of the zinc, will give up to the platinum
its electricity or not. If the ion be the potassium of potassium
sulphate, which holds the electricity very <U+FB01>rmly and only gives
it up under the action of potential differences of between two
and three volts, no transfer of the electricity will take place.
If, however, the potassium sulphate at the platinum wire be
replaced by sulphuric acid, the difference of potential then at
hand is suf<U+FB01>cient to force the hydrogen ions thereof to part
with their electrical charges, whereupon they escape in the
form of ordinary hydrogen. By the combination of this posi
tive electricity with the negative of the metal the latter is
partially neutralized, the zinc, in consequence of its lowered
negative potential, becomes able to send out more positive
ions, and the action continues as long as metallic zinc or
hydrogen ions remain at disposal.
   This explanation makes apparent why in this case the
acid must be at the platinum and not at the zinc ; it throws
light at the same time upon all the peculiarities which are
manifested when zinc is dissolved in acids, and which have
till now remained insuf<U+FB01>ciently explained. It forms at the
same time the startin -point towards an understanding of the
phenomena connected with the dissolving of the metals in
general.
   Pure zinc does not dissolve in acids, as was found by De

 150     Prof. Ostwald on Chemical Action at a Distance.
 la Rive; well amalgamated zinc has the same property. The
 metal does not have, in this case, less tendency to go into
 solution than when impure ; for if it be connected with pla
 tinum, copper, or any other similarly acting metal, solution
 at once ensues.     The dif<U+FB01>culty lies, therefore, plainly not in
 the dissolving of the zinc, but in the evolution of the hydrogen;
 when this latter action is assisted the solution takes place, in
 the case of either pure or amalgamated metal.            That the
 hydrogen is evolved with difficulty at the zinc, more readily
 at the so-called negative metals, lies in the di<U+FB01>'erences of
 potential towards the electrolyte. Zinc has a strong, ositi\'e
 solution-tension, that is it sends positive ions readily into
 the liquid and opposes correspondingly the reverse action,
 the reception of positive hydrogen ions and the removal of
 their charges.    The other metals in contact with the same
 electrolyte develop a far less difference of potential, or pos
 sibly one of opposite sign, and either o<U+FB01>er far less resistance
 to the discharging of the hydrogen or even assist it.
    This is the reason why zinc dissolves in acids when in con
 tact with other metals; it is clear that the usual form of
 expression, that solution takes place in consequence of galvanic
 currents between the zinc and the other metals, does not
 entirely correspond to the facts of the case. The galvanic
 currents are indeed inseparably connected with the act of
 solution; they are, however, not the primary agent which
 e<U+FB01>'ects solution, but are produced by the act of solution which
 they must necessarily accompany, because the question is one
of the formation and displacement of ions. Solution ensues
when the possibility is present that the positive ions in the
solvent may in any way be removed therefrom.
    Differing from the simple displacement of positive ions, as
in the case of zinc (as also magnesium, cadmium, and a
few other metals), the dissolving of such metals as are not
able to effect this displacement is accomplished by means of
the destruction of positive ions, or what has the same effect,
the creation of negative ions.     Both are accomplished by the
action of oxidizing agents, the <U+FB01>rst by means of reactions
which produce non-electrolytes, the second by such as produce
electrolytes.
   An example of the <U+FB01>rst case is the dissolving of copper in
dilute sulphuric acid, which takes place slowly under the
action of free oxygen. Here the hydrogen ions of the acid
combine with the oxygen atoms to form the non-electrolyte
water, and thereby it becomes possible for a corresponding
number of copper ions to be formed, that is for the copper to
go into solution.

           Prof. Ostwald on Chemical Action at a Distance.       151
       An example of the second case is the dissolving of gold in
    chlorine-water.     In order that gold ions may enter the
    liquid there must be formed there a corresponding number
    (three times greater)’ of chlorine ions; this takes place by the
   splitting up of the chlorine molecules of the chlorine-water
   into negatively charged chlorine ions.
       The closer analysis of these reactions leads us consequently
   to conclusions by which certain assumptions in regard to
   the electrical char es of the atoms su<U+FB01>'er not inconsiderable
   changes.    Since t e time of the electrochemical theory of
   Berzelius the idea has been held that the holding together of
   the atoms in molecules is conditioned by the opposed electrical
   charges of the former, and this representation has been also
   applied to the case of the combination of the same atoms,
   which Berzelius looked upon as impossible. According to
   this a neutral chlorine molecule would have to yield a posi
   tive and a negative chlorine atom when split up.        But such
  an assumption stands in complete contradiction with ex
  perience, which has hitherto made us acquainted with nega
  tively charged chlorine atoms exclusively, and we have not the
  slightest indication that positive chlorine ions can exist. We
  must, on the contrary, in the face of the entirely general fact
  of the formation of dissociated chlorides out of the metals
  and free chlorine, make the assumption that with the break
  ing down of the chlorine molecules Cl, into chlorine ions (not
  chlorine atoms, as are formed at white heat) both parts of the
  molecule assume the same negative charge.          This seems to
  stand in opposition to the general experience that, with the
  formation of electrical charges, equal quantities of positive
  and negative electricity must always be produced. Still this
 principle is also con<U+FB01>rmed here, for from ordinary chlorine
 negative chlorine ions are formed only under such circum
 stances that, at the same time, the same number of positive
 ions is produced. The great activity of free chlorine in its
 action upon metals is conditioned by the great inclination of
 chlorine to pass over into the condition of ions ; iodine, which
 presents this inclination in a far less degree, and has accord
 ingly no such great a<U+FB01>nity to negative electricity, if I may be
 allowed the expression, has correspondinglya far less capacity
 for transferring metals into the condition of ions, or, accord
ing to the customary but ill-chosen expression, to combine
with them.
     These considerations give us the explanation for the action
which oxidizing agents show upon contact with platinum
which is connected with the “ nobler” metals. If we have,
for example, gold in a solution of common salt, it has an

152      Prof. Ostwald on Chemical Action at a Distance.
extremely slight tendency, if any at all, to form ions ; it is
far removed from the possibility of taking from the sodium
ions the necessary positive electricity. The entire action will
then be limited to the gathering of a few chlorine ions upon
the surface of the gold, and of a corresponding slight excess
of sodium ions upon the platinum. But if new chlorine
molecules be present, they <U+FB01>nd here opportunity to go over
into negatively charged ions ; the corresponding quantity of
positive electricity,which must be produced at the same time,
passes through the platinum to the gold, and the latter is put
in position to send out, or one may say is directly forced to
send out, a corresponding number of positively charged atoms,
or 1011s.
    I wish to emphasize here that, without in any way altering
the <U+FB01>nal result, the explanation may be also given somewhat
 di<U+FB01>'erently. Instead of recognizing the direct cause of the
 action in the tendency of chlorine to form negative ions, the
 active role may be ascribed to the gold, and to it be referred
 a positive tendency, though slight yet at hand, to the forma
 tion of ions. Chlorine would then play the more passive role
 by opposing to its transfer into negative ions a very small
 resistance, which is overcome by the positive tendency of the
 gold.     At present it may not be entirely easy to decide
 <U+FB01>nally between these views ; yet, without a closer discussion
 of the question, for which, however, some material already is
 at hand, I believe that the preference is due to the <U+FB01>rst.
     This presentation brings out under all circumstances the
 fact that the great signi<U+FB01>cance which the positive ion of the
 electrolyte has in cases of metals of the character of zinc, com
 pletely disappears in this case of the nobler metals. In fact,
  under the given conditions, gold dissolves as well when sodium
  chloride solution, as when hydrochloric acid, both saturated
  with chlorine, is present at the platinum, which proves that
  the positive ion present, which suffers no change at all by the
  action, is not concerned, but instead only the substance which
  is able to furnish negative ions. W'eaker oxidizing agents,
  that is such with less tendency towards the formation of
  negative ions, as for example bromine, are ineffective, as I
  have convinced myself by making the experiment.
     It- is perhaps <U+FB01>tting, at this place, to say a few words in
  regard to the expressions “Tendency ” and “ Inclination,” of
  which use has here been made. Expressions of this kind are
  properly looked upon in exact science as suspicious, so long
  as they are not accompanied by satisfying explanation in the
   form of a controllable de<U+FB01>nition. On the other hand, there
   manifests itself everywhere the need of expressions of this

       Prof. Ostwald on Chemical Action at a Distance.          153
kind for the representation of natural occurrences, and the
cause thereof lies in the following.
   The different forms of energy may be, as is known, always
resolved into two factors, one of which possesses the pro
perty that, in a system with a de<U+FB01>nite kind of energy, a con
dition independent of the time may obtain only when this,
which Helm calls the intensity factor, has the same value
everywhere in the system. Conversely, anything happens
in the system only under the condition that the values of this
factor at two places thereof are different. Difference of the
intensity-factor is therefore the cause that anything happens,
and every difference of this kind represents a “Tendency ”
or “Inclination ” of the system to equalize the difference.
Now there are possibilities, as shall in another place be more
fully explained, of hindering this equalization by the bringing
to bear of appropriate, opposing intensity-differences of another
form of energy; these are exactly the cases in which the
above-mentioned expressions “ Tendency ” and “ Inclination”
clearly present themselves, because the action is ready to
take place at any time when the hindrance present is re
moved. In this sense, that the system of metals, electrolytes,
&c. at hand contains differences of intensity of chemical
energy, which are compensated by corresponding opposing
differences of electrical intensity, or of potential, and which
assert themselves <U+FB01>rst when, by establishment of the electric
conduction, the latter are made to vanish,—in this sense have
tendency and inclination been used in the preceding, and, after
this explanation, the further use of these terms may well
appear permissible.
   If we now turn back to the subject under consideration, we
see that the dissolving of metals is in all cases in so far electric,
as it depends upon the changing of the metals into (electri
cally charged) ions.      The marked activity of the metals in
the development of electric currents depends, on the one hand,
upon their capacity to undergo this change, on the other
upon their capacity of “metallic ” conduction. Further,
when currents cannot be developed because the necessary
conductors are wanting, the quantityr of energy corresponding
to the change may assume the form of heat; as occurs, for
example, with the dissolving of metals which do not separate
hydrogen, such as copper, silver, bismuth, &c., in nitric acid
or aqua regia. In this case the question is also one of the
 replacement, by metal ions, of the hydrogen ions present;
 but since the metal is not able to take the electricity neces
 sary for the change directly from the hydrogen, a cause must
 be present to assist this action. Here, for example, the oxygen

154      Prof. Ostwald on Chemical Action at a Distance.
of the nitric acid serves the purpose.    As the latter is reduced
to nitrous acid, a bivalent oxygen atom, that is one with two
 negative electrical charges, becomes free and, with two posi
tive hydrogen ions, forms water. Thereby two metal ions
        othercorresponding
withintheir
or,                         positive
               words, are forced     charfly
                                  thereto  es the enter the
                                              can excess of liquid,
                                                             nega
tive ions now contained in the liquid. The electricity remain
ing in the metal compensates the positive electricity, which,
according to the general law of the “Conservation of Elec
tricity,” must be developed upon the separation of the negative
oxygen atom. It can scarcely be necessary to add that all the
quantities of electricity in question are, by Faraday’s law,
exactly equal to one another.
   Finally, the question presents itself whether galvanic cur
rents may not also be developed in aqueous solutions without
the help of any metal, only by means of formation and de
struction of ions.    Let us consider a liquid which has the
capacity of developing positive ions, and a second in contact
with it which can create negative ions (or destroy positive
ones) ; then the actions will again occur with especial readi
ness when care is taken that the corresponding quantities of
electricity be conducted away. This is effected by the inser
tion of conductors of the <U+FB01>rst class, which are not chemically
attacked, and which are connected so as to make possible a
reciprocal neutralization of the displaced quantities of elec
tricity.
   This case becomes realized when we bring, for example, a
solution of ferrous chloride in contact with one of sodium
chloride containing free chlorine, and dip in both solutions
connected electrodes of carbon or platinum. The bivalent
ferrous ions in the ferrous chloride change into trivalent ferric
ions. The- negative quantity corresponding to the positive
electricity is discharged through the electrode into the chlo
rine solution, and supplies there the amount of electricity
necessary for the change of the molecular chlorine into
chlorine ions, and this action continues until the supply of
ferrous ions or chlorine molecules is exhausted.
   It becomes at once clear that here we have again to do
with a chemical “Action at a distance” of the above-described
kind. For it plainly makes no difference as to the action
whether the solutions of ferrous chloride and of chlorine are in
immediate contact, or are separated from each other by any
electrolyte, as for example sodium-chloride solution.          For
since the transfer of electricity takes place from and to the
ions of the electrolytes, the ferric chloride is formed in this
case not directly from the chlorine-water but at the submerged

        Prof. Ostwald on Chemical Action at a Distance.       155
platinum plate, and the chlorine seems consequently not to
exert its action where it itself is located, but at any arbitrary
distance. Since, under the customary views, this phenomenon
presents a rather unusual aspect, I shall describe in a few
words a suitable arrangement of the experiment.
   The solutions in question are put into two small glass
beakers; in one ferrous chloride, in the other a solution of
sodium chloride saturated with chlorine: in the place of the
latter a solution of bromine in common salt solution, or one
of potassium bichromate and hydrochloric acid may be con
venientl used. In each class is placed a platinum electrode,
and hot these are joined by metallic connexion through a
galvanometer. Finally the circuit is closed by an inverted
siphon-tube <U+FB01>lled with salt-solution, the ends of the tube being
closed by parchment-paper. The galvanometer indicates at
once a current which passes in the liquid from the ferrous
chloride to the chlorine, and at the electrode in the ferrous
chloride this salt changes into the ferric chloride. In order
to render it evident that the action takes place neither at the
  archment-paper nor uniformly in the entire liquid, but is
limited to the surface of the electrode, where the formation
of ferric ions from ferrous ions by the transfer of positive
electricity is alone made possible, the ferrous-chloride solution
(which is previously to be completely reduced by digestion
with iron powder) may be treated with a little potassium
sulphocyanate ; the development of the red-brown coloration
exclusively at the electrode becomes then readily apparent.
   In place of ferrous chloride there may of course be employed
any other “reducing ” solution.       In order to realize a case,
where the transfer of electricity takes place without the inter
vention of metal ions, I have combined sodium bisulphite
with a solution of sodium chloride containing bromine, and
have observed entirely similar results; even when the con
nexion is made by a siphon <U+FB01>lled with a solution of pure
salt, in a few moments the Presence of sulphuric acid may be
detected by means of an acid solution of barium chloride,
while at the same time sodium bromide, that is bromine ions,
has been formed on the other side.
   The chan e in the ions of the sulphite, which here takes
place, may e explained in different ways. There exist in
sodium bisulphite solution the negative ions HSOB. The
change of these into the more stable negative ions of sulphuric
acid may be represented by the reaction
                        ‘l' H20=H2803 + H2809
in which the resulting acids may be considered as partially or

156     Prof. Ostwald on Chemical Action at a Distance.
wholly dissociated. In order that this ma become possible,
both of the negative units of electricity of tfie HSOB ions must
be removed ; they pass through the electrode to the other solu
tion, where they serve to change a bromine molecule, Brg, into
bromine ions. The same result is reached when the bivalent
ions of the neutral sulphite, S ()3, are supposed to be changed
into sulphuric acid according to the reaction
                          803 + H20 = H2SO4 ;
for every molecular weight of sulphuric acid formed, two
units (of 96540 coulombs each) of negative electricity must
pass through the connecting wires.
   The electromotive forces which are developed when different
solutions act upon the same metal are not unknown; they
were <U+FB01>rst extensively investigated by R. Arrott* and later by
A. Wright and C. Thompson 1'. The possibility of analysing
more closely the actions upon which they depend and of
understanding these actions in this fundamental character, was
<U+FB01>rst given by the consideration of the electrical relations of
the ions, which indeed before Arrhenius developed his so
extremely fruitful theory, was not carried out.
   In conclusion I wish to add that the description of some of
the experiments, which are communicated here, was completely
worked out at my writing-table, before 1 had seen anything of
the phenomena in question. After making the experiments on
the following day, it was found that nothing in the description
required to be altered. I do not mention this from feelings
of pride, but in order to make clear the extraordinary ease
and security with which the relations in question can be con
sidered on the principles of Arrhenius’s theo of free ions.
Such facts speak more forcibly than any pdfiamics for the
value of this theory.
   A number of interesting phenomena, with which I have
met in further investigations on this chemical action at a dis
tance, will be presented at another opportunity. 1 hope like
wise, as soon as I can <U+FB01>nd the necessary time, to be able to
produce some pertinent quantitative measurements. I do not
mention this to keep others at present from the carrying out
 of such experiments and measurements, but, on the contrar ,
 in order to express my conviction of the necessity of a search,
ing quantitative study of this <U+FB01>eld.

 XXIV. Relation of Volta Electromotice Force to Latent Heat,
    Speci<U+FB01>c Gravity, &c. of Electrolytes. By Dr. G. GORE,
    F.R.S.*
     N a research “On Changes of Voltaic Energy of Alloys
        during Fusion ” (Phil. Mag. ante, p. 27) I have shown
 that when an alloy of bismuth, lead, tin, and cadmium, and
 one of bismuth, lead, and tin, changed from the solid to
 the liquid state by gradual and uniform application of
 heat whilst immersed in a suitable electrolyte, it suddenly
 increased in electropositive state, showing that whilst ab
 sorbing latent heat it acquired greater electromotive force,
and that when these alloys solidi<U+FB01>ed, reverse effects occurred.
 M. J. Regnauld- had previously shown (Comptes Rendus Acad.
 Sci. June 10, 1878; Chemical News, v01. xxxviii. p. 33) that
 liquid gallium was electropositive to solid gallium in a neutral
 solution of gallons sulphate.
    In order to ascertain whether, in cases where the mere act
 of mixing or diluting electrolytes is known to be attended by
 absorption of heat, a similar increase of the power of exciting
 electromotive force occurs, I took the separate ingredients
 of a chilling-mixture, each in a liquid state and at the same
 atmospheric temperature, measured the electromotive force
 of a simple couple of cadmium and platinum‘l' in each liquid
 separately by the null method of balance, with the aid of a
 suitable thermoelectric pile (see Proc. Birm. Phil. Soc. vol. iv.
 p. 130; The Electrician, 1884, vol. xii. p. 414), and a galva
 nometer, then mixed the liquids, immediately took the tem
 perature of the mixture, and, after having allowed the liquid
 to acquire the atmospheric temperature, measured the electro
,motive force of the couple in it. As the changes of energy
 depend upon each of the ingredients of the mixture, it was
 necessary in each case to consider the alterations of the mean
 amount of electromotive force.
    Distilled water was used in making all the solutions. The
 proportions of substances employed were in nearly all cases
 simple multiples of their equivalent weights. The thermo
 meter employed in the <U+FB01>rst four experiments was graduated
.to '2 of a Fahr. degree, and that used in all the other‘ones
 was capable of being read to '01 of a Centigrade degree.             The
 following are the particulars of the experiments :—

electromotive force had greatly increased. The electromotive
force was quite variable in the acid solutions owing to their
great degrees of strength and the evolution of gas.

   The various cases of absorption and evolution of heat given
in this table agree with those given by J. Thomsen in his
thermochemical researches (see P. Muir’s ‘Elements of
Thermal Chemistry,’ Appendix v.).
   An inspection of the results thus obtained shows, lst, that
in 19 cases out of 20 diluting an electrolyte or mixing it with
another increased the mean amount of electromotive force of the
two liquids; and 2nd, that in 12 instances out of the 20
there was a lowering of temperature and an absorption of
heat, and in the remainder an evolution and loss of latent
heat, during the act of mixing.
   As in the whole of the 8 cases in which there was evolution
and loss of heat there was an increase of mean amount of
           " In these two cases a positive plate of zinc was used.

  166      Dr. G. Gore on the Relation of Volta Electromotive
  electromotive force, it was evident that this increase could
  not be due to absorption of energy in the form of heat. I
  therefore examined the phenomena in another manner, to
  ascertain whether they were related to changes oftotal volume
  and of mean speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the two liquids during the act
’ of mixing.
     Different investigators have shown that when a concen
  trated aqueous solution of an acid, a salt, or an alkali, is
  diluted with water, a contraction of the total volume
  of the two liquids and an increase of the mean amount
  of their speci<U+FB01>c gravities occur in nearlyr every case
  (see Watts’s ‘Dictionary of Chemistry, 2nd Supp.
  pp. 596—604). Marignac, however, found an excep
  tion with a mixture of a solution of neutral sulphate
  of sodium and sulphuric acid : in this case “ expan
  sion always occurs ” (ibid. p. 604) ; he further
  observed that contraction takes place on diluting
  solutions of hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, chlo
  ride of sodium, and sulphate of sodium (ibid. pp. 603, .
   604). J. Thomsen and others have also shown that
  when a solution of caustic soda, and of various other
  substances, is diluted, the total volume of the two
  liquids becomes less (ibid. pp. 597—600). And Nicol
  has obtained similar results by separately diluting
  aqueous solutions of potassium chloride, potassium
  nitrate, Sodium chloride, and sodium nitrate (Phil. ' = u
   Mag. vol..xv. 1883, p. 97 ; Journ. Chem. $001883,
   vol. xliii. ‘, Trans. p. 136).
      In order to ascertain whether contraction occurred
  in the whole of the remainder of the cases in which
  I had found an increased mean amount of electro
  motive force developed during the mixing, the follow

  a glass tube about 12 inches high and if an inch in
  diameter, with a perfectly <U+FB01>tting stopcock in the
  middle. The lower end of this tube was closed by a 4,:
  vulcanized rubber bung, and the upper end was <U+FB01>tted        git—(l
  with a perforated bung surmounted by a tall/glass
  tube of narrow bore open at both ends, and provided
  with a scale or index capable of sliding up or d0wn.
  The stopcock and bungs were coated with grease, and
  the apparatus was proved to be perfectly water-tight.
  The entire portion of the apparatus below the index
  scale was immersed side by side with a sensitive ther
  mometer in a large vessel of water at about 16° C., in
  order to keep the apparatus at a suf<U+FB01>ciently uniform        Q

  temperature during the short period of an experiment. The
  thermometer was capable of measuring to '01 of a Centigrade
  degree.
     The lower compartment of the large tube and the bore of
  the stopcock were perfectly <U+FB01>lled with the lightest of the two
  liquids at exactly the proper temperature; if this lower space
  was not suf<U+FB01>ciently large a glass bulb was previously <U+FB01>xed
  water-tight on the lower end of the tube. The upper com
  partment and a part of the narrow tube was now <U+FB01>lled with
the heavier liquid, and the apparatus immersed in the bath.
  When the whole had acquired the same temperature, the tap
was slightly opened for an instant and closed again, the index
 adjusted to the level of the meniscus, the tap then fully opened,
the apparatus occasionally inverted, the liquids allowed to mix,
 and the changes of total volume of the liquids and the tempe
ratures noted at stated intervals of time until all change of

making accurate measurements. The following are the results

     With the solution of aqueous ammonia, if su<U+FB01>iciently dilute,

  cyanic acid. Some practical mechanical application of liquid
  expansion by mixture might perhaps be made to produce
  hydrostatic pressure.                           .
     The above results, together with those previously obtained
 by other investigators (see references already given), show
 that in 18 out of the 20 mixtures of liquids employed in this
  research, contraction of total volume of the two electrolytes
 occurred during the act of mixing.                     This large proportion of
 cases of contraction indicates the existence of a great number
of instances of the same kind, and that probably nearly all

168                     Prof. J. Perry on the
electrolytes increase in mean amount of their speci<U+FB01>c gravities
during mixture or'dilution; these statements agree with the
usual views entertained on the subject.
   By comparison of these results with those in Table 1., and
those of Table 1. with one another, it appears, 1st, that increase
of mean speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the two liquids during dilution or
mixing occurs not only in cases in which heat is evolved and
lost, but also in those in which heat is absorbed and becomes
latent; 2nd, that increase of mean electromotive force of the
two liquids also occurs not only in those cases in which heat
is absorbed and becomes latent, but also in those in which it
is set free. And 3rd, that in 17 cases out of 20 an increase
of mean speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the two liquids was attended by
an increase of the mean amount of their electromotive force.
“to may therefore conclude that in cases of mere physical
Mixture, the changes of mean speci<U+FB01>c gravity and of mean elec
tromotive jbrce of electrolytes are probably related to each other
as concomitant effects of the same cause, change of molecular
motion. From the known general relation of increase of speci<U+FB01>c
gravity to decrease of speci<U+FB01>c heat, it further suggests the in
ference that in cases of simple dilution the mean electromotive
force of electrolytes is related to their mean speci<U+FB01>c heat.
   As in all such cases, each phenomenon,whether it be physical
mixture, dilution, speci<U+FB01>c gravity, speci<U+FB01>c heat, latent heat,
or electromotive force, involves the mutual action of two sub
stances, it is essentially necessary in every case to ascertain the
mean amount of change occurring in the two substances.
   Ina separate and more extensive research, not yet pub
lished, I have measured the losses and gains of electromotive
force by means of different positive metals in different classes
of mixtures of electrolytes, including cases of chemical union
as well as of mere physical mixture.
               XXV. The Study 0] Transformers.
             By Prof. JOHN PERRY, F.R.S., D.Sc.‘
   [The following paper was written in February last, at a time when I
had been compelled to listen to many discussions on the Transformer.
It has been nearly forgotten till now; but I see that it ought to be
published now, so that it may precede my paper read four days ago
 efore the Physical Society on ‘Mr. Blakesleys method of Measuring
Power in Transformers.”-—26th May, 1891.]
I HAVE been engaged on quite other matters during
      the last few years, and thought a few weeks ago that I
must be hopelessly in arrear concerning the subject of
                    * Communicated by the Author.

                     Study of Transformers.                   169
transformers. Every year I give to students in an “Applied
Mathematics ” class the old-fashioned formulae concerning
two or more circuits ; my students have generally worked a
few numerical examples on transformers, and we have then
gone on to other subjects.                            a
   I venture now to think that I have lest almost nothing by
remaining for so long ignorant of the vague but reckless
statements made by writers of papers on this subject, and
that students will gain something by coming back to the old
fashioned method of treating it.
   I say, on the assumption of constancy of magnetic permea
bility, of no hysteresis, and no heating of either iron or copper
by eddy currents, what are the laws of a transformer?
   Let this be found out <U+FB01>rst.
   On comparing the theoretic and experimental results, we
shall be in a position—we have never yet placed ourselves in
this position—~to theorize on the effect of the new phenomena,
and even this it will not be wise to do until we observe
whether magnetic leakage will not account for some of the
discrepancy.
   If one gives numerical values to resistances, sizes of iron,
numbers of windings, &c. it is quite easy—a matter of a few
hours at most—to calculate everything about all the currents
for a transformer with two, three, or more coils.
   This year, instead of asking my students to work a few
numerical exercises, I asked them to work out quite a number
of exercises on a transformer with two coils, and I venture to
think that the numbers given by them in the following Tables
are of even more interest—just now—than experimental
results. The tables give results that no experimenter could
give. I have had some experience myself, and really I cannot
say that I see my way, with any ordinar dynamometer, to
distinguish between a lag of 175° and 180 ; whereas in these
tables the lag sometimes varies for no load and full load be
tween 179°'94O and 179°‘942. The graphical method of
 working cannot distinguish differences so small as these.
   As for the trouble of working,—my students have much
other home-work to do, and they do it, and yet one of them
has brought me two complete tables worked out at home
between Friday and Monday.
   Let V be the primary voltage, C the primary current, It
primary resistance, L the primary self-induction, C’ the
 secondary current, It' the Secondary resistance, 11 the
 secondary self-induction, and M the mutual induction.        Let
p be a non-inductive part of the resistance of the secondary,
 the part external to the transformer. Let V' be the voltage

the primary, and P' that given out by the secondary. Then,

    As an example of a transformer with which we have
 experimented electrically and arithmetically, take R=lO
 ohms, R’='l+p, a=1000 volts, L=10 secohms, L’='1
 secohm, and take as is usual M=1 secohm. That is, assume
 no magnetic leakage. We have the following interesting
 results obtained by altering 1, beginning with a frequency of
 160 per second and ending with the rather absurd case of 1':
 more than 6 seconds. It is to be observed that when I say
 in any case that 273-:1000, or 100, I really mean that
 277T L=10000 or 1000 respectively.                        It will be observed
 [that L, M, and L' only enter into the calculations in combi

                      Study of Transformers.               "171
nation wrth 7.”.     Hence, instead of saying that my tables
show the effect of diminishing frequency in a given trans
former, I might say that they really show the effect of
keeping frequency constant and diminishing the section or
increasing the length of the iron magnetic circuit.
   Thus, for example, the table for 27'”: 100 may mean
           272100 and L=10, M=1, L’='1;
but this table is correct for
           2721000, and Lil, M=-1, L’=-01.                    i
I shall only assume, in fact, that in any table the ratios .of
L to M and L' remain constant.
   For the sake of beginners it is well to state that, using
amperes, volts, and ohms, if P and S are the numbers of
windings of the primary and secondary respectively; if a is
the cross section of the iron in square centimetres, and 7t the
average length of the complete iron magnetic circuit and a
the permeability (being about 1500 in ordinary transformer
working), we may take it that

   If two or three tables bé‘compared for which the values
of all. L differ even greatly, it will be noticed that A', e', p'
are practically the same from the very smallest to the greatest
loads. Also, except for small loads A, e, P, and E, are prac
tically the same. This is the more striking as the frequency
is greater. Now this is really the same as saying that if the
ratios of L, L', and M remain constant, considerable changes

in their absolute values do not greatly affect the results ; that
is, considerable changes in y. do not affect the results; that is,
even hysteresis need not be expected to greatly affect the
results.

   It is to be observed that in the tables, 1000, A, A’, and a’
divided by       2 give the readings on dynamometers of the
primary voltage and primary current and secondary current
and secondary voltage respectively, or their efective values.
   Note that the lag e varies considerably from no load to small
ordinary loads, but the lag e’ is always nearly 180°. And
hence the secondary voltage and currents are almost identi
cally the same kind of function of time (only of opposite
sign) as the primary voltage. To make this certain :—the
general term in V, whatever V may be, may be written .
                     a, sin ilct + b, cos Net,
and the general term in 12' is
               2" sin (21kt — 1r) + 1200s (Hat—qr),
               s                      s
where s is the same for all terms. \Ve are here considering
only the ith term.
   Evidently this is

                        s               s
and it is to be noted also that the lag is more nearly 180° as
i is greater.    I have here used k to represent 2;, the reci
procal of 1' being the frequency.          This is true also of the
primary current when R' is not great.
   With these tables before us, certain generalizations may be
made in the formulae given above. I assume, as in the tables,
no magnetic leakage, so that M9=LL'.

      In practice it is found that the secondary voltage “ dro s ”
  more rapidly than this law would indicate—a result w llCll

      Mfg 26t/i.-—When the above paper was being prepared in
  February last, not for publication, but to be handed about
  among my students to connect the results of their calculations,
  I asked some of them to repeat their calculations on the
  assumption that there may be magnetic leakage. That is,
  taking the same values of all their coil quantities as before,
  assuming that there may be a little magnetic leakage. I did
  not expect very great differences from the old numbers, but
  to my astonishment there were very great differences.
      Thus, taking R: 10 ohms, R'='l+p, a=1000 volts,
  L=l5 secohms, L’ ='15 secohm, two students have worked
  out what is the e<U+FB01>'ect of magnetic leakage, 1st, when the
  frequency is 106 per second; 2nd, when the frequency is
  10'6 per second. In the <U+FB01>rst case, two tables were calcu
  lated ; in the second case, four.
       No general mathematical expressions will show so forcibly
  the necessity for caution in neglecting leakage.

     So that even when the leaka eis so insigni<U+FB01>cant as this, its
  e<U+FB01>ect is very marked when t ere is a heavy load on the
  transformer. Of course, the secondary current and secondary
  voltage would exhibit the same kind of discrepance.
     I do not know how much magnetic leakage there may be
  in an ordinary transformer ; and indeed my present purpose
  is only to show students that as there is always some leakage,
  it ought to be taken into consideration.
     I think it impossible that the leakage should be less than one
  one-thousandth of the whole induction. That is, that '001 of
  the whole induction produced by the primary escapes the
  secondary coil, and '001 of the whole induction produced by
  the secondary eScapes the primary. The result is practically
 the same as if I said that '0005 of the primary escapes the
  secondary, and '0015 of the secondary escapes the primary.
 Now, taking a current of frequency 159 with the above
 mentioned transformer, let the primary voltage be
 V= a1 sin (1000 t + 01,) + a2 sin (2000 t+ a2) + a5 sin (3000t + a3)
                       + a, sin (4000 t + a4) + &c.
     If there were no leakage, the primary current would be
 with great exactness, if R' :1 ohm,

Hence, unless the leakage is very small indeed, or very great,
it is obvious that the primary current cannot be a periodic
function of the same kind as the primary voltage.              The
Tables and expressions show that this is also the case with the
secondary current. They also show that the secondary and
primary currents are nearly the same functions of the time,
although opposite in sign, and that they are nearly propor
tional to one another.
   All necessary general rules suggested by the Tables are
easily worked out from the formulae.        But the suggestions
are such that it is evidently worth while to treat the subject
more generally, and those who are interested in symbolic
methods, as employed in linear differential equation work,
may prefer to see the equations written as

   lf,_ then, we can neglect 2Ly0, we have the law when
there is no leakage (9).         But when 2Ly0 cannot be
neglected, of course the effect of it is to make the secondary
voltage fall off more quickly as the load increases than would
be indicated by formula           This I <U+FB01>nd shown by such
actual experimental results on transformers as I have at
command.
   As I have already said, when we assume no magnetic
leakage, it is of no importance whether we assume that per
meability is constant or not, or whether there is hysteresis or
not; the results given by (2) have been shown to be practi
cally correct for such frequencies and amounts of iron &c. as
are usual in transformers.
   But if there is leakage y, and if p. and therefore L varies
from instant to instant during a cycle, it is certain that
y will alter in an inverse way. Making, then, the very
unnecessary assumption that there is hysteresis in a trans
former, it is obvious that Ly will not vary very much during
a cycle, and the results of calculation will not be very dif
ferent from what they are on the assumption that p. is con
stant. I have elsewhere given reasons for assuming that there
is really no hysteresis in transformer working.
   Taking the sizes of iron and other dimensions of any
working transformer, and using them for calculating such
tables as I have given, it will be found that on calculating
the true power P given to the primary coil and comparing it
with W, if W is
    Effective Primary Volts >< Effective Primary Current, y
then         is nearly 1, even when the load is rather
small, and may be said to be exactly 1 for ordinary and all
greater loads, if there is no magnetic leakage. But if there
is magnetic leakage, a, is, as before, much less than 1 for
very small loads, getting greater with the load until for heavy
loads it reaches a maximum value, and for very heavy loads
diminishes again. But it is always less than 1, and is less
and less at its maximum value as the current departs further
from a simple sine function of the time. In Mr. Eliott’s
two tables,
                           W = 005 G,
and without magnetic leakage e is 0 for nearly the whole
range of load—that is :—If there is no magnetic leakage, the
power given to the transformer is obtained by multiplying

               On Measuring Power in Transformers.                    185
 effective primary volts by effective primary amperes.v But
when there is magnetic leakage, this rule is wrong. The
            P
ratio of         for example, in the second table is never greater
            W)
than cos 20°. Such experimental results as are at my com
mand con<U+FB01>rm my view that
      Effective Primary Volts X E<U+FB02>'ective Primary Amperes
give a result always greater than the true ower, even for
very great loads; a result- to be expected i there is con
siderable magnetic leakage.
      XXVI. Mr. Blakesley’s Method of Measuring Power in
            Transformem'. By Prof. J. PERRY, F.R.S.*
        R. BLAKESLEY’S method of measuring the power
           given to the primary coil of a transformer becomes
more important the more it is studied. Mr. Blakesley proved
 it to be correct if currents followed the simplest periodic law; if
there was no magnetic leakage; if magnetic permeability was
constant. Any person who has used Fourier’stheorem knows
that if Mr. Blakesley’s rule is right for a sine function, it
must be right for any periodic function whatsover; as any
periodic function may be expressed in sine functions, and
each of these enters into the equations as if it were alone-1'.
    * Communicated by the Physical Society: read May 22, 1891.
    1' This assertion was challenged in the discussion. Perhaps I ought
to have explained myself more fully. At the time I happened to be
working with Fourieris Series very much, and I lost sight of the fact
that what was very ev1dent to me might not be evident to others.
   If                  a: 2:" (ai sin iltt+bi cos ikt),
and                    y:     (at sin ikt+/8,- cos ikt),
where k=gr1r and -r is the periodic time, then the average value of my
between the limits 0 and 1- is
                               sEQR' “rt-b.- 13;),
and does not involve any term such as a,- arr or b,- Br; that is, into the
expression for the average value each term of the Fourier’s Series enters
just as if there were no other terms. Nearly all practical Electrical
Engineers are in the habit of ignoring calculations which assume that a
current is a sine function of the time; they say that such calculations
are useless because the current never is a true sine function of the time.
I have here given one of many examples which might be given in
which a proposition concerning any periodic function need only be
proved for one of the Fourier terms of that function. And in all cases,
 the result of the study of a sine function is at once applicable to any
periodic function whatsoever.                            ,

186       Prof. J. Perry on Mr. Blakesley’s Method of
   Prof. Ayrton and Mr. Taylor have proved the method to
be correct for currents of any periodic law, the permeability
varying in any way whatever.        But they make the assump
tion that there is no magnetic leakage.
   I believe that it was Dr. H0 kinson who, in his pa er read
before the Royal Society on Mgrch 10th, 1887, <U+FB01>rst eparted
from the old-fashioned way of treating mathematically the
equations concerning currents in neighbouring coils, and he
has been followed by everybody else who has written upon
that subject since. Some writers of eminence have given, and
incompletely, Hopkinson’s investigation, evidently not having
seen his paper. In my opiniout e usual method is somewhat
misleading.     Assuming no eddy currents in the conducting
part of a transformer, the equations written in the old
fashioned, and in what I venture to say is the only correct
way, become
            V=RC +Le+Me'}                                    (1)

force; 0' is its current, L' is its coef<U+FB01>cient of self-induction,
and M is the mutual induction between the two circuits.
It may be well to state that, using amperes, volts, and ohms :—

 But there is always some magnetic leakage, and it <U+FB01>lls me
with astonishment that so many investigators should assume
 that a little leakage makes no difference.

    To get an idea of the importance of even a little leakage
let us eliminate C, from equations (1) and we have the
result                                         2
                            M         LL'—M .
           V= RO—R'UG'+ TC.                           .   .   .   .  - (2)
The usual assumption that if LL’ only differs by a very little
from M2 the error is unimportant, is seen to be inadmissible
when we consider how great a value                 sometimes may have
in comparison with C or (3'.           Thus, for example, in a trans
former with which I have had something to do experiment
ally, L=l5, L'=0'l5, R: 10, and M is very nearly 1'5; so
that (2) becomes
                    V=100+ 1011'0'+(15-1\-§)C.
    Now, to take the very simplest kind of periodic current,
and the one for which the above wrong assumption is least
wrong, and a frequency of 106 per second—writing, in fact,
                              C=A sin 1000 t,
we know that                  _
                             C = 1000 A cos 1000 t.
So that, even if M di<U+FB02>'ers only by 1 per cent. from what it
has been assumed to be, that is, if there is only 1 per cent. of
                                                            2   0
magnetic leakage, the neglected term (15 — %)C becomes
of the value

or 0'3 C, or 300A cos 1000 t.            In fact, the neglected term
becomes thirty times as important as the important and
certainly hitherto non-neglected term R0 in the equation.
    Now in no case is the current truly a sine function of the
time, and any departure from this simplest kind of periodic
current makes the error of which I speak much greater.*
   ’ As an example, one of many worked out by my students at Finsbury
during the last few years : taking the sizes of iron from a certain Mordey
transformer which I have occasionally used; assuming permeability con
stant and no eddy currents in colpper or iron; assuming currents to be
true sine functions of the time. f V is voltage at terminals of rimary,
primary resistance 10 ohms, internal secondary resistance 0'1 0 m, out
side resistance of secondary in ohms being called p; self-induction of
primary 15 secohms, self-induction of secondary 0'15 secohm; assum
ing V in volts=1OOOsin2—17_T t, and taking frequency 106 or r=1+106
 second, it is quite easy to calculate to any number of places of decimals

188         Prof. J. Perry on Mr. Blakesley’s Method of
    Of course, any self-induction in the outside part of the
secondary circuit will produce the same effect as a leakage in
the transformer itself.
   The interesting fact to which I wish to draw the atten
tion of members of the Society is this, that however great
may be the magnetic leakage, Mr. Blakcsley’s method is still
correct if magnetic permeability is assumed constant during
a cycle. Multiplying equation (2) by C we have

of working is evidently quite out of the question.                  '
   My students have for several, years made calculations of this kind,
obtaining tables of values for various frequencies and amounts of iron in
the transformer, and they are exceedingly instructive. Until such tables
are compared with actual eXperimental results, it seems to me that
debates as to the effect of hysteresis consist merely of assertions having
no physical basis.                    _      _                                      ,

one third per cent., or that M: 1'48 secohms. Using this value of M we
get Table II.                _                   _
   Now it is perfectly certain that there is some magnetic leakage, always;
but it is rather difficult to say Just how much there may be. I have
here assumed in taking M'=1‘48 instead of 1'50 that 15 per cent. of the
total induction due to the primary coils does not pass through the
secondary coils, and that 1‘, per cent. of the total induction due to the
secondary coils does not pass through the primary coils. This number
has been taken at random.

    If either O or C' were the current in a non-inductive

to measure the average product b the split dynamometer
method; but there is no such error iiere.
     Hence Mr. Blakesley’s method is correct, however great
may be the magnetic leakage.                            It must be remembered, how
ever, that I have neglected eddy currents in the copper and
iron; and I assume magnetic permeability to be constant during
   Now at full loads on this transformer it is perfectly obvious that
currents, legs, and powers are immensely altered by this small amount of
 leakage which I have introduced as possible. The currents are ten times
as great, and the lags are utterly different from what they have been
supposed to be.

190         Prof. J. Perry on Mr. Blakesley’s ilfethod of
a cycle. If I had time, I could show that in alternating-current
calculations there are other very important uses of the fact
          1'+t
that           ant-.dt=0, if .z- is any periodic function of the
        t
time.
                       Added May 23rd, 1891.
   In the discussion of this paper it was obvious that I had
not at su<U+FB01>icient length made known what I meant by magnetic
“leakage.” It was owing to this, no doubt, that my introduc
tion of the idea of the importance of leakage was looked upon
as academic merely. Again, my use of the symbols L, M, and
L' did not seem to be understood, nor what they had to do
with a transformer. It is therefore necessary that I should
say more fully, but not more de<U+FB01>nitely than in the paper,
that as M is always less than VLL' owing to magnetic leak
age, I de<U+FB01>ne leakage as the value of y where
   Hence, if L=P2%T a: or P’m, say, then L'=S’m and
M=PSm(l—y).
   Again, the method of treatment to which I object is to
state the equations as
                                , d1
                        V=R(,+P-d-t,.       . . . . . . (1)
                                     d1
                        0=R'c'+sa.          . . . . . . (2)
   I affirm that the induction I of equation (1) is a very
different thing from the I of equation           As the old Max
well method of writing the equations does not seem to be
understood, I wish to make it clear that if I dld use the
induction Iwould use I in equation (I) and I, in equation (2),
where                         1
                        ID: PmU + Sm(l —y)C',
                       I,=Pm(1—y)C + Sm-C'.
   This is assuming that the number of ampere-turns which
 reduces the effective induction through the primary is
PC+SC'(1—y); and the number of ampere-turns which
produces the effective induction through the secondary 1s
                           130(1 —y) + SC’.
In fact, as I stated clearly when reading the paper, y is the

                Measuring Power in Transformers.                191
fractional portion of the <U+FB01>eld due to primary current which
escapes the secondary winding, or it is the fractional portion
of the <U+FB01>eld due to the secondary current which escapes the
primary winding. The reasoning is the same even if a small
difference be supposed to exist between the y of the <U+FB01>rst and
the y of the second equation; that is, if M is not the same
in the two circuits. I submit that in the absence of any
prior de<U+FB01>nition of “leakage” this is simple and reasonable. '
Dr. Sumpner’s “ leakage ” is a very different thing.             He
said, let ID: 18(1 +w), then a: is the magnetic leakage.
    Of course, on any reasonable assumption of alterations in
,u, the permeability of iron, or on the most reasonable assump
tion that p really is constant during a quickly-performed
cycle, Dr. Sumpner’s a; varies greatly during the cycle. I
cannot give a physical meaning to .r. My “leakage ” y does
not vary if y. is constant during a cycle, and I have given a
 perfectly de<U+FB01>nite physical meaning to it.
    It may be well to add, here, why I think it reasonable to
 assume y. constant during a cycle.                  _
     1st. I have shown that if there is any leakage, the use of
 equations (1) and (2) is quite unreasonable.
     2nd. If there is any leakage, it is impossible to treat the
 subject mathematically unless some assumption is made con
 cerning ,u.
     3rd. It is quite certain that the law of variation of p, when
 the cycle is very slowly performed must be quite different
 from the law when the cycle is very quickly performed, as it
 aIWays is in practice.
     4th. The analogies between magnetic stress and strain and
 ordinary stress and strain in materials are well established.
  Now every material exhibits strain hysteresis when slowly
  loaded and unloaded, and exhibits no hysteresis whatever
  when the loading and unloading are very quickly performed.
  Even the most inelastic of materials will transmit a musical
  note unchanged.      Hence for years I have taught my students
  to look upon magnetic hysteresis as very important when
  cycles are slowly performed and as unimportant when cycles
  are very quickly performed. Unless on this assumption, how
  is it that there is so little heating of the iron of a transformer
  by hysteresis even when transforming the largest amounts of
  energy; and such heating as there is must be partly due to
  eddy currents. I therefore maintain that a constant during
  a cycle (and this means that my “leakage” is constant during
  a cycle) is the only reasonable assumption that can be made
  in the present state of our knowledge.                          _

 XXVII. The Theory of .llagnetism and the Absurdity of
    Diamaynetic Polarity. By J. PARKER, M.A., Fellow of
    St. John’s College, Cambridge '.
l    HE most unsatisfactory part of the theory of magnetism
        is that which refers to the so-called diamagnetic
bodies.    This part of the theory is so beset with absurdities
and contradictions that it is necessary to examine it closely
and to point out the true explanation of the behaviour of
the so-called diamagnetic bodies before we can give the
general theory.
    I published a short and somewhat premature paper on dia
magnetism in the Philosophical Ma azine for May 1889.
A few weeks afterwards my ideas on t e subject had ripened
into their present form; but I determined to publish no more
about it until after the appearance of my book on ‘ Elemen
tary Thermodynamics,’ which I was then intending to write.
Finding, however, that my book was not likely to be <U+FB01>nished
as soon as I had expected, I published a second short paper
on diamagnetism in the Philosophical Magazine for July
 1890, which I thought would be sufficient to explain my
ideas until I could give the subject the attention it deserved.
    My second pa er on diamagnetism was criticised, as I have
since found, by r. Lod c with a great display of rhetoric
in the next number of t e Philosophical Magazine; but I
was then so occupied that I did not see or hear of the criticism
until the following November. When I then came to read
it, I did not <U+FB01>nd anything which required me to modify any
of my ideas on the subject in the slightest degree, and I
concluded that Dr. Lodge had misunderstood my paper.
    It is now proposed to consider the subject carefully and
completely, b which means, it is hoped, the disputed points
will be settle to the satisfaction of everybody. In so doing,
I shall endeavour to prevent all misconception by making
my arguments as clear and simple as possible. For this
reason I shall employ none but the simplest mathematics,

                the Absurdity of Diamagnetz'c Polarity.          193
  and shall avoid unnecessary references to the physical theories
  of magnetism.
   - To begin, the property which distinguishes the so-called
  diamagnetic bodies (like bismuth and copper) from the other,
  or paramagnetic bodies (like iron), is shown
  by the following classical experiment. A               Fig.1.
  small bar, A, of the substance to be experi
  mented on, is hung by a thread between the
  poles, NS, of a powerful electromagnet and
  then the magnet is excited. If the bar A be
  one of the so-called diamagnetic substances,
  it will set its length at right angles to the      N           ,_
  line joining the two poles of the electro-         :3          ii
  magnet, as shown in the second accompany-                 A
  ing <U+FB01>gure, which is supposed to be a view as
  seen by an eye looking from above. If, however, the bar A
  be one of the paramagnetic substances, it sets its length
  along the line joining the two poles of the
  electromagnet.                                          Fig; 2
      Instead of taking the above fundamental
  experiment as our starting-point, I prefer,         EA“ E
  for the sake of simplicity, to take another
  which is easier to understand. The second
  experiment has not yet been performed ; but it is admissible
  to make it the basis of our discussion, for not only is it equiva
  lent to the classical experiment described above, but the
  inferences drawn from both will be the same.
      In our ideal experiment, we take a powerful electromagnet
  whose poles are at a considerable distance apart, and hang a
  small piece, M, of the substance to be
   tested by a thread near either pole, P, of            Fig. 3.
   the electromagnet.       Then on exciting
   the magnet, it is found that if M be a
   piece of iron, it is drawn nearer the
    pole P, while if it be a piece of bismuth,        P
   it would be driven further away from it.         I             M
      The so-called explanation which is
   usually given of these phenomena may be divided into two
   parts :—
       (a) It is supposed (that is, assumed) that the pressure of
   the air is strictly uniform all over the surface of M, from
   which it would follow that the pressure of the air can have
‘ no in<U+FB02>uence in causing the body M to approach or recede
    from the excited pole P.
       (b) It is then supposed, as a necessary consequence, that
    when the electromagnet is excited, a piece of iron is attracted
    to the pole P, and that a piece of bismuth is repelled.
       Phil. May. S. 5. Vol. 32. No. 195. August 1891.         O

 194       Mr. J. Parker on the Theory of Magnetism and
    Experiments, which need not here be described, have been
 made with many solids and with liquids and gases, from
 which it is inferred that all substances are susceptible to
 magnetic in<U+FB02>uence, and it is supposed necessary to divide
 them into two classes: paramagnetic, those which, when
 placed near one pole of a magnet, are supposed to be attracted;
 diamagnetic, those which, under the same circumstances, are
 supposed to be repelled.
    I <U+FB01>rst of all deny that (a) can be correct.       For let an
 ideal right circular cylinder PQRS, inde<U+FB01>nitely small in all
 its dimensions, be described in the air anywhere near the
 pole P of the electromagnet such that at no point within the
 cylinder is the magnetic force at right
 angles to the axis of the cylinder. Also let           Fig. 4.
 the ends PQ, RS of the cylinder be normal
 sections and suppose that the radius of each
 is inde<U+FB01>nitely small in comparison with the                    R
 length of the cylinder. Then since, in the         P
 state of equilibrium, the pressure of the mag
 netized air on any surface is evidently               0.
 normal to that surface, just as if gravitation
 were the only action at a distance, it follows that the pressure
 of the air, per unit of area, at the end PQ of the cylinder is
 not the same as the pressure at the end RS. Thus in the
 space around the excited pole P, the pressure of the magne
 tized air varies from point to point, and therefore the assump
 tion (a) cannot be correct.                                 "
    The explanations (a) and (12) must therefore be modi<U+FB01>ed
 as follows :—It must be admitted that in the above experi
 ment the pressure of the magnetized air is not quite uniform
over the surface of M, but it may be supposed that the
resultant pressure is so small in comparison with the action
of the pole P that it is still necessary to divide bodies into
two classes, viz. those which are attracted by the pole P,
and those which are repelled by it.
    Now if we recollect that the so-called diamagnetic bodies
(like bismuth), which, when the magnet is excited, recede
from the pole P, are caused to do so by a force which is
evidently very minute, it will be easy to show that a very
slight inequality (too small to be detected) in the pressure of
the air on the surface of M is quite competent to produce the
phenomena observed. Diamagnetic bodies may therefore be
really attracted to the pole P, and only caused to recede from
it by an excess in the pressure of the air on the side of M
next to P over the pressure on the side remote from P; just
as a balloon is attracted to the earth and only caused to
ascend by the pressure of the air.

             the Absurdity of Diamagnet-ic Polarity.          195
   To make our argument simple, let us suppose that in our
ideal experiment the body M is a cube each of whose edges
is one centimetre, and let it be hung so symmetrically with
respect to the magnet pole P that it is only on the face Y,
next to P, and on the opposite face
Z, that the pressure of the air need                Fin. 5.
be considered. Also, for the sake
          to lie, uniform
of sim licit
pressurg)                 su ose
                   let us ovlgi') eachthe
                                       of      P I      Y M Z
these faces. Then if the pressure of
the air on the face Y exceed that                                \
on the face Z by the lOOOth part of an atmo, the resultant
pressure tending to drive M away from P will be rather over
1 gramme weight. If M be of bismuth, the most strongly
pronounced of the so-called diamagnetic substances, the mass
of the cube will be nearly 10 grammes. The resultant pressure
of the air is therefore about 116th of the weight of the cube.
It will, therefore, be capable, in one second, of generating
in the cube a velocity of 98 centimetres per second, and of
causing it to move from rest through 49 centimetres. In {
of a second, it would generate in the cube a velocity of 24'5
centimetres (9'6 inches) per second, and cause it to move
through 3 centimetres (1'2 inches).       If the pressure on the
face Y exceed that on the face Z by the 10,000th of an atmo,
the resultant pressure tending to drive the cube away from P
will be about the T%0th part of its weight. This would be
suf<U+FB01>cient, in one second, to give the cube a velocity of 9'8
centimetres (3'8 inches) per second, and to cause it to move
through 4'9 centimetres.      In é second it would give the cube
a velocity of 4'9 centimetres (1'9 inches) per second, and
cause it to move through 1'2 centimetres ('46 inch).
   The preceding calculations may well throw doubt on the
common theory of diamagnetism, but the theory has still one
apology left. It is found that diamagnetic bodies retain
their characteristic property in a comparative “vacuum” of
2 or 3 millimetres of mercury (say the BOLOth of an atmo).
To explain this, we have only to observe that if, in our ideal
experiment, the attraction of the pole P on the body M were
strictly zero, the body M would be driven away from the
excited pole P by the pressure of the air however good the
“vacuum ” might be, short of absolute perfection. Hence if
the attraction of P on M be not strictly zero but exceedingly
small, it will be necessary to reduce the density of the air
very nearly to zero before this attraction can make itself
manifest.
   Having now shown that the common notion of diamagne
                                  O2

196'     Mr..J. Parker on the Theory of Illagnetism and
tism rests on insuf<U+FB01>cient experimental evidence, or rather,
on none at all, I may add that no one has ever attempted
to support the notion by theory. This will prepare the way
for my alternative idea, based on theory, that every substance
placed near one pole of a magnet is attracted by the pole
when the magnet is excited and can only be prevented from
approaching the pole by some antagonistic cause, such as
the pressures exerted by the contiguous objects. In the
common theory of diamagnetism, it is supposed that bismuth
is more powerfully repelled by a magnet pole than any
other substance; according to my theory, bismuth is more
feeny attracted than any other substance.
 ' Before giving the theoretical grounds of the new theory,
I cannot help observing that those who think the old theory
of diamagnetism sufficient, should try to prove that the
ascent of a balloon in the air is due to the diagravitational
repulsion of the earth. Those who accept the new theory,
will be content to regard diagravitation and diamagnetism as
companion absurdities.
   I was <U+FB01>rst led to reason theoretically on diamagnetism
by reading the following remarkable article in Prof. Tait’s
"Sketch of Thermodynamics ’ :—“ The commonly received
opinion, that a diamagnetic body in a <U+FB01>eld of magnetic force
takes the opposite polarity to that produced in a paramagnetic
body similarly circumstanced, is thus attacked by Thomson
by an application of the principle of energy. Since all para
magnetic bodies require time for the full development of their
magnetism, and do not instantly lose it when the magnetizing
force is removed, we may, of course, suppose the same to be
true for diamagnetic bodies; and it is easy to see that in
such a case a homogeneous non-crystalline diamagnetic sphere
rotating in a <U+FB01>eld of magnetic force would,it' it always tended
to take the opposite distribution of magnetism to that acquired
by iron under the same circumstances, be acted upon by a
couple constantly tending to turn it in the same direction
round its centre, and would therefore be a source of the per
petual motion.”
   This argument, which, for some unaccountable reason, seems
to have been entirely neglected, requires to be slightly mo
di<U+FB01>ed; for no notice is taken of the frictional resistance of the
air to the rotation of the sphere, and it is not shown that the
 motion supposed to be thus derived in unlimited quantities
 may not be due to the absorption of heat at one temperature
 and its partial rejection at a lower. These defects may be
 obviated by supposing the sphere placed in a, “ perfect
 vacuum,” and making provision to prevent the system

            the Absurdity of Diamagnetic Polarity.            197
absorbing or giving out heat except at some constant absolute
temperature 0. Also, for the sake of simplicity, we may
suppose the sphere connected with mechanism, on which it
does just so much work that its angular velocity of rotation
remains constant. Under these conditions the system will
assume an invariable state. If we then suppose that W is
the mechanical work done on the system in any time, and Q.
the amount of heat absorbed, the principle of energy will
give, since there is no change of state,
                           W+Q=O.
   Now since work is obtained from the system, W is negative.
   We see, therefore, that Q is positive.
   But by Carnot’s principle, we have
                       53¢), or Q<O.                             ;
Thus Thomson’s ideal experiment is inconsistent with both
the principle of energy and with Carnot’s principle, and the
hypothesis of diamagnetic polarity is therefore disproved.
   The argument adopted in the two papers I have published
on diamagnetism in the Philosophical Magazine is only a
modi<U+FB01>ed form of Thomson’s, but possesses the advantage of
simplicity. It may be described thus: Take a piece of bis
muth (or of any of the so-called diamagnetic substances) and
place it within the action of a strong steel magnet whose
poles are so far apart that only one of the poles, P say, exerts
any sensible force on the bismuth. Then let the steel magnet
be made immovable, and suppose the piece of bismuth held
by a pair of pincers, or in some other way, so that it can
either be kept at rest or moved about at will. Next, let the
air be exhausted in the space about the bismuth until the
“ vacuum” is perfect, and, lastly, let means be taken to pre
vent the absorption or rejection ot'heat, except at some constant
temperature 6'.
   If the piece of bismuth is held for some time in any posi
tion X and then suddenly moved to a new position Y,
nearer to P, the magnetization of the bismuth will, of course,
become ultimately stronger in the position Y than it was in
the more remote position X; but, since magnetization re
quires time for its development, the change of position may
be effected so rapidly that the magnetization of the bismuth
has scarcely time to alter before the new position Y is reached;
We thus see that the amount of mechanical work which can
be obtained from the system of the steel magnet and the
piece of bismuth during a given change of position depends,

198       Mr. J. Parker on the Theory of Magnetism and
among other things, on the speed at which the change of
position is made. Suppose then, if possible, that the bismuth
is repelled by the pole P, and let the system be made to
undergo the following cycle of operations in two di<U+FB02>'erent
ways :—
   (1) When the piece of bismuth is in equilibrium in any
position X at the uniform temperature 0, let it be moved to
some other position Y, nearer P, so slowly that at every point
of the path the bismuth is magnetized to the full extent and
the temperature constant. The work done on the system in
this operation will be positive, and may be written W.
   Then let the piece of bismuth return slowly from Y to X
by the previous path reversed. The whole of the work W
will thus be returned by the system, so that, on the whole,
there is neither loss nor gain of mechanical work during the
   cle. Let the piece ‘ of bismuth be moved from X to Y so
cy(2)
rapidly that the magnetization has scarcely time to change
before the change of position is complete.      The work that
must be expended for this purpose is obviously < W ; in fact,
if the position X be far enough away from P, the work done
on the system during the change of position may be practi
cally zero. Next, let the piece of bismuth remain at rest in
its new position until its magnetization has attained its per
manent value. Then let it be brought rapidly back from Y
to X by the <U+FB01>rst path reversed ; and, lastly, let it remain in
the position X until the original state is attained. The
mechanical work returned by the system in this way will be
 >W. Thus, on the whole, there is a gain of mechanical
work during the cycle in which heat is absorbed and evolved
at a constant temperature. This being impossible, by the
principle of energy and Carnot’s principle, we conclude that
the assumption that the piece of bismuth is repelled by the
pole of the magnet is absurd.
   The foregoing cycle was described in my <U+FB01>rst paper on
diamagnetism; but the inference then drawn was, not that
diamagnetism is impossible, but that Carnot’s principle does
not hold for diamagnetic bodies. In my second paper, I
denied the existence of diamagnetism ; but long before that
time Duhem had arrived at the same conclusion, from reading
my <U+FB01>rst paper, and had written a book on the subject.
    I must now point out that Dr. Lodge has objected, with
justice, to the preceding reasoning, that it contains a tacit
assumption. Thus, even if we admit, as we are bound, that
the magnetization of every body takes time to grow and to
die away, it is not proved but that, in the second way of per

             the Absurdity of Diamaynetic Polarity.            199
 forming the experiment described above, the assumed repul
 sive force between the steel and the bismuth may be so
 affected by the rapidity of the motion that the work required
 to force the bismuth from the position X to the position Y
 ma)r be > W, and not less, as we supposed.
    Dr. Lodge‘s objection may be illustrated very simply as
 follows :—Let a quantity of gas be contained in a. cylinder
<U+FB01>tted with .a smooth air-tight piston, and suppose it to be
provided that the cylinder can absorb or give out heat freely,
but only at some constant temperature 0. When the whole
is in equilibrium at the uniform temperature 9, let the piston
he pushed in so slowly that the system is constantly in equi
librium, and the temperature always uniform and equal to 6.
The work required for this purpose may be called W. Then
let the piston be drawn out slowly until the original state is
attained. The work restored will be W, and, on the whole,
there will be neither loss nor gain of work.
   Next, let the piston be pushed in as much as before, but
far m0re rapidly. The work expended on the system in
doing this will be >W. Now let the piston remain in its
new position until the temperature has everywhere sunk to
0. Then let the piston be rapidly drawn out to its original
place, and then wait until the original state is brought about.
The work restored by the system will be <W, so that there
will have been a loss of mechanical work in the cycle.
   Dr. Lodge’s objection may be obviated by means of two
assumptions :—
   (1) We assume that the magnetization of a body at rest
may be in a state of unstable equilibrium. For example, in
the experiment with the piece of bismuth, we assume that
when the bismuth is at rest in any position X, the repulsive
force of the steel magnet may have a value f which does not
properly belong to the position X, and that this force may
continue unchanged so long as the bismuth is held steadily
enough in the position X. We further assume that if the
bismuth be moved slowly from the position X, and then
slowly brought back again, the repulsive force of the steel
magnet will again be        if suf<U+FB01>cient care has been taken to
move the bismuth about steadily. \Vhen the magnetization
of a body at rest is in a state of unstable equilibrium, a slight
shake, by which no perceptible amount of mechanical work is
done, will be suf<U+FB01>cient to cause the magnetization to rise or
sink to its proper value.
   (2) We also assume that if two magnetized bodies be
moved about with any velocities, the attraction or repulsion
between them when they are passing through any given

200       Mr. J. Parker on the Theory of Magnetism and
position may, if the experiment is made steadily enough, be
exactly the same as if both bodies were at rest in that position
with their magnetizations invariable.
    In applying these assumptions to the second method of
making the experiment with the piece of bismuth, let us
suppose, merely for the sake of simplicity, that the magneti
zation of the steel is "“ rigid,” that is, not merely unstably
invariable, but invariable under all circumstances. Then let
the cycle be performed as follows :—
    (a) Let the bismuth be moved from Xto Y so steadily
that its magnetization is unaltered. It is evident that no
thermal phenomenon will attend this operation, and that the
work done on the system will be <W.
    (b) The magnetization of the piece of bismuth now being
in unstable equilibrium, let a slight shake, by which no per
ceptible amount of mechanical work is done, be given to the
bismuth, in consequence of which the strength of the magne
tization will be affected, and a thermal phenomenon take
place. Then let the bismuth be held in the position Y until
the temperature is again 6, and the magnetization at its proper
value.
   (0) Next let the piece of bismuth be brought back from Y
to X by the <U+FB01>rst path reversed, and so steadily that the
magnetization does not change. The work restored by the
system during this operation is > W.
   (d) Lastly, leta slight shake be given and hold the piece of
bismuth in the position X until the system is in the original
state.
   We see therefore that if the two assumptions are made, the
hypothesis of diamagnetism enables us to obtain work from a
cycle in which heat can only be absorbed or given out at a
given constant temperature 6. We now contend that the
two assumptions are admissible. We shall establish the truth
of this assertion indirectly by showing what results the two
assumptions lead to when applied to several of the most
important propositions in magnetism and electricity.
   1. If in the modi<U+FB01>ed Thomson’s argument, we suppose the
piece of bismuth replaced by any substance S which is attracted
to the pole P, it will easily be seen that if the magnetization
of S increases as the distance from P decreases, our two
assumptions do not lead to a result in contradiction to the
principle of energy and to Carnot’s principle. we there
fore conclude that a substance may be attracted by a magnet
pole—a result which, of course, is in accordance with ex
periment.
   It is necessary to notice another method of making the

               the Absurdity of Diamagnetic Polarity.         201
  experiment.     If the substance S be brought from X to Y, a
  positive quantity of work, W1 say, will be obtained. Then if
  S be turned round without altering the magnetization, the
  force between P and S will become repulsive, and therefore
  if S be brought back from Y to X without any change in the
  magnetization, another positive quantity of work, W2 say,
  will be obtained. In this way, it might be thought, we could
  prove that S could not be attracted by P, but we must
  recollect that work will have been expended in turning S
  round. In fact, we may be sure that the work expended in
  turning S round, <U+FB01>rst in the position Y, and then in the
  position X, will be >W1+W2.
      II. Generally, if the substance M, when removed to a suf<U+FB01>
  cient distance from the pole P, is in the neutral state, it can
  easily be proved that when 'M is near P, and its magnetiza
  tion in stable equilibrium, M must be attracted by P with a
  force which increases as the distance from P decreases. Such
  a substance is de<U+FB01>ned to be “ perfectly soft,” and since
  unstable states of magnetization do not occur in practice, we
  may say that a “ perfectly soft ” substance can only be
  attracted by a magnet pole.
      Of course, a substance S may be repelled by the pole P,
- but in that case, it can easily be shown, the magnetization of
   S could not be zero when it is at a great distance from P.
   The substance S would then be a permanent magnet, or its
  magnetization would consist of a permanent part combined
  with a temporary part induced by the in<U+FB02>uencing pole P.
      III. If we now suppose the pole P replaced by a positively
  electri<U+FB01>ed body and the piece of bismuth by a negatively
  electri<U+FB01>ed body B, the force between the two bodies will be
  attractive, and when B is moved from X to Y in such a way
  that the distributions of the electri<U+FB01>cations are in stable
  equilibrium, the attraction on B in the position Y will be
  greater than if the distributions had not been changed.
   Hence if W be the positive quantity of work yielded by the
  system when B is moved from X to Y in such a way that at
  every instant the distributions are in stable equilibrium, then
  when B is moved from its initial position X, in which the
  distributions are stable, to the second position Y, without any
  change in the distributions, the work yielded by the system
   will be <W. Also if, after causing the distributions in the
  position Y to become stable, we bring B back from X by the
  previous path reversed without any change in the distribu
  tions, the work so done on the system will be >W. Conse
  quently, if the system is now caused to resume its original
  state, a complete cycle will have been undergone, and a posi

202       Mr. J. Parker on the Theory of Magmtism and
tive quantity of work expended in it, which is in accordance
with the principles of thermodynamics.
  IV. Next, let both bodies be positively electri<U+FB01>ed, and suppose
that they are at such a distance from one another throughout
the experiment that the force between them is always re
pulsive. Then, when B is moved from X to Y in such a way
that the distributions are constantly in stable equilibrium, the
repulsion on B in the position Y will be less than if the dis
tributions had not changed. (In the case of a supposed
diamagnetic “soft substance,” it will be recollected that the
repulsive force in the position Y was greater than if there
had been no change in the magnetization.) From this it is
easily seen that electric repulsion is in accordance with the
principles of thermodynamics.
   V. Again, if we assume the principle of the conservation of
electricity, which can be partially obtained as a theoretical
deduction from the principle of energy and Carnot’s principle,
our two assumptions enable us to <U+FB01>nd expressions for the
energy and entropy of an electri<U+FB01>ed system at rest in which
the distribution of electricity is in equilibrium, stable or
unstable. Then we can easily <U+FB01>nd the condition of electric
stability on an insulated homogeneous conductor. For if P,Q
be two points of such a conductor, our expressions show that
if the potential have a higher value at P than at Q, it will be
possible for electricity to pass, of itself, from P to Q, but not
from Q to P. Conversely, if the potential at P be less than
at Q, electricity will be able to pass, of itself, from Q to P,
but not from P to        Suppose, for example, that the potential
at P is greater than at Q: then a slight shake may cause a
passage of electricity from P to Q, and this will diminish the
potential at P and increase it at        Thus the potential tends
to become uniform throughout the conductor, and when it has
become uniform, the distribution is stable.
  VI. Again, our expressions for the energy and entropy enable
us to discuss the conditions of stability of tWo conductors A,
B, separately homogeneous, which are in contact with each
other, and isolated from all other bodies. For if P be a
point in the body A, and Q a point in the body B, our expres
sions show that if the potential at P exceed the potential at
Q by more than a. certain amount, electricity will be able, of
itself, to pass from P to Q, but not from Q to P; and con
versely. Thus the condition of stability is that the potential
should be uniform throughout each conductor, and that the
two values should differ according to a certain law; all which
is veri<U+FB01>ed by experiment. Again, if the distributions be
inde<U+FB01>nitely near stable, and we suppose» a small charge to
pass from one conductor to the other, our theory indicates

                       the Absurdity of Diamagnetic Polarity.            203
          that it will be necessary to impart or take away» heat to keep
          the temperature of the junction of the two bodies constant.
          In other words, the theory gives both the difference of poten
          tial and the Peltier eli'ect.
              Now it is important to remark that by merely assuming
           our expressions for the energy and entropy to hold for stable
           distributions and without making any further use of the con
           ception of unstable distributions, we can easily obtain the
          very same expressions for the difference of potential and the
           Peltier effect as before.
              In like manner, we have two methods of discussing the
           question of a difference of potential and the law of the Thomson
          effect, in the case of two unequally heated portions of the same
          substance in contact, and both methods give the same results.
             VII. Lastly, we have two ways of investigating Helmholtz’s
          theory of the galvanic battery, and both lead to the same
          conclusions. This theory, it is true, has been questioned;
          but the objections appear to rest on misconceptions; and,
          besides, the theory does not seem to have been yet suf<U+FB01>—
          ciently explained. However, I do not propose to consider
          the subject any further at present, but merely wish to point
          out that we have two ways of getting the same result.
              I have now, I consider, conclusively shown that my two
          assumptions are legitimate; and yet, at the same time, I
          acknowledge the importance of Dr. Lodge’s objection, in
        ' requiring us to examine the tacit assumptions which lie at
          the root of all thermodynamical investigations of electricity
          and magnetism.
‘4‘“rr“       To conclude our discussion on diamagnetism, I observe
           that, so far as I am aware, no one has ever attempted to
          advance any serious theoretical or other arguments in favour
           of the common notion of diamagnetism. The theory appears
          to have owed its origin to the want of a theoretical examina
          tion of the subject, and to have been maintained from an
          excusable veneration for an old theory and a belief in the
          infallibility of the older scientists. Yet it has been occasion
          ally questioned from the <U+FB01>rst. Duhem, in his book on dia
          magnetic bodies, mentions Becquerel and Pliicker as having
          objected to the theory. Even in England there are persons
          who have never accepted it, and Dr. Lodge himself seems to
          be aware that it will not stand examination; for in his
          criticism on my two previous papers on the subject, he
          appears to rely chie<U+FB02>y on the strength of his rhetoric, and on
          an appeal to the name of Faraday.
              I now proceed to the next part of the paper.
                                     [To be continued]

‘   logies in the Met/rods of Measuring Power. By Prof.

                                   I.
  IN a paper read by us before this Society on March 6th it
       was pointed out that for every problem involving alter
  nate P.Ds. in series there was an analogous problem involving
  alternate currents in parallel. This general proposition tells
  us that we can transform each of the P.D. equations given,
  for example, in our paper on “ The Measurement of the Power
  given by any Electric Current to any Circuit,” read before
  the Royal Society, April 9th, 1891, into a current equation,
  and so transform our method of calculating power by the
  measurement of three P.Ds. into a method of calculating
  power by the measurement of three currents.
                 @               Fig. 1.
     Such a transformation of our equations has been recently
  carried out by Dr. Fleming in the ‘ Electrician,’ for May 8th,
  and the method he arrives at as
  well as the three-voltmeter method
  of which it is an analogue are seen               Fig. 2
  in <U+FB01>gures 2 and 1. If V1, V2, V3
  be the readings of the voltmeters
  in <U+FB01>gure 1, and A1, A2, A3 the
  readings of the three ammeters in
  <U+FB01>gure 2, and r the resistance of
  the non-inductive portion of the
  circuit cd in each case, then the
  mean watts given to ab are re
  spectively, whatever he the nature
  of the circuit ab, or of the current
                         %, (Vs2 — V12 ‘_ V22)

   Alternate Current and Potential Diference Analogies.    205
   The three-ammeter method has the advantage over the
three-voltmeter method, in that the dynamo need not give
a larger P.D. than that necessary to send the current through
ab; it is inferior to the three-voltmeter method in that while
it is possible to measure VI, V2, and V, rapidly in succession
by using only one voltmeter, it is, of course, impossible to
use only one ammeter to measure A1, A” and A3 without con
stantly interrupting the circuit, and hence it would be neces
sary to accurately calibrate three instruments if this current
method were employed.
   But the main objection to this current method is that, as
Dr. Fleming points out, it does not possess the accuracy of
our three-voltmeter method of measuring power. For in
order that this three-current method may give accurate
results it is necessary to assume, to quote from our Royal
Society paper, “the entire absence of self and mutual induc
tion from a circuit some portion of which is necessarily of a
solenoidal form.”
   It is possible, however, to obtain a current analogue of our
three-voltmeter method which shall have the accuracy of the
three-voltmeter method itself. And as the general propo
sition given in our previous paper tells us that the current
analogues of RD. arrangements in series are current arrange
ments in parallel, it follows that with this other method also
the dynamo will not be required to produce a greater P.D.
than that necessary to send the current through the circuit
the power given to which we desire to measure.
   The method is as follows :—In parallel with the circuit ab
(<U+FB01>g. 3) the power given to which
we wish to measure connect a          .        F‘g'3'

necessarily make the so-called                    g 1'
non-inductive branch more or                      g
less inductive)(.1 Let Zita, it” and

as shown, then, from the equa-               _
tions given in our Royal Society paper, 1t follows at once
that the mean watts given to ab are
                    aAg-Ai—en
 . It is interesting to notice that if ab were the primary coil
 of a transformer, it would be when the load on the secondary

 206      Prof. Ayrton and Dr. Sumpner on Alternate
 was small, that is when the current passing through ab
 was small, that it would be most dif<U+FB01>cult, on account of lag,
 to measure with ordinary methods the power given to ab.
 But that is exactly the case when it is most easy to use our
 one-voltmeter and two-ammeter method, since when the
 dynamo has to send little current through ab there is little
objection to requiring it to send a current through at in
 parallel with ab.
  - If the voltmeter (<U+FB01>g. 3) be a hot wire instrument, then,
 since an appreciable current will pass through this voltmeter,
 1* must be taken as the parallel resistance of cd and of the
 voltmeter. It is important to observe, however, that there
 is no necessity to know either of these resistances separately,
 since the value of r can be determined when the three instru
 ments A1, A3, and V are relatively calibrated thus :-—First,
 break the circuits of cal and of the voltmeter, and compare
 the de<U+FB02>exion of A3 with A1; this calibrates ammeter A3
 relatively to ammeter A1, the calibration of which we will
assume to be correct ; second, close the circuits of ad and of
the voltmeter, but break the transformer circuit ab, A3 is now
in series with the parallel circuit containing cd and the volt
meter. The value of o- is therefore at once known, since
r must equal the volts as read by V divided by the amperes
as read by A3.
                                 II.
    As an illustration of the general proposition to which we
have referred, it ma      interest the Members to see what are
the other analogies t at we have traced out between alternate
P.Ds. in series and alternate currents in parallel in connexion
 with the measurement of power.

    Mr. Blakesley’s method, communicated to this Society in
 February of this year *, is the current analogue of our electro
meter method of 1881. For with the electrometer method
 (<U+FB01>g. 4) we make two measurements, one giving us the mean

which is equal to 1' times the mean watts given to ab

 is obtained, and this is equal to % times the mean watts
given to ab (<U+FB01>g. 5).
     It is important to notice that as no instrument is inserted
in the non-inductive circuit ab (<U+FB01>g. 5), this method of
Mr. Blakesley’s has exactly the same accuracy as the electro
meter method.
                                       III.
     The electrometer measurements may, as we pointed out
some years ago, be varied; and by making the connexions
as seen in <U+FB01>g. 6, we can obtain from the two readings the
mean values of

to ab.

   Mr. Blakesley has also pointed out, in his paper published
in the Phil. Mag. for April of this year, that the current
measurements may be varied and the apparatus arranged as
seen in <U+FB01>g. 7.           The two mea-            _

   While, however, our second method of using the electro
 meter (<U+FB01>g. 6) gives the answer with the same accuracy as
 the <U+FB01>rst method (<U+FB01>g. 4), Mr. Blakesley’s second method of
joining up the dynamometers in <U+FB01>gure 7 introduces self
 induction into a circuit which ought to be entirely non
 inductive, and so it does not give t 0 answer with the same
 accuracy as his <U+FB01>rst method (<U+FB01>g. 5).
                                    IV.
    The modi<U+FB01>cation of our electrometer method suggested to
 one of us by Mr. L. Atkinson, while he was a pupil at the
 Finsbury Technical College, and afterwards carried out by

            Current and Potential szerence Analogies.                209
  MM. Blondlot and Curie, of making an electrometer with
  two needles for the measurement of power, is the exact
  analogue of the wattmeter method. For with the double
  needle electrometer (<U+FB01>g. 8) we obtain from a single reading
 the mean value of
                           ("1 — ’02) (v2 '- 1’3);
  which is equal to r into the mean watts given to ab.         Similarly
 with the wattmeter (<U+FB01>g. 9) we obtain from a single reading
 the mean value of
                                                       Fig. 9.
                   “1‘13;
 which is proportional to éinto the
 mean watts given to ab.
    While, however, the double-needle
 electrometer gives us the answer
 with perfect accuracy, the watt
 meter method is liable to inaccuracy
 from the circuit cd not being strictly
non-inductive.
    Some years ago, at a meeting of the Institution of
Electrical Engineers, one of us published the formula for the
error made in using a wattmeter to measure the ower given
by an alternate current to an inductive circuit. §ot wishing
to cumber the pages of scienti<U+FB01>c periodicals with elementary
mathematics, it was thought suf<U+FB01>cient merely to state this
formula without publishing a proof.             But as our formula has
now been introduced into text-books, and as the appropria
tion thereof by the writer of a well-known treatise has
led him to supply a proof of it involving an appalling
array of mathematical equations, we venture to offer a proof
which, although very simple, is perfectly accurate. We are
the more induced to do this because we <U+FB01>nd that this formula,
and its proof for the error due to self-induction in the sup
  osed non-inductive portion of the circuit cd, apply equally
well to all the nine methods of measuring power illustrated
in <U+FB01>gures 1 to 9 of this paper.

    The formula employed with such methods for giving the
mean watts, whether it involves the reading of one instrument,
as in the case of the wattmeter (<U+FB01>g. 9), or of two instru
ments, as with the methods illustrated in <U+FB01>gures 4, 5, 6, 7,
and 8, or of three instruments, as with the methods illustrated
in <U+FB01>gures 1, 2, and 3, gives with perfect accuracy 1- times the
mean product of two currents, or ; times the mean product
 of two P.D.s. Whether this mean product is directly pro
portional to the mean watts given to ab depends in all the
nine cases on the following consideration :—
     The mean product between two currents which are sine
 functions of the time is, as every student now knows, equal to
 half the product of their maximum values into the cosine of the
 phase angle between them.       Therefore if the angle of lag be
 tween the current in ab and the RD. between its terminals be
 (9, and the angle of lag between the current in cd and the
 PI). between its terminals be ¢, and if the maximum values
 of the currents in these two circuits be A,’ and A2’ respec
 tively, and the maximum values of the P.D.s at the terminals
 of these circuits be V1’ and Vg’, it follows that the formula
 used to measure the watts in the cases 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9
 gives

as we did in 1888, where p equals 21:- times the frequency, it
must be remembered that while I and r are the true values of
the self-induction and resistance of cd, L and R are only
the effective self-induction and resistance of ab. Hence, as
 Mr. Blathy suggested in the ‘Electrician’ for 1888, it is
 better to loaVe our expression for the ratio of the apparent to
 the true watts in the general form as given in (1) rather than
 to put it in the derived form as given in (2).
    ¢ will generally be positive if the resistance of cd is small;
 but, if cd contains a doubly-wound high resistance-coil, as is
 generally the case when cd is the <U+FB01>ne-wire circuit of a watt
 meter, then it- is quite possible to make qb positive, nought, -
 or negative. 0 may, of course, be also positive, nought, or
 negative, depending on whether the self and mutual induction
 e<U+FB02>'ects preponderate or not over the capacity effect.        It is
 therefore possible to have either 0 or <1), or both, positive or
 negative.
    The apparent watts will therefore be :—
 too large if 6 and 42 be both of the same sign and 9 >¢ ;
             .    (I) 9 and ¢ be both of the same sivn and 0 < ¢;
 too small if {(2) 9 or (j) be of different signs ;0
      _   -       (1) 0 and 95 be equal ;
 correct if     { (2) ¢ be nought.
     Now ¢ can be made very small in one or other of three
  ways :—
     1. Use some method of testing, like that shown in <U+FB01>gures
          1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8, which does not require any
         measuring instrument to be placed in the non
          inductive circuit cd.

  212.     Prof. Ayrton and Dr. Sumpner on Alternate
     2. Use a wattmeter (<U+FB01>g. 9), and make the capacity of
          the stationary doubly-wound resistance-coil exactly
          balance the self-induction of the suspended and the
          stationary coils.
   i 3. Make   the resistance
          wattmeter           of the
                      small. For   with<U+FB01>ne-wire
                                         a given circuit, ad, of the
                                                 P.D. between    the
          terminals of cal the same de<U+FB01>exion of the measuring
          instrument can be obtained for di<U+FB02>'erent values of the
          resistance of ad if we make the number of turns in
          the coil or coils of the measuring instrument in cal
          proportional to the resistance cd.         But the self
          inductiou of the coil or coils is proportional to the
          square of the number of turns, and therefore pro
        ' pertional to the square of r for a given de<U+FB01>exion of
          the measuring instrument. Hence tan gb can be
          made as small as we like for a given value of p by
          making the resistance of ad small.
     This suggests a current method of measuring the power
  given to any circuit which is no more wasteful of power than
  the methods shown in <U+FB01>gures 2, 3, 5, and 7 ; and which,
  although not so accurate as those shown in <U+FB01>gures 3 and 5, is
  as accurate as those shown in <U+FB01>gures 2 and 7. The method
  is simply to use a wattmeter (<U+FB01>g. 9), but having both its
  coils made of thick wire, or, as this may be called a split
  dynamometer, the method consists in using a split dynamo
  meter having one of its coils in the circuit ab (the power given
- to which we desire to measure) and the other coil in a circuit
  cd parallel to ab. The power will be given at once by 1‘
  times the reading of the instrument and with but a very
  small error if r be small.
                                  V
     Mr. Rimington has suggested a method of measuring the
  mean value of the product (cl—1),)(v2—v3) (<U+FB01>g. 9) by
  means of a dynamometer, each of Whose coils is in circuit
  with a high resistance, joined up as shown in <U+FB01>gure 10.
                               Fig. 10.
     The objection to this method is as follows:-—By making the
  time-constants of each of the circuits of the dynamometer afg,

            Current and Potential l){ference Analogz'es. ' 213
 d h 9 equal to one another, we can, no doubt, make the differ
 ence of phase in the two currents passing through the dyna
 mometer exactly the same as the difference in phase between
 the current through ab and the RD. at the terminals of
 ab; but we cannot make the currents through the dyna-.
 mometer coils independent of the rate of alternation. Hence,
 if this instrument be employed for measuring the power
 given to ab in the way shown in <U+FB01>gure 10, it must be
 calibrated for each rate of alternation of the current.
    But although this defect exists in the employment of
 Mr. Rimington’s high-resistance split dynamometer for the
 measurement of power, it can be used without error for
measuring the phase-angle between two P.D.s in series by
    method analocous

   XXIX. A Kinetic Tluzory of Solids, with an Experimental
            Introduction. By WILLIAM SUTHERLAND.
                        [Continued from p. 43.]
                      ' Young’s Zlfodulus.
     l. The experimental determinations that have hitherto been
 made of the temperature variations of Young’s Modulus have
 been made for the most part by the static method, the di<U+FB02>i
 culties of which detract from its trustworthiness; for example,
 Wertheim, by the static method, found the Young’s Modulus
 of iron and silver to increase with rising tem erature, though
,we now know that it diminishes. Kupffer Me'm. de l’Acad.
 Impe’r. des Sc. de St. Pét. 6 sér. t. 6) devised a convenient
.modi<U+FB01>cation of the kinetic method (by lateral vibrations)
 which lent itself well to the measurement of the temperature
 effect, but used an erroneous formula for calculating the
 modulus from his measurements.             Zoppritz (Pogg. Ann.
cxxviii.) has recalculated with a correct theory the right values
 of the modulus of various metals at ordinary temperature
 from Kupffer’s data. I recalculated the values at other tem
   eratures, but found the temperature interval of about 30° 0.
too small to give trustworthy results. Accordingly I under
took a series of measurements by Kupffer’s method.
    The method consists in causing a rod of the metal to vibrate
laterally with one end clam ed and the other free, <U+FB01>rst with the
free end vertically above t e clamped one, and next under it.

  216                  Mr. W. Sutherland on a
 The rod is either loaded or not loaded at the free and according
 to convenience. Kupifer’s error came in in the method in
 which he tried to eliminate the in<U+FB02>uence of gravity. Of
  course, if the rods were made to vibrate in a horizontal instead
  of a vertical plane, gravity would have no appreciable effect if
  the rods were stiff enough and unloaded, but the bending effect
  of a load must needs interfere; and in the case of lead and
  tin wires, for example, even when unloaded, it is impossible to
  make them vibrate in a horizontal plane. A lead wire which
  will collapse at once if held horizontally at one end, will stand
  vertically if clamped at the bottom and execute vibrations
  without collapse ; and even at temperatures at which, when
  the bottom is clamped, vibrations become impossible through
  instability, it is always possible, with the top clamped, to get
 stable vibrations.
     Thus, to get values of Young’ modulus by Kupi'fer’s
 method at any temperature requires only a correct method of
 allowing for the action of gravity in affecting the period of
 vibration.               '
     The advantages of Kup<U+FB02>'er’s method are several : it can be
 applied to convenient sizes of material, while the static method,
 to give accurate results, necessitates the use of long wires; by
 loading the end of the vibrating piece its period can be made
 such as is easily measured'without special recording-appli
ances, and is obtainable by a mere counting of vibrations in
 a measured time. If desired, the method could easily be used
 for determining the in<U+FB02>uence of stress on the value of Young’s
 modulus ; by loading the free end, the value of the modulus
 could be found under stresses right up to the breaking load.
     Ziippritz (Pogg. Ann. cxxviii.) has given the theory of the
 effect of gravity on unloaded bars, but the case of loaded bars
 has not, so far as I am aware, been solved in a form suitable
 for practical use; and as freedom to load at will the specimen
 under experiment is one of the best points about the method,
 it will be as well to give <U+FB01>rst the theory of the lateral vibra
 tion of a loaded bar under gravity.
    A slight adaptation of a method of calculation given by
 Rayleigh in his ‘ Theory of Sound,’ vol. i. chapter 8, gives a
 close enough solution for practical purposes. He shows that
 the period of a laterally-vibrating bar can be got approxi
 mately by supposing the bar bent statically by a de<U+FB02>ecting
 force applied to the free end and then allowed to move, so that
at any time t from the moment of release the de<U+FB01>exion of any
 point on the bar is to its original de<U+FB01>exion in the ratio
 cos 27rnt to unity. Then, by equating the maximum value of
'the potential energy during the motion to the maximum value

                      Kinetic Tlieory of Solids.              217
 of the kinetic energy, a value of the frequency n is obtained,
 which is approximately identical with that given by the com
 plete theory of the lateral vibrations of a bar. Accordingly
 it is only necessary to add to the potential energy of bending
 that due to gravity to get an approximate solution. Suppose
 clamped at either the top or bottom a uniform vertical bar of
 length l, density p, section a, radius of gyration of section k,
 mass m, loaded with mass M, which has its centre of mass at
 distance 1' from the clamped end, and suppose the free end
 de<U+FB02>ected with force F. Now the tendency of the weight of
 M is to increase the bending effect of F when M is up, and to
 diminish it when M is down ; but for small displacements this
 difference in the effect of the weight of M in the two cases
 can be neglected. If y is the de<U+FB02>exion of the point at dis
 tance .z' from the clamped end, then the form of the rod is
 given by                     F
                          g=        _ 31x2)!
where B=qlc’o-, in which g is Young’s modulus.
    Then, according to the approximate method, the form at
time t is

   To <U+FB01>nd the potential energy due to gravity we have to
determine how much each point of the rod is vertically dis
placed on bending.       Let ds be an element of length in the
bent rod, then

     Equation (B) can be con<U+FB01>rmed by Kupffer’s experiments.
  For one and the same bar the left-hand side is to be constant
 for all values of the load. For a steel bar 49'66 inches long
 and weighing 1'5848 Russian pounds, we have the following
 values of the left-hand side for the following values of M :—
 M in Russian pounds...             0       06852          1'0644   1'8173

     A ain, for a piece of the same bar 40-08 inches long and
 weig ing 1'2792 Russian pounds, we have the values:-

     In both cases the number which ought to be constant shows
'a slight diminution with increasing load, which is easily ac
 counted for, and the approximation to constancy is close
  enough to warrant the use of the formula for the determina
  tion of Young’s modulus.           To satisfy myself of the complete

220                  Mr. W. Sutherland on a
applicability of the formula, I made copper and magnesium
wires vibrate unloaded both in the two vertical positions and
in the horizontal; calling n3 the number of vibrations per
 second in the horizontal position, I found that n: + 112: 2113, as
 should be, to a high degree of accuracy.      But there is another
 check which can always be applied to any set of experiments.
 The equation (A) shows that
                          l' 5       6m >       9(mlz    Sll/ll”s

                               +——--l_87514 Z_9     6 + 15,, ),
so that nf—ng is quite independent of the elastic properties of
the bar, and has a calculable value. It is therefore a check
on the method to see that the observed value of 121—113 is equal
to the calculated. In the experimental values about to be
given this method of veri<U+FB01>cation will be applied, and it will
be seen that in any case where it is possible to make observa
tions with only one vertical position of the bar, the equation
(A) can be safely used for the calculation of Young’s
modulus.        -'                               \
   Of course, where the Young’s modulus of a substance varied
appreciably with stress, it would not be possible to eliminate
the action of gravity, as in equations (B) and (C), but equation
(A) could be used.
   Eaperz'ments.—The vibrations were carried out in the same
box heated in the same manner as in the Rigidity experiments.
The rod or wire that was to vibrate could be clamped at the
middle point of either the top or the bottom of the box, and
executed its vibrations freely inside. To secure accuracy in
determining the period of the swing the vibrations had to be
reinforced, and this was done by means of a thread passing
horizontally from the free end of the wire to the outside;
by means of the thread a slight periodic impulse could be im
parted to the vibrating wire at the middle of a swing ; a
little practice enabled one to attain a high degree of accuracy
with even lead and tin wires in determining the number of
vibrations per second. Every value given in what follows
was derived from several hundreds of swings.                      .
   In all cases except that of tin wire, the wires vibrated un
loaded, and accordingly equation (C) applies.

       2. Compilation of Data.——As regards the variation of v
. Young’s modulus with temperature, Kupffer‘s vibrational
  method is so superior in accuracy to the static method, that
  eVen rough experiments like my own by Kup<U+FB01>'er’s method
   give far more trustworthy results than even the most
   careful and re<U+FB01>ned measurements yet made by the static
   method.     Kupffer’s own temperature-range was too small to
   give weight to his measurement ; and as I know of no other
   measurements by his method, I must regard the data just
   given as the most trustworthy yet published. It is therefore
   hardly worth while quoting other results except those of
   Kiewiet, who (Wied. Ann. xxix.) applied a much more sensi
   tive static method than the usual one, namely, the method of
   bending to zinc, tin, and copper. Kiewiet’s values, in the
   case of tin, for the ratio of g at 60° and 104° to g at 16° are
   '82 and '67, while mine are '83 and '73 ; in the case of zinc
   at 60° and 103° and 16° the ratios found by Kiewiet are '92
   and '87, while my values are '92 and '83. At 102° and 16°
    Kiewiet <U+FB01>nds for rolled copper the ratio '967, and for electro
    lytic c0pper '934, while my number is '914.
        Except for copper the agreement of the two methods is
    good, all things considered.                        "

   3. Law of Variation of Young’s Modulus with Temperature.
'—By the light of the result for rigidity this law is easily
found ; temperature must only occur in the ratio 0/T, where
T is the melting-point ; and as a general survey of the values
of Young’s modulus for different metals at different tempera
tures shows that the modulus within our experimental range
is a linear function of the temperature, it was easy to test
whether the em irical equation q/Q=1—a6/T would apply to
all the metals, (5 being the rigidity at absolute zero, and a a
constant the same for all metals. The result was to <U+FB01>nd that
q/Q = l —-'823t/T represents with considerable accuracy all the
foregoing experimental results. But it is important to notice
that this can only rank as an approximate empirical relation
covering the range of temperature of my experiments, and
cannot rank as a natural law in the same way as the rigidity
relation n/N=1— (0/T)’, because it does not cover the range
of temperature right down to the melting-point ; the relation
gives a <U+FB01>nite value for Young’s modulus at the melting-point,
whereas it ought to give a zero value. The relation then does
not give the general law sought, and is only mentioned here
on account of its simplicity and the facilities it gives for
getting approximate values of Q, the Young’s modulus at
absolute zero.
   As a theoretical relation between Young’s modulus and
temperature will be investigated in the theoretical part of this
paper, and the values of Young’s modulus at absolute zero
will be given there, there is no need to consider any further
the empirical relation.

The Structure of a Portion of the Sierra Nevada of California. By
  GEORGE F. BECKER. Bullet. Geol. Soc. of America, vol. ii. 1891.
FROM the South Fork of the Stanilaus River to the Trucknee, a.
     distance of about eighty miles, and for some thirty miles to the
west of the eastern scarp of the range, Dr. Becker found the' rocks
to be chie<U+FB02>y granite and diorite overlain in part by andesite and
basalt; and the area to have been glaciated up to the summits of
the passes. The rocks are intersected by extremely numerous
<U+FB01>ssures,—vertical, diagonal, and horizontal; the last giving a.
terraced aspect to the granite, and the two former rendering it
columnar. The <U+FB01>ssures are more or less susceptible of being
grouped as systems; and are found to be true fault—planes, with
dislocations, slickensides, and slaty shearing. These multitudinous .
faultings are referred to a. late Tertiary period, in part contem—
porary with the andesitic eruptions.
   An inductive examination of dislocating forces treats of the
physical characters of these faults and <U+FB01>ssures in detail, both as to
horizontal and vertical movements. The author shows “ that the
existence of the vertical <U+FB01>ssure systems attended by evidences
of compression leads inevitably to the theory of a horizontal
thrust, which is further con<U+FB01>rmed by the occurrence of relatively
rare <U+FB01>ssures dipping at angles of 45°.” So also as to “ the <U+FB01>ssure
systems formed by the vertical thrust, . . . the horizontal partings
could be produced without raising the sheets of granite, while the
vertical <U+FB01>ssuring and faulting by the vertical thrust component
involved either the raising of a sheet against gravity, or a. downward
movement into the underlying mass. When the vertical <U+FB01>ssures
and the horizontal <U+FB01>ssures were once formed, the stress still present
would be relieved rather by relative motion on these <U+FB01>ssures than
by the establishment of new ones.”                                     ‘
   The hypothesis of the tilting of the range, to account for the.
deep erosion of the river-beds, is not supported by Dr. Becker's
observations. He considers that the <U+FB01>ssure—systems broke up the
area in such a manner that glaciers, which are really unequal tov
the excavation of valleys themselves, cleared away the movable.
débris from the surface, giving the country its peculiar physical,
features of ca<U+FB01>ous, out of shattered zones, and domes from isolated
prismatic masses of rock.
Antiquities from antler Tuolumne Table Mountain in California.
   By GEORGE F. BECKER. Bullet. Geol. Soc. of America, vol. ii.
   1891.
THE occurrence of human bones and of grinding implements in the
auriferous gravel under the lava at the foot of Table Mountain in
California has been doubted, but Dr. Becker supports Prof. Whit
ney’s announcement of these discoveries by further and independent
evidence of the facts. Plant-remains, like those of Tertiary age,

                     Notices “respecting New Books.                 '227
  with bones of extinct Mam‘malia, for instance Rhinoceros hesperius
  and Mastodon americanus, have been met with in this gravel.
  Flows of lava covered it; and the glaciation of the Sierra followed,
  leaving in ridges the lava-<U+FB02>ows that had covered these old valley
  gravels, and making new valleys out of the intermediate rock
  margins of those gorges. Plate 7 represents the pestle and one
  of the two mortars found, with stone spear-heads, by Mr. Neale
  in 1870; and a woodcut shows a broken pestle found by Mr. Cla
  rence King in 1869.
      Dr. Becker gives some remarks on the correlation of the lavas
  and gravels with the eastern deposits; and proceeds to explain
  that the great valley of California was formerly a Pleistocene gulf,
  and the Pliocene animals may reasonably be supposed to have sur
  vived in the locality to a late period; also that a local glaciation,
  due to peculiar climatal conditions, may have occurred here after
. the more general Glacial Epoch.
      At the reading of Dr. Becker’s paper the Rev. G. F. Wright
  gave some further information on the subject, to the effect that
  another mortar had been found in the same gravel in 1887.
  Notes on the Early Cretaceous of California and Oregon. By GEORGE
         F. BECKER. Bullet. Geol. Soc. of America, vol. ii. 1891.
  THE de<U+FB01>nition of this group and its fauna. is detailed, sh owing that
  the one group of strata in the Coast Ranges of California, called
  the Knoxville group, and the other near Horsetown in Shasta
   County, are probably equivalent to the Gault. In the Sierra
   Nevada these strata are intersected by numerous auriferous quartz
  veins; in the Coast Ranges they are extensively metamorphosed
  and yield quicksilver.
      The same group is represented at Riddles, Douglas County,
   Oregon, and in Queen-Charlotte Islands. One of the leading
   fossils is the Aucella, characterizing strata of approximately the
   same age also in Alaska and British Columbia, and, according to
   Dr. G. M. Dawson, even as far north as Porcupine River within
   the Arctic Circle.    Mr. J. S. Diller added the information that
   both the Knoxville and the Horsetown beds are well exposed in
   Tehama County, between the localities of California and Oregon
   referred to by Dr. Becker.                           '              '
      The Horsetown beds lie unconformably on nearly vertical slates,
   and the disturbance thus indicated was probably Post-Triassic ; for
   in the Mineral-King district, about two miles from the summit of
   the western branch of the Sierra, vertical slates associated with
   eruptive granite contain casts of shells indicative of a Triassic
   fauna. The author adds—“The main mass of the granite of the
   Sierra is earlier than the Aueellw-beds, and in part, at least, later
   than these Triassic beds. It is very probable that a granitic extru
  sion accompanied the disturbance which led to the nonconformity
  at Horsetown.      In British Columbia Dr. Dawson has traced a
   Post‘Triassic upheaval, which was accompanied by granites._ This

The Photochronograph and its Application to Star-Transits. By
   J. G. HAGEN, SJ. (Stormont & Jackson, Printers, Washington,
   D.O.: 1891.)
THIS is a pamphlet of 36 pages and 2 plates describing experi
ments and results in photographing star-transits at the Georgetown
College Observatory. The work had its origin in a visit made by
Prof. F. Bigelow and Mr. G. Saegmiiller to the Observatory named
in the summer of 1889, and it is con<U+FB01>dently stated that “this
method of letting the sensitive plate take the place of the eye and
the chronograph seems to have a great future.” It is claimed that
the entire absence of personal equation in the results, and the fact
that the probable errors are smaller than in the usual plan, give to
the photographic method a practical importance and superiority
which cannot fail to be recognized. “A photographic transit is, on
the Whole, more laborious than one taken by the chronograph, yet
it certainly makes it possible for us to eliminate the personal equa
tion in all cases where such elimination must be purchased at any
cost. As an example we need only mention longitude determina
tions. The usual exchange of the observers, so expensive in time
and money, is, by the photographic method, rendered unnecessary
and even useless. If the photochronographs at the two stations
are worked by the same clock at either station, or at an intermediate
one, the sensitive plates will record the diiference of the two meri
dians without the interference of the observers.” The experiments
are to be continued, the peculiar errors of the method are to be
studied, and it is proposed to test its e<U+FB02>iciency in regular zone
work.

      1. “ On Wells in West-Su<U+FB01>'olk Boulder-clay.” By the Rev.
Edwin Hill, M.A., F.G.S.
   It might be supposed that in a Boulder-clay district water could
only be obtained from above or from below the clay. But in the
writer’s neighbourhood the depths of the wells are extremely
different, even within very short distances; and since the clay
itself is impervious to water, he concludes that it must include
within its mass pervious beds or seams of some different material
which communicate with the surface. It would follow that this
Boulder—clay is not a uniform or a homogeneous mass.

    The visible sections are only those given, at hand by ditches, and
at a considerable distance north and south by pits at Bury St.
Edmunds and Sudbury. The appearances in these harmonize with
that conclusion. Conclusion and appearances differ from what we
should expect on the theory that this Boulder-clay was the product
of the attrition between an ice-sheet and its bed.
    2. “ On the Melaphyres of Caradoc, with Notes on the Associated
Felsites.”    By Frank Rutley, Esq., F.G.S.
    Within very limited areas the melaphyres of Oaradoc differ con
siderably in texture and in structure, some having once been
basalt-glass or andesite-glass (such being the super<U+FB01>cial portions of
a. lava-stream) ; others have possessed a certain amount of inter
stitial glass, which has subsequently been rendered more or less
opaque by the development of magnetite, while at times it appears
to have been converted into a. palagonitic substance. In some
 of the rocks the crystalline texture is very <U+FB01>ne, in others com
paratively coarse. Near the summit of Caradoc is a basalt-tn<U+FB02>' or
 andesite-tu<U+FB02>'.
    The melaphyre or dolerite of Little Caradoc differs from the lavas
 in that the augiie remains fresh and the felspars are altered, while
 in the lavas of Caradoc proper the pyroxenic constituent is decom
 posed and the felspars remain as a rule unaltered.
    Whether the melaphyre of Little Caradoc may be regarded as a.
neck from which the lavas lying to the south-west of it emanated,
 is a point which can only be demonstrated by further <U+FB01>eld-work.
    The author considers that further investigation may prove beyond
 dispute that the associated felsites are rhyolites of which the original
 structures have as a rule been almost entirely obliterated. In an
 appendix further evidence is adduced in favour of the original rhyo
 litic nature of these fclsites, and a fragmental rock from Bowdler’s
 Chair is described as unquestionably a rhyolite-tuff.
     3. “ Notes on the Geology of the Tonga Islands.” By J. J.
 Lister, Esq., MA.
    The islands of the Tonga group are situated on a long ridge which
 rises from deep water on either side to within a thousand fathoms of
 the surface of the sea. The general direction of the ridge is N.N.E.
 and S.S.W.
     (1) A line of volcanoes, some active, some extinct, traverses the
 group. Continued southward, the direction of the line passes through
 the Volcanoes of the Kermadec group, and those of the Taupo zone of
 New Zealand; while to the north it cuts the line of the Samoan
 volcanoes at right angles.
     (2) Besides the purely volcanic islands there are some formed by
 submarine eruptions, whose layers have been laid out under water
 and since elevated, with or without a covering of limestone.
     (3) The remaining islands are formed entirely of limestone.
     Eua is an example of the second group. The volcanic basis con
 sists for the most part of beds laid out beneath the sea, and some of

  230        i  Intelligence and M'scellaneous Articles.
  the upper ones contain pelagic shells. Dykes of augite and hyper
  thene-andesite project on the shore, and a representative of the
  platonic series occurs. There is evidence that the island has been
  elevated and again submerged prior to the elevation which has raised
  it to the present height. The volcanic basis is largely invested with
  limestone, and this rock forms the summit 1078 feet above sea-leVel.
 Sections show that it is a shallow-water deposit.
     Of the purely limestone structures, Tongatabu, Nomuka, and the
 long reef on which the larger islands of the Hapaii group are
 situated form more or less complete atolls, all of which have been
 elevated to a greater or less extent.
     The Vavuu group is remarkable for its very indented contour,
 suggesting the idea that it rests on a much denuded basis. Both
 here and at Eua there are raised limestone formations with atoll or
 barrier-like contours; and there is some direct evidence to show
 that these have been formed without the aid of subsidence.
     The presence of islands formed of volcanic materials laid out in
 layers beneath the sea, and the manner in which the recently formed
  Falcon Island is now being reduced to the condition of a submarine
 bank, suggest that the atolls of the group may rest on similarly
 formed foundations.
     4. “ On the Inverness Earthquakes of November 15th to De
 cember 14th, 1890.”      By C. Davison, Esq., M.A.
     In this paper the author gives reasons for supposing that the
 Inverness earthquakes of last year were due to the subsidence of a
 ‘great wedge of rock included between a main fault and a branch
 one; and he considers that there is little doubt that these recent
 earthquakes were the transitory records of changes that, by almost
 inde<U+FB01>nite repetition in long past times, haVe resulted in the great
 Highland faults.

ON THE DETERMINATION OF THE DIELECTRIC CONSTANT OF
     GLASS BY AID OF VERY RAPID ELECTRICAL OSCILLATIONS.
     BY R. BLONDLOT.
VERY rapid electrical oscillations, such as are produced by Hertz’s
       apparatus, have been utilized by Prof. J. J. Thomson for the
measurement of the dielectric constant*. Prof. Thomson draws from
his experiments the following conclusion: “for vibrations whose
frequency is . . . . 25,000,000 per second, the speci<U+FB01>c inductive
capacity [of glass] is very nearly equal to the square of the refrac
tive index, and is very much less than the value for slew rates of
reversals.”
    As regards this conclusion we might demur to the use of the
    * J. J. Thomson, “Speci<U+FB01>c Inductive Capacity of Dielectrics when
acted on by very rapidly alternating Electric Forces,” Proc. Roy. Soc.
June 20, 1889.

               Intelligence and Mscellaneous Articles.                        231
formula which gives the period of the oscillations, a formula the
tenability of which is doubtful in the case of very rapid oscillations.
More recently, E. Lecher has measured the dielectric constants of
several substances by the aid of a method founded also on the
determination of the wave-length of very rapid oscillations, but
without employing any formula.                                                    -
    The conclusions of M. Lecher are diametrically opposed to those
of Prof. Thomson: “Not only,” says he, “ does the dielectric con
stant, calculated by the aid of the capacity, not become smaller for
very rapid oscillations, but it even considerably increases.”
    These contradictory conclusions have led me to engage in new
researches; the method which I have adopted is based on the
employment of very rapid oscillations, but I do not make use of
any formula.
    A' large rectangular plate of copper AA’ is <U+FB01>xed vertically; a;
second, smaller plate B B' forms a condenser with the <U+FB01>rst.                  This
condenser can discharge itself by the intermediation of the knobs
a and b;      a is in communication with the gas-pipes, b with
one of the poles of an induction-coil the other pole of which 00m
municates with the gas-pipes. When the coil is working the
condenser A B is the seat of oscillatory charges and discharges the
Period of which is of the order of the           of a second.
    We have thus in the space situated on the side of A A' opposed
to B B' a periodic electromagnetic <U+FB01>eld which—and this is the chief
point—has x x as the plane of symmetry.
    Let us <U+FB01>x in this <U+FB01>eld two square
plates C D, C’ D' parallel to A A' and                               Isl-")6
symmetrical with respect to X X,
and then solder to the middle points
1), D' of their inner edges two wires
terminating at E and E’ in two carbon
points kept facing each other at a                                       _—|
Very small distance apart.
    Although the coil is working, we
do not observe any light between E
and E'; this results from the sym
metry of the apparatus. If we
interpose a glass plate between
AA' and OD, sparks immediately            w
pass between E and 13'; this is                B
caused by the induction received by
C D becoming less strong than that
received by C' D'.
    Let us now interpose between
 AA' and C’D' a plate of sulphur;
if we give to it such a thickness                       _- _- ->(_ _ _-_
that the inductive action on O' D’
 is equal to that on O D, the sparks disappear between E and E.’
Conversely, the disappearance of sparks between E, 13' indicates

232            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
that the inductions transmitted to CD and O'D' are equal; it is
suf<U+FB01>cient therefore to measure the thicknesses of the dielectric
plates to determine by an easy calculation the ratio of the dielectric
constants of glass and sulphur. By means of experimental pre
cautions which I cannot mention here I have been able to render
this method sensitive and exact.      _
   The glass plate which I employed was exactly 3 centim. thick.
For the other side, I cast two plates of sulphur in the form of,
prisms of the same angle, in such a manner that by clipping them
together, as in Babinet’s compensator, a plate with parallel faces
was formed the thickness of which could be varied. I found 3'15
centim. for the thickness of the plate of sulphur which exactly
compensated the plate of glass. To complete the determination of
the dielectric constant of glass that of sulphur had to be obtained ;,
this was easy, since sulphur is a nearly perfect dielectric. I
employed the method indicated by M. J. Curie" and found the
number 2'94=(1'67)2.
   This result is almost identical with that of Prof. J. J. Thomson.
Maxwell’s law is not exactly veri<U+FB01>ed, as the mean index of my
plate of glass is about 1'51, but the difference is much less than
that given by the values of dielectric constants obtained by the aid
of slower methods. My conclusion is the same as that of Prof.
J. J. Th0mson.—Oomptes Rendus, May 11, 1891, p. 1058.
  ON AN IMPROVED METHOD OF DETERMINING SPECIFIC HEAT IBYi
   MEANS OF THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT.             BY PROF. PFAUNDLER,
   The method published in 1869, which depends on Joule’s law
according to which the same current develops in spirals of wire
arranged in series quantities of heat which are proportional to the
resistances, has hitherto met with but few applications, owing to
the fact that it is only applicable to nonconducting liquids. The
author has got rid of this objection by replacing the spirals of wire
by thin glass spirals <U+FB01>lled with mercury. He obtained also greater
accuracy and certainty by interposing these resistances as branches
in a Wheat-stone’s bridge, so that it was possible to control the ratio
of the resistances during the passage of the current and keep it
constant. Slight alterations of the resistances were compensated
by placing glass threads in the straight ends of the tubes which
contained the mercury. In other cases those alterations Were
measured by displacing the contact-key, and in this way the result
was corrected.
   The comparative measurement of the rise of temperature is
made more sensitive by the aid of a thermopile.
   Experiments are communicated which show the applicability of
the method both for direct and alternating currents.— Wiener

          PART I. Some Physical and Mathematical Data.
   MANY of the terms employed in treating of the properties
            and conditions of matter have in common use a some
   what vague meaning. The meaning, so far as clearly outlined,
   is also only too often di<U+FB01>'erent from that which the physmist
  intends to convey. As regards terms such as rigid, sotzd,
  plastic, viscous, &c. it seems to me that even eminent geologists
   are apt to be misled by the popular usage, so that they fall
  into error respecting the data which mathematical and
   physical science places at their disposal. It thus seems
   advisable on the present occasion to clear the ground by
   brie<U+FB02>y considering the sense attached to these terms by the
   more exact school of physicists. To render the following
   statements intelligible it is necessary to explain the meaning
   scienti<U+FB01>cally attached to the terms stress and strain. By
   stress is meant a force referred to unit of area of the surface
  across which it acts, by strain the increase in the distance
_ between two material points divided by the original distance.
   For instance if a vertical bar n square inches in cross section
  <U+FB01>xed at the upper end, sustain a load of t tons, and the load
  be uniformly distributed over the cross section, the longi
  tudinal stress is tn, taking the square inch as unit of area

the bar increase in length from 100 to 10001 inches, and the
increase be uniformly distributed over the portion lengthened,
the longitudinal strain is 100'01—100) x 10”, or '0001.
   The writers who have ad most in<U+FB02>uence on the resent
scienti<U+FB01>c usage of English terms dealing with p ysical
groperties are unquestionably Professor Clerk Maxwell and
  ir William Thomson. The former gives the following
de<U+FB01>nitions in his ‘ Theory of Heat" :—“ A body which when
subjected to a stress experiences no strain would, if it existed,
be called a Perfectly Rigid Body.              There are no such
bodies. . . .”
   “A body which when subjected to a given stress at a
given temperature experiences a strain of de<U+FB01>nite amount,
which does not increase when the stress is prolonged, and
which disappears completely when the stress is removed, is
called a Perfectly Elastic Body.”
   “ If the form of the body is found to be permanently
altered when the stress exceeds a certain value, the bod is
said to be soft or plastic, and the state of the body w en
alteration is just going to take place is called the Limit of
Perfect Elasticity.”
   “ If the stress, when it is maintained constant, causes a
strain.. . which increases continually with the time, the
substance is said to be viscous.”
   A viscous material may be either solid or <U+FB02>uid. It is
regarded by Maxwell as <U+FB02>uid when any stress, however small,
produces a constantly increasing strain. Maxwell draws a
distinction between elasticity of bulk and elasticity of shape—
the latter being peculiar to solids—which is more fully treated
of by Sir W. Thomson. A body possesses perfect elasticity
of bulk when on the removal of the stress it returns to its
original volume, even though the form of its surface be per
manently altered. Both writers regard it as certain that solid
bodies will retain perfect elasticity of bulk under compressive
stresses which far exceed the limit of elasticity of shape.
The following statement embodies the views of Sir W.
ThomsonT:—“ If we reckon by the amount of pressure,
there is probably no limit to the elasticity of bulk in the
direction of the increase of pressure for any solid or <U+FB02>uid;
but whether continued augmentation produces continued
diminution of bulk towards zero without limit, or whether for
any or every solid or <U+FB02>uid there is a limit towards which it

may be reduced in bulk, but smaller than which no degree of
pressure, however great, can condense it, is a question which
cannot be answered in the present state of science.” '
   Maxwell, by denying the existence of a perfectly rigid body,
maintains that every solid can sustain stress or' transmit
force only by suffering strain. Thus on depositing a feather
on the most solid block of iron we produce in the iron a
system of strains, in<U+FB01>nitesimally small it is true, but whose
existence can no more be questioned than the existence across
the surface Separating the iron and the feather of forces
balancing the portion of the feather’s weight left uncom
pensated by the air-pressure. The hypothesis quoted above
from Sir W. Thomson, that there may be a limit beyond
which no body can be compressed, is not inconsistent with
Maxwell’s statement. The hypothesis regards the ratio of
the increment of strain to the increment of pressure as
ultimately becoming in<U+FB01>nitesimally small, but it in no way
implies that this ratio ever becomes absolutely zero.
   In a solid bar, supposed perfectly elastic, exposed to longi
tudinal stress, the ratio of the stress to the strain is styled
Young’s Modulus. In many materials Young’s modulus varies
in magnitude according to the direction in which the axis of
the bar is taken. Thus, in ordinary woods, there is a marked
difference between the value of Young’s modulus in the
direction of the pith of the tree and in any perpendicular
direction. Materials in which Young’s modulus is independent
of the direction in which the axis of the experimental bar is
taken are termed isotropic, all others are termed aaolotropic.
   In an isotropic elastic solid it is supposed, on the ordinary
British or biconstant theory, that the value of Young’s modulus,
E, alone is insuf<U+FB01>cient to de<U+FB01>ne the elastic structure, and that
some other elastic constant must be known. For many
purposes the most convenient additional constant is the ratio
of the lateral contraction to the longitudinal extension—each
measured per unit of length—in a bar ex osed to simple
longitudinal traction. For instance, if the diameter of a bar
under uniform longitudinal stress change from 10 to 9'9997
inches the lateral contraction is '00003, and if the longitudinal
strain be '0001, the ratio of lateral contraction to longitudinal
extension is '3. This ratio is termed Poisson’s Ratio, and is
represented here by '17.
   On the uniconstant theory of isotropy 17 must have the value
'25, which certainly accords well with experiments on glass
and some of the more common metals, especially iron and
steel under certain conditions.
   On the biconstant theory 07 may have any value within

236           Mr. G. Chrec on some Applications of
certain limits. The existence of these limits, it must be
admitted, is seldom recognized, and experimental results are
not infrequently referred to which are inconsistent with the
view taken here, viz. that 17 must lie between 0 and '5. If,
however, 1) were negative in any material a circular bar of
this material, when subjected to uniform longitudinal tension,
would increase in diameter; while if 1) were greater than ‘5,
the bar, when <U+FB01>xed at one end and subjected to a torsional
couple at the other, would twist in the opposite direction to
the applied force. Until these phenomena are shown to
present themselves in isotropic materials—and the experi
mental veri<U+FB01>cation ought to be easy—it seems legitimate to
suppose that when experimentalists deduce values for 17 which
lie outside of these limits, their experiments refer to bodies
whose constitution is different from what is assumed in their
mathematical calculations.
    The properties attributed to an isotropic elastic solid by the
ordina mathematical theory are as follows :—                                   .
 . (A) he strain must be elastic, i. e. it must disappear on
the removal of the stress.
    (B) The ratio of stress to strain must be independent of
the magnitude of the stress, or, in Professor Pearson’s words,
the stress-strain relation must be linear.
    (O) The strains must be small.
    (D) The values of Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio in.
a bar of the material must be independent of the direction in
which the axis of the bar is taken.
    The last property alone distinguishes isotropic from 22010
tropic elastic solids.
    (A) answers to Maxwell’s de<U+FB01>nition, but (B) and (G) are
not assumed by Maxwell. In other words, a solid may be
perfectly elastic without showing a linear stress-strain rela
 tion, or possibly even after the strains have become large.
Thus, for the sake of clearness, I shall call Maxwell’s limit of
perfect elasticity the Physical limit, and the limits supplied
by (B) and (O) the <U+FB01>rst and second Mathematical limits
respectively.
    It is not infrequently taken for granted that the physical
and the <U+FB01>rst mathematical limit are necessarily identical, i. e.
that the elasticity is certainly not perfect when the stress
strain relation ceases to be linear. According, however, to
some experimentalists cast iron is as perfectly elastic as any
other metal in the sense of Maxwell’s de<U+FB01>nition, but the stress-'
strain relation for even small strains is sensibly not linear*.

 This is of course a question for experimentalists to decide,
 but in any case where their <U+FB01>nal verdict is that the stress
 strain relation is sensibl not linear the employment of the
 ordinary mathematical theory is unjusti<U+FB01>able.            It must be
 admitted that the principle (0) is a very vague one, leading
 to no exact limit, and that it seldom receives any Very formal
 acknowledgment. It is, however, clearly recognized, and a
 reason for it assigned in the following statement due to
 Thomson and Tait * :—“ The mathematical theory of elastic
 solids imposes no restrictions on the magnitudes of the stresses,
 except in so far as that mathematical necessity requires the
 strains to be small enough to admit of the principle of super
position.” The italics are mine.             The meaning is that the
strains must be small fractions whose squares are negligible
compared to themselves. If this principle be neglected and
the mathematical equations be supposed to apply when the
 strains are large, the dif<U+FB01>culty of giving them a consistent
physical interpretation is very great if not wholly unsur
 mountable.
    In most materials having any claim to be regarded as
 elastic solids, the stress-strain relation for most ordinary stress
systems certainly ceases to be linear while the strains are still
small. We shall thus in the meantime leave the condition
 (0) out of account, though we shall have to return to it in
 treating of the so-called “ theories of rupture.”
    The existence of the properties (A), (B), (D), presupposed
by the mathematical theory, is determined not solely by the
chemical constitution of the body, but also by the treatment
to which it has been subjected. Thus a freshly annealed
copper wire may, when loaded for the <U+FB01>rst time, be far from
satisfying conditions (A) or (B), and yet by the process of
loading and unloading it may be brought into a state of ease,
wherein these two conditions are very approximately, if not
exactly ful<U+FB01>lled, so long as the stress does not exceed a certain
limit. Again, the fact that a large mass of metal is sensibly
isotropic is no suf<U+FB01>cient reason for attributing isotropy to the
same metal when rolled into thin plates or drawn into thin
Wires.
   It is quite possible that the three conditions (A), (B), and
(D) represent an ideal state which is never actually reached,
and that a divergence may always be shown by the use of
very delicate apparatus. If this be true, then the results
obtained by the mathematical theory cannot claim absolute
correctness. It seems, however, to be satisfactorily established
                   * ‘Nat. Phil. vol. i. Part ii. p. 422.

238           Mr. C. Chree on some Applications Q)"
that many materials in the state of ease satisfy these con
ditions with at least a very close approach to exactness, so
that the results of the mathematical theory when properly
restricted are then su<U+FB01>iciently exact for practical purposes.
   From the preceding statements it will be seen that it is of
the utmost importance to know what are the limits within
which the conditions assumed by the mathematical theory are
satis<U+FB01>ed with suf<U+FB01>cient exactness to justify its application.
This question must of course be settled by experiment, but it
is beset by various di<U+FB01>iculties which ought ,to be clearly
recognized. These arise in part from the serious obstacles
in the way of a complete experimental knowledge, and in
part from the want of a proper understanding between those
interested in the practical and theoretical sides of the subject,
and a consequent confusion in the terms used.
   To avoid complication let us begin by supposin            the
mathematical limit of perfect elasticity to coincide wit the
physical. Let us consider the simple caseyof a bar under
uniform longitudinal traction. We may suppose the bar
isotropic, and in consequence of suitable treatment perfectly
elastic for loads not exceeding L]. No mechanical treatment,
we shall suppose, can render it perfectly elastic for loads
greater than Lg.      It does not follow that a load L2 will
necessarily rupture the bar either immediately or in course of
time, but simply that for any load greater than L2 the strain
is not perfectly elastic.   Increasing the load from zero we
should reach a load L3, probably greater than L2, that would
in process of time rupture the bar, or a load L4 greater than
L3 that produces immediate rupture.         All these loads are
supposed to refer to unit of area.
   Now in the initial state of the bar we should be entitled to
apply the mathematical theory only until the load L1 was
reached. When we aim at <U+FB01>nding the utmost capability of
the material under longitudinal load, we may perhaps apply
the theory until the load L2 is reached, but here we must
stop. To apply it until the loads L3 or L4 are reached—
assuming these greater than Lg—is clearly inadmissible.
   Results of a similar kind hold for all the comparatively
simple forms of stress,—-such as pure compression, torsion, or
bending—in which practical men are interested. There are
limits to the state of perfect elasticity lower than the limits
at which rupture takes place, at least immediately.
   The usual aim of the engineer is that no part of the
structure he is designing should ever be strained beyond the
elastic limit, and this end he of course desires to obtain with
the least possible expenditure of material. Thus ideally he

              Physics and Mathematics to Geology.              239
might be expected to calculate the dimensions of each piece,
so that for the maximum load it is to be subjected to it shall
just not pass beyond the limit of perfect elasticity. There
are, however, in general agencies, such as wind pressure,
dynamical action of a moving load, 850., whose effects are not
very fully understood and whose magnitude cannot always
be foreseen. Thus it is the custom to allow a wide margin
for contingencies. Now the limit of perfect elasticity seems
the natural quantity to employ in allowing for this margin,
but the uncertainties attending its determination are such
that it is customary to employ the breaking-load instead.
The breaking-load for the particular kind of stress the member
in question is to be exposed to is divided by some number,
e. g. 4 or 5, called a factor of safety, and the dimensions of the
member are calculated so that its estimated load shall not
exceed the quotient of the breaking-load by the factor of
safety. The engineer varies the factor of safety according
to the nature of the load, and according to the con<U+FB01>dence he
possesses in the uniformity of the material and in the com
pleteness of his knowledge as to the vicissitudes the structure
is exposed to. It has thus come to pass that attention has been
largely directed to the breaking-loads, and theories have been
constructed which aim professedly at supplying a law for the
tendency to rupture, under the most general stress-systems
possible, of materials whose rupture-points have been found
under the ordinary simple stress-systems employed in
experiment.                          ,
    There are only two such theories of rupture for isotropic
materials that at       resent possess any general repute.      To
 understand them he reader requires to know that for any
 stress-system there are at every point in an isotropic elastic
 material three principal stresses along three mutually ortho
 gonal directions, and likewise three principal strains, whose
 directions coincide with those of the principal stresses. If
an imaginary small cube of the material be taken at the point
considered with its faces perpendicular respectively to the
three principal stresses, then no tan ential stresses act over
 these faces.   In a bar under a unitgormly distributed longi
 tudinal stress L per unit of cross section, two of the principal
 stresses are everywhere zero, and the third is parallel to
 the axis and equals L.       If E be Young’s modulus, and q
 Poisson’s ratio for the material, supposed isotropic and elastic,
 the greatest principal strain is everwhere L/E and its direction
 is parallel to the axis. The two remaining principal strains
 are each —nL/E, and they may be supposed to have for their
 directions any two mutually perpendicular lines in the cross
 section of the bar.

240              Mr. C. Chree on some Applications of
I    One of the theories referred to above is that when the
algebraic di<U+FB01>‘erence between the greatest and least of the
principal stresses at any point—a pressure being reckoned
negative—attains a certain value, rupture will ensue at this
point. Thus, if in descending order of magnitude the prin
cipal stresses at a point he T1, T2, T3, then Tl—Ta is the stress
di<U+FB01>'erence*at this point, and the theory asserts that rupture
 will ultimately ensue if the stress-difference anywhere equals
  L3, the load for ultimate rupture of a bar of the material by
  longitudinal traction ; while if the stress-di<U+FB01>erence anywhere
  equals L4, the load for immediate rupture by longitudinal
  traction, then immediate rupture will ensue.
     The second theory, which is supported by the great
  authority of de Saint-Venant T, replaces the stress-difference
  of the <U+FB01>rst theory by the greatest strain. It thus asserts
  that the condition for rupture is found by equating the
  largest value found anywhere for the greatest strain to the
  longitudinal strain answering to longitudinal traction L3, or
  to that answering to the traction L4, according as the rupture
  is ultimate or immediate. This theory maintains that extension
  in some direction is necessary for rupture.
     The two theories may, as in the case of pure longitudinal
  traction, lead to the same result; but in general they do not,
  so one at least of them must be wrong. When we examine
  the theories. still supposing the mathematical and physical
  limits of perfect elasticity the same, a very obvious dif<U+FB01>cultyi
  presents itself. It is assumed that the stress-difference and
  greatest strain are derived by the mathematical theory ; but
  that theory applies only so long as the material is everywhere
  perfectly elastic, whereas rupture, at least when immediate,
  presents itself after the elastic limit has been passed. Thus
  if the application of the mathematical theory lead to values
  for the maximum stress-difference and greatest strain equal to
the yalues of these quantities answering to rupture, at all
  events when immediate, the true conclusion would seem to
  be that the fundamental hypothesis on which the treatment
  .proceeds, viz. that the material follows the laws assumed by
  the mathematical theory, has been shown to be incorrect.
  Nothing has been proved except that the elastic limit must
  be passed and that the mathematical theory does not apply.
      The only logical way of interpreting the theories is to

suppose that the maximum stress-difference and greatest strain
are to be compared not with the values that answer to rup
ture, but either with those that answer to the limit of perfect
elasticity or with those derived by dividing the values an
swering to rupture by some factor of safety. This factor
must then be large enough to prevent the limit of perfect
elasticity being passed. Thus from either point of view we
encounter a formidable dif<U+FB01>culty, viz. the uncertainty of what
is the limit of perfect elasticity.                                 _
   “’e have supposed that a bar may be brought into a state
in which it is perfectly elastic for longitudinal tractions not

theories described above really apply to the limit of perfect
elasticity, the one would seem to maintain that L, is the
limiting value of the stress-di<U+FB01>'erence, the other that Lg/E is
the limiting value of the greatest strain for all possible stress
 systems in material of the same kind as that in the bar. The
complete experimental proof or disproof of such theories is
not likely to be easy. Thus taking, for instance, the case of
 lon 'tudinal traction, suppose it were shown that a certain
 met 0d of treatment which raises the elastic limit for load
 parallel to the axis of a bar does not raise the elastic limit for
 longitudinal load in a bar whose length lay in the cross
 section of the original bar. This would only su<U+FB02>ice to prove
 that the treatment adopted did not give a <U+FB01>xed elastic limit
 the same for all kinds of strain, it would leave the possibility
 of such a limit being obtained in some other way an open
 question.
    In the preceding remarks the mathematical and physical
 limits of perfect elasticity have been supposed identical.
 When they differ, the mathematical limit is of course that
 which must be employed in determining the range of the
 mathematical theory. It will .certainly not exceed the phy
 sical limit. I may add that, while for certain structures such
  5 isolated boilers the physical limit may most nearly concern
 ‘he practical engineer, in other structures, such as girder
 bridges, the stress-strain relation is assumed to be linear in
 designing the seVeral parts, so that the <U+FB01>rst mathematical
 limit is then of the utmost practical importance.
    In the previous discussion of the stress-difference and
 greatest strain theories, as settling the limits of application of
 the mathematical theory, it has been taken for granted that
 the condition (C) was safeguarded by them. Now in most
 ordinary systems of loading this is probably the case, but it
 is 'not always so.     For instance, if we assume the mathe

 242'           Mr. C. Chree on some Applications of
 matical theory to hold, a solid isotropic sphere under a uniform
 surface-pressure shows none but negative strains, and the
 three principal stresses are everywhere equal. Thus the
 greatest strain is everywhere negative, and the stress-dif
 ference everywhere zero.      This is true irrespective of the
 magnitude of the surface-pressure, and so, according to both
 theories, the stress-strain relation would be linear and the
 mathematical theory would apply, however large the pressure
_was. According to the theories, one might continue to em
 ploy mathematical formulae which indicated a reduction of
 the sphere to one millionth of its ori 'nal volume.            It is
 obvious, however, that a reduction of t e volume by even a
 tenth would produce strains which are probably far in excess
 of those admitted by the principle            In formulating an
 objection to the universal application of the theories, I have
 preferred to attack them on the side of the principle (C) so
 as to show clearly that the high authority of Thomson and
 Tait is on my side. The example considered raises, however,
 what seems to me at least an equally strong argument against
 the theories from the side of the principle (B). For we must
 remember that the stresses inside the material are determined
 by the intermolecular forces. Now, whatever molecules may
 be, and however they may act on one another, it seems in
 credible that the molecular forces should lead to one and the
 same stress-strain relation, however much the mean molecular
 distance may be reduced. The fact that Sir W. Thomson
 regards the existence of an irreducible minimum volume as
 possible may, I think, be taken as proof that he is opposed to
 the view that it is possible for the stress-strain relation to
 remain linear under such circumstances. It thus seems to
 me, on various grounds, that the inevitable conclusion is that
 while one or other of the two theories may, under ordinary
 circumstances, be suf<U+FB01>cient to de<U+FB01>ne the limits of the mathe
 matical theory, the result must always be checked by reference
 to the condition (C), or, what comes to the same thing, we
 must give up the mathematical theory when the strains it
 indicates are such as would markedly alter the mean mole
 cular distance.
     I next proceed to discuss the possibility of the earth’s
 possessing an elastic solid structure, deriving the necessary
 data from three papers published in the ‘ Transactions’ of the
 Cambridge Philosophical Society. For brevity these will be
 referred to as (a)*, (6)1', and (0)1.

   The strains due to the action of the sun and moon being
comparatively insigni<U+FB01>cant, we need consider only the “ cen
trifugal ” forces due to the earth’s diurnal rotation, and the
gravitational forces due to the mutual attraction of its parts.
   The data supplied by Geology do not enable us to formu
latc any likely theory as to a probable distribution of density
and elasticity throughout the earth regarded as an elastic
solid.   All we know with certainty is that the surface strata
are on an average considerably below the mean density, that
they differ widely in character, many being markedly aeolo
tropic, and that frequently they are far from horizontal.
Thus, as our object is merely to consider what are the possi
bilities on the hypothesis of solidity, it will be best to make
the hypothesis as simple as possible. Now, if the deviations
from the earth’s mean density and from an isotropic elastic
structure were limited to the surface-strata, where alone we
are certain of their existence, the effect of the “ centrifugal ”
forces would be nearly the same as if these deviations did not
exist; but the effect of the gravitational forces on the eccen
tricity of the surface may depend largely on the nature of
the deviations. I thus propose to treat the problem in
stages.
   The <U+FB01>rst stage 119 lects entirely the gravitational forces
and regards the cart as a slightly spheroidal body—which
has departed from the spherical form in consequence of its
rotation—of uniform density and of the same isotropic elastic
structure throughout, rotating with uniform angular velocity
u) about its polar axis.
   Let a denote the mean radius, d the difference between
the e uatorial and polar semi-axes of the surface, E
Youngs modulus, and 1] Poisson’s ratio for the material.
Then the ratio d : a is given for various values of 1) in the
following Table *z—

   In the case of an originally spherical solid assumin the
shape of the earth under rotation, it is of no practice im
portance whether we re ard a as the radius of the original
spherical surface, or as t e mean radius under rotation, nor
does it matter practically whether the density be supposed
uniform previous to or during the rotation. There is, it is

may be neglected.
 ‘ The mathematical solution on which Table I. is based treats
the spherical surface of radius a as that over which the con
ditions for a free surface are satis<U+FB01>ed. Now some uncertainty
may exist, depending on the physical interpretation put upon
the mathematical equations, whether these surface conditions
should be applied over what is the surface before the dis
placement—in this case the surface of the true sphere which
it is assumed the earth would form if the rotation disappeared,
—or over what is the surface during the rotation. This un
certainty might constitute a very serious dif<U+FB01>culty if the de
formations were supposed to be large—a contingency which
may arise when the limitation (C) in the magnitude of the
strains is neglected; but in such problems as the present
where the strains are, as we shall see presently, of the same
order of magnitude as occur in ordinary engineering struc
tures, it is of no material “consequence. In the present case
complete assurance on this point may be derived from <U+FB01>gures
1 and 2, plate ii. of (a), which show the changes induced by
rotation in the equatorial and polar semi-axes of spheroids of
various shapes.
   For given values of d, a, m, and p, Table I. shows that E
and 17 increase together. Giving w the value it has for the

   This table will, give a general idea of the limits within
which E may reasonably be expected to lie, though some of
the data refer to material which is hardly likely to have been
isotropic. It shows that if the in<U+FB02>uence of the gravitational
forces on the eccentricity were negligible—which, however,
is not the case—the earth, though perfectly solid and elastic,
might reasonably be expected to display not a smaller but a
considerably greater eccentricity than it actually does.
   The question next arises whether the strains and stresses
produced by the rotation are such as are consistent with the
principles on which the application of the mathematical theory
rests. In the actual case of the earth this question is of im
portance only in exceptional circumstances, owing to the pre
ponderating in<U+FB02>uence of the gravitational forces, still it
possesses suf<U+FB01>cient interest to claim separate consideration.
The following table gives a suf<U+FB01>ciently close approximation
to the numerical results obtained for the rotating body treated
above, when for E are substituted the values which answer to
the production by rotation alone of an eccentricity equal to
that of the earth.                                                            '

246           Mr. C. Chree on some Applications of
    The maximum stress-difference and the greatest strain, as
given in the table, are both found at the centre.
    The result on the stress-difference theory is nearly inde
pendent of a), and is more unfavourable in every case than
that given by the greatest strain theory to the view that the
 material remains perfectly elastic. A stress of 16 tons per
square inch is not one that an engineer would view with com
 placency in any structure intended to be permanent, but it is
a low value for the tenacity of good wrought iron. A stress
of even 33 tons per square inch can easily be borne without
 rupture by good steel, and is perhaps not in excess of the
 stress under which the best steel remains practically perfectly
elastic. The greatest strains are not of such a magnitude as
to raise any presumption against the linearity of the stress
strain relation. Thus, according to all the tests, it is quite
possible that an originally spherical solid of the earth’s mass
but devoid of gravitation should remain solid and elastic
while assuming the form of the earth under rotation. Its
material, however, at least if homogeneous and isotropic,
would require to possess an unusually high limit of perfect
elasticity.
    The next subject for consideration is how the question is
affected by the existence of ravitational forces such as are
found in the case of the cart . The strains and stresses in a.
 slightly oblate spheroid, treated as an isotropic elastic solid,
all consist of two parts, the <U+FB01>rst part being the same as if the
surface were truly spherical, the second depending on the
eccentricity. It is the second parts that represent the action
of the gravitational forces in modifying the eccentricity, but
these parts are in general insigni<U+FB01>cant so far as the question
 of the applicability of the mathematical theory is concerned. I
shall therefore postpone consideration of them until an account
has been given of the strains and stresses which are inde
pendent of the eccentricity.
    The mathematical dif<U+FB01>culties in applying the ordinary
theory to the case of a homogeneous solid gravitating sphere
are tri<U+FB02>ing, but the dif<U+FB01>culty of putting a physical interpre
tation upon the mathematical expressions answering to most
values of 1) is such as very forcibly to call attention to the
necessity of the limitation         Since the gravitational force
at an element of a solid sphere depends not only on the total
mass which lies nearer the centre than does the element, but
also on its absolute distance from the centre, we must assume
that the equations supplied b the ordinary mathematical
theory, if they apply at all, old for the position of <U+FB01>nal
equilibrium after the deformations have taken place. This

                   Physics and Mathematics to Geology.                          247
seemingly requires that strain should be de<U+FB01>ned as the ratio
of the increase of length to the <U+FB01>nal length, which is not in
accordance with the usual interpretation of Hooke’s law
unless the square of the strain be negligible. Su posing the
internal equations to refer to the <U+FB01>nal deforme condition,
the surface equations will undoubtedly also refer to this con
dition. Thus, so far as the terms independent of the eccen
tricity are concerned, we may suppose the mathematical
theory applied to a sphere whose densityp is uniform through
out. and whose radius a equals the earth’s mean radius.
    In this case the maximum stress-difference and the al
gebraically greatest strain are both found at the surface.
Let us denote these by S and E respectively; and let so denote
the greatest compression, which occurs at the centre, and u“

248           Mr. C. Chree on some Applications of
   For a given value of 1; the value of S is independent of E.
It diminishes continually as 1) increases from zero.        Since
the value of 5 depends on E, I have given the value of E E, or
the longitudinal stress which would produce in a bar of the
material a strain equal 3. The value of E E has a maximum
of about 1520 tons weight per square inch, for 17:]—- t/ 1/2
or ‘293 nearly.
   For n='5 the values of so and u“ are zero supposing E
<U+FB01>nite, but for other values of 1; one can obtain numerical
measures of these quantities only by assigning numerical
values to E. Now if the earth were an elastic solid truly
spherical but for its rotation, the value of E answering to a
given value of 17 would be determined from the eccentricity
of the surface.    But the action of the gravitational forces, as
will be seen more clearly presently, largely reduces the eccen
tricity which rotation would produce in a sphere of given
material. Thus the eccentricity varying inversely as E, the
value of E answering to a given eccentricity is necessaril
considerably smaller when gravitational forces act along with
the “centrifugal” than when the latter act alone.       Since the
surface-strata are very variable and of _ much smaller mean
density than the earth as a whole, any calculation of the
reduction of our estimates of E, when gravitational forces are
allowed for, which treats the earth as of uniform density can
not lay claim to great accuracy. For this reason, and also
because I am specially desirous not to overstate the case
against the application of the mathematical theory, I have in
calculating the values of so and u" in Table IV. ascribed to E
the values it would possess in the total absence of gravita
tional forces, viz. the values 1020 x 106 for 17:0 and 1220 x 10‘5
for n='25 in the same units as before. The numerical values
ascribed to so and u“ in the table are thus essentially minima,
which would in reality have to be increased probably to a.
considerable extent.
   It will be seen from the formulae and from Table IV. that
when a) is zero or is small, the application of the mathematical
theory would be fully justi<U+FB01>ed on the greatest strain theory,
while utterly condemned on the stress-difference theory.
The principle (C) is in this case entirely in agreement with
the stress-difference theory, and the application of the mathe
matical theory can in fact be supported only by those who
reject this principle, and consider it possible for the stress
strain relation to remain linear though a solid sphere is
reduced to one fourth or less of its original volume.
   Noticing from (1) and (2) that EE/S=2n, we see that for,

               Physics and illatliematics to Geology.               249
all values of 1; less than '5 the stress-difference theory is less
favourable to the view that the mathematical theory is appli
cable than the greatest strain theory. If there is any truth in
either theory, the earth’s material cannot possibly possess a
linear stress-strain relation for values of 'r; such as '25 (i. e.
with a structure such as that of the metals) unless it be of a
strength compared to which that of steel is insigni<U+FB01>cant.
For such values of 'q the strains are also enormously in excess
of those which can be admitted according to the principle (0).
   When, however, 17 approaches the limiting value '5 a com
plete change comes over the features of the case.                  The
maximum stress-difference and all the strains diminish, oven
tually vanishing when 17='5. Thus none of the objections
hitherto encountered can be urged against the application of
the mathematical theory when 1] equals or nearly equals '5.
To the exact value '5 of '17 there is, I admit, a physical objec
tion, which would doubtless have been urged by Maxwell, viz.
that, supposing Young’ s modulus to be <U+FB01>nite, this implies the
material to be absolutely incompressible. There is, however,
 no obvious physical objection to the hypothesis that the
 material is very nearly incompressible, i. e. that '5 -—17 is very
 small"; and an isotropic sphere with such a structure would,
 according to all our tests, remain perfectly elastic when
 possessed of the earth’s mass and exposed to its gravitational
 forces.
    In our previous estimate of the value of E the action of the
 gravitational forces in reducing the eccentricity was not taken
 into account. If the principles we have laid down as regula
 ting the applicability of the mathematical theory be conceded,
 we need only consider the case when '5 —'r) is very small ; and
 since the formulae show that in this case a small variation in
 the value of n is of little consequence, we may for simplicity
 suppose n='5 exactly.
    In order to show the nature of the uncertainty that must
 in reality be attached to the result, it seems desirable to give
 a general idea of the way in which the existence of gravita
 tional forces affects the eccentricity. Let us imagine, then,
 that over the surface of a perfect sphere weightless matter
 is piled up, which transforms the surface into that of a slightly
 oblate spheroid whose polar and equatorial semi-axes are re
 spectively a—2d/3 and a+d/3.           Now suppose the heaped-up
 material to become heavy. The pressure it exerts on the
 surface below it is greatest in the equator and is zero at the

 pp. 192-5, give data from which they conclude that indie-rubber is such
 a material.

250            Mr. C. Chree on some Applications of
poles. Thus the originally spherical surface will tend to sink
at the equator and to rise at the poles; consequently the
difference d between the equatorial and polar semi-axes of the
 spheroidal surface will diminish, but the diminution is clearly
 less the smaller the density of the heaped-up material.
    It must be understood that this does not profess to be a
complete account of what actually happens; but it may suf<U+FB01>ce
 to show that the gravitational forces tend to reduce the eccen
 tricity which the centrifugal forces tend to develop, and also
that this reduction may depend largely on the density of the
 surface layers. 1f the departure of the surface layers from
 the earth’s mean density occurs mainly near the equator,
 then the action of the gravitational forces in reducing the
 eccentricity may be much less than it would seem to be on
 the hypothesis of an earth of uniform density.
    Treating the density as uniform and 07 as equal '5, I <U+FB01>nd that,
for a given value of E, the existence of the gravitational forces
would in such a case as that of the earth reduce the difference
between the equatorial and polar diameters called for by the
rotation in the ratio of 9 : 40 approximately“. Thus, for a
given eccentricity, the value of E when the gravitational
 forces act is to its value when the centrifugal forces alone
exist as 9 :40. So in the supposed case of the earth, We
should have to reduce E from 141 x 107 to 32 X 107 grammes
weight per square centim. The maximum stress-difference
reduces to 7'2 tons weight per square inch. The greatest _
strain remains '0018, as before, but it would answer to a
purely longitudinal stress of only 3'6 tons per square inch.
Owing to the less density of the surface-strata these reductions
may be considerably too great, so that it is advisable to regard
32X 107 as essentially a lower limit to the value of E. As
stated above, the numerical result for the value of E would
be but little altered if we supposed 1] slightly less than '5 ;
but unless '5—17 be very small, the terms independent of the
eccentricity become of importance in estimating the maximum
stress—difference and greatest strain.
   The conclusion to which the previous investigations lead is,
that none of the principles at present recognized in the
hiconstant theory of isotropy are opposed to the hypothesis
that the earth possesses in its interior an isotropic elastic
solid structure with a linear stress-strain relation, provided
its material be very nearly incompressible. But the hypo
thesis that the material iu the interior shows an isotropic elastic
structure, such as that of the ordinary metals under the
ordinary conditions to which they are exposed on the earth’s

surface, can be maintained only by those who are prepared to
reject the usual theories of the rupture, the limitation (C) in
the size of the strains, and the argument introduced here
from the theory of intermolecular forces. This raises no
presumption against the hypothesis that the interior is in a
perfectly solid state, and possessed of such a chemical consti~
tution, say, as iron, if it be admitted that it is of a material
in which the linearity of the stress-strain relation ceases when
the compression becomes large.
   The results obtained raise no presumption for or against
the theory that the earth is in a liquid or plastic state. They
merely show that any argument against the possibility of an
elastic solid structure in a body of the earth’s form is without
foundation ; and that any argument based on the destructive
tendency of the enormous gravitational forces in a solid of its
mass is inconclusive, even as directed against such structures
as are compassed by the ordinary mathematical theory. It
has not been shown that an aeolotropic solid structure of some
kind, or of a variety of kinds, may not satisfy all the con
ditions as well as or even better than a nearly incompressible
isotropic material. The presumption is, in fact, that the con
ditions may be satisfied in an in<U+FB01>nite number of ways.
   It must be borne in mind that there may be fatal objections
to an elastic solid structure which do not arise immediately
from the theory of elasticity. Such an objection may arise
from the rapid increase with the depth shown by the tempe
rature near the earth’s surface. My principal reason for
referring to this is to point out that the common argument
against the production of <U+FB02>uidity by the high internal tempe
rature (viz. an assumed raising of the melting-point by
pressure) has just as much weight for a nearly incompressible
solid earth as for any other, because while the‘ stress-difference
in such an earth is small the internal pressures are extremely
large.
   Before passing to the second part of the paper, I have to
confess that there is no reason to believe that some of the
limitations assigned here to the application of the mathema
tical theory will be accepted by all or even by a majority of
elasticians.   In fact the mathematical theory has actually been
applied by several recent writers under circumstances when
most or all of the limitations proposed here are violated. For
instance, this is to a certain extent the case in Professor Dar
win’s paper *, “ On the Stresses caused in the Interior of the
Earth by the Weight of Continents and Mountains.” In the
principal part of the paper he supposes 'r)=‘5, when, as we
                    if Phil. Trans. 1882, pp. 187—2-50.

have seen, none of the objections apply; but in his § 10, in
order “to know how far the results . . . . may differ, if the
elastic solid be compressible,” he supposes that while the
rigidity constant is <U+FB01>nite the bulk modulus is very small. In
other words, he applies mathematical formulae which assume 1)
nearly equal to -—1. Such a value has been here regarded
as impossible. It should also be noticed that if n were equal
 —1 then E would vanish, and if n be nearly —1 the value of
E must be very small. Thus the strains and displacements
given by equations (2) to (4) would in the case supposed by
 Professor Darwin be enormously greater than even those
given in Table IV.         I do not observe, however, that either in
the paper itself or in one supplementary * to it Professor
Darwin makes any explicit reference to the terms in the strain
independent of the angular coordinates, from which the equa
tions (1) to (4) are derived. I am thus unable to say whether
his neglect of the limitations that these terms are here regarded
as setting to the application of the mathematical theory is
intentional or not. Again, in a recent paper 1', “ On Sir
William Thomson’s estimate of the Rigidity of the Earth,”
Mr. Love has also considered the problem of the earth treated
as an isotropic elastic sphere, more especially for the value
'25 of 07. In his equations (14) and (18) Mr. Love deter
mines the values of two arbitrary constants which occur in the
terms independent of the angular coordinates; and it is easily
seen that the expression he would thence obtain for these
terms is identical with minei. After determining the second
constant he, however, dismisses the subject with the remark,
 “This . . . . gives the mean radial displacement, a matter
which need not detain us here.” So far as I can see, Mr.
 Love makes no reference to any principle such as (0), nor to
 the possibility of the stress-strain relation ceasing to be linear.
    I ought also to explain that in my paper (a), directing my
attention solely to the theories of rupture, I left out of sight
any such limitation as (B) or (C), and treated the case of an
earth in which 77: O as one in which, according to the greatest
strain theory of rupture, the mathematical theory was ap
plicable. I also failed to notice that the case 1)=‘5 was
sanctioned by the greatest-strain theory as well as by the
stress-difference theory.

 XXXIV. The Theory of lilaynetz'sm and the Absurdity of
    Diamaynetz'c Polarity. By J. PARKER, 111.141., Fellow of
   St. John’s College, Cambridge.
                         [Continued from p. 203.]
 IT appears from experiment that the properties of exerting
       actions at a distance by a magnet are mainly situated at or
near the ends of the magnet. Suppose, then, that we have
two long magnets A, B, which may be considered to possess
the magnetic properties only in their ends, and let these
magnets be so placed that we need only take into account one
end of each.       Also let these two ends be so far from each
other that they may be regarded as mathematical points
P, Q. Then the only magnetic forces between the two
magnets will be equal forces at the poles P, Q, acting along
the line PQ in opposite directions.
   Now let the two magnets be situated in a“ vacuum ” and be
made to undergo a reversible cycle in which the velocities
are constantly zero. To do this, they must be held by external
forces equal and opposite to gravity and to the magnetic
forces between P and Q. But if the equal forces between P
and Q be denoted by F, a repulsion being considered positive
and an attraction negative, the work done by F in a small
change of the distance PQ                will be Fdr. Hence the
work done on the system during the cycle by the external
forces is ~5Fdr, where the two limits are identical. This
must be zero, by the principles of thermodynamics, and there
fore F must depend only on r, or FEf (r). From experi
                            .              .       1       .
ment it appears that ftr) is proportional to 77,, so that if the
force between P and Q when their distance is one centimetre
be 7t. dynes, the force will be gdynes when the distance is
r centimetres.
   Now let there be any number of poles R, R', R”, . . . ,
which may be treated as mathematical points, acted on simul
taneously by P and Q. Then it is inferred from experiment,
supported by theory, that if the two poles P, Q repel each
other, the forces they exert on any one of the other poles,
R, will be both repulsive or both attractive; but that if P
and Q attract each other, the forces they exert on any one
of the other poles will be one repulsive and the other attrac
tive.    Conversely, if P and Q both repel or both attract the
pole R, they will repel each other; while if one attract and

254           Mr. J. Parker on the Theory oflfagnetism and
the other repel, they will attract each other; and the very
same properties are true of all the poles.
     Thus it ap ears that there are two kinds of poles, or of
magnetism.          ike kinds repel; unlike kinds attract. For
instance, if P and Q repel each other, they are of the same
kind. If both P and Q repel a third pole R, R will be of
the same kind as P and Q ; if both P and Q attract B, it will
be of unlike kind to P and
     The two kinds of magnetism may be distinguished by the
signs + and —. It is immaterial which kind of magnetism
be considered positive ; but it is generally agreed to take the
kind found at that end of a soft bar of iron which, when
freely suspended and in stable equilibrium, points to the
north.
     If the poles P, Q exert equal forces, both attractive or both
repulsive, on any third pole R from which they are equally
distant, the poles P, Q, or the quantities of magnetism at P
and Q are said to be equal. If the forces be equal, but one
attractive and the other repulsive, the poles P, Q are said to
be equal and opposite, or the quantities of magnetism at P
and Q are said to be numerically equal but of opposite sign.
Again, if the pole P exert m times as great a force as Q, and
both be attractive or both repulsive, the magnetism at P is
said to be +m times that at               If one force be attractive
and the other repulsive, the magnetism at P is said to be
 —m times that at           Lastly, it is inferred from experiment,
supported by theory, that if two poles X, Y be at the same
distance as two equal poles P, Q, and the magnetism at X be
.1.- times that at P, and that at Y y times that at Q, the force
between X and Y will be my times that between P and Q.
The force between X and Y is repulsive if X and Y, or wand
y, be of the same sign, that is, if the product wy be positive :
the force is attractive if a: and y be of opposite signs, or a-y
negative.
     These results lead to the C.G.S. system of units. If two
equal positive poles P, Q, situated at a distance of one centi
metre, repel each other with a force of one dyne, the quan
tity of magnetism at P or Q is de<U+FB01>ned to be the unit of
magnetism. It therefore follows that if two poles X, Y, at
which the quantities of magnetism are m and m', be at a dis
tance of 1' centimetres, the magnetic force between them will

     To complete the fundamental principles of magnetism, we
must add the great principle of the Conservation of Magne

              the Absurdity 0f Diamagnetic Polarity.         255
 tism, which asserts that whatever changes take place in the
 magnetization of a system, the quantity of magnetism remains
 constant.
     In the ordinary text-books, the fundamental de<U+FB01>nitions &c.
 are given in a manner which we cannot accept. Thus, let
 A, B be two long magnets which may be supposed to possess
 the magnetic properties only in their ends, and let them be so
 placed that we need only consider the positive pole of each,
 viz., P on A and Q on B. Then,if these poles are equal, and
 if, when they are placed “ in air ” at a distance of one centi~
 metre, a force of one dyne is required to overcome the force
 which tends to separate them, the strength of each pole is
 de<U+FB01>ned to be unity, and it is asserted that at a distance of r
 centimetres “in air,” the force which tends to separate them
 is % dynes.    In our method of treating the subject, we should
 say that the force which tends to separate the two poles is
 partly due to the magnetisms of the poles themselves, partly
to the magnetization of the air in which the two magnets are
 placed, and partly to the inequalities in the pressure of the
 air. In some experiments, the pressure of the air is the most
important factor. The so-called de<U+FB01>nitions of the text-books
 are therefore not de<U+FB01>nitions at all, but propositions in the
 Kinetic Theory of Gases, and are possibly incorrect.
    Having now explained the fundamental principles of the
subject, we must consider how magnetism is distributed in
bodies. In the <U+FB01>rst place, it is evident that a <U+FB01>nite quantity
of magnetism cannot be concentrated into a point—that is
into an indefinitely small sphere; for any two parts of the
sphere would exert very great forces on each other, and the
sphere would <U+FB02>y to. pieces.
    A <U+FB01>nite quantity of magnetism can be distributed on a <U+FB01>nite
area. For if a- be the quantity of magnetism per unit area,
or the surface density, on an in<U+FB01>nite plate, this plate will
exert a magnetic force 27mm on a body P with a quantity of
magnetism m. If P be a second plate on which the surface
density is 0’, the force exerted by the in<U+FB01>nite plate on each
unit of area of P will always have the <U+FB01>nite value 2mm".
    If we break a magnet into any number of pieces, each
piece is found to be a complete magnet. From this it is in
ferred that each atom or molecule is a complete magnet with
equal quantities of positive and negative magnetism at its
ends. The total quantity of magnetism on each atom or
molecule is therefore zero, and the distribution on it may
be supposed to be a surface distribution. To prevent any
dif<U+FB01>culty being felt with respect to surface distributions of

256      Mr. J. Parker on the Theory of Magnetism and
magnetism, we have only to mention that, according to the
physical theories of magnetism, all that is meant is a <U+FB01>nite
pressure or tension per unit area on the surface.
   The reason why, in an ordinary bar-magnet, there is little
manifestation of the ma netic properties except near the ends,
is supposed to be that t e positive end of one atom or mole
cule and the negative end of the next partially neutralize

   To calculate to what extent the magnetisms of successive
molecules neutralize one another, we require some preliminary
propositions.
   Suppose that a very short, thin, straight magnet of length l
is placed with its centre at O and let the quantities of mag
netism at its two ends A, B, which may be treated as mere

angle between OP and the line AB, or the axis of the magnet.
Then the magnet AB exerts on P a repulsive force 1%

Thus if we can neglect %, as we certainly can when AB is
comparable to the size of a molecule, the action on P reduces
to 7% parallel to BA and 3;? cos 0 along OP.          These forces
are exactly the same as would have been produced by another
short magnet similar to AB, placed along AB with its centre
at 0, provided that m'l'=ml. De<U+FB01>ning ml to be the magnetic

and denote the coordinates of P by (w, y,          and the angles
AB makes with the axes by (a, ,8, ry), the forces exerted on P

or 3{lTlcos 6, along OP.      We may therefore say that the
action of a small magnet AB is equal to the sum of the actions
of its components.
   A molecule may be supposed made up of several elementary
magnets such as AB. As each of these constituent elemen
tary magnets is equivalent to three component magnets
parallel respectively to the three rectangular axes, the whole
molecule is equivalent to three elementary magnets parallel
respectively to the axes, and therefore equivalent to a single
resultant elementary magnet. The magnetic moment and
direction of this resultant magnet may be called the magnetic
moment and axis of the molecule.
   As neighbouring molecules may be magnetized differently,
we shall avoid the irregularities by considering a volume
do which, though very small, is still large enough to con
tain many molecules.       Since each molecule in the volume
is equivalent to three small component magnets parallel to
the axes, the whole volume do is equivalent to three small
component magnets, and therefore to a single small magnet.
If we denote the moment of this single magnet by Ida,
I is de<U+FB01>ned to be the intensity of magnetization of the ele
ment, or at a point in the element, and. the direction of I is
de<U+FB01>ned to be the direction of magnetization.
    If A, B, O be the components of I parallel to the axes, it
is evident that the external action of the element do is equal
 to the sum of the actions of three equal volumes placed suc~
 cessively in the same position, Whose magnetizations are
 respectively parallel to the axes and equal to A, B, and C.
    If we draw a curve such that the tangent at any point is
 the direction of magnetization at that point, the curve may be
 called a line of magnetization. It is generally continuous so
 long as we keep to the same body. If at any point two con
 secutive tangents cut at a <U+FB01>nite angle, we shall consider, that,

             the Absurdity of Diamagnetz'c Polarity.         259
for magnetic purposes, we enter a new body when we travel
along the line of magnetization past the point at which the
discontinuity takes place.
   If the elementary volume dc be in the form of a cylinder,
of small length and thickness, whose generators are lines of
magnetization and whose ends are orthogonal sections, it is
evident, from what has been shown, that the external mag
netic action of the volume is the same as that of layers of
magnetism on the ends, of surface-densities I on the positive
end and —I on the negative end.
   We shall now suppose the body divided into a vast number
of elementary cylinders such as these, and we shall examine
how far the magnetic layers on contiguous ends neutralize
one another. Let 0 be a <U+FB01>xed point on a line of magnetiza
tion and P, Q two other points, such that the distance OP = s
and OQ=s + ds. Round the line OPQ describe a small closed
curve and let a line of magnetization travel round it so as to
trace out a thin tube in the body. Through P and Q draw
                             Fig. 7.
normal surfaces to the line OPQ, and let do: be the area of the
section of the tube at P or Q.       Then let the length PQ be
divided into an in<U+FB01>nite number of equal parts, each of which
may be supposed considerable in comparison with the size of
a molecule, and through each of the points of division draw
surfaces normal to PQ, so as to divide the small cylinder PQ
into an in<U+FB01>nite number of in<U+FB01>nitely thinner cylinders. Then,
since each of these constituent cylinders of PQ is equivalent
to equal surface—layers on its ends, the densities of which vary
uniformly from I at P to I+Z~§ds at Q, it is clear that the
cylinder PQ is equivalent to layers on its ends, of surface
densities —I at P and I+%ds at Q, together with a
quantity of magnetism —% (is do: uniformly distributed

found on a line of magnetization.
   Now let a <U+FB01>nite body be divided into an in<U+FB01>nite number of
thin tubes such as that surrounding the curve OPQ.      Let one
of these tubes meet the surface of the body in the curves

tube, entirely within the tube and just touching the curves
XY, X'Y' at the points X, X'. Then, when the section of the
tube is inde<U+FB01>nitely diminished, the external magnetic action

of XYY'X' is ultimately the same as that of XZZ'X', and is
therefore equivalent to a volume-density whose value p at any
point is —:—g, and a layer of surface-density IX on XZ and
another layer --Ix, on X’Z'.    Consider the section XZ.    The
layer on this section is equivalent to an equal quantity of
magnetism distributed uniformly on the neighbouring small
area XY.     But if 6x be the angle between the direction of
ma netization and the outward drawn normal at X, the area
X =the area XZ x sec 0x.          The surface-density on XY
is therefore IX cos 6 .     Similarly the density on X'Y' is
Ix, cos 0 ,.  Hence we arrive at the simple result, generally
obscured or made mysterious by formidable integrations, that
a <U+FB01>nite body is magnetically equivalent to a volume distribu
tion whose density p at any point is —g, together with a
surface-layer whose value a" at any point of the surface is
I cos 9, where 6 is the angle between the direction of magneti
zation and the outward drawn normal at the point.
   The expression for p can be put in a more convenient form.

of their actions will be equal to that of the given body.

layer whose density at a point P where the outward drawn

     We may now <U+FB01>nd the energ U and the entropy ¢ of any
 magnetized system at rest, with, its magnetization in equili
 brium, stable or unstable. For this purpose we shall <U+FB01>rst
 obtain the energy U’ and the entropy ¢’ of a magnetized
 system identical with the given system except that it is broken
 up into an infinite number of small pieces.              ‘
      W'ithout altering the internal conditions or the magnetic
 distribution of any part of the system (U’, ¢'), let all its
 elementary portions be removed to in<U+FB01>nite distances from
 one another, and left without velocity. Suppose that in thus
 preventing the forces acting between the various elements
 from producing velocities, the work obtained from the system
 is Y+W, where the part Y is due to the magnetization of
 the system and W to gravitation. Then, since the operation
 is clearly reversible and unattended by any thermal pheno
 menon, the energy will now be U'—Y—W, and the entropy
    '. Also, since the values of the energy before and after the
 operation (U', U'—Y—W) depend only on the two states, it
  is clear that Y+W, and therefore Y alone, is independent of
  the manner in which the change of state is effected.
      Let us now consider one of the elements after it has been
  removed to an in<U+FB01>nite distance from all the other elements.
  Its energy will be proportional to its volume do, if that
  volume is small enough ; and, if the substance be homo

 only on the intensity of magnetization I and the absolute
 temperature 9, the energy of the element may be written
 F(I, (9)111". Calling G the value of F(I, 0) when 1:0, which
 is clearly <U+FB01>nite, we may put F (I, 6)dv in the form C(lv+

    The very simple expressions (1) and (2) are due, I believe,
to Duhem, by whom they were given in 1888. Before
making use of them, I will show how the energy of a
magnetized system is discussed in the ordinary text-books.
    The principle of the conservation of magnetism being taken
for granted, it is <U+FB01>rst assumed that magnetization may be
separated from material bodies ; in other words, that the pro
perty of matter of exerting actions at a distance may exist

             the Absurdity of Diamaynetic Polarity.         263
apart from matter. It is next assumed that there is an in
<U+FB01>nite store of positive and negative magnetism at in<U+FB01>nity at
which we can be supplied gratis with as much as we require.
Lastly, it is assumed that the attraction or repulsion between
any two small quantities of magnetism m, m', dissevcred from
matter, is exactly the same as the attraction or repulsion
between two small portions of matter at the same distance.
magnetized with the same quantities of magnetism m, m'. Then,
in order to <U+FB01>nd the energy U of any magnetized system, we sup
pose its magnetism made up of an in<U+FB01>nite number of elements
which were originally at an in<U+FB01>nite distance from the given
material system and from one another, and unassociated with
matter. If, therefore, we denote by U0 the energy that the
given system would have if it were deprived of its magneti
zation, but otherwise unchanged, and imagine some agent
capable of bringing the magnetic elements from in<U+FB01>nity up
to the given system, and there placing them in the positions
they are to occupy, without exerting more ferce than is just
necessary to overcome the attractions and repulsions between
them, we are supposed to get
                           U=U0+Y
     The ordinary text-books make no attempt to <U+FB01>nd the en
 tropy of a magnetized system. In fact, until the appearance
 of Duhem’s book in 1888, the rigid methods of thermodynamics
 do not seem to have been thought necessary.
     In order to <U+FB01>nd the condition of magnetic stability on a
 homogeneous body of uniform temperature 0, we suppose the
 body incapable of receiving or losing heat except at the con
 stant temperature (9. Then we imagine the magnetization of
 a single volume element do to change slightly in direction,
 and to increase from I to [+81 ; and we suppose that when
 the temperature has again become equal to 0, no other change
 has been made in the system.
     If 8Q be the heat absorbed in the process, the principles of
 thermodynamics require that
                            so < 68¢,
 or, since no work has been done on the system during the
 operation,
                            8U < 68¢.

264       Mr. J. Parker on the Theory of Magrwtism and
    Let us now imagine a system identical with the given

be removed to in<U+FB01>nity without causing any other change in
the system. Then if w be the work so obtained, we have
clearly
                             8Y=5w.
    To <U+FB01>nd 8w, we may take the volume do of any form we
please. Suppose it is a cylinder with its ends perpendicular
to the axis, and the axis parallel to I. Then, by the principles
of the potential, if dm be the section of the cylinder and ds
its length, we have

(a, B, 'y) be the angles the direction of magnetization at the

    If the element do be to any extent magnetically “ rigid,”
its magnetization will not be fully able to obey the directing
causes, and there will be relations between 3A, 8B, and 80 ;
but if the element be “perfectly soft,” we may consider
8A, 8B, SC independent.       In the latter case, if we put 5B
and 50 both zero, equation (3) gives

   We must now explain the meaning of the differential co
efficients of V. We know that if at any external point
P(.z, y, z), a unit positive pole be placed without disturbing
the magnetization of any part of the given material system,
(— g,—Z—;I,—             will be the magnetic forces (X, Y, Z),
parallel to the axes, exerted on the unit pole at P by the
given system. When the point P is within the given system,
We cannot place a unit pole there without disturbing the
system. We therefore imagine a small right circular cylinder,
whose axis coincides with the direction of magnetization and
whose ends are perpendicular to the axis, removed from about
the point P; and suppose that no change is made in the
system beyond the removal of the contents of the cylinder.
If the point P is in the midst of a liquid or gas, a thin sub
stance, the magnetization of which may be neglected, must
be used as a lining for the cylinder, so that the interior of
the cylinder is vacuous. Then if V' be the potential at P of

and therefore
                    dV       'dV'     all!
Now the contents of the small cylinder, before being cut
away, were magnetically equivalent to layers on the ends, of
densities +1 on the positive end and —I on the negative
                 dV”
end. Thus — d           is simply the force, parallel to the axis

of or, arising from these two layers.      But if we take a cir
cular layer of uniform density I, the force it exerts on a
unit pole in the axis of the layer at a point where the radius
of the layer subtends an angle a, is 21rI(1— cos at), and may
therefore be neglected when a is small. Hence, if the radius
of the right circular cylinder be in<U+FB01>nitely small in comparison
with the length, the differential coef<U+FB01>cients of V" will be zero.
Consequently, (— %,— d7; ,—               are the magnetic forces
parallel to the axes, exerted by the new system V' on a unit
pole placed at P without disturbing that system. These
forces are written (X, Y, Z), and are called the forces of the
given system at P.
   If F be the resultant of (X, Y, Z), or the resultant force
of the given system at P, equations (4) become

Now it has been shown by Duhem (Des Corps Diamag
nétiques) that \P(I, 6‘) must always be positive. We must
therefore always take the positive sign before 1;, and may
write              A      B    C     I

where x(I, 0) is always positive.
   The meaning of equations (5) is that, at any point of a
“ perfectly soft ” homogeneous substance, the magnetization,
when in stable equilibrium, coincides in direction with the
force at that point.      If there is any magnetic “ rigidity”
about the substance, the magnetization at a point may, of
course, make a <U+FB01>nite angle with the force at that point.

              the Absurdity of Diamaynetic Polarity.              ' 267
    We can now explain Weber’s hypothesis of magnetism.
 He considers that a body which appears to be neutral is as
 much magnetized as when it exhibits active magnetic pro
 perties, only that, in the former case, the magnetized mole
 cules have their axes pointingin all directions so as exactly to
 neutralize one another. He then supposes that the act of
 magnetization merely consists in giving the axes of the mag
 netized molecules a. de<U+FB01>nite direction. In fact, if we suppose
 an elementary magnet suspended freely by the centre of mass,
 it is clear that it will set its axis in the direction of the external
 magnetic force which acts upon it.
    In the common theory of magnetism it is admitted that in
a “perfectly sof ” homogeneous substance, the magnetiza
tion at any point is in the same straight line as the force ;
but it is supposed that in the so-called diamagnetic homo
geneous “soft substances,” \lr, or x is negative, or that
the magnetization is in the opposite direction to the
force. This gives rise to a dif<U+FB01>culty in Weber’s theory;
for it appears to follow that when an elementary magnet
is freely suspended by the centre of mass, it may perma
nently set its axis in the opposite direction to the external
magnetic force. To escape from this dif<U+FB01>culty it might be
assumed that in every diamagnetic body a number of mole
cules form a kind of lock-work, similar to that of a gun,
and that the <U+FB01>rst act of the external magnetizing force
is to set the lock.       In this way, it might be thought, we
should have a means of setting the magnetized molecules in
the opposite direction to the force and keeping them there;
but it would follow that a diamagnetic body could not be mag
netized until the external magnetizing force exceeded a certain
value, and would not lose its magnetization when the force
was withdrawn. As this appears to be contrary to experi
ment, we conclude that our explanation of the dif<U+FB01>culty due to
the common theory of diamagnetism must be insuf<U+FB01>cient.
    In the case of a quasi-homogeneous substance, like air or
any gas, the mass-density will vary from point to point.
Denoting the mass-density by p, and putting I: g I’, where

very small in comparison with the length of the axis. Then,
by taking the axis of the cylinder tangential to an equi
potential surface, it is easily seen that the pressure and density
of the air have constant values all over the same equipotential
surface. If the axis coincide with a line of force, and we
suppose ourselves to travel in the direction of the force, we
obtain, since the force exerted at any point by the neigh

    The important simpli<U+FB01>cation effected by putting x constant,

the surface-layer of A will be Ia cos 0“,

   270      Mr. J. Parker on the Theory of Magnetism and

     If A be a perfect “vacuum,” we put ka=0.
     This result, which is even more important in electricity
  than 1n magnetism, can be written in a very brief form. For
  if F“, FM be the normal components of F“ and F,, and if a“
  stand for 1 +4ka or 1 +41rka p<U+FB02>and a, for 1 +4'n'lrb, we have

     The foregoing is the usual method of stating the result;
  but if we keep to the convention of supposing every normal
  to be drawn outwards, we shall have
                       -'   #aFan+/L6an=0'
     Since for many substances k is very small (being less than
  M), it follows from the preceding investigation that the
  abrupt change of the force in crossing the boundary of two
  soft bodies may generally be neglected. Hence, if a number
- of soft, feebly magnetic bodies be magnetized by permanent
  steel magnets, we may suppose, without sensible error, that
  the force at any point is entirely due to the permanent
  magnets; in other words, we may neglect the force due to
  the magnetization induced in the soft bodies.       This may also
  be shown as followsz—Let B be any soft, feebly magnetic bod .
  Then the force at any point is the resultant of two forces—lib
  due to B and Fa due to the rest of the system. To make a
  rough comparison between F, and F“, we take the point
 close to the surface of B, in which case it is evident that F1,
 is comparable with 21rlb, that is, with 2wka, or with the
 resultant of 2wkab along F, and 27rchFa along Fa. Thus Fb
 is comparable with 2wkaa, or if kb=m, with the 60,000th
 of Fa; and we draw the same conclusion as before.
    Let us now suppose that a soft, feebly magnetic body B,
 which is either a solid or a liquid contained in a bag, is
 magnetized inductively by a permanent steel magnet situated

             the Absurdity ofDiamagnetic Polarity.       _     271
to the left; and let us imagine, for the sake of simplicity,
that the magnetic force within the body B is everywhere
parallel to the axis of at, so that as we travel parallel to Oz in
 the positive direction, the force diminishes numerically, whether
it be the pesitive or the negative pole of the permanent
magnet which acts on B. Then if we consider a parallelopiped
on the base cly dz, the force acting on it parallel to 0.2: will
be
                           dy dz (I Z-gdz',

                                   (1 F2
                       hkbdy dz          d4};
which is always negative, since F2 diminishes as .0 increases,
and k, is positive. Hence the soft body B is always attracted
by the permanent magnet. The same result would have been
obtained if B had been air or a gas contained in a bag.
    If the body B be immersed in air or in a gas, or in a soft
liquid, the pressures on the two ends of the small parallelo
piped will, by equations (7) and (7’), give a force in the
opposite direction to Ow of
                         ékady dzjvg—dw,
where F has the same meaning as before.
    Hence if k, be greater than kg, or the body B more mag
netic than the gaseous or liquid medium by which it is
surrounded, the attraction of the permanent magnet will over
power the pressure on the surface and the body B will be
drawn towards the pole of the magnet ; but if k, be less than
k“, or B less magnetic than the surrounding medium, the
attraction of the permanent magnet will be overpowered by
the pressure on the surface, and the body B will appear to be
repelled by the permanent magnet.
    We may now sum up the analogies we have found be
tween magnetism and gravitation in the case of homogeneous
bodies. First of all, every soft substance is attracted when
placed near one pole of a magnet; and every body is
attracted to the earth. Secondly, if a number of soft
bodies be magnetized by a steel magnet, we may neglect

272        Mr. J. Parker on the Theory of [Magnetism and
the action of the magnetized soft bodies on one another ;
and if a number of small bodies be placed near the earth,
we may neglect their ravitational attraction on one another
in comparison with tiat of the whole earth. Lastly, if a
soft body be immersed in a gas or liquid, and then placed
near the pole of a magnet, it will appear to be attracted or
repelled according as it is more or less magnetic than the gas
or liquid by which it is surrounded; and if any body be
immersed in a gas or liquid, it will ap ear to be attracted or
repelled by the earth according as it is eavier or lighter than
the gas or liquid in which it is placed.
   The theory we have given is beautifully illustrated and
con<U+FB01>rmed by the following experiments of Faraday’s, described
in Tyndall’s ‘ Diamagnetism.’ Theory and experiment <U+FB01>t
together so exquisitely that we cannot but wonder the true
theory should not have been seen from the <U+FB01>rst.
   “ If a weak solution of protosulphate of iron, m, be put into a
selected thin glass tube about an inch long, and one third or
one fourth of an inch in diameter, and scaled up hermetically,
and be then suspended horizontally between the magnetic
poles in the air, it will point axially, and behave in other
respects like iron ; if instead of air between the poles, a solu
tion of the same kind as m, but a little stronger, n, be sub
stituted, the solution in the tube will point equatorially, or as
bismuth. A like solution somewhat weaker than in, to be
called l, enclosed in a similar tube, will behave like bismuth
in air but like iron in water.”
   It now remains to describe how it is generally attempted
to gloss over the imaginary dif<U+FB01>culties of diamagnetism.
   It is generally admitted that the apparent magnetic or dia
magnetic properties of a soft body B immersed in air or any
other gas or a liquid, are merely differential—that is, depend
on the algebraic excess of the coef<U+FB01>cient k, of the body B
over the coef<U+FB01>cient k, of the substance A in which it is
immersed. This result is thought to be “proved” in the
following way :——-Since every soft body is magnetically equiva
lent to a layer of magnetism on its surface, it follows that
there are two layers on the common surface of A and B, one
belonging to A, the other to B. It is then supposed that the
layer on this surface which properly belongs to A, does not
really belong to A at all, but to B. The body A being mag
netically equivalent to a layer on its surface, it is assumed
that, as the layer on the common surface of A and B is
supposed transferred to B, we may treat A as unmagnetized.
With this assumption the pressure of A would be uniform,

             the Absurdity of Diamagnetic Polarity.           273
and the behaviour of B would be entirely determined by the
supposed compound layer on its surface.
Now if 0 be the angle at any point P               Fig_10_
of the common surface of A and B
between the normal at P, supposed
drawn from A to B, and the force,
which may be considered continuous in
crossing the bounding surface, the su er
<U+FB01>cial density of the layer at P w ich
belongs to B will be —1, cos 6, and of
that which belongs to A, I“ cos 9.
Hence the density at P of the com
pound layer is (Ia—Ib) cos 9. The ratio of this to the density
                                                   I l
at P of the layer which properly belongs to B, is i—", which
                                                      16
is equal to a constant b_ 11 Thus, since the attraction of the
                         ’6b
permanent magnet on B; due to the surface-layer which
properly belongs to B, may be written kbG, where G would
have the same value for any sof't body of the same shape and
size as B, when placed in the same position, the attraction of
the permanent magnet on B, when immersed in A, will
be (k,—ka) G, or equal to the force due to the layer which
properly belongs to B, diminished by what this force would
be for the gas or liquid, A, displaced by B.
   According to the remarkable caricature of reasoning just
noticed, it follows that we do not need to know the absolute
value of the coef<U+FB01>cient k belonging to any soft substance, but
merely the algebraic excess of the coef<U+FB01>cient over that of
some standard substance.        This standard “ substance ” is
often chosen to be a “vacuum,” and its coef<U+FB01>cient is put
zero. Then, since many bodies are apparently repelled by a
magnet pole in a comparatively slight “ vacuum ’ of 2 to 3
millimetres of mercury, it is concluded that the coef<U+FB01>cients of
these bodies, or, rather, the excesses of their coefficients over
that of a vacuum, are negative.
    Granting, for the present, the <U+FB01>rst part of this so-called
reasoning, we must point out that a vacuum can only be
obtained by removing the air completely from the interior of
a closed vessel, and not by merely reducing the pressure to 2
or 3 millimetres of mercur '.    If we were allowed to consider
such a comparatively slig t reduction of density as consti
tuting a vacuum, we could prove the existence of diagravita
tion ; for if we could <U+FB01>nd a gas 100 times as light as hydrogen,
a balloon could be made which would <U+FB02>oat in this so-callod
vacuum.

 27L         Mr. J. Parker on the Theon of JIagnetism and
    We must now consider the two layers on the common sur
 face of two soft bodies A, B, A being a gas or liquid. If the
 surface-molecules of A were provided with sharp points and
 were caused by the smallest amount of magnetization to stick
 to B, it might be thought that both surface-layers would then
 belong to B; but a little consideration tells us that the
 molecules which stick to B would take with them two layers
 of opposite signs, and it is clear that the remainder of A
 would still have a surface-layer of its own, adjoining the
 modi<U+FB01>ed surface of B. In order, therefore, to cause the two
 surface-layers both to belong to B, we must make the follow
 ing assumptions:—It must be supposed that every molecule
 of A is provided with a sharp point, and that the act of
 magnetization causes each molecule to be broken into two
 halves, on one of which is the positive magnetism, on the
 other the negative. Then it must be supposed that those
 half-molecules on which are the surface-layers of A stick to
 the bodies B . . . , with which they happen to be in contact,
 and lastly, that the other half-molecules stick together in
 pairs in such a way that their magnetisms neutralize one
 another. In this way, we should have both surface-layers
 belonging to B, and we might treat the free part of the gas
 or liquid A as unmagnetized. A dif<U+FB01>culty would, however,
 arise when the magnetizing force was withdrawn, unless we
 had some means of reminding the half-molecules to take
 partners. We might avoid the dif<U+FB01>culty by imagining the
 two halves of each molecule tied together bya piece of thread,
 but then we should introduce the absurdity that magnetiza—
 tion changed the gas or liquid A into a solid. Lastly, we
should be obliged to conclude that when a system is once
magnetized, it is impossible to increase the magnetization—a
conclusion which, of course, is necessarily false.
   There is one other wa of treating diamagnetism which
requires to be noticed. This is the method of induced electric
currents used by Weber, by which it is thought to be proved
that k is negative for bismuth and some other substances.
To this I reply that I have already suf<U+FB01>ciently disproved
the common theory of diamagnetism; and secondly, it will be
proved in a future paper that the common theory of induced
currents generally involves an absurdity, and can seldom be
correct.
   The rest of the paper will be occupied with a brief dis
cussion of a few important problems in the light of the new
theory.
   I. If a body P, placed near a number of <U+FB01>xed bodies X, Y,
Z, . . . . , be subject to no actions at a distance, but those of

             the Absurdity of Diamagnelie Polarity.         275
 magnetism and gravitation arising from the <U+FB01>xed bodies
 X, Y, Z . . . . , it can easily be shown that no state of equi
 librium of the body P can be stable unless it be in material
 contact with one or more of the <U+FB01>xed bodies. This proposition
 is proved in Duhem’s L’aimantation per in<U+FB02>uence.       When P
 is in material contact with one or more of the <U+FB01>xed bodies,
 its equilibrium may, of course, be stable. The most useful
 case to consider is the following :—
    Imagine a small bar of bismuth B, suspended from two
 small balloons by threads, as in the <U+FB01>gure, and suppose that
 the mass of the system is slightly less than the mass of the
 air which it displaces
 when unmagnetized and
 near the ground. Then,                      Flg- 11
if the system be set free,
it will ascend in the air,                     M
and, of course, a state                    [:1
 of stable equilibrium
will be attained when it
has risen high enough,
if the weather be calm.                         B
 We may, however, ob
 tain a state of stable equilibrium in a more convenient way.
 For if a permanent strong steel magnet M be <U+FB01>xed some
 distance from the ground, just over the bar B, the system of
 the bismuth and balloons, when let go, will ascend until the
 motion is checked by the increased density and pressure of
the air about M, and will ultimately take up a state of stable
 equilibrium suspended in the air at a moderate distance from
the ground.                                ,
    The problem just given was, we believe, <U+FB01>rst considered by
Sir W. Thomson, to whom it was suggested by the story of
the cof<U+FB01>n of Mahomet.
    II. We will next consider the thermal phenomena due to the
motion of a soft body B in presence of a permanent magnet
M. For simplicity, let M be held at rest and suppose its
magnetism “ rigid.” Also let B be homogeneous, and let our
magnetized system consist merely of the two bodies B and M,
situated in a vacuum.        Then if the temperature, in every
state of equilibrium, is uniform and equal to 9, and if no heat
can be absorbed or given out except at the temperature (9, we
shall have, in any small reversible operation,
                              8Q=06¢.
Now the formula for the entropy is
                   ¢=¢0+§h(1,0)dv. . . . . . . . (2)

276            Mr. J. Parker on the Theory of Magnetism.

where the integral refers only to the soft body B, since no
change can take place in M.
    If the operation consist in moving B nearer to M, I will
increase or SI be positive. Hence, if gill be positive for all
values of I, the operation will cause an absorption of heat, or
would cool the body B, if heat was not supplied from without:
if iii—Ill be always negative, there will be an evolution of heat,
or the operation would beat the body B.                  _
    III. We will, last of all, examine, with Duhem, the method
proposed by Jamin for the determination of the distribution
of magnetism on a permanent magnet.
    A small piece of soft iron, B, being placed in contact with
the permanent magnet at any point P, the smallest force
required to detach it is measured, and it is supposed by Jamin
           .                                 2
that this force is proportional mtg—X) , where V is the poten
tial of the permanent magnet at P and dn an element of the
outward drawn normal.
     We observe, in the <U+FB01>rst place, that the small piece of soft
iron B is magnetically equivalent to a layer on its surface.
 Consequently, the magnetic force at any point is the resultant
of that due to the surface-layer of B and of that due to the
permanent magnet.          Within the bod B, the force due to the
surface-layer of B is the greater of t e two.         This will com
 plicate the problem, and so, for the sake of argument, we will
 agree to ignore the surface-layer of B. With this assumption,
 it follows that the equipotential surfaces and lines of force
 will be due entirely to the permanent magnet, and that the
total magnetic force exerted on B by the permanent ma net
acts along the line of force at P, and is equal to It‘ll—8dr),
where do is the volume of B, and ds an element of the line of
 force in the positive direction of F.     If, for simplicity, we put
                                         2
 I=lcF, this result becomes 1,40% do.            Now if the line of
                                           2
 force at P be directed outwards, ii]; will be negative, and if
                               2
 it be directed inwards,         will be. positive.    Thus in both

cases, the total magnetic force exerted by the permanent

   Thus even with all our assumptions, the force which Jamin

XXXV. The Eapansion of Chlorine by Light as applied to
    the Measurement of the Intensity of Rays of High Refran
    gibilitg.    By Dr. A. RICHARDSON, Lecturer 0n Chemistry,
     University College, Bristol'.
                             [Plates III. 8: IV.]
 IT has been shown by Budde (Phil. Mag. iv. 1871; Pogg.
        Arm. Ergbd. vi. 1873) that when chlorine is exposed to
 the in<U+FB02>uence of sunlight, an expansion of the gas occurs
 which is independent of the direct heating-e<U+FB02>'ects due to the
 light ; the volume to which the gas <U+FB01>rst expands is maintained
 during exposure provided that the intensity of the light
 remains constant, contraction to the original volume takin
 place when the gas is shaded. He further found that the
 rays of high refrangibility were in<U+FB02>uential in promoting this
 change, no expansion being occasioned by the rays at the red
 end of the spectrum. The application of this property of
 chlorine to the measurement of the “actinic”1' intensity of
 light was suggested by Budde many years ago, but no further
 ste 5 appear to have been taken in this direction.
     gome experiments on which I am at present enga ed have
 rendered it necessary that the actinic intensity of lig tshould
 be measured during periods of many months together, and it
 seemed possible that the expansion of chlorine by light might
 be applied to this purpose. As, however, the researches of
  Bunsen and Roscoe (Trans. Roy. Soc. 1887, p. 381)led them to
  the conclusion that no change in volume occurred in chlorine,
  when exposed to light, other than that due to direct heating
  e<U+FB01>'ects, it became necessary to repeat some of Budde’s experi
  ments so as if possible to decide this point. In order to do this

      The bulbs were <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>lled wit dry air and placed in a glass
   tank through which a current of cold water circulated ; under
   these conditions it was found that no movement of the index
. took place on exposure to bright sunlight. The air in one of
   the bulbs was then replaced by dry chlorine, and both bulbs
   were again exposed under precisely similar conditions; an
   immediate expansion of the chlorine took place, causing the
   index to move through a distance of from 20 to 30 centim.,
   but on shading the bulbs the index returned to zero. On
   interposing variously coloured glasses between the bulbs and
   the source of light, it was found that with cobalt glass the
   index receded 15 to 20 centim. from the zero-point, whilst
   even faintly yellow glass as well as ruby glass caused it to
   return to zero. It was further found that the radiations from
   a cannon-ball at a temperature just below a red heat produced
   practically no movement of the index when the bulbs were
  exposed in the air at a distance of from 1 to '5 metre.
      Budde’s observations being thus con<U+FB01>rmed, it was next
  necessary to determine how far the expansion of chlorine is
  proportional to the actinic intensity of the light to which it is
  exposed.    In order to do this a series of measurements of the
  expansion of the gas were made, whilst at the same time the
  intensity of the light to which the gas was exposed was
  determined by means of an actinometer.
      The expansion of the gas was measured in a differential
  arrangement, consisting of two tubes of 55 cubic centim.
  capacity and 10 centim. in length ; these were connected
  with a horizontal gauge graduated in '5 centim., provided
  with a small bulb at each end. These bulbs and also the
    auge contained strong sulphuric acid, a short column of air
    eing introduced to serve as index.
     The tubes to be exposed were suspended in a box, which
  could be placed at any required angle so as to face the sun,
  and when <U+FB01>lled with dry air were found to be equally heated;
  the bulbs containing the acid were in all cases protected from
  the light. One tube was then <U+FB01>lled with dry chlorine and the
 acid up to the index was saturated with the gas.
     The chlorine used in this and subsequent experiments was
  prepared by the action of hydrochloric acid on potassium bichro
  mate; traces of hydrochloric acid were removed by passing
  the gas through U-tubes containing solutions of chromic acid,

and subsequently dried by means of sulphuric acid.                              In
order to determine the actinic intensity of the light, amodi<U+FB01>ed
form of Bunsen and Roscoe’s pendulum-actinometer was
used (Trans. Roy. Soc. 1862, p. 139) ; in this method paper
coated with silver chloride is exposed to light, and the time
required to produce a degree of darkening equal to a standard
tint is measured. The intensity of light necessa                         to pro
duce this tint in one second of time is taken as'the unit of
intensity. The measurements were made in the open air,
care being taken that the air- and chlorine-tubes were ex
posed to light in the same plane as the sensitive paper.
When the maximum expansion of the chlorine was reached at
any one time, as shown by the index remaining stationary,
the intensity of the light was measured by exposing the sen
sitive paper. Two series of observations were made under
widely different conditions of light; one on June 8, which
was a cloud day, the other on June 9, on which the sun was
shining. T e results of these measurements are given in the

   In column I. the intensity of the light is given as measured
by the actinometer. In column [1. the expansion of the
chlorine, as shown by the movement of the index from zero,
is given in centimetres ; the zero~point, which was determined
from time to time by shading the tubes, was found to remain
nearly stationary throughout. The calculated intensity, in
terms of the movement of the index through 1 centim., is
given in column 111., and from the mean value so obtained
the intensity is recalculated in terms of the observed ex
pansion (column IV.). In making these observations great
dif<U+FB01>culty was experienced owing to the constant variation in
the intensity of the light; and as the maximum movement
of the index was only reached after some time, these sudden
variations, which were registered accurately by the actino
meter, did not produce a corresponding change in the position
of the index.     The close agreement between the results ob
tained directly by the actinometer and those calculated from
the expansion of the gas lead, however, to the conclusion that
the change in volume in chlorine gas is directly proportional
to the actinic intensity of the light to which it is exposed,
although the friction of the acid in the gauge tends to smooth
out the more sudden variations.
   By the aid of such a differential apparatus as that above
described, to which the name of “ chlorine actinometer ” may
be applied, the intensity of the light can be read directly from
the gauge, and it is thus found possible to study other light
effects under constant conditions of intensity by making
exposures whenever the index stands at a given point.
   It was next necessary to inquire how far dilution with air
in<U+FB02>uenced the amount of expansion of chlorine when exposed
to light. To do this a differential apparatus, shown in <U+FB01>g. 1,
Plate 111., was used, in which the gas to be exposed was con
tained in the tubes A and B, 15 centim. in length and about
3 centim. in diameter.    Two glass stop-cocks, C and D, were
sealed on to A, the lower one, D, being connected with a
graduated pipette E containing air and dipping under strong
sulphuric acid contained in F. The graduated capillary tube
G was <U+FB01>lled with strong sulphuric acid, as also the bulbs
H and I, the movement of a short column of air serving to
indicate an change in volume in either tube.        The tube A
was <U+FB01>rst     lled with chlorine, whilst B contained dry air
throu bout the experiment. Both tubes were then exposed
to lig t and the expansion of the chlorine determined, the
intensity of the light being at the same time noted by means
of the chlorine actinometer ; the tubes were then shaded and
the zero-point found. The stop-cocks C and D were then

Volume of acid was caused to rise in E, thus forcing an equal
Volume ‘of air into A. Chlorine being expelled at C ; O and
D were then closed, and, after the gas had thoroughly mixed,
the tubes were again exposed to light of the same intensity
as in'the <U+FB01>rst case: this process was repeated until all the
chlorine was replaced by air. Knowing the capacity of A
and the proportion of air introduced at each operation, the
amount of chlorine could be calculated. Two series of ex
periments were made under different conditions of light, the
intensity for each series remaining nearly constant. The
results are given in the next table.

  282         Dr. A. Richardson on the Measurement of the
  on again exposing the tube to light, after two days, an ex
  pansion of 5 centim. occurred. This is a point of some im
  portance where the expansion of chlorine as against air is
  made a measure of the actinic intensity of li ht, as the
  diffusion of chlorine from the sulphuric acid into the air-bulb
  would introduce a gradually increasing source of error".
      As it seemed possible that the sensitiveness of chlorine to
  light might be in<U+FB02>uenced by the temperature of the gas
  during exposure, an experiment was made in which the two
  tubes A and B, <U+FB01>g. 2, Plate 111., were <U+FB01>lled with chlorine,
  these were connected together by a tube which could be
  closed by means of a stop-cock F ; changes in volume being
  measured as before by means of the gauge 0 containing sul
  phuric acid and bubbles of air. The tube A was kept at a
  temperature of 14° C. by a current of water circulating
  through the outer tube D, whilst B was heated in the jacketing
  tube G G, by the vapour from chlorobenzene boiling in E at a
  temperature of 132° C. The pressure in the two tubes was at
  <U+FB01>rst equalized by opening the stop-cock F; and when the
  temperature was constant in the two tubes (as shown by the
  index remaining stationary when F was closed), the tubes
  were alternately exposed to and shaded from the light. The
  following is the mean of a series of experiments made :—
        Both tubes shaded, zero = O.
        Heated tubes exposed         = 6'0 centim. expansion.
        Both tubes shaded, zero = O.
        Cooled tubes exposed         = 6'7 centim. expansion.
        Both tubes shaded, zero = O.
  In the heated tube the illumination of the gas was interfered
  with by the partial refraction of the light, due to the con
  densation of the chlorobenzene on the sides of the jacketing
  tube, and further it is possible that the vapour of chlorobenzene
  may absorb a portion of the actinic rays. This probably
  accounted for the slight difference observed in the expansion
  of the gas in the two tubes. From this experiment it is
  concluded that the expansion of chlorine by light is practically
  unaffected within a range of temperature between 14° and
  138° 0.
     Having made these preliminary experiments, an apparatus
  was next devised whereby the automatic registration of the
. actinic intensity of light was effected by the expansion of
  chlorine. This was done by suspending a differential appa

  ratus on the beam of a balance in such a manner that the
  <U+FB02>ow of acid from one arm to the other produced a movement
  of the beam, which was communicated by means of a lever to
  a pen and was recorded on a rotating drum.
     As has already been stated, a differential actinometer, con
  taining air in one bulb and chlorine in the other, gradually
  becomes inaccurate owing to the diffusion of chlorine into the
  air-bulb. This dif<U+FB01>culty is avoided in the apparatus shown
 in <U+FB01>g. 3, Plate 111., which consists of two differential arrange
 ments A B C D and E F G H, suspended on the beam of the
 balance I ; one is completely <U+FB01>lled with dry chlorine, the tubes
 B and D being half <U+FB01>lled with strong sulphuric acid saturated
 with the gas. The second contains dry air with sulphuric
 acid in F and H. One of the chlorine-bulbs A and one of
 the air-bulbs E are exposed to light, whilst the other chlorine
 bulb C and air-bulb G are protected from the light by a covering
 of tin-foil, and hang in the box J, in which the two bulbs
 can swing freely. It will be seen that when A and E are
 exposed to the heating-effects of sunlight, the expansion of
 the gas in A causes acid to <U+FB02>ow from B to D, whilst a.
 corresponding expansion in E causes an equal weight of acid
 to <U+FB02>ow from H to F. But the chlorine in A undergoes a
 further expansion, due to the actinic rays, causing an
 additional weight of acid to pass from B to D. A movement
 of the beam is thus produced which is communicated to the
 lever M, and is registered by means of a pen on a strip of
curve-paper rotating on the drum N. The capacity of the
 bulbs A and E in this case is 273 cub. centim., that of G
and C 319 cub. centim.; the tubes B and F and D and Hare
 l5 centim. long and 1'25 centim. in diameter, the distance
 between the two sets of tubes being 35 centim. It is found
desirable that the movement of the bulbs and beam should
be as small as possible, and that the effect should be magni<U+FB01>ed
 by increasing the length of the lever. After the apparatus
is blown together, care must be taken to remove all moisture
by drawing dry air through the bulbs and tubes. The
apparatus is exposed out of doors in a wooden box G, <U+FB01>g. 4,
Plate 111., the bulbs A and B passing through a hole in the
lid; these are protected by a glass shade, C, 45 centim. high
and 20 centim. in diameter; this is mounted in a block of
wood, D, so that when the box is in its normal position, the
axis of the cylindrical shade points to the pole star.   The two
bulbs occupy a position equidistant from the sides of the
shade and about midway between the top and bottom. The

exposing them to intense sunlight : it was found that, although
the temperature within the shade varied from 15° to 40° (1.,
the compensation was so complete that practically no deviation
from the straight line, described by the pen on the drum,
was observed ; the bulbs were <U+FB01>xed to the beam (as nearly as
possible over the point of support) by means of cylinders of
thin sheet-brass, which were slipped over the acid tubes and
screwed to the beam. The instrument was calibrated by
means of the silver-chloride aotinometer. The result of six

 VXXXVI. On the Electri<U+FB01>cation of Steel Needle-Points in Air.
-                        By A. P. Onxrrocx *.
                                [Plate V.]
  ‘§ 1. ,AS Faraday long ago put it, the discharge of electricity
              from a point into a gas may be looked upon as a
  particular case of sparking between a conductor (the point)
  and a non-conductor (the surrounding gas). It is, moreover,
  a particularly interesting form of discharge, as compared
  with that taking place between two conductors, from the fact
  that it seems more likely to throw light on the unsymmetrical
  behaviour of positive and negative electricity. For there is
  evidence which points to the surface of the electrode as the
  origin of that want of symmetry ; and by experimenting
  with one electrode only, one is able to a certain extent to
  separate its effect on positive electricity from that on negative :
  vsuch separation being impossible in the case of sparks be_
,tween two conductors, as both effects are there necessarily
   present together.
      The phenomena connected with discharge from points group
   themselves naturally under two heads :—Those occurring be
   fore or at the beginning of discharge; and those occurring
   during the passage of electricity from the point. What
  ,follows refers to the <U+FB01>rst of these divisions only.        _
      § 2. When ,an earth-connected sewing-needle is placed
   with its end facing the centre of an insulated metal plate,
  [and the latter is gradually electri<U+FB01>ed, there comes a point at
  which the needle begins to discharge onto the plate. This
  .point, for given conditions, is very de<U+FB01>nite, and corresponds
   to a breaking down of some resistance between the needle and
   the plate.   It seemed desirable to discover how much of the
   dielectric was concerned in this process. Forthis purpose
  _measurements were made of the strength of the electrostatic
  <U+FB01>eld at the surface of the needle-point at the instant that dis
   charge occurred, the distance of the plate from the needle
   being varied from 0'04 centim. to 5 centim., while the needle
   ,was suspended in such a_manner (§ 8) that the attraction
    between it and the plate could be determined.           _
      Now the attraction is due of course to the tension in the
   lines of force which end at the surface of the needle; and
   sincetheir direction is everywhere normal to the surtace, it
   ,follows that if the needle be a true cylinder placed sym
    metrically with regard to the plate, the mechanical pulls of
                    '1' Communicated by the Author.

 286         Mr. A. P. Chattock on the Electri<U+FB01>cation
 the lines of force upon its sides will balance, and the needle
 will be urged towards the plate with a force which depends
 only on the lines ending at its point (its other end being
 shielded from induction).      Moreover, so long as the distance
 from the point to the plate is greater than a few times the
 diameter of the point, the distribution of electricity on the
 latter will be practically independent of that distance; and
 the strength of the electrostatic <U+FB01>eld just in front of the point
 will thus come to be proportional to the square root of the
 mechanical pull on the point. The needle becomes in fact its
 own electrometer, and measures the difference of potential
 between its point and the air a short distance from it.
    In Table l. the values of the square root of the pull (P) in
 dynes on the point of a <U+FB01>ne* sewing-needle at the instant of
 discharge are given for various distances (d) in centimetres
 between its point and a metal plate. The constancy of VP
 speaks for itself.                                    '
   It is true that an ordinary sewing-needle is not a perfect
cylinder, but tapers gradually to its point, so that part of P
 must be due to lines of force on its sides ; but this must be
very small, for the density of charge on the sides is small
'compared with that at the point, and the force per square
 centimetre is proportional to the square of the density ; and
in addition to this, the force on the sides has to be resolved
into a direction almost at right angles to itself before it can
aifect P. Indeed, the very constancy of P, when d is varied,
may be regarded as evidence that this part of P is negligible.
(Other reasons are given in § 3.)
   The two needles A and B on which the measurements were
made were numbered alike by the makers, and the agreement
in the values of VF for the' two is fairly close. This is the
more satisfactory as the readings were taken under somewhat
different conditions. The needle A was suspended in the
larger of the two instruments described in § 8. It discharged
onto a disk of tin 13 centim. in diameter, with its edge pro
tected by a ring of thick wire. The disk and the inside of
the instrument were covered with a thin <U+FB01>lm of vaseline.
The readings on B were taken with the small instrument.
The disk in this case was a penny with its surface ground and
polished. N0 vaseline was used.
   The positive values of VP for the two needles differ by
about 3 per cent., whereas the negative values differ by 10
per cent. This is worth pointing out, as it is in accordance
with what appears to be a general rule, viz., that the positive

discharge is more constant and stable than the negative, and
far less dependent on the condition of the discharging point.

the constancy of the discharge <U+FB01>eld at the point. In terms

 <U+FB01>ne a needle is rather uncertain, as it tapers towards the
 point. Measured under a microscope it seems to lie between
  1'9 x 10"3 and 2'3 x 10"3 centim. Taking the mean of these
 numbers, one obtains the value of the <U+FB01>eld of force f close in
 front of the point

     The highest measured value of f for discharge in air is, I
  believe, that obtained by Dr. Liebig for sparks between plates
  (Phil. Mag. July 1887, p. 106), viz. 400 E.S. units for a
  spark-length of 0'0066 centim. This is much less than
  either of the above numbers, but the length of discharge at
  the point is probably much less than 00066 centim. The
  aesults may, moreover, be veri<U+FB01>ed by calculation from potential
    ata.                                                          '
     Although the value of f is so large at the surface of the
  needle-point, the lines of force diverge rapidly, and at a very
  short distance from the point the <U+FB01>eld becomes inappreciab'le.
   In other words, there occurs within this short distance a step
   of potential (v) which, if theypoint is hemispherical and small,
   may be taken as equal to g , where Q is twice the charge on
   the hemisphere (Q, as already assumed, being uniformly dis
   tributed over the point).                                        a

     The column headed V in Table I. givesthe difference of
 pptential in E.S. units between the needle and the plate.
 _ 0w, except for the presence of the needle itself, the <U+FB01>eld of
 force in which it was placed would have consisted of parallel
 lines ; for the point of the needle was arranged in this experi
 ment to project 3 or 4 millim. beyond a <U+FB02>at screen of tin-foil
 through a small hole in it, and the distance from the tin-foil
 to the disk (a penny) onto which the needle discharged was
small compared with the diameter of the disk, so long as the
 value of d was less, say, than a centimetre. Even with the
 needle in position, the <U+FB01>eld would be disturbed for a very
 small distance only round about the point, on account of the
 extreme smallness of the latter.       Hence V may be regarded
 as consisting of two parts—one constant (viz. v) and occurring
 in a small space close to the point ; the other proportionalto
 d for small values of d.
     Taking the mean of the values of V for each value of d,
 we obtain the numbers plotted with d in Curves I. The
 upper curve is for positive discharge, the lower for negative.
  Up to a distance of somethin .less than a centimetre from
  point to plate, the values of      lie very fairly on the straight
 lines ruled through them. V—aconstant is thus proportional to
  d ; and the values of the constants are of course to be found
 where the ruled lines cut the axis of V._ These points are
  hardly distinguishable from the values (which are marked by
  crosses) of the step of potential at the point calculated above
  from P (viz. 4'5 and 3'3). They show indeed a slight
  tendency to exceed these values ; but the agreement is
  certainly striking, considering the complete independence of
  the two methods of measurement.

290            Mr. A. P. Chattock on the Electrification
   The small amount (3 to 6 per cent.) by which the potential
step calculated from V exceeds that calculated from P
may be accounted for, I think, by the fact that the lines
of force from the needle-point do not diverge quite as
rapidly as calculation supposed.           The parallel lines of the
rest of the <U+FB01>eld keep them together and so increase the real
step of potential at the point without altering P in pro
portion. To test this point I measured P for a needle of
about the same size as B, <U+FB01>rst suspending it in a parallel <U+FB01>eld,
and then with its point at the centre of curvature of a spherical
cup. In the <U+FB01>rst case, VP was about 3 or 4 per cent. less
than in the second; showing, as it seems to me in the light
of what follows, that, in the arallel <U+FB01>eld, f at the point was
nearer the average value of t e <U+FB01>eld through a small distance
from the point surface than in the radial <U+FB01>eld of the second
case; and to about the same amount that the above dis
crepancy requires.
   This accounts, moreover, for the fact that needle B is the
only one which does not agree with the results of Table II.
Its constant (f x ro'a) being 15'5 at a pressure of 76 centim.
   As regards the measurement of potential in the above, the
electrometer described in § 8 was used; its constant being
determined by comparison with short sparks between brass

   The values of V were taken from Dr. Liebig’s paper al
ready referred to.
   I think, then, it may be safely concluded that the attraction
of a plate on a needle-point is practically due only to the lines
of force ending at its point——even when the needle is not a.
perfect cylinder ; for a conical point could only have the effect
of increasing P and so making the step of potential calculated

from it bigger than that from V, whereas the reverse is the
case. It is true that the density must be greater at the centre
of the point than at the sides of the hemisphere. But this is
what P chie<U+FB02>y depends upon, and it is also precisel here that
discharge occurs and the value of f is required. Ilence the
connexion established above between P and f seems to be
practically true, although the assumption that f is uniform
over the point-surface is not.
   In what follows, therefore, the values of f have in every
case been determined from P and r.
            Efect of Curvature qf Discharging Surface.
    § 4. Two conclusions appear, then, to result from the fore
going. In the <U+FB01>rst place, the absence of discharge below a
certain de<U+FB01>nite potential, which is constant for given con
ditions, implies the breaking down of some resistance before
electricity can pass off at a point ; and, secondly, the fact that
f is independent of at points to the near neighbourhood or
actual surface of the point as the seat of this resistance.
   All this is in accordance with what is known regarding the
discharge of electricity in gases, and is indeed only what one
would naturally have expected. It still remains to consider
whether the resistance to discharge is to be sought in the gas
itself, in the surface of the point, or in both.
   The possible ways in which resistance may arise are, I
think, all to be included under three heads :—
    (a) It may exist in the gas itself, to a greater than mole
cular distance from the point. For this the gas must become
possessed of something in the nature of structure round about
the point      e. cease to be gas in the ordinary sense of the
word), and the only kind of structure that suggests itself as
likely is that of the polarized Grotthuss chains which Prof.
J. J. Thomson has used with such effect in his beautiful theory
of striae.
   (b) It may exist at the surface of the metal only, and con
sist in the tearing away from the point by electrical force of
electri<U+FB01>ed particles which are clinging to it (a special case of
which is the forcing of charged particles through a non
conducting layer on the point).
   (0) Or it may mean the pulling off of something in the
nature of a <U+FB01>lm possessing surface-tension.
   As a matter of fact (b) and (c) are two opposite extremes
of the same phenomenon. In both, particles adhering to the
point are pulled off—but the adhesion of (b) is normal to the
surface only, i. e. between the particles and the metal ;

  292        Mr. A. P. Chattock on the Electri<U+FB01>cation
  while in     it is tangential‘to the surface only ; i. e. between
  the particles themselves. An actual case would lie some
  where between the two; and probably much nearer to (b)
 than to (0).
     Now in the case (a) of Grotthuss chains the <U+FB01>eld f at the
  point, as measured by the pull up0n it, should increase as the
  sharpness of the point increases; and for two reasons.         In
 the <U+FB01>rst place, for chains of given length there will be some
  average strength of <U+FB01>eld required to break them, the value
 of which will always be less than that measured at the
 surface of the point on account of the divergence of the lines
 of force there ; and the difference between the measured and
 the average <U+FB01>eld will be more marked as the divergence (2'. e.
 the sharpness of the point) increases.       Secondly, the chains
 will be shorter at a sharp point than at a blunt one on ac
 count of this same divergence ; and this again will necessitate
 a stronger <U+FB01>eld to break them, for much the same reason that
 a short piece of iron is harder to magnetize than a long one.
    The same sort of variation off with sharpness of point willv
 occur in the case of (c), if the mechanical pull of the <U+FB01>eld on
 the point surface be looked on as having to tear off a <U+FB01>lm
stretched over it.
    But to pull small particles off a point whose radius of
curvature is large compared with their diameters will always
 require the same value of          Hence (b) differs from (a) and
 (c) in requiring that f shall be independent of r.
    The effect on f of altering r was therefore investigated.
j$teel needles were ground by a watchmaker to hemispherical
 points of different diameters and burnished with a hard steel
 tool.   The values of f in air were then determined for each at
various pressures ; the instrument used being the smaller of
the two described in § 8. Curves connecting air-pressure (p)
'and f were then plotted, and from these the numbers given in
 Table II. were taken. The values off for positive discharge
are given for three pressures :——76, 40, and 20 centim. of
Imercury. Those for negative discharge are Only given at
.20 centim. The reason being that the latter show a good
 deal of irregularity at higher pressures, seeming (as will be
seen later) to depend largely on the condition of the point
surface, which the positive values do not. The values of f
(for needle 0 are inserted with queries, as they are almost
certainly too high; The extreme <U+FB01>neness of its point necessi
tated a Very rapid tapering to the sharpest part, so that a good
deal of the measured pull must have been due to lines of force
starting from its sides. This is borne out by the numbers in
the four last columns.            '      >    '      i   -  '     '

    Now these columns show that below a point-radius of
millim._f varies in close proportion with F“, and they con
sequently negative hypothesis (6). But they also negative
 (0), for the pull per square centim. normal to. a <U+FB01>lm of sur
 face-tension T and radius of curvature 'r necessary to break it
 is proportional to T/r, and if this pull is to be supplied by f
it follows that f2 must be proportional to T/r, which gives
 —O'5 instead of —0'8 as the power of r with which f varies.
Even -—0'5 is higher than can be assumed,f0r it is calculated on
the supposition that there is no cohesion between the <U+FB01>lm and
the point, and the existence of cohesion would still further
reduce the power of r, as tending to bring the <U+FB01>lm nearer to
class (1)).
    Resistance to discharge at a point is thus to be found in
the surrounding gas, and is therefore practically reduced to
the breaking down of Grotthuss chains, the lengths of which
 are not negligible compared with the radius of curvature of
the point. I do not mean by this to exclude surface-resistance
as a possible factor in discharge—indeed what follows shows
that it may be very appreciable ; but it is not the whole, nor
I believe an important part, of the resistance at a clean point.
      5. After a point has been used for discharge for some
time its resistance greatly increases, and when discharge
occurs it begins with a suddenness and violence which is very
suggestive of the bursting of a <U+FB01>lm. The effect is increased
if the point he now reburnished (without regrinding), though
this process makes it look as if it had never been used. For
instance, Curves II. are those connecting the pressures of
the air with f for needle H. The continuous curve AB re
presents f at the commencement of positive discharge, CI)
being for negative. The readings for these <U+FB01>ve curves were
taken alternately, two at a time, the pressure being gradually
increased.     They correspond to an unused clean needle. The
cloud of points (Q) for positive and x for negative discharge)
was obtained on attempting to repeat the curves, and it was
noticeable    that each
though the needle    was well
                         repetition
                              polished
                                    increased   the values of
                                        on dry wash-leather  and
rou e each time.      Afterwards the needle was reburnished,
and the dotted curves E F (+) and GH (—) obtained, show
ing a still further increase of f and no less irregularity in its
values than before.
    The above, therefore, furnishes evidence of the growth of
resistance at a point when it is used.     That the current does
not permanently clear the formation away in getting through
is obvious from the readings ; but if a reading be taken
quickly after another with a point in this condition, the

                 of Steel Needle-Points in Air.              295
second value of f is often slightly lower than the <U+FB01>rst; as if
the <U+FB01>lm had not had time to <U+FB01>nish forming again after the
<U+FB01>rst discharge. Now if this were so it would follow that the
value of f, when the current stops, should be less than when
it starts (for a used point only ; the two values agree closely
for a clean one). To test this needle H was again taken and
the values of f determined for various air-pressures at the
point when the current just stopped, the potential of the
 needle being gradually diminished until a high-resistance
(7000 (0) Elliot galvanometer between the needle and the
earth stood at zero. The results are given in Curves III. ;
 A B and C D for the unused point are repeated from Curves II.
 for comparison. J K and LM are the new curves. They
 are marked by circles. The agreement between J K and A B
 could not be closer, and points unmistakably to a temporary
 cleaning of the point while current is <U+FB02>owing. LM, for
 negative discharge, is very curious—coinciding as it does
 with CD at low pressures, while it leaves it so completely
 higher up. It was noticeable that just in proportion as the
 two curves diverged, the stoppage of the current was marked
 by increasing suddenness. At high ressures it was impossible
 to get the needle to discharge at all with a small current ;
 either the <U+FB02>ow was strong or it stopped altogether with a
jerk—the same effect, though almost microscopic, being just
 perceptible at the cessation of positive discharge also. This
 being so, it follows that the values off on the negative curve
 really correspond to a strong current and not to the point
 where the current stops. Hence their greater values. The
 sudden cutting off of the negative current was ver striking,
 and suggested rather forcibly the covering over 0 the point
 by some sort of <U+FB01>lm that had been perforated by it.        It is
 true that the positive discharge was hardly affected, but this
 is only an example of what has been already alluded to—the
 relatively greater instability of negative than of positive dis
 char e.
    Although the silent discharge from a point does not appear
 to have the power of permanently clearing away surface
 resistance, sparks do so readily enough—though under suitable
circumstances they will also form it again. In making the
 measurements on needle B (Table 1.), the discharge at the
 last recorded (+) reading took the form of a spark. VP
 was here 1'59. Cu repeating the reading it had risen to 1‘95.
 A third discharge brought it back to 1'62, and after that it
 continued to oscillate between these two values for some 20 or
 30 times with hardly a break in the regularity. Obviously
 one spark formed a resistance and the next blew it away

296           Mr. A. P. Chattock on the Electmy‘ieatz'on .
again. The character of the sparks was quite different too.
The one which formed the resistance was thin and sharply
de<U+FB01>ned, and spread out for a considerable distance over the
plate like a. splash. The other was much brighter, straight,
and without any signs of a de<U+FB01>ned edge.
    While, however, the above is evidence of the existence of
surface-resistance at used points, the fact that the values of f
at beginning and end of discharge are practically identical
for'a clean point for both positive and negative electricity,
may be regarded as showing that such resistance is either
Zery small or non-existent on points which have not been used
  efore.

    § 6. Assuming, then, provisionally that cohesion in Grotthuss
chains is the sole cause of the resistance offered to discharge
at a clean point, and that gas atoms are consequently .con
earned in carrying the electricity when it does ~go“, there
arises the interesting question as to the amount of charge
carried by each atom; and one is tempted to see whether
the above measurements throw any light on it. With
out in any way pretending to settle the point, the following
considerations seem to me to render it probable that the
electrochemical equivalent of gas atoms is of the same order
of magnitude as that of the same atoms in electrol tes.
    The essence of a Grotthuss chain is that it shal consist of
molecules capable of being split into two parts, one of which
is charged after the split with positive electricity and the'
other with negative. These charges may exist separately in
the molecules to start with, or they may be induced by an
electrostatic <U+FB01>eld—but in either case it is the <U+FB01>eld which
subsequently arranges them in chains; and the breaking
down of the chains occurs when the mechanical pull of the
<U+FB01>eld on the charged parts is suf<U+FB01>cient to overcome their
mutual af<U+FB01>nity. This af<U+FB01>nity may be due to one of two causes
or their combination. Either it is (a) the electrical attraction
of two initial charges, or it is (b) a cohesive attraction without
any previously existing charges, or it is (0) both. One of
these three it must be, if by cohesive attraction is understood
the sum of all nonelectrical forces between the two parts of
the molecule.                                              -
    Consider the <U+FB01>rst (a) of these cases. If the molecules hold
   it This does not preclude the possibility of metal dust in the discharge

 the lines between the pairs of atoms signifying lines of
 electrostatic force. A chain of such molecules will give way
 when it is put in a <U+FB01>eld of force just stron enough to redis
 tribute the charges by induction so that ialfas many lines
 pass between A and B, C and D, &c. as before; and the
 remainder pass between B and C, D and E, &c.          This state
 of things may be represented thus :—
 Putin another way, the strength of the <U+FB01>eld which will do
 this is rather greater than that which would induce on each
 of the two end atoms of the chain half their assumed initial
 charges, supposing them to be connected by a <U+FB01>ne conducting
 wire.    It depends thus on the length of the chain, being
 greater as the chain is shorter.
    In the case (b), a constant cohesive a<U+FB01>inity between the
two parts of the molecule, it is necessary to suppose that e1ec-'
tricity can pass from one to the other under the in<U+FB02>uence of
induction when they are put in a <U+FB01>eld of forceJ in order that
after separation they may be oppositely charged. The fol
lowing <U+FB01>gure shows a chain of such molecules on the point of
             +      :0         0:0         ¢=0        6
breaking down, the break occurring when the cohesive forces
(W) are just overcome by the electrical forces (a) set
up by the <U+FB01>eld. Here, again, the longer the chain the weaker
the <U+FB01>eld required to break it ; and as the cohesive forces are
constant, and the electrical forces are dependent, for given
molecular arrangement, only on the charges induced in the
molecules, it follows that these charges will also be practically
constant, no matter what the length of the chain may be.
    In both these cases, therefore, for all lengths of chain, the
atomic charges at the breaking-point are constant; in case (6)
being rather less than such as would be induced by the <U+FB01>eld
on the end atoms, supposing the latter to be connected by a
conductor ; and in case (a) less than twice that amount (less,
because the chain is not a continuous conductor).           Their

values might thus be calculated in terms off if the geome
trical conditions were known. This, however, is not the case
under the conditions of actual experiment ; but by arranging
that the chains shall consist of single molecules only, it is
possible to get an idea of the magnitude of the charge in
question. Reduce in imagination the discharging-point to
molecular dimensions; and <U+FB01>nd, by what is rather violent
extrapolation, the corresponding value off at discharge from
the constant in Table II. The Grotthuss chains will have
been reduced to single molecules by the reduction of the
point, and by supposing them to be spheres the + and —
charges induced on their opposite sides may be calculated.
These charges will then represent in the case of (a) half, and
in the case of (b) the whole of the atomic charge.

the atomic charge) because it is calculated from measurements
on chains of many molecules, which, as was pointed out above,
are not conductors, but only lines of high SIC. Now the
most probable value of the ionic charge of oxygen is 10-“,
which, considering the extent of the extrapolation and the fact
that the above number is too great, is in suf<U+FB01>ciently striking
agreement with it. It is at any rate satisfactory that the ex
perimental number is the larger of the two.
   It is interesting to see whether a similar result is to be got
from measurements of sparks between plates. Taking Dr.
Liebig’s numbers above referred to, I <U+FB01>nd, following Prof.
J. J. Thomson, that the formula f: (,l+150 expresses the
results for the smallest spark-lengths in air fairly well, con
sidering that the numbers for that part _of the curve are rather
irregular. The values of a lie between 1'9 and 1'4 for the

Extrapolating for a distance between the plates of %X 10‘“,
the <U+FB01>eld between them comes to be 4 x 108. This would induce
a still higher charge (8 X 10-9) on a spherical molecule ; but
it must be remembered that these data are much further
removed from molecular dimensions than mine.
    On the other hand, there is a case accessible of what may
perhaps be called discharge between plates, which takes place
actually within molecular dimensions : I mean the passage of
electricity at the cathode of a voltameter. Here, if a step
of potential of, say, 1 volt be assumed, and iff stand for the
corresponding <U+FB01>eld between the liquid and the metal of the
cathode,

This is capable of inducing on a spherical molecule charges
of 1'5 x 10‘H E.S., a number which cannot be distinguished
from the ionic charge. Moreover, no reduction is necessary
here as the data of calculation are from measurements made
direct on single molecules.
    Taking, then, these three calculations together, and having
regard to the fact that the nearer the conditions of experiment
approach molecular arrangement the closer are the results to
the value of the ionic charge, I cannot help thinking that they
furnish strong grounds for supposing that electri<U+FB01>ed atoms in
gases are associated with the same quantity of electricity as
111 electrolysis.
    As regards the third possibility of molecular cohesion (c)
mentioned above, that it is due to a combination of (a) and
(b), it is impossible, without knowing the relative values of
the two forces at work, to get any idea of the atomic charge
from the value of        All that can be said is that it will be less
than the value calculated for atoms held together by electrical
attraction only. Even in this case, therefore, there is nothing
to negative the presence of ionic charges in gaseous conduction.

    § 7. If the conclusions arrived at above be correct, one
 may picture a metal point on the verge of discharging as a
 smooth curved conducting surface studded all over with
 Grotthuss chains standing up on it like bristles. The density
 of charge upon it will thus be far from uniform.      It will reach
a maximum at the root of each chain, the quantity collected
there being constant for a given gas, independent of the length
 of the chain, and equal perhaps to the ionic charge of the gas
 atoms. In between the chains the density will be much less.

    Now the <U+FB01>eld (f) measured by the attraction of a plate ona
needle-point is the average number of lines of force per square
centimetre of the point-surface, and takes no account of the
manner in which they are distributed over it. (This is because
the pointis so smallthat the lines have room to become uniformly
spread out before they reach the plate.) Hence it follows
that, for different dispositions of the chains, the measured
values off may be very different, and yet the number of lines
of force running through each chain be the constant number
corresponding to ionic charge on its atoms. f, in fact, for a
given amount of induction per chain, depends both on the
 length and on the closeness of the chains.            Great length or
great closeness, or both, means that the greater part of the
lines proceeding from the point have been absorbed by the
 chains, hardly any passin       in between them.           In this case
f is practically proportiona to the number of chains per square
centimetre and is independent of their lengths. On the other
 hand, very short chains, or very few to the square centimetre,
 or both, mean that f is sensibly independent of their closeness,
 but is now dependent on their length; being inversely pro
 portional thereto so long as it is not very great compared with
 the radius of curvature of the point. Between these two
 extremes f depends both on length and on closeness of the
 chains—varying in an inverse manner with the former, and in
 a direct manner with the latter.             '
    Now both length and closeness of the chains increase with
 increase of gas-pressure.     Hence there must be some pressure
A above which f is sensibly proportional to the closeness of
 the chains only, and some lower pressure B below which it
 is inversely proportional to the chain-lengths only.             In the
 neighbourhood of A increase of pressure will affect f chie<U+FB02>y
 by the resulting alteration of the closeness, and will therefore
 increase      Near B it will have the opposite effect, as increase
 in the length of the chains means a decrease of                  Hence
'between A and B there must be some pressure for which f is
 a minimum. This point is of course well known to exist*,
 though I was unable to obtain a su<U+FB02>iciently good vacuum
 with my apparatus to reach it. If, however, f be expressed
 in terms of some power (n) of the pressure, n will be 0 at the
 minimum point, and positive and increasing as the pressure rises
 from there. This increase is shown well in Table III. (calculated
 from Table II. for positive discharge only—the negative is
too uncertain). Here n, is calculated from the values off
 corresponding to 76 and 40 centim. of mercury, and n, for
 40 and 20 centim.      n, is in every case less than n1.

     The needle marked X was in reality a steel ball used
 for bicycle-bearings. This was put opposite a tin disk of
  6 centim. diameter at a distance of 3'6 centim. n was calcu
 lated from measurements of the difference of potential between
 ball and plate, as f could not be measured. The values of 12
 <U+FB01>t in well with the rest. (n1 was calculated in this case from
f at 40 and 60 centim. mercury.)
    Now pressure alters the length and closeness of the chains
 at the same time ; but, for a given <U+FB01>eld-strength at a point
 surface, alteration in curvature gives rise to alteration of
 chain-length only, the length being less as the point gets
 sharper. Hence at a sharp point f is more dependent on the
 length of the chains than at a blunt one ; it is in fact nearer
 its minimum value, and n is consequently less. This, too, is
 shown very clearly in Table III.
    A pretty illustration of the in<U+FB02>uence of point curvature on n
 was accidentally met with in the case of needle C. In getting
it into the apparatus for repetition of the curves obtained with
it, its point came against the metal box and was <U+FB02>attened
slightly to a width of about 3'6 x 10'3 centim. The values of
n, and n2 obtained from it after this were respectively 0'42
and 0'30, instead of 0'31 and 0'2 for the <U+FB01>ner point.
    Grotthuss chains, coupled with constant atomic charge, are
thus well able to explain most of the phenomena described in
this paper.   There still remains one which is perhaps the most
important of all—the difference in the behaviour of positive
and negative discharge. This I hope to discuss in connexion
with experiments now in progress, but it may perhaps be well
to place on record the results so far obtained.

   These are given in Table IV., where lc is the ratio at a pres
sure of 20 centim. of f for positive discharge to f for negative.
The ratio shows a distinct tendency to decrease as r increases.
It is almost useless to give values at higher pressures on
account of the uncertainty as to the condition of the point,
and the great effect this may have on the negative discharge
 (Curves III.) ; but the ratio is distinctly less at higher
pressures for points which seemed quite clean : the decrease
of k at 70 centim. mercury varying from 3 to 8 per cent. as
compared with k at 20 centim. For dirty points the decrease
may reach 50 per cent.

   § 8. The electrometer used for potential measurements was
constructed on the principle of the one designed some years
ago, for absolute measurement of much smaller quantities,.by
Prof. Minchin. The attracted disk is suspended, and the force
of attraction measured by tilting the whole instrument until
the disk falls back by its weight to a <U+FB01>xed point. The disk
is a sheet of mica, covered on one side with tin-foil and metal
lically connected with the case of the instrument, which is a
tin cylindrical box 30 centim. long by 30 centim. diameter.
The disk hangs just outside a 3-inch hole in a tin screen at
one end of the case, and opposite the hole inside the case is
an adjustable disk of tin which forms the attracting plate.
The sensitiveness of the instrument may be varied very greatly
by altering the distance between this plate and the suspended
disk. This arrangement does not of course permit of absolute
measurement, but it was thought that calibration in terms of
spark-lengths was suf<U+FB01>ciently accurate for the work in hand.

                            The same principle of tilting was used in measuring the

the place of the suspended disk. The zero-position was deter

XXXVII. On the Relation between the Density and Composition
    ofDilute Sulphuric Acid.     By A. W. RUCKER, F.R.S.*
SOME time ago I had occasion to examine closely Mr.
      Pickering’s method of detecting breaks in curves re
presenting the results of experiments, and in consequence of
the recent controversy on the subject I have lately reconsidered
the matter.
   Mr. Pickering’s work covers a wide area, and he cannot
complain if those who study his method devote themselves
particularly to some one application of it.
   I have specially investigated the curve which expresses
between 46 per cent. and 80 per cent. the relation at 18°
between the percentage strength of the solution and the
“ <U+FB01>rst differential” of the densities.
   This was chosen on two grounds. First, because it in
cludes within its range the percentage corresponding to the
hydrate which Mr. Pickering has isolated. Secondly, because,
although Mr. Pickering estimates the magnitude of the
possible error of observation to be greater at 18° than at
other temperatures, the agreement between his curves and
                    “ Communicated by the Author.

                Composition of Dilute Sulphuric Acid.          305
  the results of observation appears in this case to be freer
  from exceptional, and possibly accidental, causes of disturbance
  than in others.
     I have therefore tried to <U+FB01>nd an equation which will express
  a considerable portion of this curve to within the limits of the
  error of experiment.
     If a curve, determined from isolated points, is discontinuous,
  it is nevertheless often possible— though perhaps dif<U+FB01>cult—to
  express it by a moderately simple continuous equation. To
  do this, however, terms would have to be introduced which
  express the rapid change of curvature in the neighbourhood
  of the point of discontinuity.      _
     My equation, however, consists of three parts, which are
  not suited to turning awkward corners.
     The lower part of the curve is nearly a straight line. The
  differences between the ordinates of the upper part of the
  curve and those of this line are very accurately in geometrical
  progression.                                               '
      If this were all, the equation would be of the form
                            g=a+b.'c—cdl.
      As a matter of fact, for the middle region this curve lies
  a little below that given by experiment. The difference
  gradually increases, reaches a maximum, and dies out; but
  the change is very gradual, extends over a considerable range,
‘ and does not in the least suggest discontinuity.
      To make the two curves, given by observation and calcula
  tion, <U+FB01>t, I have introduced a term which makes the form of
  the equation
                                           m
                       y=a+bw—cd’+      n: + n—z‘
      A curve of this kind has in all seven arbitrary constants,
   for if we change the origin to wogo it may be written
                                              m/c
                      g=a +lh’6—0 .d + n1+-lgzn_‘
   where
                                 k=n’0.
      In the following Table I give the values of the three
   terms, a+b.v, cal”, and m/(nI+n“), so that the fact that no
   term introduces violent and sudden changes may be obvious.
      I have carried out the calculations to one place further than
   the results of the observations are given, as Mr. Pickering
   uses that place in the readings from his smoothed curve,
   given in Table III. of his paper (Trans. Chem. 300., March
   1890, p. 145).

    Before comparing these numbers with Mr. Pickering’s
experimental results it is convenient to deduce from his
Table II. the values of ds/dp given by his own smoothed
curve.      This can be done with fair accuracy for the greater
number of points.
    The following Table proves that for a large part of the
curve the “second differential ” at any point is,                  within 5

in the last place the arithmetical mean of the corresponding
quantities given for two other points of which the abscissa: (p)
differ by equal amounts from that of the point in question.
   Thus the value of (it’s/05p" at 80-5 per cent. is the mean of
the values at 81'5 per cent. and 795 per cent.

   * The di<U+FB02>’ersnce 0f the two values of ds/dp, from which this number is ob
tained, is 127. I am not sure whether this discrepancy is due to a mistake or
to the supposed existence of a point of discontinuity.
   The intervals from which these mean values are calculated
are at least twice as great as those which have to be used in
deducing values of ds/dp at points intermediate to those given.
Hence the errors introduced are not likely to exceed 2 or 3
in the last place.
   I have therefore deduced from the numbers in Mr. Picker
ing’s Table II. the readings on his curves at the points
corresponding to his experiments.
   In the following Table III., 190 and                     are the values of

these quantities given in Mr. Pickering’s Table III. The
percentage at the experimental points is p, and pm: (p +100) /2.

     It remains to compare the two sets of values given by my
single curve and Mr. Pickering’s <U+FB01>v'e curves respectively with
his experimental numbers.
     In doing so we must remember what the estimated experi
mental error is. Mr. Pickering regards the possible error in
the determination of a density as =0'000008 = 6 say. Hence
the possible error of ds/dp is 26/3, where 5 is the difference
between the percentages of the two points from which it is
determined. In general 8:2, so that the error of ds/dp is
10000008. The experiments at 18° (which are alone treated
of in this paper) are supposed to be less accurate than the
others, but Mr. Pickering does not think that the error of expe- '
riment reaches twice the above value’. He admits that the
   '1' It must, however, be' remembered that the 18° curve was chosen
as the abnormal errors appear to be fewer and less than in other cases.

                  Composition of Dilute Sulphuric Acid.                                        309
curves prove that errors do exist of larger amounts than these,
especially where the two points used in calculating ds/d-p were
found from different solutions. I=think, therefore, that I shall
be expressing his views if I say that he regards the normal
limit of error in the present set of experiments as < 16 x 10—6
and >8 x 10‘“, when the interval between the points used in
<U+FB01>nding ds/dp is 2 per cent. The estimated maximum error
calculated on this basis is shown in the following Table :—

   1' This is given in Mr. Pickering’s Table I. as 982.
    In studying this Table one fact must be borne in mind.
The last <U+FB01>gure in all the columns is doubtful. In order to

310          Prof. A. W. Riicker 0n the Density and
obtain it I have had to carry Mr. Pickering’s own calculation
of the value of ds/dp from his experiments to a place beyond
that at which he—very properly in my opinion—stopped.
    In the third column (,8) the last <U+FB01>gure is a<U+FB01>'ected—in the
case of' the higher percentages—by the third decimal in the
percentages, which I have ignored. The error thus committed
is, however, small.
   As regards the fourth column (vy) , small errors may be
introduced into the last place by the method of calculation.
   It, then, we discard the last place and express each value of
B—a and 17—0: in terms of the number of units in the last
place but one to which it most nearly approximates, we get
the following Table, in which, for brevity, the values of p

   It is evident from this Table that, taking a broad view of
the relative claims of one continuous or <U+FB01>ve discontinuous
curves to represent the results, there is not much to choose
between them.
   There are <U+FB01>ve points (marked with asterisks) at which
both systems indicate large errors. These are partly accounted
for by the fact that at most of them the differences between
the values of p by means of which ds/dp was calculated were
unusually small.     At all of them also the two points required
were obtained by means of di<U+FB01>ierent solutions, so that sources
of error not included in Mr. Pickering’s estimate of the
maximum affected the results.
   These points Mr. Pickering regards as abnormal. I will
therefore neglect them, only remarking that if sources of error
of such magnitude are introduced by a change in the funda
mental solution from which the mixtures are made up, similar
unreckoned errors may be introduced in the process of form
ing the individual mixtures. An inspection of the curves at
8°, 28°, and 30° con<U+FB01>rms this suspicion.

             Composition of Dilute Sulphuric Acid.             311 _
    Omitting these points, however, the next most striking fact
is that the values of ry—a are large for the two largest per
centages, viz. 80-54 per cent. and 80'04 per cent. This is not
a mistake.     The value of $ x 106 at 80 per cent. is given in
Mr. Pickering’s Table III. as 11230, and the numerical value
of ds/dp diminishes as 10 increases. The observed value at
8004 per cent., 11251, must therefore necessarily be a great
deal too large.      '
    If, then, we omit the abnormal points (marked with aste
risks) and con<U+FB01>ne ourselves to those for which I have been
able to calculate 7—0:, we <U+FB01>nd that, out of 14 points, errors of
appreciable magnitude (to this order of approximation) occur
 eight times when my curve is used and seven times when
 Mr. Pickering’s <U+FB01>ve curves are employed; the sum of the
 errors in the <U+FB01>rst case is 9 and in the second 11.      '
    For my own part I think this result is suf<U+FB01>cient to show _
that, in attempting to discriminate between representations of
 the experiments under consideration, Mr. Pickering is dealing
 with quantities less than the error of experiment.
    The same conclusion is supported by a study of Table IV.,
 if we admit that <U+FB01>gures in the last place are trustworthy.
    It is evident that my own results in the column 8—“ could
 be a little improved. Positive errors are the more numerous,
 and to make positive and negative errors balance we should have
 to subtract 2 from all the <U+FB01>gures in that column. Hence it
 would have been better to choose for the constant a the value
 0'010955 instead of 0010957.        I have not thought it worth
 while to rewrite the Tables to introduce this small correction.
    The only point that I can see in Mr. Pickering’s favour is
 that, if we omit the points at 80'54 per cent. and 8004 per cent.,
 and if we omit the points which I have called abnormal at
 which the errors are large, the errors obtained from his curves
 are kept more nearly within the limit 0'000008 than in the
 case of those obtained by myself.
    I do not press the point that the maximum error in this
 case is admittedly larger than 0'000008, but I must insist that
 it is extremely unlikely that errors so large as those at the
 abnormal points exist, and that there are none larger than the
 estimated amount elsewhere.
    Why, for instance, are we to admit an error of 22, or three
 times the lower limit to the maximum error, at 56'89 per
 cent., and insist that an, error of 16, which is only twice the
 same limit, is impossible at 63'08 per cent.? If we do make
 this extremely improbable assumption, it is of course possible
 to reduce the errors thus arbitrarily picked out by making the
 curve discontinuous.

312           Prof. A. W. Riicker on the Density and
   Thus, if between 53 and 58 we suppose the terms
                        {12—5(p—53)} X 10—6
to be added to the equation, the calculated values from 53 to
 58 become
                10059,     10270,    10488, and 10602,
which make the values of 13—04
                      5, —5, +22, and 0.
These are about of the same magnitude as the corresponding
values of 'y—a, and, except at the abnormal" point, are less
than 0'000008.
   Why the large difference matters so little and the small
differences are so important I‘do not know, but it appears to
me that Mr. Pickering has been performing with a ruler an
operation analogous to that I have here performed by modi
fying a formula.
   It is, however, possible to perform the same operation over
other ranges. Thus, taking the percentages in round num
bers, and subtracting from the part of the curve between 65
and 54 terms given by
                     {1 + 2'6(60—p)2} x 10—5,
we get the numbers in the following Table :—

   The tenths of a per cent. omitted might affect the last
<U+FB01>gures to the extent of one unit ; but the Table proves that it
is possible by such devices to bring even the point at 56'89
per cent. into line with those near to it to within limits which
are admittedly less than the error of experiment. A group
of points from 64 to 74 per cent. shows errors no larger than
Mr. Pickering’s from 59 to 71 per cent. Such a method of
treating the results, whether the instrument be a ruler or a
formula, appears to me unjusti<U+FB01>able.
   There is no doubt that the larger differences between obser

vatiou and calculation are really due to errors. They occur
in two instances, at all events, in pairs having opposite signs.
One of these is near 79 per cent, the other near 65 per cent.
They are precisely what might be expected if from any cause
one density was more than usually erroneous. Is it not likely
that other minor errors are to be explained in a similar way?
   Mr. Pickerin appears to me to be on the horns of a dilemma.
 If we assume t      larger values of the maximum error to be
correct, then the values of 43—: are for the most part (except
at the abnormal points) so well within the limits of the error
of experiment that the whole discussion resolves itself (even
from his point of view) into a controversy about matters less
than the error of experiment. If the lower limit is adopted,
then he must explain why, when at 64:50 per cent. the value
of 'y—u is some three and a half times greater than the esti
mated maximum error, the theory 'of discontinuity is required
to account for the much smaller discrepancies found elsewhere.
   Horizontal lines are drawn in Table IV. at the points where
Mr. Pickering believes that there are breaks,.jn the continuity
of the curve. The differences B—a show no sign of regularity
in these intervals, they are for the most part of the same order
of magnitude as the estimated error of experiment ; and any
argument which could be drawn from the fact that they
exceed the lower values which may be assigned to it is neu
tralized by the fact that in some cases they unquestionably
exceed the largest limits Mr. Pickering has speci<U+FB01>cally men
tioned. Finally, to obtain the last place it has been necessary
to strain the calculations, and to carry them in some instances
to a place further than Mr. Pickering himself has done. If
therefore we adopt the safer course of neglecting <U+FB01>gures
 <10“, the continuous equation expresses the facts at least
as well as the <U+FB01>ve discontinuous curves.
   It is of course logically open to Mr. Pickering to claim that
his case is not disproved until a process similar to that which
I have adopted has been successfully applied in a much larger
number of instances.     So far as I am concerned I can only
reply that I think my result places him in the position of
having to prove a negative, and that I certainlycannot under
take to devote myself to the multiplication of such evidence.
   I have before stated that I think that the curves in some
parts—if not discontinuous—have peculiar features which
suggest special physical causes. Thus between 84 and
94 per cent. they are obviously nearly straight lines. My
doubts have always had reference to the minor changes of
curvature and to the use of the ruler in detecting them. They
are con<U+FB01>rmed by the above investigation.

     XXXVIII. Note on the Theory'of the Solitary Wave.
                      By Sir G. G. S'roxns‘.
IN a paper on the Solitary Wave by Mr. J. McCou'an,
    printed in the July number of the Philosophical Magazine,
for a copy of which I am indebted to the kindness of the author,
he refers to a conclusion which I advanced in a paper written
long since, and reprinted full ten years ago, according to which
a solitary wave could not be propagated without change
of form. As I have known for the last ten years that this
conclusion was erroneous, and have published a paper in
which the motion of a uniformly propagated solitary wave
was considered, I am not concerned to defend it; but it may
be well to point out the true source of the error, respecting
which I cannot agree with Mr. McGowan.
   While the <U+FB01>rst volume of my Collected Papers was going
throu h the press, I was led to the conclusion (see p. 227)
that t 0 highest possible waves of the oscillatory kind (the
motion being irrotational) presented a form in which the
crests came to wedges of 120°.      On re<U+FB02>ecting on the applica
tion of this to very long waves propagated ‘in water of which
the depth is small com ared with the length of wave, I was
led to perceive that t e conclusion above mentioned was
erroneous, and also that the source of the error was that it
was not suf<U+FB01>cient, even though a solitary wave were very
long, to treat it as inde<U+FB01>nitely long, and consequently to take
the horizontal velocity as the same from the surface to the
bottom. On speaking on the subject to Lord Rayleigh, he
referred me to the previous papers on the solitary wave by
M. Boussinesq and himself, with which I was not at the time
acquainted. The conclusion of a supplement to my paper on
oscillatory waves, which forms the last article in vol. i., shows
that I was then fully alive to the possibility of the propagation
of a solitary wave without change ; and in a short paper en
titled “On the highest wave of uniform propagation (Pre
liminary noticel,” read before the Cambridge Philosophical
Society in 1883, and printed in the Proceedings (vol. iv.
p. 361), I have indicated a new method, depending on a
process of trial and error, for determining numerically the
circumstances of uniform propagation of waves, whether of
the oscillatory or solitary class, more especially in the extreme
case in which the crest comes to a wedge of 120°, so that the
wave is on the point of beginning to break.
   I cannot agree with Mr. McGowan either that the form of
expansion which I used is inadmissible, or that the form which
he proposes at p. 58 to substitute, that of a series involving
exponentials in which the coef<U+FB01>cient of a: in the index is

                          my purpose) inadmissible, on account of the discontinuity of
                          the expression.

                          me to a wrong conclusion.        It is easily shown that in a very

                          is nearly the same from the bottom to the surface for any
                          vertical section of the wave made by a plane perpendicular to
                          the direction of propagation. For a given depth of water and
                          maximum height of wave, this is so much the more nearly
                          true as the length of the wave is greater. The horizontal
                          velocity tends inde<U+FB01>nitely towards constancy from top to
_ .___1'U-._”~-V.14._4 “  bottom as the length of the wave increases inde<U+FB01>nitely. Now
                          Sir George Airy hasshown that for a wave in which we may
                          suppose the particles in a veltical plane to remain always in a
                          Vertical plane, as they must do if the horizontal velocity isthe
                          same from top to bottom, the form of the wave must _radually
                          change as it progresses. it might seem therefore t at, how
                          ever small we take the height of a wave at the highest point,
                          we have only to make the wave long enough and Airy’s inves
                         tigation will apply, and the wave will change its form in time
                         as it travels along. Now in the solitary wave of Russell, the
                         lower the Wave, the longer it is ; and therefore it might seem
                         as if we had only to make the wave low enough and long
                         enough and the length would be so great that Airy’s investi
                         gation would apply, and the form would change, though
                         slowly.
                             The answer to this is that, however small we take the
                         height, we are not at liberty to increase the length inde<U+FB01>nitely.
                         There is in fact a relation between the height and the length
                         in a solitary wave which can be propagated uniformly, which,
                         though it is of such a nature that the length becomes in<U+FB01>nite
                         when the height becomes in<U+FB01>nitely small, nevertheless forbids
                         us for a given height, however small, to increase the length
                         indefinitely.
                             The possibility of the existence of a solitary wave of uniform
                         propagation is so far established by my investigation relating
                         to oscillatory waves, as that it is made to depend on the prin
                         ciple that the in<U+FB01>nite series by which the circumstances of the

motion of oscillatory waves is expressed must remain con
vergent until the height is so far increased that the outline
gesents a singular point, namely the wedge of 120°. If this
     conceded, we have only to make the wave-len th (in the
sense of the distance from crest to crest, not in t at of the
distance from the point where one of the swells begins to
where it ceases to be sensible) in<U+FB01>nite, in order to pass to the
case of a solitary wave uniformly propagated.

THESE are three works, (i.) and (ii.) written by Profs. Oliver,
      Wait, and Jones, of Cornell University, and (iii) arranged by
the last—named gentleman, who has recently been on a visit to this
country with a \iew, we believe, to the preparation of a new
edition of the Tables. (i.) is an excellent practical treatise on both
Plane and Spherical Trigonometry. “ After eight years’ use in the
class-rooms the book has been wholly rewritten.” The aim in the
revision has been to make the book “simpler and more attractive
as a text-book, and to make it more thorough and exhaustive as a
treatise." The new matter is thus noticed :—~(1) Applications of
Trigonometry to surveying, astronomy, and navigation. (2) The
extension of the notion of directed lines, and the introduction of
such other conventions, particularly of directed surfaces, as help
to interpret algebraic symbols by geometric magnitudes, and thus
to lay the foundation for the study of mathematical physics.
(3) The discussion of the general triangle, plane and spherical.
There is nolack of admirably drawn <U+FB01>gures, and often the same
principle is illustrated by several <U+FB01>gures: when this is the case,
“ the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>gure is easiest followed; the others help the reader to
see the generality of the principle and of the proof.” The text is
concise without being obscure. “Only the main lines of the sub
ject are developed; collateral matters are outlined in the examples
and left for the student to work out for himself.” The authors
have freely used English text-books as well as American ones, and
largely drawn upon Senate-House Examination-papers. It is a
work especially adapted for practical students. There is a copious
Index of reference.
   (ii.) This edition appears to be almost, if not quite, identical
with the <U+FB01>rst edition, which we commended some few years since
in our Magazine.
   (iii.) is a very handy collection of most useful Tables. There is
an explanation of the Tables at the end of the work, and on the
title-page there is the promise of a dollar for the <U+FB01>rst notice of
every error in the Tables.
   The same three writers promise a text-book in Algebra whose de
<U+FB01>nitions and statements of principles are clear and precise, and Whose
proofs are rigorous and so simple that any diligent pupil can read it

 young men of ordinary ability.
 The Number-System of Algebra treated Theoretically and Historically.
    By HENRY B. FINE, Ph.D. (Boston and New York : Leach,
    Shewell, and Sanborn; pp. x+ 131.)
 “la simply call attention to this small work, which presents in a
 readable form much of what is given in the larger works of Hankel
 (Uomplea‘e Zahlensystemen), M. Cantor (Vorlesungen <U+FB01>ber die
 Geschichte der Mathematik), Weierstrass, Thomas, and other Conti
 nental writers on the nature of the number-concept and the
 number-system of Algebra. The discussion follows the same lines,
 in the main, as the author’s previous pamphlet ‘ On the Forms of
 Numbers arising in Common Algebra.’
   A Treatise on Plane Trigonometry.     By E. W. HOBSON.      (Cam
           bridge: University Press, 1891; pp. xvi +356.)
 THE grati<U+FB01>cation we have derived from a perusal of this work is
 akin to that we felt on reading Chrystal’s ‘Algebra.’ The thorough
 ness and yet withal the freshness with which our author has
 treated his subject puts his book in the <U+FB01>rst rank of Mathematical
publications lately issued by the University Press. The theory of
 the circular functions is treated from the modern point of view,
 and yet the elementary parts are worked out in suf<U+FB01>cient detail
 for students“ whose range of reading is to be more limited ” than
 that of those readers to whom the work is primarily addressed.
 It is pre-eminently a strong book. and will be of prime value to
 advanced University men, who will <U+FB01>nd the principles of the theory
 of Complex Quantities clearly discussed in a manner similar to that
 of the ‘Algebra’ above referred to. Even in the most recent Works
 Analytical Trigonometry “has been too frequently presented to
 the student in the state in which it was left by Euler, before the
 researches of Cauchy, Abel, Gauss, and others had placed the use
 of imaginary quantities, and especially the theory of in<U+FB01>nite series
 and products, where real or complex quantities are involved, on a
 <U+FB01>rm scienti<U+FB01>c basis.” There are eighteen chapters in all.
     In a short chapter (11.) the method of projections is introduced,
  and this method is subsequently e<U+FB01>ectively used in conjunction
  with the de<U+FB01>nitions of the circular functions employed by
  De Morgan (see ‘Double Algebra’). These de<U+FB01>nitions appear to
  the author to be “ those from which the fundamental properties of
 the functions may be most easily deduced in such a way that the
  proofs may be quite general, in that they apply to angles of all
  magnitudes. It will be seen that this method exhibits the formulae
  for the sine and cosine of the sum of two angles, in the simplest
  light, merely as the expression of the fact that the projection of
  the hypothenuse of a right-angled triangle on any straight line in
  its plane is equal to the sum of the projections of the sides on the
  same line.”    The periodicity of these functions is clearly shown,

3l8            Intelligence and illiscellaneous Articles.
 and some space is given to their graphical representation. We
 then have (N) the addition and subtraction formulae for func
 tions of two or more angles, and (v.) the functions of sub
 multiple angles. The next chapter (VL) is to our mind the most
 valuable of the elementary chapters for readers for Scholarship
 papers. The collection of worked-out examples will be of material
 use to such readers on account of the many beautiful arti<U+FB01>ces used
 in their solution. At a somewhat earlier stage than is usual, Mr.
Hobson discusses (VII.) the expansion of functions of multiple
angles. He does so because “they are merely algebraical conse
quences of the addition theorems.” In VIII. and Ix. the reader is
 introduced to the relations between the circular functions and
 circular measure of an angle and the formation of Trigonomelrical
Tables, it being assumed at this latter stage that the student has
acquired a knowledge of logarithms from some work on Algebra
    Properties of triangles and quadrilaterals occupy chapters x., XL,
XII.    These are treated in some detail, references to the modern
geometry of the triangles being in the main purposely excluded.
    The Analytical side of the subject occupies chapters x111. to the
end. In X111. is an account, with applications, of complex quan
tities, which is preliminary to the (perhaps) distinctive feature of
Mr. Hobson’s book—the rigorous discussion of the theory of in<U+FB01>nite
series. The corresponding portion in Mr. Hobson’s Elwyc. Brit.
article has recently elicited commendation from Prof. Chrystal, and
the work before us, we believe. presents the proofsin even fullerdetail.
    The exponential     function, and what the author        calls   the
 “ generalized logarithm ” (“the doubly in<U+FB01>nite series of values of
the logarithm of a quantity ”), form the subject-matter of xv.:
hyperbolic functions of XVI.; in<U+FB01>nite products of X\'II.; and the
closing chapter gives a proof of the irrationality of 1r, with other
applications of continued fractions to the subject. We have noted
few errors: p. 83, line 4, for h read I); p. 103, line 4, for (29)
read 40 which depends on (29) of § 49 z p. 123. line 15, for second
sinO read tanH; p. 132, line 7 up, for (7) read (11); p. 311,
line 10 up, for sin (x—iy) in denominator read cos (x—iy). There
is a beautiful and numerous collection of exercises which will
interest any one who has a taste for the subject. The <U+FB01>gures and
the “ get up ” are all that one could wish for.

  EDITORIAL NOTE 05' MR. PARKER’S PAPER ON THE ABSURDITY
                          OF DIAMAGNETISM.
    F I had seen Mr. Parker’s paper in last month’s Philo
        sophical Magazine before publication, I would have
referred it back to him for some im )ortant alterations. I
could hardly, however, have foreseen, w en publishing a paper
b a Fellow of St. John’s College, Cambridge, that it was
lihely to contain such statements as, lst, that there is anything
new in the theory that diamagnetic action is really due to the
paramagnetism of the air; and, 2nd, that no theory of dia

               Intclligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             319
magnetic action has been propounded. This “ new theory”
is at least as old as Becquerel (1850), and has been investi
gated by almost everybody who has worked at diamagnetism,
and they are practically unanimous in the conclusion that
diamagnetic actions cannot be explained by the paramagnetism
of the air.
   These undisputed experiments prove that such a theory as
Bccquerel’s would require a vacuum to be paramagnetic.
This is a new nomenclature, and does not make the old one
absurd ; it involves practically what Mr. Parker says is non
existent, namely one of the theories of diamagnetism.               But
all this is too well known to be worth wasting words on.
   As to the second curious statement of Mr. Parker's,
namely that no theory of diamagnetism exists, that is equally
extraordinary. Chapter xxii. of Maxwell's pretty generally
known Treatise is headed “ Ferromagnetism and Diamag
netism explained by Molecular Currents,” and gives an in
teresting description of Weber’s theory of Diamagnetism in
§ 838. If Mr. Parker had exercised his ingenuity in explain
ing how Weber’s theory, which, being a possible theory can be
reconciled with Thomson’s di<U+FB01>iculty, it would have been more
instructive than a dissertation on the absurdity of what undis
puted experiments show to be real. If the opportunity had
arisen, it would have been only kind to Mr. Parker to have
referred the paper back to him for reconsideration before
publishing it.                              Gno. F. FITZGERALD.
                      ON HOMOLOGOUS SPECTRA.
       To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
GENTLEMEN,                                   Cardiff, August 20, 1891.
   Will you kindly allow me to say a few words in reply to the
recent article by Professor Hartley in your Magazine (April 1891),
which referred almost entirely to a previous paper of mine.
   I regret that, in reading Professor Hartley’s papers on Homo—
logous Spectra, I failed to see his statement concerning the
importance of noticing the physical properties of the lines of the
various spectra. In com paring, however, the lines of magnesium and
zinc, which he considers to be homologous, I saw at the most only the
faintest resemblance. This may be due to the fact that the photo
graphs which I used were of the arc-spectra, while his were of the
spark—spectra. I had sets of both at my disposal; but the arc
spectra ones were so superior in every way that I selected them.
As I said in my previous paper, I think the arc-spectrum photo
graphs are preferable in looking for homologous lines; not because
the spark-spectrum is variable, as Professor Hartley thinks I meant,
but because of uniformity of conditions, sharpness of lines, freedom
from business, (to.    It may be that the di<U+FB01>erence between the arc

320            Intelligence and Mscellaneous Articles.
and the spark-spectrum is merely one of temperature; but so far
surely the arc-spectra photographs have been more suitable for the
comparison of spectra. Regarding magnesium and zinc, I must
still say that the resemblance is much less marked than between
zinc and cadmium; and it is well to note that the recent work of
K ayser and Runge shows conclusively that magnesium is not
related so closely to zinc and cadmium as it is to barium and the
elements on the other side of the second column of Mendelejeit’s
table.
                                 Very respectfully yours,

                                     Before proceeding to describe the appearance presented by
                                  the discharge, I will mention one or two points which may
                                  prove useful to any one who wishes to repeat the experiments.
                                  According to my experience the discharge is more easily
                                  obtained in bulbs than in square tubes, and witha. Wimshurst
                                  machine than with an induction-coil. If an induction-coil is

                                  such instruments. It is essential to success that the gas
                                  in the bulbs or tubes should be quite dry and at a suitable
                                  pressure; there is a pressure at which the brilliancy of
                                  the discharge is a maximum, and as in endeavouring to

                                  tried allow the discharge to pass pretty readily, though it

324    Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Discharge of Electricity
describes the light produced in a tube round which the wire
connecting the coatings of a Leyden jar is twisted; the lumi
nosity in Hittorf’s experiments seems to have <U+FB01>lled the tube,
and not, as in the experiments described in this paper, been
con<U+FB01>ned to a ring. It seems possible that the difference in
the appearance in the tubes may have been due to the exist
ence of an electrostatic action in Hittorf’s experiments, the
primary coil getting raised to a_ high potential before the
 discharge of the jar, and inducing a distribution of electricity
 over the inside of the glass of the tube ; on the passage of the
 spark the potential of the primary coil will fall, and the
 electricity on the glass redistribute itself; to effect this re
 distribution it may pass through the rare<U+FB01>ed gas in the
 discharge-tube and produce luminosity.
    In my experiments 1 took two precautions against this
e<U+FB01>ect : in the <U+FB01>rst place I connected the primary coil to earth,
 so that its potential before discharge took place was unaltered,
 and as an additional precaution I separated the discharge
tube from the primary by a cage made of blotting-paper
moistened with dilute acid ; the wet blotting-paper is a suf<U+FB01>
ciently good conductor to screen off any purely electrostatic
effects, but not a good enough one to interfere to an appre
ciable extent with the electromotive forces arising from
 rapidly alternating currents. In this way we can screen off
any electrostatic effects due to causes which operate before
the electrical oscillations in the jars begin ; when once these
have commenced, there ought not, I think, to be any separa
 tion of the electromotive forces into two parts, one being
 called electrostatic, the other electrodynamic. As this is a
 point on which it is desirable to avoid any misunderstanding,
 I hope to be excused if I treat it at some length.
    In the mathematical treatment of the phenomena of the
 “ Electromagnetic Field,” it is customary and not incon
 venient to regard the electromotive force as derived from two
 sources, or rather as consisting of two parts, one part being
 calculated by the ordinary rules of electrostatics from the
 distribution of electricity in the <U+FB01>eld, the other part being the
 differential coef<U+FB01>cient of the vector potential with respect to the
 time. From a mathematical point of view, there is a good
 deal to be said for this division; the two forces have very
 distinct and sharply contrasted analytical properties. Thus the
 electrostatic force possesses the property that its line-integral
 taken round any closed curve vanishes, while the surface
integral of its normal component taken over a closed surface
 does not in general vanish. The “vector potential force,” on
the other hand, does not in general vanish when integrated

           through Exhausted Tubes without Electrodes.
 round a closed curve, the surface-integral of its normal com
 ponent taken over any closed surface, however, vanishes. When,
 however, our object is not so much mathematical calculation
 as the formation of a mental picture of the processes going
 on in the <U+FB01>eld, this division does not seem nearly so satis
 factory, as the fundamental quantities concerned, the electro
 static and vector potentials, are both of considerable com
 plexity from a physical point of view. \Ve might judge that
 this division of the electromotive force into two parts, the one
 derivable from an electrostatic, the other from a vector, poten
tial, is rather a mathematical device than a physical reality,
from the fact which I pointed out in a report on Electrical
Theories (B. A. Report, 1886), that though the electrostatic
potential satis<U+FB01>es the mathematical condition of being pro
pagated with an in<U+FB01>nite velocity, the total electromotive force
in the electromagnetic <U+FB01>eld travels with the velocity of light,
and nothing physical is propagated at a greater velocity.
    In an experimental investigation such as that described in
this paper it is not so important that our method of regarding
the phenomena should lead to the shortest analysis as that it
should enable us to picture to ourselves the processes at work
in the <U+FB01>eld, and to decide without much calculation how to
arrange the experiments so as to bring any effect which may
have been observed into greater prominence.
   The method which I have adopted for this purpose is the
one described by me in the Philosophical Magazine, March
1891, and which consists in referring everything to the
disposition and motion of the tubes of electrostatic induction
in the <U+FB01>eld. These tubes are either endless, or have their
ends on places where free electricity exists, every unit of
positive electricity (the unit being the quantity of electricity
on the atom of a nnivalent element) being connected by a
unit tube to a unit of negative electricity, the tube starting
from the positive electricity and ending on the negative. At
any point in the <U+FB01>eld the electromotive intensity varies as the
density of the tubes of electrostatic induction at that point.
When the electricity and the tubes in the <U+FB01>eld are at rest,
the tubes distribute themselves so that the electromotive
intensity at any point is derivable from a potential function ;
as soon, however, as the equilibrium is disturbed, the tubes
move about and get displaced from their original positions,
the disposition of tubes and therefore the electromotive
intensity are changed, and the latter will no longer be deriv
able from a potential function, and according to the mathe
matical theory would be said to include forces due to electro
static and electromagnetic induction. . According to our view.

326     Prof. J. J. Thomson-on the Discharge qf Electricity
however, the cause of the electromotive intensity is the
same in both cases, viz. the presence of tubes of electro
 static induction, aud the electromotive intensity ceases to be
derived from a potential, merely because the distribution of
these tubes is not necessarily the same when they are moving
 about as when they are in equilibrium. It is shown, in the
 paper already referred to, that these tubes when in motion
 produce a magnetic force at right angles, both to their own
 direction and to that in which they are moving, the magnitude
 of the force being 4'” times the product of the strength of the
 tube, the velocity with which it is moving, and the sine of the
 angle between the direction of the tube and its direction
 of motion. In an electric <U+FB01>eld in which the matter is at
 rest, these tubes when in motion move at right angles to
 themselves with the velocity “ a,” that at which electro
 dynamic disturbances are propagated through the medium.
 We can easily show that, K being the speci<U+FB01>c inductive
 capacity of the medium, the line-integral of 4w/K times the
 density of these tubes taken round a closed circuit is equal to
 the rate of diminution of the number of lines of magnetic
 induction passing through the circuit. Thus, since the funda
 mental laws of electrodynamic action, viz. Faraday’s law of in
 duction and Ampere’s law of magnetic force, follow from this
  conception of the <U+FB01>eld as produced by tubes of electrostatic
 induction moving at right angles to themselves with the
  velocity “v,” and producing a magnetic force at right angles
  both to their own direction and to that in which they are
  moving, and proportional to the product of the strength of
  the tube and its velocity, it is a conception which will
  account for all the known phenomena of the <U+FB01>eld. It fur
  nishes in <U+FB01>ne a geometrical instead of an analytical theory of
  the <U+FB01>eld. It will also be seen that from this point of view
  the magnetic force, when introduced to calculate the electro
  motive forces arising from induction, logically comes in as an
  intellectual middle-man wasting mental effort.
     We may thus regard the distinction between electrostatic
  and electromagnetic electromotive forces as one introduced
  for convenience of analysis rather than as having any physical
  reality. The only difference which I think could be made
  from a physical point of view would be to de<U+FB01>ne those effects
  as electrostatic which are due to tubes of electrostatic induc
  tion having free ends, and to con<U+FB01>ne the term electromagnetic
  to the effects produced by closed endless tubes. It is only,
  howeVer, when the electromotive forces are produced ex
  clusively by the motion of magnets that all the tubes are
  closed; whenever batteries or condensers are used, open tubes
  are present in the <U+FB01>eld.

         through Exhausted Tubes without Electrodes.        327
   It will be useful to consider here the disposition and
motion of the tubes of electrostatic induction in the arrange
ment used to produce these electrodeless discharges. We shall
take the case where two jars are used, as in B, <U+FB01>g. 1, as being
the more symmetrical.
   Just before the discharge of the jar, the tubes of electro
static induction will be arranged somewhat as follows :—
There will be some tubes stretching from one terminal of the
electric machine to the other; others will go from the ter
minals to neighbouring conductors, the table on which the
machine is placed, the <U+FB02>oor and walls of the room, &c. The
great majority of the tubes will, however, be short tubes
passing through the glass between the coatings of the jars.
Let us now consider the behaviour of two of these tubes, one
from the jar A, the other from B, when a spark passes between
the terminals of the machine. Whilst the spark is passing
these may be regarded as connected by a conductor; the tubes
which originally stretched between them now contract, the
repulsion they exerted on the surrounding tubes is destroyed
so that these now crowd into the space between the terminals,
the two short tubes under consideration now taking somewhat
the form shown in <U+FB01>g. 2. These tubes being of opposite sign
                 Fig. 2.                  Fig. 3.
                    _+
 tend to run together; they do so until they meet as in <U+FB01>g. 3,
 when the tubes break up as in <U+FB01>g. 4, the upper portion run
 ning into the spark-gap, where it contracts, while the lower

    328    Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Discharge of Electricity
    portion rushes through the dielectric to discharge itself into
    the wire connecting the coatings of the jars, an intermediate
    position being shown in <U+FB01>g. 5. These tubes while rushing
    through the dielectric produce, as already stated, magnetic
    forces ; some of them on their way to the discharging wire
    will pass through the discharge-tube; if they congregate there
    in suf<U+FB01>cient density, discharge will take place through the
    rare<U+FB01>ed gas.
       The discharge of the jar is oscillatory, and we have only
    followed the motion of the tubes during a part of the oscilla
    tion ; when, however, this tube enters the wire between the
    jars a tube of opposite kind emerges from it ; the same thing
    happens when the other portion enters the spark-gap. These
    go through the same processes as the tubes we have followed,
     but in the reverse order, until we get again two short tubes
    in the jars, but opposite in sign to the original ones; the
    process is then repeated and so on as long as the vibrations
    last.
       In order to see What are the most advantageous di—
    mensions to give to our apparatus, let us consider on what
    the maximum electromotive force in the secondary depends.
    Let us take the case of a condenser of capacity C discharging
    through a circuit whose coef<U+FB01>cient of self-induction is L ;
    then, if the potential difference between the plates of the con
. ' denser is initially V0, the current 7 at the time t is (sup
    posing as a very rough approximation that there is no decay
  p
    in the vibrations) given by the equation
                             __ LB - J‘
                            'y—        5111       . '
    The rate of variation of this, '9, is therefore
                                  0     _L
                                L 6‘” VLO'
    So that if M is the coef<U+FB01>cient of self-induction between the
    primary and a secondary circuit, the maximum electromotive
    force round the secondary is MVO/L, which for a given spark
    length is independent of the capacity of the condenser. In
     practice it is advisable, however, to have as much energy in the
    jars to start with as possible, and better results are got with
    large jars than with small ones. Using a six-plate Wimshurst
     machine I got very good results with two “ gallon jars;” with
    a large induction-coil the best results were got with two_
    “pint and a half jars.”
       The best number of turns to use in the primary coil C

            through Exhausted Tubes without Electrodes.         329
  depends upon the size of the leads ; if all the circuit were
  available for this coil one turn would give the largest electro
  motive force, because though for a given rate of change of the
  current in the primary the effect on the secondary increases with
  the number of turns, the rate of change of the current varies
 inversely as the self-induction of the primary, so that if all the
 circuit is in the coil 0, since an increase in the number of turns
  will increase the self-induction of the circuit faster than the
  mutual induction, it will diminish the electromotive force
  round the secondary. In practice, however, it is not possible
  to have the whole of the wire connecting the coatings of the
 jar in the coil 0 ; and in this case an increase in the number
 of turns may increase the mutual induction more than the self
 induction, and so be advantageous. The best result will be
 obtained when the self-induction in the coil 0 is equal to that
 of the remainder of the circuit.        It is very easy to <U+FB01>nd by
 actual trial whether the addition of an extra turn of wire is
 bene<U+FB01>cial .or the reverse.      The brightness of the discharge
 depends upon the time of the electrical oscillations as well as
 upon the magnitude of the electromotive force. Thus, in an
 experiment to be described later, the brilliancy of the dis
 charge was increased by putting self-induction in the leads
 which, though it diminished the intensity of the electromotive
 force, increased the time-constant of the system. When the
 discharge-tube was square and the coil C had also to be square,
 it was found most convenient to make it of glass tubing bent
into the required form and <U+FB01>lled with mercury. When, how
ever, the discharge was required in a bulb, the primary coil was
 made of thick gutta-percha-covered copper wire wound round
 a beaker just large enough to receive the exhausted bulb.
There is sometimes considerable dif<U+FB01>culty in getting the <U+FB01>rst
discharge to pass through the bulb, though when it has once
been started other discharges follow with much less dif<U+FB01>culty.
The same effect occurs with ordinary sparks. It seems to be
due to the splitting up of the molecules by the <U+FB01>rst discharge;
some of the atoms are left uncombined and so ready to con
duct the discharge, or else when they recombine they form
compounds of smaller electric strength than the original gas.
When the discharge was loath to start, I found the most
e<U+FB02>’ectual way of inducing it to do so was to pull the terminals
of the Wimshurst far apart and then, after the jars had got
fully charged, to push the terminals suddenly together. In
this way a long spark is obtained, which, if the pressure of
the gas is such that any discharge is possible, with the means
at our disposal will generally start the discharge.

330     Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Disc/Large qulectricit'z/
                   Appearance of the Discharge.
   Let us suppose that we have either a square tube placed
outside a square primary or a bulb placed inside a circular
coil of wire, and that we gradually exhaust the discharge
tube, the jars sparking all the time. At <U+FB01>rst nothing at all is
to be seen in the secondary, but when the exhaustion has
proceeded until the pressure has fallen to a millimetre or
thereabouts, a thin thread of reddish light is seen to go round
the tube situated near to but not touching the side of the
tube turned towards the primary. As the exhaustion pro
ceeds still further, the brightness of this thread rapidly in
creases, as well as its thickness; it also changes its colo'ur,
losing its red tinge and becoming white. On continuing the
exhaustion the luminosity attains a maximum, and the dis
charge passes as an exceedingly bright and well-de<U+FB01>ned ring.
On continuing the exhaustion, the luminosity begins to di
minish until, when an exceedingly good vacuum is reached,
no discharge at all passes. The pressure at which the lumi
nosit is a maximum is very much less than that at which
the electric strength of the gas is a minimum in a tube pro
vided with electrodes and comparable in size to the bulb.
The pressure at which the discharge steps is exceedingly low,
and it requires long continued pumping to reach this stage.
We see from these results that the dif<U+FB01>culty which is ex
perienced in getting the discharge to pass through an ordi
nary vacuum-tube when the pressure is very low is not
altogether due to the dif<U+FB01>culty of getting the electricity from
the electrodes into the gas, but that it also occurs in tubes
without electrodes, though in this case the critical pressure is
very much lower than when there are electrodes.         In other
words, we see that as the state of the bulb approaches that of
a perfect vacuum its insulating power becomes stronger and
 stronger. This result is con<U+FB01>rmed by several other experi
 ments of a different kind which will be described later.
   The discharge presents a perfectly continuous appearance,
with no sign of striation, of which I have never observed any
trace on any of these discharges, though I must have ob
served many thousands of them under widely different con
ditions.                  ~
              Action of a JIagnet on the Discharge.
   The discharges which take place in these tubes and bulbs
are produced by periodic currents, so that the discharges
themselves are periodic, and the luminosity is produced by
currents passing in opposite directions. As this is the case,

discharges in opposite directions, the places of maximum
luminosity in the one <U+FB01>tting into those of minimum lumi
nosity in the other.     Since these discharges are in opposite
directions, they will be pushed opposite ways when a magnetic
force acts at right angles to them, the discharges in opposite
directions can thus be separated by the application of a magnetic
force and examined separately. In the experiment which was
tried with this object, a square tube was used placed outside
the primary, the tube at one or two places being blown out
 into a bulb so as to allow of the wider separation of the con
 stituent discharges. When one of these bulbs was placed in a
 magnetic <U+FB01>eld where the force was at right angles to the dis
 charge, the luminous discharge through the bulb was divided
 into two portions which were driven to opposite sides of the
 bulb ; each of these portions was of uniform luminosity and
 exhibited no trace of striation. It was noticed, however, in
 making this experiment that the discharge seemed to have
 much greater dif<U+FB01>culty in pissing through the tube when
 the electromagnet was on than when it was off. This obser
 vation was followed up by several other experiments, and it
  was found that the discharge is retarded in a most remarkable
  way by a magnetic force acting at right angles to the line of
 discharge. This effect is most strikingly shown when the
  discharge passes as a ring through a spherical bulb. If such a
  bulb is placed near a strong electromagnet, it is easy to adjust
  the length of spark so that when the magnet is off a brilliant
  discharge passes through the bulb, while when the magnet is
  on no discharge at all can be detected.        The action is very
  striking, and the explanation of it which seems to <U+FB01>t in best
  with the phenomena I have observed is that the discharge
  through the rare<U+FB01>ed gas does not rise to its full intensity
  suddenly, but as it were feels its way. The gas <U+FB01>rst breaks
  down along the line where the electromotive intensity is a
  maximum, and a small discharge takes place along this line.
  This discharge produces a supply of dissociated molecules
  along which subsequent discharges can pass with greater
  ease. Thus under the action of these electric forces the gas
  is in a state of unstable equilibrium, since as soon as any
  small discharge passes through it the gas becomes electrically
  weaker and less able to resist subsequent discharges. When
  the gas is in a magnetic <U+FB01>eld, the magnetic force acting 011
  the discharge produces a mechanical force which displaces
  the molecules taking part in the discharge from the line of
   maximum electric intensity, and thus subsequent discharges

   332    Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Discharge of Electricity
   do not <U+FB01>nd it any easier to pass along this line in consequence
   of the passage of the previous one. There will not, therefore,
   be the same instability in this case as in the one where no
   magnetic force acted, upon the gas.       A con<U+FB01>rmation of this
   view is, I think, afforded by the appearance presented by the
   discharge when the intensity of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld is reduced,
   so that the discharge just, but only just, passes when the
  magnetic <U+FB01>eld is on.       In this case the discharge, instead of
  passing as a steady <U+FB01>xed ring, <U+FB02>ickers about the tube in a very
  undecided way.
     If the strength of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld is reduced still further,
  so that the discharge passes with some ease, the bright ring
  which, when no magnetic force is acting, is in one plane, is
  changed into a luminous band situated between two planes
  which intersect along a diameter of the bulb at right angles
  to the magnetic force. These planes are inclined at a con
  siderable angle, one being above and the other below the
  plane of the undisturbed ring. This displacement of the ring
  by the magnetic force shows that it consists of currents cir
 culating tangentially round the ring.
     This action of a magnet on a discharge <U+FB02>owing at right
 angles to its lines of force is not, however, the only remarkable
 effect produced by a magnet on the discharge. When the
 lines of magnetic force are along the line of discharge, the
 action of the magnet is to facilitate the discharge and not to
 retard it as in the former case. The <U+FB01>rst indication of this
 was observed when the jars were connected, as in (a) in <U+FB01>g. 1.
 The earth-connexion being removed, in this case there is a
 glow from the glass into the bulb, due to the redistribution of
 the electricity induced on the glass by the primary when it is
 at a high potential before the spark passes. If the primary
is connected to earth by a circuit with an air-break in it, the
intensity of the glow may be altered at will by adjusting the
length of the air-break; when the air-space is very small
there is no glow; when it is long the glowis bright.          The
bulb in which the discharge was to take place was placed on
a piece of ebonite over the pole of an electromagnet, and the
air-space in the earth-connexion of the primary was adjusted
so that when the magnet was off no glow was observed in the
tube. When the magnet was on, however, a glow radiating in
the direction of the lines of magnetic force was produced,
which lasted as long as the magnet was on, and died away
rapidly, but not instantaneously, when the magnet was taken
off. In this case the discharge seems to be much easier along
the lines of magnetic force.
    The following experiment shows that this effect is not

          through Exhausted Tubes without Electrodes.      333
con<U+FB01>ned to the glow-discharge, but is also operative when the
discharge passes entirely through the gas. A square tube
ABOD (<U+FB01>g. 6) is placed outside the primary EFGH, the
lower part of the discharge-tube CD being situated between
the poles L M of an electromagnet. By altering the length of

acting on the secondary can be so adjusted that no discharge
passes round the tube ABGD when the magnet is off, whilst
a bright discharge occurs as long as the magnet is on. The
two effects of the magnet on the discharge, viz. the stoppage
of the discharge across the lines of magnetic force, and its
acceleration along them, may be prettily illustrated by placing
in this experiment an exhausted bulb N inside the primary ;
then the spark-length can be adjusted so that when the
magnet is off the discharge passes in the bulb, and not in the
 square tube, while when the magnet is on the discharge
passes in the square tube, and not in the bulb.
   The experiments on the effect of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld on the
discharge were tried with air, carbonic acid, and oxygen, but
I could not detect any di<U+FB01>‘erence in the behaviour of the p
gases.                                                       '
   The explanation of the longitudinal effect of magnetic force
seems more obscure than that of the transverse effect; it is
possible, however, that both may be due to the same cause,
for if the feeble discharge which we suppose precedes the
main discharge branches away at all from the line of main
discharge, the action of the magnetic force when it is along
the discharge will tend to bring these branches into the main
line of discharge ; and thus there will be a greater supply of
dissociated molecules along the main line of discharge, and
therefore an easier path for the subsequent discharges when
the magnetic force is acting than when it is absent.
   It is perhaps not necessary to assume that the mechanical
action of the magnetic force is on a small discharge preceding

Nil
      334    Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Discharge of Electricity
      the main one ; the action of the magnetic force on the chain
      of polarized molecules which are formed before the discharge
      passes might produce an effect equivalent- to that which we
      have supposed was produced on an actual discharge.
         The chain of polarized molecules would be att'ected in the
      following way :——The magnetic <U+FB01>eld due to the electromagnet
      consists of tubes of electrostatic induction moving about ;
      these tubes, as well as the direction in which they are moving,
      are at right angles to the lines of magnetic force. The short
      tubes of electrostatic induction which join the atoms in the
      molecules of the gas will, under the in<U+FB02>uence of the electric
      forces, set themselves parallel to the direction of the electro
      motive intensity at each point.          r
          Thus, when the magnetic force is at right angles to the
    ' line of discharge, tubes of electrostatic induction parallel to
      those in the molecules will be moving aboutin the <U+FB01>eld ; and
      since parallel tubes exert attraction and repulsion on each
      other, the molecular tubes will be knocked about and their
      efforts to form closed chains made much more dif<U+FB01>cult by
      the action of the magnet.     On the other hand, when.the lines
      of magnetic force are parallel to the discharge, the moving
      tubes are at right angles to those in the molecules, and will
      not disturb them in the attempt to form chains along the line
      of magnetic force, they will in fact assist them in doing so by
      preventing all attempts in directions across the lines of force.
          Prof. G. F. Fitzgerald has suggested to me in conversation
      that this action of a magnet on the discharge might be the
      cause of the “ streamers ” which are observed in the aurora;
      the rare air being electrically weaker along the lines of mag—
       netic force than at right angles to them will cause the
       discharge in the direction of those lines to be the brightest.
                      Discharge through diferent Gases.
          I have examined the discharge through air, carbonic
       acid, hydrogen, oxygen, coal-gas, and acetylene. As I have
       already mentioned, at the highest pressures at which the
       discharge passes through air, the discharge is reddish, and
       gets brighter and whiter at lower pressures.    If the discharge
       is examined through a spectroscope, the lines in the spectrum
       coincide with those obtained by sparking through air in the
       ordinary way with a jar in the circuit. The relative bright
       ness of the lines in the spectrum of the discharge without
       electrodes varies very much with the pressure of the gas and
       the length of spark in the jar circuit. With a long spark in
       this circuit, and the pressure such as to give a bright white

         through Exhausted Tubes without Electrodes.         335
discharge, the spectrum is very much like that of the
ordinary jar-discharge in air. When, however, the pressure is
so low that the discharge passes with dif<U+FB01>culty, a few lines in
the spectrum shine out very brightly, whilst others become
faint, s0 faint indeed sometimes that if the air-spectrum were
not thrown into the <U+FB01>eld of view of the spectroscope at the
same time, they might pass unnoticed. Three lines which are
very persistent, the <U+FB01>rst a citron-green, the second a more
refrangible green, and the third a blue, I am inclined to
think must be due to mercury vapour from the pump.
   1 am indebted to Prof. Liveing for the loan of a very <U+FB01>ne
direct-vision spectroscope, and to him and Mr. Robinson, of
the Cambridge Chemical Laboratory, for valuable advice in
the attempts which I made to photograph the spectra of
some phosphorescent glows mentioned below.
   I should like to call attention to the advantages for spectro
scopic purposes which attend this method of producing the
discharge ; it is easily done either by an ordinary electrical
machine or an induction-coil. An intensely bright discharge
is got, and there is no danger of complication arising from
the spectrum of the gas getting mixed with that of the
electrodes.
                      Discharge in Oct/gen.
   By far the most remarkable appearance is presented when
the discharge passes through oxygen, for in this gas the
bright discharge is succeeded by a phosphorescent glow
which lasts for a considerable time; indeed, with a strong
discharge it may remain visible for more than a minute.
When the discharges succeed one another pretty rapidly, the
phosphorescence is so strong that it hides the successive
bright discharges, and the tube seems permanently full of a
bright yellow fog. We can thus by the use of this gas con
vert the intermittent light given by the bright discharge into
a continuous one.
   Perhaps the most striking way of showing this phosphor
escence is to use a long tube, about a metre long and 6 or
7 centimetres in diameter, with a bulb blown in the middle,
the primary coil being twisted round this bulb. Then, when
the sparks pass between the jars, a bright ring-discharge
passes through the bulb, from which, as if shot out from the
ring, the phosphorescent glow travels in both directions along
the tube, moving slowly enough for its motion to be followed
by the eye. It cannot, therefore, be produced by the direct
action of the light from the spark on the gas in the tube, for

 336      Discharge of Electricity through Eruhausted Tubes.
 if it were, the glow would travel with the velocity of light.
 It is necessary to mention this point, for the light from these
 discharges has great powers of producing phosphorescence.
    The glow seems to consist of gas which has been in the path
 of the discharge, and whose molecules have been split up by
 it and projected from the line of discharge. This gas which,
 when projected, is in a peculiar state, by a process of chemical
 combination gradually returns to its original condition, and
 it is while it is in this state of transition from its new condi
 tion to the old that it phosphoresces.       If this is the case we
 should expect that the period of phosphorescence would be
 shortened by raising the temperature. On trying the experi
 ment I found that this took place to a very marked extent.
 A discharge-bulb <U+FB01>lled with oxygen at a low pressure was
 placed over a Bunsen burner ; before- the bulb got hot each
 bright discharge was succeeded by a bright afterglow, but
 as the bulb got hotter and hotter the glow became fainter
 and fainter, and at last ceased to be visible, though the bright
 ring was still produced at each discharge of the jar. When
 the Bunsen was taken away and the bulb allowed to cool,
the glow reappeared.
    The spectrum of the afterglow is a continuous spectrum,
in which I could not detect the superposition of any bright
lines. The only gas besides oxygen in which I have been
able to detect any afterglow is air, though in this case the
range of pressure within which it is exhibited is exceedingly
small ; indeed it is often by no means an easy matter to get
a bulb <U+FB01>lled with air into the state in which it shows the
glow. The spectrum of the air-glow showed bright lines ; I
thought myself that I could see a very faint continuous
spectrum as well. Some friends, however, who were kind
enough to examine the spectrum, though they could see the
bright lines clearly enough, were of opinion that there was
nothing else visible.      I endeavoured to photograph it, but
without success, so that the existence of a continuous spectrum
for this glow must be considered doubtful.
   When the discharge passes through acetylene, the <U+FB01>rst two
or three discharges are a bright apple-green, the subsequent
ones, however, are white, and as the green discharge does
not reappear, we must conclude that the acetylene is decom
posed by the discharge.

     XLII. Notes on Allotropic Silver.           By M. CAREY LEA*.
      ELA TIONS of the Yellow to the Blue F07‘7718.—Tl16 gold
         and copper-coloured forms on the one hand, and the
blue, bluish-green, and steel-grey on the other hand, stand
in close relations to each other. In previous papers there has
 been described a crystalline state intermediate between these
 active forms and ordinary silver, which intermediate condition,
whilst retaining the bright yellow colour of the active form, is
 nearly as indifferent to reagents as ordinary silver. Into this
 intermediate state both the yellow and blue forms are capable
 of passing, and apparently the intermediate states of both
 kinds of allotropic silver are identical : the intermediate form
 of blue silver is yellow. Thus, when lumps of blue silver are
 heated in a test-tube to about 180° 0., they assume a gold
colour and lustre. The same change takes place at the same
temperature when <U+FB01>lms of blue silver are placed in a hot-air
bath.
     But relations much closer than these exist. Blue silver can
be converted into yellow at ordinary temperatures and con
sequently with retention of its active properties. This is
accomplished through the agency of sulphuric acid. When a
solution of silver is obtained by the action of sodium hydroxide
and dextrine on silver nitrate 1', it appears to contain the blue
variety; for if allowed to precipitate spontaneously by long
standing, or if precipitated by acetic acid, dilute nitric acid,
or by many neutral substances, it gives a form of silver which
is dark red whilst moist and dries with a. blue surface-colour.
 (It is always a little dif<U+FB01>cult to characterize these substances by
 their colours, since the surface-colour which they show when
dry, either in mass or in <U+FB01>lms, is mostly complementary to
their colour when wet. As the surface-colour is much the
more characteristic, I have adopted the course of naming
them by that.)
    The behaviour of the red solution obtained by soda and
dextrine with dilute sulphuric acid is very interesting and
   it From an advance proof communicated by the Author.
   't Forty grams each of sodium hydroxide and of yellow or brown dex
trine (not white) are dissolved in two litres of water, and twetny-eight
grams of silver nitrate in solution are added in small quantities at a time,
with frequent stirring, so that several hours shall elapse before the last
portion is added. The solution is always sli htly turbid when viewcd by
re<U+FB02>ected light, by which it shows a beautiful eep green colour. By trans
mitted light it is deep red, and, when diluted, absolutely transparent.
By diminishing the proportion of silver nitrate to one half, a solution
nearly or quite clear by re<U+FB02>ected as well as by transmitted light is obtained.

338                Mr. M. Carey Lca’s lVotes
instructive. When 100 cubic centim. of solution are poured
into 100 cubic. centim. of water to which 3 cubic centim. of
sulphuric acid have been previously added, a dark red precipi
tate falls, which, when dry, especially in <U+FB01>lms, is blue. The
mixed liquid from which the precipitate is formed is acid.
Increasing the proportion of acid to 4, 5, and 6 cubic centim.
successively, the substance obtained has a green surface-colour,
becoming more yellowish green in proportion as the acid is
increased in quantity. ‘Vith 7% cubic centim. the substance
no longer dries green, but yellow. Increased proportions of
acid produce substances drying with a coppery shade.
   It will be seen that from a single solution, and using one
substance only as a precipitant, we can obtain the whole rango
of different forms of allotropic silver by simply varying the
proportions of the precipitant.
   That these forms of silver should subsist in the presence of
sulphuric acid in excess is remarkable. For the most part
the presence of this acid tends to quickly convert allotropic
to ordinary silver. For example, bright yellow allotropic
silver obtained with ferrous tartrate was washed on a <U+FB01>lter
with water containing 5%,5 its volume of sulphuric acid : in
two or three hours the entire mass was converted into grey
ordinary silver.
   It is observable that the substances precipitated with the
least acid have a very splendid lustre, and that this lustre
diminishes steadily as the proportion of acid is increased.
Up to 6 to 100 cubic centim. the effect is hardly noticeable,
after that it becomes more marked.
   But we can also obtain the converse of this reaction.     Just
as the solution which naturally would yield the blue product
can be made to yield the yellow by the presence of excess of
strong acid, so the solution which normally yields the yellow
substance may be made to produce blue (or rather green)
silver by adding alkali. Thus a mixture of dilute solutions of
ferrous sulphate and of Rochelle salt added to mixed solutions
of silver nitrate and of Rochelle salt results in the formation
of gold-coloured silver. But if we add a little sodium hy
droxide, either to the iron solution or the silver mixture, we
shall get a bluish-green product, Whose properties show that
it belongs to the blue class and not to the yellow. Even if a
solution of the hydroxide is added immediately after the iron
solution has been poured into the silver, the result is the same.
   There is, therefore, a well-marked tendency of acids to give
rise to the formation of the yellow product and of alkalics to
the blue. But this is a tendency only. Both substances can
be produced from neutral solutions, and slight changes are

                        on Allotropz'c Silver.                  339
 suf<U+FB01>cient to alter the product formed. Thus, ferrous tartrate
 in dilute solution acting on silver tartrate gives rise to the
 formation of the gold-coloured substance, but when citrates
 are substituted the blue substance is obtained.
    Production of Allotropz'c Silt-er by Inorganic Substances.—
 For reasons which will be mentioned presently the reduction
 of silver must take place gradually to produce the allotropic
 form, and for a time it seemed an invariable condition that
 an organic substance of some sort should be present. This,
 however, proves not to be essential. In a paper presented to
 the American Academy, and kindly read for me by Prof.
Remsen at the meeting in April last, I alluded brie<U+FB02>y to
 having found a. reaction depending upon inorganic agents
only.    It is as follows :—Sodium hypophosphite added to
silver nitrate does not etfcct reduction ; but when hypophos
phorous acid is set free by the addition of phosphoric acid, a
red coloration appears, indicating the presence of allotropic
silver. The coloration is transitory, no doubt because of the
strong tendency of free mineral acids to convert allotropic
to normal silver; but red and blue stains form on the sides of
the vessel.                              '
    Phosphorous acid gives similar results, though perhaps less
well marked.
   Action of Light on Blue Silt-en—This action differs with
different varieties : it was more especially examined with the
form that is obtained from the soda-dextrine silver solution
already described, by pouring the solution into an equal bulk
of water to which sulphuric acid had been added in the pro
portion of 4 cubic centim. to each 100 cubic centim. of water.
This form was selected because it is easy to obtain with great
constancy of result, and because it is one of the forms of
blue silver most sensitive to light.
   Exposed to light this substance <U+FB01>rst becomes more distinctly
blue, losing a slight greenish shade. With continued expo
sure it passes to a yel ow-brown shade, and <U+FB01>nally to a. per
fectly pure golden yellow of great brilliancy and lustre. This
last is the intermediate or crystalline form.
   The action of light on this form of silver is remarkable in
this respect, that its <U+FB01>rst effect is to increase the sensitiveness
to reagents.
   This result was so unexpected, and a priori so improbable,
that it was subjected to the most careful veri<U+FB01>cation before
being accepted. The action is very easily shown by exposing
a <U+FB01>lm of the substance to light, covering part of the surface
with an opaque screen. After twenty or thirty minutes of
exposure to strong summer sunshine the <U+FB01>lm may be plunged
                               2A2

340                  Mr. M. Carey Lea’s Notes
into a l-per-cent. solution of potassium ferridcyanide, when
the part exposed colours much sooner and more strongly than
that which was covered. The effect is shown still better by
placing the <U+FB01>lm in a frame, covering part with paper rendered
absolutely opaque by coating it with thick tin-foil, part with
translucent paper (thick white writing~paper or very thin
brown paper), and leaving part wholly exposed. After four
or <U+FB01>ve hours’ action of strong summer sunshine, the <U+FB01>lm is to
be treated with weak ferridcyanide. The part wholly exposed
having passed into the gold-coloured crystalline condition (if
the exposure has been suf<U+FB01>cient) is Wholly unacted upon ; the
part covered by the translucent paper is rapidlv attacked, that
wholly protected is attacked slowly. So that the portion
moderately acted on by light has very markedly increased in
sensitiveness thereby.
   It follows that upon this form of silver light has a reversing
action, <U+FB01>rst exalting its sensitiveness, then completely de
stroying it.                                         '
   It is impossible to overlook the analogy which exists between
this action of light and that which light exerts on silver
bromide. The latter substance, though incomparably more
sensitive to light, is subject to the same reversing action;
<U+FB01>rst gaining in sensitiveness to reducing agents, and then, by
continued exposure, becoming less sensitive than originally, a
change commonly known as solarization.
   Causes determining whether, in the reduction of Silver, the
Allotropic or the Normal form shall be produced—I have
examined the phenomena connected with the reduction of
silver under a great variety of conditions. These for the
most part do not deserve particular mention, but seem to lead
up to this generalization : that the reduction of silver may be
direct or indirect; direct when it passes from the condition
of the normal salt or oxide to that of the metal, indirect when
the change is <U+FB01>rst to suboxide or to a corresponding subsalt.
So far as my observation has gone, when the reduction is
direct the reduced silver always appears in' its ordinary form ;
but when the reduction is indirect the silver presents itself in
one of its allotropic states.
   The following reactions support this view.
   Three of the principal modes of formation of allotropic
silver are:-—(l) Reduction of silver cit-rate or tartrate by
ferrous citrate or tartrate ; (2) acting on silver nitrate or
oxide by dextrine and <U+FB01>xed alkaline hydroxide ;         acting on
silver nitrate or carbonate by tannin and <U+FB01>xed alkaline car
bonate. Now if, in either of these three cases, we interrupt
the action before it is complete by adding an excess of dilute

                            on Allotropz'c Silver.                       341
  hydrochloric acid, we shall obtain a dark chestnut-brown or
  sometimes purple-brown substance, which on examination
  proves to be a mixture of silver subchloride and protochloride.
  When, after complete removal of the excess of hydrochloric
  acid by thorough washing or, better, by boiling with distilled
  water, the substance is treated with cold dilute nitric acid,
 that portion of the subchloride which is not combined with
 the normal chloride is broken up, and there remains proto
 chloride of a very rich and intense rose-colour".
    The production of silver subchloride in all these cases would
 seem to indicate that the reduction when the acid was added
 was incomplete ; and that in case               a subsalt, and in cases
 (2) and (3) a suboxide was <U+FB01>rst formed as an intermediate
 step before complete reduction. Either of these substances
 would of course give rise to the formation of subchloride when
 treated with hydrochloric acid. It is important to observe
 that this result is to be obtained only by interrupting the
 reaction before it is complete. W'hen, for example, allotropic
 silver in solution is produced by the action of sodic hydroxide
 and dextrine, and after complete reduction hydrochloric acid
 is added, the liquid becomes <U+FB01>lled with grey normal silver
 which presently collects to a cake.           When this cake is well
 washed and boiled with water and then treated with dilute
 nitric acid, solution takes place: a trace of protochloride is
left behind. It has been mentioned elsewhere that hydro
chloric acid, though without action on ordinary silver, is
 capable of forming a variable quantity of protochloride when
placed in contact with allotropic silver.
    I have not met with any exception to this general principle,
 that when a reaction leading to the formation of allotropic
 silver is interrupted by the addition of hydrochloric acid,
 subchloride is abundantly formed as one of the products.
    In all such cases the reduction is evidently indirect.              The
silver does not lose at once the whole of its oxygen, but appa
 rently passes through an intermediate form, probabl Ag40,
the reduction of which tends to the formation of alotropic
silver.
    These facts lead directly up to the question, Does silver
exist in its subsalts in the allotropic form? There are some
facts that would support this view, especially the very rich
and varied coloration of the subsalts corresponding to the
   * This is a very beautiful reaction and deserves more particular mention
than can be given here. It is perhaps the best means for obtaining silver
protochloride, for which purpose I have often employed it, both on
account of its facility and certainty, and the very beautiful colour of the
product.

almost in<U+FB01>nite variety of colour of allotropic silver, whilst
normal salts of silver when formed with colourless acids are

of allotropic silver and its less speci<U+FB01>c gravity would seem to
indicate a. simpler molecular constitution than that of normal
silver.
XLlII. Some Applications of Physics and [Mathematics t0
    Geology. By G. GHREE, 111.11., Fellow of King’s College,
    Cambridge.
                       [Continued from p. 262.]
               PART 11. Some Geological Theories.
THE belief that the present spheroidal form of the earth
       necessarily betokens a prewous liquid, or at least plastic,
condition seems amongst Geologists almost as universal as
the belief that the earth but for the development of rotation
must have been a spherical body. Whether this latter con
clusion has any satisfactory basis apart from philosophical
speculations, it is not my present object to inquire. But
supposing, for the sake of argument, that the natural form of
the earth as undisturbed by rotation is spherical, the con
clusion that it ever was in a liquid or even in a plastic state
throughout is, according to the preceding results,not established
by its present spheroidal form. Yet even in such a standard
work as Geikie’s ‘Text-book of Geology,’ after reading the
discussion on p. 12 and the footnote attached, I fail to detect
a trace of the idea that the polar <U+FB02>attening might be called
forth by rotation in a truly solid body.
    Various geological writers, it is true, speak of a solid earth
as capable of changing its form, but they seem in reality to
regard the change as due to rupture or to the development of
a plastic condition. This appears, for instance, to be the view
actually held by Mr. Herbert Spencer in a short paper*
entitled “The Form of the Earth no proof of Original
Fluidity.” This paper has been referred to with a somewhat
inaccurate conception of its value and results by two recent
geological writers, so it claims some notice at our hands.
The <U+FB01>rst of the two writers referred to, Mr. W. B. Taylor 1',
says :—“ It is now nearly forty years since Herbert Spencer,
with a juster hysical insight [than Sir W. Thomson and
Professor Tait , contended and satisfactorily showed that a
solid earth (of any shape) would assume the oblate spheroidal
  ‘ Phil. Mag.     vol. xxx. 1847,p[1). 194—196.

                Physics and Mathematics to Geology.           343
form due to its rate of rotation, as certainly and promptly as
if it were liquid.” The other writer, Mr. A. Blytt *, amongst
other references to the paper says, “ I believe that Spencer is
the <U+FB01>rst who expressed the opinion that even a solid earth can
change its form.”                                                 .
     Mr. Spencer, after some statements as to the relativ
strength and agility of large and small animals, such as
elephants and <U+FB02>eas, formulates the general result that the
strength—called also “ resistance to fracture ”—-of a solid
structure varies as the square of its linear dimensions, while
the “agencies antagonistic to cohesive attraction,” 2'. e. gravi
tational and “centrifugal” forces, &c., vary as the cube.
Excepting a statement that this is obviously true of simple
longitudinal and torsional stress, the following is the sole
proof of his very general law supplied by Mr. Spencer :—
“ The strength of a bar of iron, timber, or other material sub
jected to the transverse strain varies as BD‘z/L ; B being the
breadth, D the depth, and L the length. Suppose the size of
this bar to be changed, whilst the ratios of its dimensions
continue the same ; then . . . the strength will vary as D2 . . .”
 (p. 195). The following is the conclusion drawn by Mr.
Spencer :—“ Viewed by the light of this principle, the fact
that the earth is an oblate spheroid does not seem to afford
any support to the hypothesis of original <U+FB02>uidity as commonly
understood. We must consider that, in respect of its obedience
to the goo-dynamic laws, the earth is <U+FB02>uid now and must
always remain so ; for the most tenacious substance with
 which we are acquainted, when subjected to the same forces
that are acting upon the earth’s crust, would exceed the limit
of self-support determined by the above law, before it attained
   *L—th of the earth’s bulk ” (p. 196).
  1,000,000,000
     Perhaps if one knew what Mr. Spencer means by “ the
limit of seltlsupport,” and what is the exact distinction he
 draws between “<U+FB02>uidity as commonly understood” and
 “<U+FB02>uidity in respect of obedience to gee-dynamic laws,” one
 might be in a position to form some estimate of his degree of
 physical insight; but so far as I can see all he satisfactorily
 shows is an extraordinary agility in jumping to conclusions.
 If his meaning is that deformation must accompany the
 action of gravitational and centrifugal forces, he might, if
 Maxwell’s view be correct, have added to the denominator
 of his estimate as many 0’s as the printer could spare; but if it
is the rupture of an elastic solid or its transformation into a

344              Mr. O. Ohree on some Applications of
plastic state to which he refers, as seems almost certain from
the context, he must have formed an extremely low estimate
of what strains a solid can stand.
    In the same passage Mr. Blytt refers to Mr. Peirce", Sir
J. W. Dawson 1', and Professor J. E. Toddi as holding that
a solid earth will alter its shape if the rate of rotation vary.
The views of Mr. Peirce I have not seen, but the other two
writers mentioned regard the solid earth itself as changing
shape only by means of a succession of what we may term
catastrophes. Their views seem identical with those which
 Mr. Blytt’s translator ascribes to him in the following words :
—“ The sea adjusts itself in accordance with the smallest
 change in the length of the day . . . . But the solid earth
 offers resistance to change of form, and begins to give way
 only when the tension reaches a certain amount” (p. 418).
 Mr. Blytt makes several distinct references to the subject,
and his remarks are not perhaps always strictly consistent.
 This, however, is hardly to be wondered at since he gives as
 the result of his investigations :——“ As has been stated, there
 prevails . . . a disagreement as to how far the earth will
 change its form, in case the centrifugal force varies. Thomson
 is most inclined to believe that it will not ; Darwin is of
 opinion that it will. And among other physicists whom
 I have consulted a similar divergence prevails upon this point.
 One thinks that a lengthening of the day even by several
 hours will be incapable of altering the form of the solid
 earth; another believes that the solid earth will probably
 change its form ust as easily as the sea” (p. 421).
     If Mr. Blytt should ever have further occasion to consult
 physicists on this or any allied point, he would find an. exact
 de<U+FB01>nition of such terms as solid a certain amount of protection
 from a priori speculations. Mr. Blytt’s own principal view
 seems due in part to an erroneous interpretation of Tresca’s
 experiments on the <U+FB02>ow of metals under pressure. They do
 not in reality justify his statement “By reason of the
 enormous pressure which prevails in the interior of the earth,
 it must be supposed that masses from a certain depth are
 more or less in a plastic state ” (p. 417). It was in fact pointed
 out some years ago by the Rev. Osmond Fisher§ that the
 existence of an ori<U+FB01>ce from which the metal can <U+FB02>ow con
 stitutes a complete difference between the conditions of

Tresca’s experiments and the state of a body subjected to

   Mr. Blytt apparently does not stand alone in believing
Sir W. Thomson to hold that the solid earth is incapable
of altering its form as the rotation alters, and that it possesses
the same eccentricity as when it solidi<U+FB01>ed. Professor Darwin
in ‘Nature,’ vol. xxxiv. (1886), pp. 420—3, seems also to put
this interpretation upon a passage he quotes from § 830 of
Thomson and Tait’s ‘Natural Philosophy.’ Supposing this
interpretation correct, Professor Darwin’s opinion that Sir
W. Thomson does not allow “a suf<U+FB01>cient margin for un
certainties ” expresses only a part of the objections 1 should
entertain. I <U+FB01>nd it dif<U+FB01>cult, however, to believe that Sir W.
Thomson, who elsewhere gives data for the eccentricity pro
duced by rotation in solid spheres of steel, can actually
suppose no change at all in the eccentricity to follow an
alteration in the angular velocity. Still it must he confessed
that though the passage contains the statement, “It must
necessarily remain uncertain whether the earth would from
time to time adjust itself completely to a <U+FB01>gure of equilibrium
adapted to the rotation,” its most natural interpretation is that
 given by Professor Darwin. I need hardly say that the con
 clusion that the earth, however solid, would retain a constant
 eccentricity while the rate of rotation varied, seems to me
 directly opposed to the conclusions to which the elastic solid
 theory leads.
    Professor Darwin himself, in his paper in ‘Nature,’ refers
 to Tresca’s experiments and thinks it probable there would
 be from time to time a <U+FB02>ow of material as the angular velocity
 altered. One of the “ uncertainties ” he refers to is the possi
 bility that, in accordance with Dr. Croll’s* views, a greater
 rapidity of denudation in equatorial than in polar regions may
 have reduced the eccentricity markedly below the value it pos
 sessed when the earth solidified. He does not seem, however,
 to refer to the considerable change of eccentricity that might
 occur in a solid through mere variation of elastic strain.
    As regards the present state of the earth’s interior there
 are,according to Geikie’s ‘ Text-book,’ p. 49, only three theories
 which merit serious consideration, viz. :—
    (1) That there is a solid crust a'nd a molten interior.
    (2) That with the exception of local vesicular spaces the
          earth is perfectly solid.
     (3) That the earth consists of a solid crust and nucleus
          with an intervening liquid layer.
                  * ‘Climate and Time ’ (1885), p. 336.

346             Mr. C. Chree on some Applications of
    According to the ‘Text-book,’ the theory of a thin crust con
taining liquid or viscous matter is exposed to “ weighty and
indeed insuperable objections,” p. 18, and “is now abandoned
 by most geologists,” p. 43.
    According to Dr. Croll" the “ general opinion among
geologists ” is that the earth “ consists of a. <U+FB02>uid interior sur
rounded by a thick and rigid [really solid] crust.”
    Professor l’restwich'f believes that “the crust rests on a
yielding substratum, and that of no great thickness.”               In
fact he advocates the third of the above-mentioned theories,
and believes 30 miles to be probably in excess of the crust’s
thickness. Most writers on the subject appear to have sub
sidiary theories of their own.
    Whether the assurance that the question is beyond the reach
of experiment accounts for the multitude of theories and the
con<U+FB01>dence with which they are proposed, is a question for
philosophers not mathematicians to consider. but it seems a
priori a possible explanation of such a declaration of faith as
that of Mr. W. B. Taylori :—“ The liquidity of our globe, and
the relative thinness of its encrusted envelope,—as attested by
all legitimate geological induction,—will be assumed without
misgivin g or hesitancy ; and the supposed mathematical argu
ments for its solidity ignored as essentially fallacious and
wholly inconclusive.’
    Of course, if the geological evidence were conclusive, it
would be mere waste of time further to consider the matter,
but the evidence that satis<U+FB01>es Mr. Taylor does not seem to
carry conviction to all geologists even in America. Mr. G. F.
Becker§, for instance, who appears to have some practical
experience, says :-—“ For a considerable number of years I
have constantly had the theory of the earth’s solidity in mind
while making <U+FB01>eld observations on upheaval and subsidence,
with the result that to my thinking, the phenomena are capable
of much more satisfactory explanation on a solid globe than
on an encrusted <U+FB02>uid one.”
   It may thus be not wholly unpro<U+FB01>table to glance brie<U+FB02>y at
some of the arguments which some of the advocates of the
several theories base on their ideas of the properties of solid
bodies.
    Mr. Taylor’s object is tb get an equatorial circumference
some 10 per cent. in excess of its present value, so as to
account for the lateral compression at the surface observed in

               Physics and Mathematics to Geology.            347
mountain-chains. Thus, following Professor Darwin*, he
supposes the earth to have once possessed a much greater
angular velocity than at present, and speaks of a “ consistent
crust (of some few miles thickness)” as having formed “ when
the rotation of our planet was at four times its present rate ”
(l. c. p. 257) . The equatorial radius would then have been, he
says, some 4359 miles, and the polar some 3291. The change
of shape, as the rotation fell off, would account, he thinks, for
observed phenomena. He considers his conclusions opposed
by Sir W. Thomson’s theory that the earth solidi<U+FB01>ed through
out and retains at least approximately its original eccentricity.
lt is on this point that he refers to the data supplied by Mr.
Herbert Spencer’s “ juster physical insight;” and he adds,
apparently as his own contribution to the argument,—-,“The
supposition that a granite mountain or equatorial‘protuberancc
400 miles high or 100 miles high could for a moment support
 itself, would hardly be entertained by a practical engineer ;”
and in a footnote, “The limiting modulus of height of a.
 granite pyramid (equalling one side of its square base) is
 somewhat less than eleven miles ” (l. c. p. 258). I am quite
ready to agree with Mr. Taylor that if solidi<U+FB01>cation occurred
 under the conditions he supposes the eccentricity must have
altered enormously and that in a non-elastic way, and I
hardly suppose that Sir W. Thomson would oppose this view.
No one, however, so far as I kuOW, has propounded the theory
of an elastic solid spheroidal earth of eccentricity '65 rotating
completely in six hours, so that the investigation of the strains
and stresses required by such a theory is unnecessary. I can
quite imagine that on any probable theory of density the
magnitude of the strains is hardly likely to be consistent with
the application of the mathematical theory of elasticity. The
force of Mr. Taylor’s remarks as to the pyramid I, however,
fail to see. Such an isolated mass exists under totally di<U+FB01>'er
ent conditions from any portion of a solid sphere or spheroid,
and one might as well argue as to the impossibility of a liquid
interior from the fact that an isolated liquid column 100 miles
high has not yet been observed on the earth’s surface. If
Mr. Taylor were, however, to calculate the strains and stresses
in such a thin shell as he supposes, of material showing any
thing resembling the structure of' ordinary rock, with a rate
of rotation such as he mentions, I very much doubt whether
he would <U+FB01>nd it in an essentially better position than his
imaginary pyramid.
   After this criticism Mr. Taylor considers the question of the
probable degree 0t rigidity of our planet quite irrelevant, but
                    “ Phil. Trans. (1879), p. 532.

  348          Mr. C. Chree on some Applications of
  the“ temptation is strong to waste upon it a collateral glance ”
  (l.c. p. 259). Accordingly he crushes Sir W. Thomson’s
 argument* from the tides by the remark—“ That a siliceous
 crust of 20 miles average thickness, and an overlying aqueous
 ocean of three miles average depth, should have (as required
 by the argument) so equal a. coefficient of mobility, that sea
 and land could thus together ‘rise and fall,’ might well be
 pronounced incredible ” (l. c. p. 260).
     He regards Sir W. Thomson as very seriously damaging
 his own argument by the admission that tides comparable in
 magnitude with those observed would occur even in a solid
 earth of steel. It does not seem to have occurred to him that
 the existence of a difference between the motions of the land
 and water may constitute an argument for solidityl'.
    Mr. Taylor admits one difficulty in his theory, viz. the
 nature and local characteristics of the plications actually
 observed ; and remarks:—“ While the force at the command of
 the rotating planet is abundantly suf<U+FB01>cient . . . evidently some
 supplementary considerations are requisite to give the observed
direction to this force,” . . . “ The mere mechanical dif<U+FB01>culty,
however, of transmitting stresses through comparatively un
 disturbed areas of hundreds of miles of a <U+FB02>exible, friable, and
practically plastic crust—with a large coef<U+FB01>cient of viscous
friction beneath—is not so formidable as might at <U+FB01>rst appear.
It must be borne in mind that the pressures derived from an
action so slow as from century to century to be scarcely
sensible, are of an order of very great intensity, but of very
small quantity” (l. c. p. 265). Mr. Taylor also infers from
“ various considerations ” that “ in all ages mountain building
has been at a maximum ; that is, the uplifted heights have
been the greatest which the average thickness of the crust at
the time was capable of supporting; so that the former has
been a constant function of the latter, the ratio being probably
not far from one-<U+FB01>fth” (l.c. p. 265). Mr. Taylor does not
state that this law of the uplifted heights is true of all lands   A»
as well as of all time, but the possibility that such may be the
case is rather alarming. He enters in fact into no unnecessary
details as to how he reached his conclusions, so that all one
can say is that measured by his own standard he is certainly
not inferior in physical insight even to Mr. Herbert Spencer.
Perhaps when he comes to deal with the “supplementary
considerations” he may supply suf<U+FB01>cient data for the mathe
matician to follow him.

“present very great rigidity of the earth ” as proved by mathe
matical and physical investigations, but complains of a “ want
of elasticity ” in the methods of the mathematicians (p. 538).
According to him, “The hypothesis moat compatible with the
geological phenomena is that of a central solid nucleus with
a molten yielding envelope—not <U+FB02>uid, but viscid or plastic; nor
is it necessary that this magma should be of any great thick
ness; but a thin crust is, it seems to me, an essential con
dition” (p. 543). Professor Prestwich adduces in support of
his views various arguments from geological phenomena which
seem of much weight. He has also various arguments of a
more or less physical character, but they seem to take a good
deal for granted. Thus, on p. 540, referring to plications in
the surface rocks, he says, “if the earth were solid through
out, the tangential pressure would result not in distorting or
crumpling, but in crushing and breaking.        As a rule no such
results are to be seen, and the strata have . . . yielded, as only
a free surface-plate could, to the deformation caused by lateral
pressure . . . a yielding bed, on which the crust could move
as a separate body, was necessary.” It seems to me that as
the phenomena of rupture are as yet very imperfectly ascer
tained, except perhaps for a few simple standard conditions,
Professor Prestwich has very little to go on but a priori ideas.
I fail to see, for instance, why pressures at or near the surface
of a solid sphere should necessarily produce fracture and not
<U+FB02>ow. Also it seems improbable that there would be a sharp
line of demarcation so as to enable a crust—which seems
clearly to mean a solid super<U+FB01>cial layer—to move as a separate
body on a “yielding bed.” Would not this imply a liquid
substratum with no appreciable viscosity? And supposing
there were a substratum of this kind, is there any suf<U+FB01>cient
experimental evidence that a solid crust of even a few miles
thickneSS would on the falling away of the liquid underneath
go into folds instead of being crushed and broken? Further,
 can plications, to the extent shown, say by the Alps, be re
 conciled with the retention of contemporaneous solidity?
 Supposing the earth to be essentially solid throughout, is there
any reason why the strain at some miles below the surface
should not locally at intervals exceed the elastic limit, with
the result for a time ofa state of <U+FB02>ow or plasticity throughout
a volume of greater or less extent? During such an epoch
 there would exist locally conditions somewhat resembling those
 which Professor Prestwich believes existent everywhere. It
 is true that one argument adduced by Professor Prestwich and
 others against the existence of separate reservoirs of molten ma
 terial—viz. the similarity in the character of volcanic products

 350           Mr. C. Chree on some. Applications of
all over the earth—applies equally against such an hypothesis.
 If, however, volcanic products be supposed to come from
 several miles below the surface, I see no obvious reason why
 they should not present similar characteristics everywhere.
N0 conclusive argument can well be based on the differences
 observed in the sedimentary strata, because the conditions
under which such strata are deposited are obviously of a varied
character.                                                        '
    In various passages of Professor Prestwich’s discussion of
the state of the earth one is apt to be puzzled by his falling
into the practice, by no means uncommon in geological
writings. of employing physical terms with a view to oratory
rather than to exposition. For instance, he speaks of con
traction “ due to the yielding 0f the weaker lines in the crust,
when the tension caused by the excessive strain (and of which
the <U+FB01>rst order of movement is an index) overcomes the re
sistance, and fractures and doubles up the strata ;” and he
adds, “Mountain-ranges are in fact the concluding term of
the stress which caused the deformation of the crust, and the
movements which at those times took place must have been
in<U+FB02>uenced by the greater energy of the strains then at work ”
 (p. 546). It is dif<U+FB01>cult to see here what is intended to be cause
and what effect. In fact, while a number of terms are em
ployed which in mathematics and physics have a fairly de<U+FB01>nite
meaning, I must confess my inability to form an adequate
conception of what is meant by the passage as a whole.
    Professor Prestwich refers (pp. 543, 544) to the hypothesis
of the late Professor E. Roche (in the reference to which a
 misprint gives the year 1861 for 1881) as supplying some
thing of the kind of earth he wants. Thus an examination
of Professor Roche’s work* may be of some service.
    He supposes the earth to consist of a central nucleus or
“bloc,” homogeneous but for a po=sible accumulation of
matter of greater density at the centre, and of a super<U+FB01>cial
layer of lighter material. Of the nucleus, with the gossible
exception of a small core of heavier matter, he says, “ a den
sité calculée, de 7 a 7'5, indique qu’elle est métallique, sans
cloute formée de fer. . . .” The speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the heavier
matter which may possibly exist at the Centre is, he says,
“ certainement bien inférieur [to 18], probablement 10 on 12
(argent, plomb),” p. 235. The outer layer or crust he sup
poses to have a speci<U+FB01>c gravity about 3, and a thickness of
about one sixth the earth’s radius. Between the crust and
the nucleus there exists, it may be everywhere or only locally,

molten matter such as appears at the surface in volcanic out
bursts, but the total volume occupied by this must be small.
Professor Roche takes three results as given ; viz. the earth’s
total mass, the eccentricity of its surface, and the ratio of the
principal moments of inertia, the last quantity being deduced
from astronomical data. He satis<U+FB01>es all the conditions he
recognizes by the aid of the following hypothesis regarding
his nucleus :——“Oe bloc a pris sa forme de<U+FB01>nitive sous l’in<U+FB02>u
ence d’une rotation moins rapide qu’elle n’est aujourd’hui,
ct il a conserve l’aplatissement correspondant, malgré les
accroissements successits do vitesse du systcme résultants de
sa contraction progressive” (p. 232). In other words, he
assumes the nucleus to have solidi<U+FB01>ed before the crust and that
it retains its shape unaltered. Thus as he regards the angular
velocity as increasing in consequence of the diminution in the
moment of inertia through contraction in cooling, the nucleus
possesses a smaller eccentricity than the crust. He supposes
only a. small difference in the length of the day at the dates of‘
the two solidi<U+FB01>cations, so that the di<U+FB02>'erence between the
eccentricities of the nucleus and crust is also small. This,
however, in no way justi<U+FB01>es his hypothesis that the nucleus
retains its form unaltered. If its material possessed the pro
perties of an elastic solid the eccentricity would certainly
 alter, and to an extent probably quite comparable with
 the alteration that would have occurred if it had remained
 <U+FB02>uid. Professor Roche seems in fact to treat his nucleus
 as possessed of the properties of the wholly imaginary per
 fectly rigid body.      He certainly introduces no equations
 such as ought to hold over the surface of an elastic solid sphe
 roid. The exact view he adopted as to the properties of solids
 it is, however, dif<U+FB01>cult to decide. On his p. 241 a brief state
 ment would imply that he did not regard each elementary
 layer of a solid sphere as of necessity totally self-supporting ;
 but on pp. 223, 224, .where the discussion is fuller, he says,
 “ Si l’on rejette la complete <U+FB01>nidité de la terre, il n’est plus
 possible d’attribuer a la compressibilité de ses couches la meme
 in<U+FB02>uence.” . . . “ Dans un solide, les tensions latérales sont
 variables et acquiérent parfois une valeur énorme. C’est
 ainsi qu’une couche pourrait se soutenir d’elle-méme comme
 une espcce de voute,'sans peser snr celle qui est au-dessous.”
 A solid layer supporting itself like an arch under the con
 ditions of matter near the earth’s surface treated as an elastic
 solid, presents strains far in excess of those which are regarded
 here as coming within the range of the mathematical theory.
  - On various grounds it seems to me that the criticism of a
 want of elasticity, though hardly in the sense intended by

 352     Applications of Physics and Mathematics to Geology.
 Professor Prestwich, may be strongly urged against Roche’s
 investigations.
    Some remarks of M.Roche’s, on his pp. 240, 241, throw con
 siderable light on his standpoint and that of many other
 theorists :—“ Les astronomes qui persistent a admettre la
 <U+FB02>uidité . . . . cherchent a éluder les objections de Hopkins et
 de Thomson, en attribuant . . . . au liquide central une vis
 cosité assez grande pour que . . . . l’ensemble en arrive 51.

 solidifié, mais admettre cette assimilation revient a dépouiller
 le milieu interne des propriétés ordinaires des liquides, et a
 lui en conserver le nom tout en l’identitiant a un corps solide.”
 He proceeds to point out that the mere question of a name is
 of no account, considering our ignorance of what would be
 the properties of matter under such pressures and at such a
temperature as the theory of <U+FB02>uidity would lead to. His line
 of argument is not very clear, but there is no hesitation appa
 rent in his conclusion :—-“ En effet, la pression supportée
 par les couches centrales, dans la supposition d’une complete
 <U+FB02>uidité, dépasserait deux millions et demi d’atmosphéres. La
 grandeur meme de ce nombre est a elle seule une objection
 péremptoire a l’hypothese qui y conduit.”
    Such a position as this may be all very well for a philo
sopher who supposes the external world a mere idea, the
 private property of his own mind and so necessarily obedient
to laws which his understanding can fully grasp, or for a
scientist who believes the earth created for the special purpose
of supplying problems of precisely that amount of dif<U+FB01>culty
which he personally is able to solve, but from a common-sense
point of view it seems utterly irrational. No physicist or
geologist has any reason to suppose that there are not nume
rous problems whose full comprehension requires more exten
sive knowledge than is possessed by himself or any of his
contemporaries.
   The necessity for theories has been eloquently urged by
Professor Darwin *, who says “A theory is, then, a necessity
for the advance of science, and we may regard it as the branch
of a living tree, of'whieh facts are the nourishment.” Employ
ing this simile, I must confess that the subject treated in this
paper resembles, in my opinion, a tree which combines a sad
deficiency of sap with a great superfluity of branches. It will,
I dare say, be generally admitted that the premature craving

 XLIV. On the Speci<U+FB01>c Heat of Basalt. By W. C. ROBERTS-,
        AUSTEN, C.B., F.R.S., and A. W. BUCKER, F.R.S.*
 HAVING been asked by- the Rev. 0. Fisher to determine
           for him the latent heat of basalt, we made some ex
periments on a specimen which was furnished to us by Prof.
   udd.
     Fragments of the rock were melted in a platinum crucible,
 and the junction ofa thermal couple consisting-ofplatiuumwith
 platinum containing 10 per cent. of rhodium was immersed
 in the pasty mass, which was then allowed to cool. The scale
 of the galvanometer had previously been standardized by an
 observation on the solidifying-point of pure gold, and the
pyrometer was standardized from time to time by the same
means. When the index spot of light reached the desired
point the wires were nipped off close to the basalt, and the
crucible and its contents were plunged into 1000 grams of
water contained in a silver calorimeter. The water was
stirred by a screw or fan of silver which was rotated by an
electric motor. The temperature was read by means of a
mercurial thermometer which had been carefully corrected.
    The two main sources of error in the experiments are pro
bably an uncertainty as to the mean temperature of the
basaltic mass owing to its being a bad conductor of heat,
and the fact that in the processes of heating and cooling it
undergoes more or less important changes of constitution.
    The <U+FB01>rst error was reduced to small proportions by using
small quantities of basalt, the mass employed rarely much
exceeding 20 grams.                                        .
    The second error is in part unavoidable. The rapidly
cooled basalt was always glassy like olivine.         We also found
that frequent heatings and coolings, and the nature of the
<U+FB02>ame—whether oxidizing or reducing—employed to heat the
mass appeared to affect the results very seriously.
    In some experiments the crucible was heated in the <U+FB02>ame

                 XLV. The New Theories of Solution.
            By JAMES WALKER, l).Sc., Ph.D.,F.R.S.E.*
   SINCE the theories of osmotic pressure and of electrolytic
          dissociation were in 1887 made generally accessible by
  their publication in the Ze-itschrift for physikalische Chemick
  they have in Germany and elsewhere on the Continent enjoyed
  an ever-increasing favour and popularity. In this country
  they have mostly been met with a passive resistance ; but in
  one or two cases where they con<U+FB02>ict with rival theories they
' have encountered active opposition.
       Mr. S. U. Pickering, in particular, has subjected them to
  unfavourable criticism, in the pages of this Magazine, at the
  Leeds meeting of the British Association, and elsewhere.
  His attack is twofold. In the case of osmotic pressure he
  compares the deductions from theory with the results of
  experiment, and endeavours to show discordance between
  them: against the dissociation hypothesis he seeks to raise
  “ theoretical objections of a fundamental character.”
       First, with regard to osmotic pressure, Mr. Pickering
  singles out the freezing-point of solutions from the many
  phenomena which have received an explanation from this,
  theory‘l', as the ground for his attack.            The hypothesis of
     it Communicated by the Author.
     1' Taking the osmotic-pressure theory in conjunction with his own,
  Arrhenius (Phil. Mag. xxviii. p. 36) enumerates seventeen heads under
  which these phenomena may be arranged—a number already too small to
  include the later researches of Ncrust and others on solutions.
                                    2B2

356                 Dr. James Walker on the
osmotic pressure claims to put us in a position to calculate
the freezing-point of a dilute solution if we know its com
position, the molecular weight of the substance in solution,
and certain easily determined physical constants of the sol
vent—provided that the solution is not an electrolyte. If the
solution conducts electricity, then, in order to <U+FB01>nd its freezing
point, we must in addition to the above data know its electrical
conductivity ; from which, by the help of the theory of elec
trolytic dissociation, we may calculate the correcting factor
to be applied to the value deduced directly from osmotic
pressure. A specimen showing how such a calculation is
made will be given in the sequel. Mr. Pickering contends
that the results of experiment are not in harmony with the
values given by the theory; and this is perfectly true as
regards the values calculated by Mr. Pickering.          But then
he has repeatedly confounded the laws deduced from van
’ t Hoth theor with the empirical relations stated by Baoult;
and, besides, as utterly ignored electrolytic dissociation in
his calculations. He says (Chem.‘News, lxiii. p. 171) :—
“ Professor Arrhenius accuses me of neglecting the effect of
dissociation when discussing the freezing-points. In this he
is quite right, for I do not believe in it.” Of course, the
assumption of such an attitude will undoubtedly enable Mr.
Pickering to <U+FB01>nd disagreement on comparing experiment
with calculation ; but, if the comparison is to be of any value,
it is surely evident that the theoretical numbers must be
legitimate deductions from the theory as expounded by its
originators, not as misconceived or distorted by its critics.      ‘
    Before proceeding further, we shall do well to look for a
moment at the conditions under which the law for the lowering
of the freezing-point is obtained from the hypothesis of
osmotic pressure. First of all, it must be understood that
the solutions considered are dilute; secondly, that they do
not conduct electricity; and, lastly, it is assumed that when
a solution freezes, the pure solvent alone separates out in the
solid form. If these conditions are ful<U+FB01>lled, it follows from
the theory that the depression produced by one molecular
weight of a substance (in grams) dissolved in 1000 grams of
solvent, will be constant for any one solvent, and equal to
'002T‘2 where T is the freezing-point in the absolute scale, and
   W    )
W the heat of fusion of the solvent (van ’t Hoff, Phil. Mag. xxvi.
p. 95). Further, it follows that the depression of the freezing
point is proportional to the concentration of the solution (Blag
den’s Law). That this law is a well-justi<U+FB01>ed generalization
where dilute non-electrolytic solutions are concerned, is amply

                      New Theories of Solution.                       357
proved by the agreement between experimental results and
the values calculated directly or indirectly by its aid. Mr.
Pickering, however, has made a number of accurate observa
tions on the freezing-points of dilute solutions, and states that
the numbers obtained by him are in discordance with those
demanded by the law. The solvent he employed was water :
the substances dissolved were sulphuric acid, calcium nitrate,
calcium chloride, and alcohol. A table of the deviation of
these solutions from regularity, Le. from Blagden’s Law, is
given by Mr. Pickering in ‘Nature,’ vol. xlii. p. 629 (also in
B. A. Reports, 1890, p. 316). It will be observed that only
the solution of alcohol is a non-electrolyte, and therefore it
only can be expected to give results in conformity with the
law in question. Now in Mr. Pickering’s table for dilute
solutions the freezing-point of the aqueous alcohol shows a.
maximum deviation from regularity of 000035, a result which
might indeed seem to coutirm the theory rather than contradict
it. Mr. Pickering, however, estimates his mean error at
0°‘0005, a seventh part of the above amount. This is some
what strange ; for on the same page where the claim to such
accuracy is <U+FB01>rst made (Chem. Soc. Journ. lvii. p. 335) he
compares two series of observations, made with different
instruments, with the following result * :—

        1'50               68%                ‘5846 ('1’)   —'0059
   The values for the two series are deduced from the
“smoothed ” curves drawn to represent them, i. e. errors of
individual experiments are already as far as possible eliminated.
Yet if we add up the differences without regard to sign, and
divide by their number, we <U+FB01>nd a mean difference of 0°‘003.
The result is quite the same if we compare the two series at
closer intervals, twenty corres onding points on the two curves
giving a mean difference of O '0033. Thus the only evidence
that Mr. Pickering places before us from which we can form
   * There are evidently some misprints in this table; I have taken the
dilferences as being correct.

358                 Dr. James Walker on the
an independent judgment of his accuracy, shows his mean
error in any one set of determinations to be many times
greater than his own estimate of it. The maximum deviation
exhibited by alcohol now falls within the magnitude of the
experimental error; and thus Mr. Pickering’s observations
must be looked upon as furnishing one more con<U+FB01>rmation of
Blagden’s Law and of van ’t Hotl"s theory.
   'With regard to the other three solutions, they cannot be
expected to follow this simple law, if the theory of electro
lytic dissociation is true. The theory, however, when applied
in conjunction with van ’t Hoti’s expression for the molecular
lowering, given above, enables us to calculate the freezing
point of dilute electrolytic solutions provided we know their
conductivity. Now very accurate determinations of the con
ductivity of dilute solutions have been made by Kohlrausch,
and from these Dr. Arrhenius has been at the pains to calcu
late v the freezing-points of the solutions studied by Mr.
Pickering, in order that a comparison might be instituted
 between the theoretical and the experimental numbers. A
 table embodying the results is given in the B. A. Report, 1890,
 p. 325 (Chem. News, lxiii. p. 148), and from it will be seen that
the agreement in the case of weak solutions is as satisfac
 tory as could be wished for. Arrhenius has there indicated
 the method of calculation, but it may be well that the matter
 should be looked into in somewhat greater detail, so that it
 may serve as an example of how such calculations are made,
 and show on what exceedingly simple principles they rest.
    We <U+FB01>nd from van ’t Ho<U+FB01>"s formula that a normal aqueous
 solution of a non-electrolyte, i. e. a solution containing one
 molecular weight (in grams) per litre, freezes at —l°'90.
 But sulphuric-acid solutions conduct electricity readily, which
 means, in the light of Arrhenius’s theory, that the molecules
                                                                 +
 are to a great extent dissociated into charged molecules H
 and 504. Each original molecule on dissociation gives three
                                 +    +     —
 charged molecules (HQSO4 = H + H + $04), which act, as far
 as the freezing-point is concerned, exactly like any other
 molecules. If the whole of the sulphuric acid in a normal
 solution were thus dissociated, the freezing-point would be,
 not —1°'90, but —-1°'9O x 3: —-5°'7(). We know, however,
 that this is not the case, and that the dissociation varies with
 the dilution ; so that it remains to determine the dissociated
 proportion of the sulphuric acid at the various concentrations.
 According to the theory this is given by the ratio of the
 molecular conductivity of the substance in a given solution

 there are now actually l+2a molecules; for each original
 molecule on dissociation becomes three, Le. contributes two
 additional molecules. We must, therefore, multiply the
 freezing-point as deduced from the theory of osmotic pressure
 by the factor i=1+2a determined for each concentration.
 Kohlrausch’s results give us both ,u.,, and am. His estimate
 of pm for -12~HgSO4 as 370/107 Siemens units is admittedly
 only a rough one, for the molecular conductivity for in
 <U+FB01>nite dilution is dif<U+FB01>cult to determine in the case of many
 acids and bases. It is quite de<U+FB01>nite, however, with salts ; and
 by applying the dissociation theory we can deduce pm for
 éHZSCh “ith great accuracy from pan for éKgSO‘v the differ
 ence between the values for potassium and hydrogen salts
 being constant according to the theory. The number thus
{obtained is 356/107, and with it the accordance between experi
 ment and theory is complete.
     With respect to the deviations from constancy shown by
 stronger solutions, Mr. Pickering states that on the osmotic
 pressure theory the depression of the freezing-point in their
 case should be abnormally small. This conclusion is reached
 from somewhat crude mechanical considerations regarding the
 balance of attraction betWeen the solvent and the dissolved
molecules (Journ. Chem. Soc. lvii. pp. 354, 355 ; Phil. Mag.
xxix. p. 500). The matter is not nearly so simple as Mr.
Pickering imagines. Even in the case of true gases (oxygen,
nitrogen, 850.) there is a deviation from Boyle’s Law, <U+FB01>rst in
one direction and then in the other, as more and more gas is
compressed into a given volume. In a solution the relations
are much more complex, and it is impossible at present to
predict what the behaviour of any particular substance in
solution will be with regard to osmotic pressure (and the
freezing-point) when the concentration passes beyond certain
limitsT. Mr. Bickering commits a strange mistake when he
writes the following sentence (Chem. News, lxiii. p. 171) :—
“ It is also remarkable that Professor Arrhenius should be so
anxious to show that strong solutions have an abnormally high
freezing-point, since he starts by telling us that according to the

360                    Dr. James Walker on the
physical theory the reverse should be the case.” Nowhere has
Arrhenius made any such statement: the deviation may be
in one direction or the other, depending on the nature of the
dissolved body and of the solvent.
    The objections urged b Mr. Pickering against the theory
of osmotic pressure in t e Philosophical Magazine, xxix.
 .p. 490-501, fall to the ground when we take into account
his neglect of electrolytic dissociation, his (then) ignorance of
the difference between Raoult’s empirical value for the mole
cular depression and the value deduced from van ’t Hoff’s
theory, and the odd selection of solvents to which Mr. Shaw
drew attention 'at the B. A. meeting (Report, 1890, p. 336).
 We are given, for example, the molecular depression for water
 dissolved in H2304,H2O. One is inclined to look upon the
 addition of water to this substance rather as the dilution of a
 strong sulphuric-acid solution than as the dissolution of water
in a de<U+FB01>nite solvent. That such a hydrate as H2804,H2O can
 be crystallized is no proof that it has previously existed as
 such in solution. All experiments, for instance, have gone to
 show that racemie acid and racemates do not exist in aqueous
 solution although they are always obtained on evaporation.
 Again, although ammonium chloride may be sublimed un
 changed, yet it does not exist as such in the vaporous state.
 The fact, therefore, that certain hydrates can be obtained as
 crystalline solids in nowise proves their existence in solutions
 from which they separate ; so that Mr. Pickering’s choice of
 them for solvents renders his experimental results in their
 application to the new theories worthless“.
    Mr. Pickering takes'exception to the theory of dissociation
into ions on the ground that it “seems to be quite irrecon
cilable with our ideas of the relative stability of various bodies,
   * In a footnote to the paper cited, p. 494, the following passage
 occurs : —“ Van ’t Ho<U+FB01>’s statement as to ltaoult’s position respecting the
 high and low values of substances in water is certainl remarkable; he
 says (Phil. Mag. 1888, xxvi. p. 99), ‘ Raoult did not discover the exist
 ence of so-called normal [meaning small] molecular depression of freezing
 point and lowering of va. our-pressure until he investigated organic com
 pounds; their behaviour ls almost without exception regular.’ As a matter
 of fact, Raoult investigated organic substances <U+FB01>rst . . . . .” In this Mr.
 Pickering is perfectly accurate. The misunderstanding has arisen from a
 somewhat ambiguous German sentence of which the above is a. transla
 tion: it runs-- “ so wurde auch die Existenz der sogenannten normalen
 molekularen Gefrierpunktserniedrigung and Dam fdruckverminderuug erst
 aufgefunden, als Raoult sich den organise-hen 'erbindungen zuwandte:
 da eben tritt das normale Verhalten fast ausnahmsios ein ” (Zeit. physikal.
 Chem. i. p. 501). The meaning is of course—“ the existence of so-called
 normal depression . . . . was not discovered until organic compounds were
 investigated ” (by Raoult).

                        New Theories of Solution.                      361
and with the principle of the conservation of energy.” It is
a curious fact, and one not without a certain signi<U+FB01>cance, that
it has been left to chemists to discover that the dissociation
theory is at variance with the fundamental principles of
energ , while physicists, on the other hand, have preferred to
base t eir objections on more or less purely chemical grounds.
Prof. Oliver Lodge, for example, refers to “that extreme
state of dissociation which physically seems to be so satisfac
tory and chemically so abhorrent ” (Brit. Assoc. Report, 1890,
p. 331). Surely if the theory is such as to satisfy so eminent
an authority as Prof. Lodge on the physical side, Mr. Picker
ing need not concern himself to show that it is in contradic
tion to the fundamental laws of energy. What it contradicts
is Mr. Pickering’s preconceived ideas of the nature of atoms
and molecules and the energy associated with them*.
     In his criticism in the July number of this Magazine
 (p. 21) Mr. Pickering lays great stress on the fact that the
supporters of the dissociation theory sometimes speak of the
heat of electrolytic dissociation as being positive, sometimes
as being negative. Arrhenius, in his original paper (1884),
 stated that heat was absorbed on dissociation ; whereas “they
now hold, I believe, that the decomposition of molecules into
 ions evolves heat.” “This change of front must rather be
inferred directly from the writings of dissociationists than
from any de<U+FB01>nite retraction which they have published ; nor
 does it appear to have been followed by all the supporters of
 the theory. . . . . . It may also be remarked that up to July
 1889 Ostwald seems to have held both views, and to have
 adopted either just as the exigencies of the case suggested. . . .
 The <U+FB01>rst point, therefore, on which the dissociationists should
 give us de<U+FB01>nite information is whether dissociation of a
 molecule into its ions is supposed to evolve or to absorb heat.”
 If Mr. Pickering had not been more zealous to criticise the
 dissociation theory than to properly comprehend it, he would
 scarcely have written these sentences. Two years ago, in the
 recognized organ of the“ dissociationists ” (Zeitsclm physikul.
    * That Mr. Pickering is occasionally liable to mistake divergencies
 from his own opinions for contradictions to the “ recognized principles of
 science ” may also be seen in his paper “ On Chemical Action ” (‘ Nature,’
 xliii. p. 165), where he accuses thermochemists of implying that “ physical
 changes are not subservient to the law of the conservation of energy.”
 He assumes that all chemical reactions must be accompanied by evolution
 of heat, and explains the known exceptions to this arbitrary principle by
 introducing dissociation as an accessory process in endothermic reactions.
 This explanation, given by Berthelot (lllécanique Chimique, ii. p. 452), is
 rejected by Horstmann (l’hysikalisclw C'lu'mie, vol. i. part 2 of Graham
 Ulto’s Lelu'buch) and others as unnecessary.

362                   Dr. James Walker on the
Chem. iv. p. 96), Arrhenius published a paper on this very
subject under the title “ Ueber die Dissociationswarme und
den Ein<U+FB02>uss der Temperatur auf den Dissociationsgrad der
Elektrolyte ;” yet of the existence of this important memoir
Mr. Pickering is completely ignorant, although an abstract of
the results is contained in the Brit. Assoc. Report, 1890,
pp. 220—223. In it the whole subject is discussed in great
detail, numerical values being given for the heat of dissociation
in nearly thirty instances. Some of them are positive, some
negative, and mostly all are small. One of the most striking,
if not one of the main, points in this paper is the prediction
given by the dissociation theory of the existence of (hitherto
unknown) electrolytic solutions with negative~ temperature
coet<U+FB01>cients for the conductivity, and the perfect ful<U+FB01>lment of
the prediction in the cases investigated (Brit. Assoc. Report,
1890, p. 223 ; Sack, Wied. Ann. xliii. p. 212).
   A few paragraphs further on (p. 23) it is asked :—“ How can
it be maintained that the positive electri<U+FB01>cation of the hydrogen
and the negative electrification of the chlorine would dissolve
the union between them? . . . . . Further, if these so-called
 + and — charges repel each other, why are they attracted
by the — and + charges respectively on electrodes during
electrolysis? . . . . . On the new theory, the electric charges
are the cause of decomposition.” Here, again, there are put
into the mouths of the dissociationists words which they
never uttered. No one has stated that the electrical charges
are the cause of dissociation, although they always accompany
the phenomenon ; nor' has any one ventured to assert that the
~+ and — charges repel each other,—in fact, the assumption
that they attract each other as usual is the basis on which
Nernst has built his elegant theory of the diffusion &c. of salt
solutions (Zeitsc/lr. p/rysz'kal. C/zem. ii. p. 617). In a com
pletely dissociated solution—one of hydrochloric acid let us
assume—the positive and negative atoms are no longer paired
off together, but there is rather supposed to exist a complete
communism amongst the charged atoms. The positive ions
                                       _
  +
 (H) still attract the negative ions (Cl), but one hydrogen ion no
longer exhausts all its attraction on one chlorine ion. There
is rather, now, attraction between it and all the chlorine ions in
its neighbourhood ; and, similarly, any one chlorine ion is
attracted in all possible directions by the hydrogen ions sur
rounding it. It is only when the positive ions are separated
en bloc from the negative ions, that the electrostatic forces
between the opposite kinds of electricity become evident.
   After discussing the Clausius-VVilliamson hypothesis from

                     New Theories of Solution.                     363
the a priori standpoint, Mr. Pickering goes on to say (100. cit.
p. 26): “It does not seem necessary, however, to imagine
the presence of free atoms to explain the phenomena of elec
trolysis (of. Lodge, Brit. Assoc. Report, 1887, p. 338).” At
the place cited, and more fully in his ‘Modern Views of
Electricity,’ p. 80, Prof. Lodge gives as his opinion that
“ the addition of the idea of double-decomposition and inter
change to the original hypothesis of Grotthus explains all
that is required by the facts, viz. a virtual or potential disso
ciation, a momentary state of hovering and indecision, without
the need for any continuous and actual dissociation.”
   It appears to me that such a potential dissociation is not
quite suf<U+FB01>cient to explain the known facts of the behaviour
of electrolytic solutions. The state of hovering or indecision
can only be brought about, according to the theory, by the
approach of two molecules of the electrolyte to such a distance
that they can interchange radicals. The number of molecules
whose radicals are in this undecided state is therefore depend
ent on the number of molecular collisions per unit time, the
Word collision being used to express a conjunction of mole
cules close enough for atomic interchange to take place. On
the other hand, the conductivity depends directly on the num
ber of potential interchanges, and therefore on the number of
collisions.    New in very dilute solutions the speed of the ions
cannot be supposed to be altered by any increase in the dilu
tion, and therefore the conductivity will be regulated by the
number of collisions alone. In such salt-solutions as Kohl
 rausch investigated, where 1 gram-molecular-weight of salt
 was dissolved in as much as 100,000 litres of water (2'. e. where
there was only one molecule of salt to 5,500,000 molecules of
 water*), it was found that the conductivity is proportional to
the concentration. But halving the concentration (2'. e. the
 number of salt-molecules in a given volume) would diminish
 the number of collisions of the salt-molecules to a quarter of
 the former value. We should, therefore, expect on the
 potential-dissociation hypothesis that in dilute solutions the
 conductivity should be proportional, not to the concentration,
 but to the square of the concentration, which is not the case.
 On this ground, then, we must reject, 1 think, the idea of
 virtual dissociation brought about by atomic interchange. It
 might be contended that collisions of the salt-molecules with
 the water-molecules would be su<U+FB02>icient to cause the potential
 dissociation ; but if that were so, sodium hydrate and hydro
chloric acid would always exist in a solution of common salt,
   * It is here assumed that the molecule of liquid water is the same as
 that of water-vapour—probably it is twice as large.

and could be separated by diffusion or otherwise, which is
contrary to all experience. The assumption of a merely
potential dissociation thus fails to account for the known
facts, whereas an actual dissociation at once affords the neces
sary explanation. Many interesting examples of the appli
cation of the dissociation theory to explain the electrical
behaviour of salt-solutions are to be found in a paper by
Ostwald, in the Zeitsc/w. physi/cal. Chem. ii. p. 270.
   With reference to the existence of hydrates in solution,
Mr. Pickering (Phil. Mag. xxxii. p. 91) brings against Mr.
S. Lupton the charge of entirely ignoring the cumulative
character of the evidenCe brought forward in favour of the
hydrate hypothesis. Now this cumulative character of the
evidence is precisely on what the theories of osmotic pressure
and of electrolytic dissociation chie<U+FB02>y rely, and what Mr.
Pickering altogether neglects. In the short paper by Arrhenius
already referred to (Phil. Mag. xxviii. p. 36) attention is drawn
to the great number of subjects dealt with by these theories
jointly: in almost all cases a quantitative comparison of the
 results of experiment with deductions from the theory has been
 possible, with the most satisfactory results.
    The only rival hypothesis which has been actively pursued
is the hydrate theory, according to which the dissolved sub~
stance in an aqueous solution is combined with all the water
 (except in very dilute solutions) to form one or more hydrates.
This is of course a perfectly legitimate hypothesis so far as it
goes; but besides suffering at present from a slight arbi
trariness in its employment where the interpretation of expe
rimental data is in question, it also labours under the dis
advantage of being unable to afford any secure basis for
calculation. Mr. Pickering, it is true, has calculated the
freezing-points of sulphuric-acid solutions by its aid, and on
account of the apparent great elasticity of his method has
obtained results in perfect accord with his experiments (Brit.
Assoc. Report, 1890, p. 321 ; ‘Nature,’ xlii. p. 631). When
 one looks, however, a little closely into the details of the cal
 culation, the concordance appears of questionable value. He
 attributes the lowering produced by the dissolved substance
 to three distinct causes, which he classi<U+FB01>es as (l) mechanical,
 (2) physical, and         chemical. The actual depression is
 made equal to the sum of three components depending on the
 above causes. First of all, we have the mechanical lowering
 based on Person’s so-called absolute zero for liquids, z'. e. the
 temperature below which a liquid will not solidify (Proc.
 Chem. Soc. 1889—90, p. 150). Mr. Pickering himself has
 subsequently proved Person’s views to be utterly untenable

                  New Modi<U+FB01>cation of Phosphorus.             365
(Proc. Roy. Soc. xlix. p. 11), so the mechanical depression is
robbed of its basis. The physical and chemical lowerings are
arrived at from a thorough confusion of heat with tempera
ture. “A de<U+FB01>nite hydrate, such as H2SO4, 13H20, can only
give up its water by decomposing into the next lower hydrate,
H2304, 9H20 in the instance taken: the heat absorbed in
this change is given by the heat of dissolution curve (863 cal.),
and will lower the temperature of a mixture with a heat
capacity of 223'5 cal. by 3°25 ” (Proc. Chem. Soc. 1889,
p. 151). This 3°‘5 is the “ chemical lowering.” Now while
it may be true that the absorption of 863 cal. “ will lower the
temperature of a mixture with a heat-capacity of 223'5 cal.
by 3°“5,” it is dif<U+FB01>cult to see what this has to do with the
freezing-point of sulphuric-acid solutions. The freezing-point
of an aqueous solution is the temperature at which it is in
equilibrium with ice; and no matter what amount of heat
may be developed on the congelation, this temperature will
remain unaffected. Heat, whether from an external or an
internal source, cannot affect the temperature of equilibrium
between the solid and the liquid : it can only change in the
one case the relative proportions of the substances, and in the
other the latent heat of fusion. Calculations on such a
theoretical foundation need scarcely be further considered.
    Whatever of future development may await the hydrate
theory, it cannot to-day be looked upon as a serious rival to
the hypotheses of osmotic pressure and electrolytic dissociation,
the list of whose achievements is constantly increasing.

         XLVI. On a New Modi<U+FB01>cation of Phosphorus.
    By H. M. VERNON, Scholar of Illerton. College, waorcl*.
HAVING occasion to melt some ordinary yellow phos
        phorus, it was noticed that in some cases the phosphorus
melted suddenly, and had no de<U+FB01>nitely marked melting-point,
while in other cases it exhibited a de<U+FB01>nite melting-point, as
most other bodies do when passing from the solid to the liquid
state. Further examination con<U+FB01>rmed this, and showed that
these were two di<U+FB01>erent crystalline varieties of phosphorus,
which differed in other properties as well.
    In order to examine the manner in which the phosphorus
passed from the solid to the liquid state, quantities of about
twenty-<U+FB01>ve grams were placed in a bulb-tube or broad test
                     “ Communicated by the Author.

            366                    Mr. H. M. Vernon on a lVew
            tube and a thermometer placed in it. In all experiments on
            the rate of rise of temperature of the phosphorus, the tube
            was placed in an air-bath kept at 100° by being surrounded
            with boiling water. The tube of phosphorus was closed and
            the thermometer kept in position by means of a cork at the
            mouth; but no especial precaution was taken to make this
            tight to prevent air getting to the phosphorus, as a few drops
            of water forming a layer about 1 millim. thick were always
            introduced into the tube, and this effectually stopped any
            oxidation or combustion of the phosphorus, even when it was
            heated to 100°._ In a few cases a thin layer of oil was sub
            stituted for the water. The thermometer was graduated in
            tenths of a degree, and as all readings were taken with a
            cathetometer, it was read to a hundredth ofa degree. The
            temperature was read at intervals ofa quarter or halt'a minute.

            hedral phosphorus. The second curve shows the rate of rise
            of temperature of the other variety of' phosphorus. It will be
            seen that there is no sudden change in the form of the curve
            at any point, and so it might be thought to be impossible to

                  Modi<U+FB01>cation of Phosphorus.                 367
determine the melting-point. The direction of the lower part
of the curve is, however, different from that of the curve from
about 46° upwards; and if these two parts of the curve be
produced in their same directions, the point where they meet
will approximately indicate what may be taken as the melting
point of the phosphorus. The melting-point thus found is
450'3, or a degree above that of the other variety. It may be
wondered where all the latent heat of fusion of this phosphorus
has disappeared to. On producing the upper parts of the
curves of both varieties of phosphorus, it will be seen that the
amount of heat required to melt them, which is represented
by the area of the <U+FB01>gures a bed, efg, is considerable in each
case, though it is greatest for the variety with the de<U+FB01>nite
melting-point. With the variety with the unde<U+FB01>ned melting
point, however, the latent heat of fusion begins to be absorbed
at about 38° or lower, and being spread over such a large
temperature-interval its effect is at <U+FB01>rst sight masked.
   As these two different varieties of phosphorus were both
obtained from the same specimen, supposed to contain phos
phorus all in the same state, it is evident that it must be
possible to easily convert one variety into the other. After a
great many attempts had been made at converting them into
one another by beating them to different temperatures, it was
at length found that the modi<U+FB01>cation into which the phos
phorus solidi<U+FB01>ed depended only on the manner of its solidi<U+FB01>
cation. If it- cooled to below its solidi<U+FB01>cation-point and then
solidi<U+FB01>ed, the temperature being thereby raised considerably,
the variety with the unde<U+FB01>ned melting—point was formed ;
while if it began to solidify the moment it reached its soliditi
cation-point Without cooling below it, the variety with the
de<U+FB01>nite melting-point was formed. In order to cool it below
43°'8, the temperature of solidi<U+FB01>cation, without solidi<U+FB01>cation
taking place, the tube containing the liquid phosphorus covered
over with a layer of water or oil is placed in hot water, and
the whole left to cool. The phosphorus generally cools to
 about 30° before solidi<U+FB01>cation, and then the temperature
 rushes up to about 43°, or higher if the mass of phosphorus
 be large enough. To produce the other variety, the tube of
 melted phosphorus is plunged into cold water. The sides of
 the tube thus become cold enough to solidify some of the
 phosphorus, which causes the whole mass to solidify when it
 cools to 43°‘8. The same effect may be produced by intro
 ducing some solid phosphorus into the liquid at about 44°, or
 by scraping a glass rod against some fragments of glass pre
 viously added to the melted phosphorus.
    A single rapid or slow cooling in this manner is not gene
rally sut<U+FB01>cient to wholly convert one variety of phosphorus

 368               Mr. H. M. Vernon on a New
 into the other, but it must be repeated another time in the
 slow cooling, and two or three times more in the rapid cooling.
 It is very easy to obtain an idea as to the proportions of each
variety present in any specimen by taking its rate of rise of
 temperature, the form of the curve obtained being between
those of the two given, and the melting-point also varying
between the extremes 44°"3 and 45°‘3. It is therefore
 possible by alternate rapid and slow cooling to convert phos
phorus backwards and forwards from one variety to the other
as often as is desired.                                       .
    As a single rapid or slow cooling is not suf<U+FB01>cient to wholly
 convert one variety into the other, it follows that the phos
 phorus, when melted, must also be in a different state in the
 two cases, thus differing from sulphur, with which, though
there are several different crystalline states, there is only one
liquid state.
    Up to the present phosphorus has always been stated to
crystallize in octahedral or rhombic dodecahedral crystals. It
is necessary therefore to ascertain which of the above varieties
 crystallizes in this form, and in what form the other variety
crystallizes. It was at <U+FB01>rst endeavoured to crystallize out the
phosphorus from its solution in carbon disulphide. About
equal volumes of carbon disulphide and phosphorus were
mixed and the excess of carbon disulphide distilled off ; but
the solution, though left for some time, did not crystallize.
It would probably be only possible to obtain good crystals by
operating on very large quantities of material, as carbon
disulphide dissolves about eighteen times its weight of phos
phorus, and so the whole of the phosphorus would crystallize
out by the evaporation of this very small quantity of carbon
disulphide. Benzene only dissolves phosphorus to a slight
extent, but it was found possible to obtain small crystals by
<U+FB01>rst warming the benzene with the phosphorus. to 40° and
then allowing the solution to slowly cool down. All the ope
rations were performed in sealed glass tubes with a bend in the
middle, and after the crystals had been deposited in one limb
the benzene was poured off into the other, the crystals being
thus left free for examination. The tubes containing the
crystals were then examined under a microscope with a power
of ten diameters. The crystals from the modi<U+FB01>cation with
the unde<U+FB01>ned melting-point were observed distinctly to crys
tallize in rhombic prisms; but as, from their in<U+FB02>ammable
nature, it was not possible to examine them except in the
glass tube, no measurements could be taken. Some of the
crystals were in masses, with smaller crystals shooting out in
different directions at right angles from the larger ones : none
of the crystals were, however, more than about 5 millim. in

                    illodi<U+FB01>catz'on of Phosphorus. H             369
  length.    Some of them could be seen on end, and the lengths
  of these axes appeared to be in about the ratio 1 :2. The
  crystals from the modi<U+FB01>cation of phosphorus with the de<U+FB01>nite
  melting-point, on examination in the same way, were observed
  to consist of masses of octahedral crystals. In size they were
  scarcely as large as those of the preceding modi<U+FB01>cation, but
  there was no dif<U+FB01>culty in identifying them. It is thus con
  cluded that it is the variety of phosphorus with the de<U+FB01>nite
  melting-point and,crystallizing in octahedra which has pre
  viously been examined and described ; while the variety with
  the unde<U+FB01>ned melting—point, crystallizing in rhombic prisms, -
  is the modi<U+FB01>cation not previously described.
     As the different crystalline modi<U+FB01>cations of sulphur exhibit
  a marked difference in their 'speci<U+FB01>c gravities, that of octa
  hedral sulphur being 202, and that of prismatic sulphur 1'97,
  a similar difference might be expected to obtain for phos
  phorus. The speci<U+FB01>c gravity was determined by <U+FB01>rst weighing
  about 20 grams of the phosphorus, cut in oblong lumps and
  well dried, in a small stopper-ed weighing-bottle, then <U+FB01>lling
  up the bottle with distilled water and weighing again, and
  lastly weighing the bottle full of water only. All determina
  tions were made at 13° 0., and were compared with water at
  the same temperature. Two different specimens of the octa
  hedral modi<U+FB01>cation were found to have the speci<U+FB01>c gravities
  1'8177 and 1'8184; while for two different specimens of the
  prismatic modi<U+FB01>cation the values 1'8272 and 1'8254 were
  obtained. The discrepancy between these two last values is
  probably due to the fact of one specimen containing some of
  the other variety of phosphorus in it, so the extreme value,
  1'8272, is probably the more correct. A sample of phosphorus
  known to contain both varieties had a speci<U+FB01>c gravity 1'8237.
  The difference between the speci<U+FB01>c gravities of the two modi
  <U+FB01>cations is about half a per cent. This is not nearly so great
  as that of the two varieties of sulphur, which is about two and
‘ a half per cent., but it is large enough to be easily appreciable.
  The phosphorus used in these determinations was generally
  only puri<U+FB01>ed by shaking it with a hot solution of sulphuric
  acid and potassium bichromate. Some of it was also distilled,
  but no difference in speci<U+FB01>c gravity or other properties was
  observable, so the oxidizing agent alone is probably enough
  to remove any impurities existing in it.
      As the curves for the rate of rise of temperature show a
   considerable difference in the latent heat of fusion of the two
   varieties of phosphorus, a corresponding difference ought to
   be exhibited in the amounts of heat given out on solidi<U+FB01>cation.

370      Messrs. Walker and Hatton on the Determination of
 melting-point phosphorus, while curve (4) shows the rate
 of cooling of the other variety : both these curves are for the
 cooling of equal quantities of phosphorus. It will be seen
that there is an appreciable difference in the heat given out;
and this toois to a great extent masked, as the rhombic modi<U+FB01>
cation, on solidifying without cooling previously to below its
 solidi<U+FB01>cation-point, is converted to a great extent into the
 octahedral modi<U+FB01>cation.          This is also the reason why both
 modi<U+FB01>cations solidify at the same temperature, viz. 430'8.
 This temperature may therefore be taken as the solidifying
 point of the octahedral modi<U+FB01>cation, while that of the other
variety is not known. It must, however, be a temperature
 below and not above this point. In order to determine it
accurately, it would be necessary to cool a very large quantity
of liquid phosphorus to below this temperature and then cause
 it to solidify, and notice the temperature to which the ther
mometer rushed up.            If only a moderate quantity of phos
phorus, as <U+FB01>fty grams, were thus treated, the heat- of solidi<U+FB01>
cation would not be suf<U+FB01>cient to raise the temperature of the
mass up to the true temperature of solidi<U+FB01>cation.
     The different properties of the two modi<U+FB01>cations of phos
phorus may be summed up as follows :—

XLVII. Experimental Determination of the Beats in the Vibra
    tions of a Revolving Bell. By JAMES WALKER, 111.11., and
    J. L. S. HATTON, B.A., Demonstrators at the Clarendon
    Laboratory, waord *.
     N a communication read before the British Association
        at Leeds, and in a paper published in the Proceedings
of the Cambridge Philosophical Society (vol. vii. p. 101)
                    * Communicated by the Authors.

         the Beats in the Vibrations of a Revolving Bell.     371
 Mr. G. H. Bryan has given the mathematical theory of the
 rotation of the nodal meridians in a revolving cylinder or bell.
 According to his analysis, the number of beats per revolution
 due to this rotation of the nodal meridians is independent of
 the velocity of revolution, and is given in the case of two
 dimensional oscillations by 28(82—1)/(S.2+1), 2s being the
 number of nodal meridians, and in the general case by
 2s(s2+7t,—l)/(s2+7t,+l), 7», being a quantity which can
 never be negative.
    Mr. Bryan’s own experiments with two different champagne
 glasses gave “about 2'6 and 2'2 beats per revolution respec
tively for the gravest tone,” of which “the latter is too small
 to be compatible with ” the theory, and it was at his suggestion
that we have undertaken some experiments at the Clarendon
Laboratory in order to test the same. The results already
obtained appear of suf<U+FB01>cient interest to warrant this pre
liminary note on the subject, pending a fuller investigation
with more accurate apparatus.
    The glass to be experimented upon was rigidly attached to
the disk of a whirling-table carrying a graduated scale ; and
an index, which could be held in a <U+FB01>xed position in space, was
carried round with the disk when released by the observer.
The glass was caused to vibrate by means of a bow : when the
note obtained was free from beats and of the required pitch
the disk was rotated. In order to prevent complicating the
experiment by the acceleration of the disk several beats were
<U+FB01>rst observed, and when the intervals at which they occurred
appeared to be uniform the index was released on hearing a
beat, and after the observation of a certain number the disk
was stopped. The whole number of turns were counted, and
the position of the index when the disk was stopped gave the
fraction of a turn.
   In order to concentrate the sound and to prevent any
motion of the ear during the observations, the beats were
observed through a tube <U+FB01>xed with one extremity close to the
revolving glass. A di<U+FB02>iculty arose in obtaining glasses which
gave a pure tone, and it was found that, even after careful
selection of the glass, accuracy was only to he arrived at when
the vibrations were excited with great care by means of a
violin-bow. The glasses selected were bell-shaped.
   The following were the results obtained, and it will be
observed that in each case the mean is slightly above the
value calculated from the two-dimensional theory.

   These results afford, moreover, the means of determining
in the case of a non-revolving bell the proportion of the whole
kinetic energy which is due to the longitudinal components
of the displacement, and thus give an indication of the extent
to which the vibrations differ from two-dimensional vibrations
on the one hand (in which the proportion is zero), and from
the vibrations of a circular plate on the other hand (in which
the proportion is unity).
   For, according to Mr. Bryan’s results, the kinetic energy in
the case of a non-revolving bell is proportional to (7t, + 1 + s2)p2,
in which expression the term Mp? arises from the longitudinal
motion, and hence the proportion in question is

XLVIII. On Periodic M'otion of a Finite Conservative System.
                    By Sir WILLIAM THOMSON*.
1. IN a recent communication to the Royal Society‘l' I
     _    suggested an extension to stable systems in general of
the well-known theory of “fundamental modes” for systems
in which the potential energy is a quadratic function of
coordinates and the kinetic energy a quadratic function of
velocities, each with constant coef<U+FB01>cients. This extension is
the subject of the present communication to the British
Association.
    2. In its title, “<U+FB01>nite ” means that the number of freedoms
is <U+FB01>nite and that the distance between no two points of the
system can increase without limit. “Conservative” means
that the kinetic energy is always altered by the same difference
when the system passes from either to the other of any two
con<U+FB01>gurations, whatever be the amount given to it when the
system is projected from any con<U+FB01>guration and left to move
off undisturbed.       By “path of a system ” we shall under
stand, in generalized dynamics, the succession of con<U+FB01>gurations
through which the system passes in any actual motion: or
the group of single lines constituting the paths traversed by
all points of the system. By an “orbit ” we shall understand
a circuital path ; or a “ path ” of which every constituent line
is a complete circuit, and all moving points are always at
corresponding points of their circuits at the same time.
    3. It will be convenient, though not necessary, to occa
sionally use the expression, “potential energy of the system
in any con<U+FB01>guration.”        \Vhen used at all it shall mean the
difference by which the kinetic energy is diminished when the
system passes to the con<U+FB01>guration considered, from a con
<U+FB01>guration or the con<U+FB01>guration such that passage to any other
permitted con<U+FB01>guration involves diminution of the kinetic
energy. By “total energy” of the system in any condition
will be meant the sum of its kinetic and potential energies.
    4. Theorem of periodic motion. For every given value, E,
of the total energy, there is a fully determinate orbit such
that if the system be set in motion along it, at any con
 <U+FB01>guration of it, with the given total energy, E, it will
circulate periodically in it.

 Boltzmann Doctrine regarding Distribution of Energy."

376             Sir IV. Thomson on Periodic .Uoiz'nn
   5. To prove this theorem, suppose the number of freedoms
to be 1'. Any con<U+FB01>guration, Q, is fully speci<U+FB01>ed byz' given
values for the 2' coordinates respectively. Su >pose now the
system to pass through some con<U+FB01>guration, Q, at two times
separated by an interval T, and to have the same velocities and
directions of motion at those times.      The path thus travelled
in this interval is an orbit, and it is periodically traVelled over
in successive intervals each equal to T. To <U+FB01>nd how to pro
cure ful<U+FB01>lment of our supposition, let the system be started
from any con<U+FB01>guration, Q, with any i values for thez' velocity
components (or rates of variation per unit-time, of the i coordi
nates). To cause it to return to Q after some unknown time
T, we have i—l equations to be satis<U+FB01>ed : and to cause i—l
of its velocity-components to have the same values at the
second as at the <U+FB01>rst passage through Q we have i—l equa
tions to satisfy ; and, in virtue of the equation of energy, the
remaining velocity-component also must hftve the same value
at the two times. That the total energy may have the prescribed
value, E, we have another equation. Thus we have in all
 2i—l equations, among coordinates and velocity-components.
 Eliminate among these the z' velocity-components, and there
 remain i—l equations among the z' coordinates which are the
 conditions necessary and suf<U+FB01>cient to secure that Q is a con
 <U+FB01>guration of an orbit of total energy E. Being i—l equations
 amongz' coordinates, they leave only one freedom, that is to
 say they fully determine one path; of which, in the language
 of generalized analytical geometry, they are the equations.
 The or any path so determined is an orbit of total energy, E.
 Thus is proved the Theorem of § 4.
    6. The solution of the determinate problem of <U+FB01>nding an
 orbit whose total energy has the prescribed value, E, is, in
 general, in<U+FB01>nitely multiple, with different periods for the
 in<U+FB01>nite number of different orbits determined by it.
    7. A simple illustration with only two freedoms, will help
to the full understanding of § 6 for every case, of any number
 of variables. Consider a jointed double pendulum consisting
 of two rigid bodies, A and B : one (A) supported on a <U+FB01>xed
 horizontal axis, I ; the other (B) supported on a parallel axis,
J, <U+FB01>xed relatively to A: and for simplicity let G, the centre
 of gravity of A, be in the plane of the two axes. Call H the
centre of gravity of B.      Let ¢ be the angle between the plane
I J and the vertical plane through I, which we shall call IV ;
and let x? be the angle between the plane J H and the vertical.
The coordinates and velocities of the system in any condition
of motion are gb, 11!, qt,      The potential energy of the sys
tem, in kinetic units, will be ng, where W denotes the sum

                 ofa. Finite Conservative System.              377
of the masses, and z the height of their centre of gravity in
any con<U+FB01>guration of the system, above its lowest. Suppose
now A to be placed in any particular position (to; and let it
be required to <U+FB01>nd what must be the position, 1P0, of B, and with
what velocities, (to, \Iro we must start A and B in motion, so that
the <U+FB01>rst time 4) has again the same value, ¢0, that is to say when
A has made one complete turn in either direction, the system
shall be wholly in the same position (¢0,1[r0) and moving with
the same velocity (dimxlro) (in the same direction understood)
as at the beginning. This implies only two equations, \[r=\[/o;
and either \I}=\lro, or d>=<to (because either of these' implies
the other in virtue of the equation of energy). And we have
just two disposables, \lro, and either 1h or <in (the given total
energy E determining either ¢0 or 1% when the other is
known). The solution of this determinate problem is clearly
possible, unless E is too small : but it is not generally unique.
We may have solutions with the velocities of A and B started
each in the positive direction, or each negative, or one nega
tive and the other positive. If A is a <U+FB02>ywheel of very great
moment of inertia, and B a comparatively small pendulum
hung on a crank-pin attached to it, and if for simplicity we
suppose the crank to be counterpoised, so- that the centre of
gravity of A is in its axis, it is clear that, according to the
greater or less value given for E, B may turn round and round
many times before A comes again to its primitive position qbo.
But it is clear that, though not generally unique, our problem
of <U+FB01>nding periodic motion with just one complete turn of A
in its period has no real solution unless E is large enough ;
 has many solutions for large enough values of E ,- but has
not an in<U+FB01>nite number of solutions for any <U+FB01>nite value of E.
    8. Again, let the condition be that, not the <U+FB01>rst time, but the
second time A passes through its initial position, both coordi
 nates and both velocities have their primitive values. When
 the given value of the total energy is not too great, the
 periodic motion which we now have will be purely vibratory;
 and the solution clearly duplex. But if E be great enough, A
 may still merely vibrate, while B may go round and round, <U+FB01>rst
 in one direction and then in the other, within the period of A’s
 vibration. If the condition be that not at the <U+FB01>rst and not at
 the second, but at the third transit of A across its initial
 position, both coordinates and both velocities have their pri
 mitive values, we may, with suf<U+FB01>ciently great total energy,
 have still wilder acrobatic performances, both bodies going
 round and round sometimes in one direction and sometimes

 378           Sir W. Thomson on Periodic Motion
 in the other.     Still with any <U+FB01>nite value for E there is only
 a <U+FB01>nite number of modes for the motion subject to the con
 dition that the third transit of A through its initial position
 completes the <U+FB01>rst period. Wilder and wilder vagaries we
have to think of if the <U+FB01>rst period is completed at the fourth
 transit of A ; and so on.
    9. This terrible Frankenstein of a problem is all involved
 in a very simple mathematical statement not including any
 declaration that it is the <U+FB01>rst, or the second, or the third, or
 other speci<U+FB01>ed, transit of A that completes the <U+FB01>rst period.
 It will probably be convenient to arrange so as to <U+FB01>nd a
 transcendental equation which will have an in<U+FB01>nite number
 of <U+FB01>nite groups of roots equal to the periods of the modes of
 the periodic motions.
    10. The case of no gravity presents a vastly simpler problem,
 of which the main solution has no doubt been many times
 found in terms of elliptic functions in the Cambridge Senate
house and Smith’s Prize examinations. The character of the
solution of this, as of all “adynamic” problems, is indepen
 dent of the absolute value of the given energy, and of duo. It
depends only on the value of the ratio \[rO/q<U+FB01>o, which of course
may be either positive or negative. In the general solution
\p—qb is clearly a periodic function of the time; and our
question of periodicity relatively to a <U+FB01>xed plane through I
resolves itself into'this :—During the period of the variation
of 11r—¢, is the change of ¢ either zero or a numeric com
mensurable with 2w? A corresponding question occurs for
every case in which our “system” is free in space, without
any <U+FB01>xed guides, and with no disturbing force from other
bodies ; as, for example, in the question of rigorous periodicity
of the motion of three bodies such as the earth, moon, and
sun, or of any <U+FB01>nite number of mutually attracting bodies,
such as the solar system, to be considered presently.
   11. An (idealized) ordinary clock with weight, and pen
dulum, and dead-beat escapement, affords an interesting
illustration. For simplicity let the cord be perfectly <U+FB02>exible
and inextensible ; let the cord-drum be rigidly <U+FB01>xed on the
shaft of the escapement-wheel ; let the escapement be rigidly
<U+FB01>xed to the pendulum ; and let the pendulum be a rigid body on
perfect knife-edge bearings. Thus we have virtually two bodies,
each with one freedom: A the escapement-wheel, cord, and
weight; B the escapement and pendulum. Each impact of
tooth on escapement is, in every clock and watch, followed by
a mutual recoil. This recoil probably in almost all practical
cases goes so far as to produce complete separation, followed
 by several more impacts and recoils before the tooth escapes,

                   of a Finite Conservative System.                     379
and the corresponding next tooth falls on the other side of
the escapement. But there is a loss of energy by impacts and
slipping, both on the non-working and on the working faces
of the escapement. The loss on the working faces could be dis
pensed with : but the loss on the non-working faces is essential
to the going of the clock. In our idealized clock we suppose
each recoil to exactly reverse the relative motion of tooth and
escapement in the direction perpendicular to the common
tangent plane of the two surfaces at their point of impact;
and we suppose the surfaces to be perfectly frictionless, so
that the in<U+FB01>nitely great mutual force at the instant of each
impact is exactly in that direction. The jumping action thus
produced would keep stopping the clock and letting it go on
again: and would utterly prevent any regularity of going.
Therefore I add the following arrangement of energy-receivers
to annul the shocks on the non-working faces of the escape
ment :—Prolong the shaft of the escapement-wheel, and <U+FB01>x
on it, in helical order, sixty little arms each carrying at its
end a disk, with its front face in a plane through the axis.
Adjust the escapement,-wheel on its shaft, so that when each
of its thirty teeth strikes one or other of the two branches of
the escapement, the lowest one of those sixty disks has its front
face vertical. On a horizontal plane below the prolongation
of the shaft place sixty little balls (energy-receivers) in such
positions that each shall be struck by a disk just before the
corresponding tooth touches the corresponding branch of the
escapement. Let the mass of each ball be equal to the proper
inertia-equivalent* of A, (the escapement-wheel, &c., and
driving-weight). Each ball struck by it, receives the whole
kinetic energy which A had before the impact ; and leaves A
at rest, with a tooth of the escapement-wheel pressing on a non
working face of the escapement. Fix sixty rigid stops to pre
vent the balls from, in any circumstances, (§§ 13 . . . 16), going
too far behind the positions in which they are initially placed.
Each of these stops must be slotted, to allow the proper disk
of the escapement-shaft to strike the ball and afterwards pass
clear through with its carrying arm. For brevity these
forked steps will be called the home-stops.                Fix also sixty
other stops, (<U+FB01>eld-stops we shall call them) in such positions
that the balls shall strike them all simultaneously and at
exactly the instant (§ 12) when the weight strikes the bottom
of the clock-case.
   * Let 1- be the radius of the cord-drum: W the driving-weight: k the
 radius of gyration, and w the wei ht of the whole rotating body con
 sisting of corddrum, escapement-w eel, shaft, and 60 arms and disks: a
 the length of each arm reckoned from the axis to the point of its disk
 which strikes the ball. The “ proper inertia-equivalent ” is (\Vr2 +wk") /a2.

380             Sir \V. Thomson on Period/c Motion
    12. Suppose now the pendulum of our ideal clock, with its
weight wound up very nearly to the top, to be started with
suf<U+FB01>cient range to let it keep going. For simplicity let this
range be small enough to secure that when the weight is run
down, the augmented range of vibration will still be within the
limits allowed for proper action of the escapement mechanism.
Let. the bottom of the clock-case be a rigid horizontal plane
<U+FB01>xed relatively to the framework bearing'the wheel and pen
dulum in exactly such a position that when the Weight, in
running down, strikes it, the pendulum is at either end of its
range. The weight jumps up after the impact, and the clock
goes backwards, the energy-receivers return home from their
<U+FB01>eld stops at exactly the right times, retracing exactly every
step till the weight (wound up by the energy of the pendulum
and of the returning energy-receivers) passes through its
initial position. If it is allowed to go higher till it strikes
against an unadjusted stop, the clock may be stopped for a
time, with the pendulum vibrating through a moderately
small range, and one tooth of the wheel chattering against
one working facet of the escapement : but “ sooner or later ”
(very soon) the tooth will escape; the clock will again go
forward ; the weight will run down, and again strike the
bottom and jump from it, this time not when the pendulum is
quite exactly at either end of its range.
    13. Complicated but quite orderly action will follow ; and
“sooner or later” a tooth will be hooked up by the escape
ment and the clock will go backwards a beat or two; but
after a very few beats, if more than one, it will go forward
till the weight strikes the bottom again. “ Sooner or later ”
the bottom will be struck at a time when the pendulum is
very nearly at rest at either end of its range and when several
energy-receivers are in such positions as to arrive home and
strike disks at right times ; and the clock will go backwards
for a good many beats.
    14. “ Sooner or later,” that is to say after some <U+FB01>nite number
of millions of millions of years, the weight will strike the bottom
when the pendulum is so very nearly at rest at either end of
its range and all the sixty balls so very nearly striking each
its <U+FB01>eld-stop, that the clock will be driven back, winding up
the weight till it again strikes the top stop, and immediately,
or after a very few beats, begins again to go forward and
let the weight run down. But our subject is not the fortuitous
concourse of atoms. It is “periodic motion of a <U+FB01>nite
system.”
    15. Returning therefore to the end of § 12; let the top
stop be so adjusted that it is struck by the weight at an instant

                of a Finite Conse'rvatire System.           38L
when the pendulum is at one end of its range. The clock
instantly begins to go forward ; and goes on retracing every
step, and repeating every one of the numerous impacts, of its
<U+FB01>rst forward motion ; till the weight strikes the bottom exactly
when each of the sixty balls is striking its <U+FB01>eld-stop, and
when the pendulum is at one end of its range, the same end
of its range as when the weight struck the bottom the <U+FB01>rst
time. Thus a perfectly periodic motion goes on for ever.
   16. During any of the half-periods in which the clock is
going forward, and the weight running down, any moderate
disturbance, such as a slight blow on the pendulum, or a
holding of the escapement-wheel stopped for some time, large
or small, will make no noticeable difference in the subsequent
motion : till the weight reaches the bottom of its range, when
we <U+FB01>nd that the periodicity is lost, and the state of things
described in      13, 14 supervenes. But any such disturbance
during a half-period when the clock is going backwards causes
the backward motion to cease and regular forward motion to
follow, immediately, or after a few beats, a greater or less
 number according as the disturbance is exceedingly in<U+FB01>ni
tesimal or but moderately small. This is a true dynamical
illustration of the “dissipation of energy,” and helps to show
 the vanity of attempts which have been made to found
 “ Carnot’s Principle,” or “the Second Law of Thermo
 dynamics,” or theories of chemical action, on Lagrange’s
 generalized equations of motion.
    17. Consider the “problem of the three bodies,” in two
 varieties ; <U+FB01>rst “ the Lunar Theory,” secondly “ the Planetary
 Theory.” One body (the Sun) is in each case vastly larger
 than either of the two others. In the first case the two others
 (the Earth and Moon) are so near one another in comparison
 with the Sun’s distance from either that his force produces
 but a small disturbance of the relative motion of the Earth
 and Moon under their own mutual attraction. In the second
 case, two planets move each chie<U+FB02>y under the Sun’s in<U+FB02>uence
 with comparatively small disturbance by their own mutual
 attraction. In each case we shall, for simplicity, neglect the
 motion of the Sun’s centre of gravity, and consider him as an
 absolutely <U+FB01>xed “ centre of force.”
    18. Taking <U+FB01>rst the lunar theory, suppose the centre of
 gravity, I, of Earth and Moon to move very approximately in
 a circle round the Sun.    Now (without necessarily considering
 that the Moon is much smaller than the Earth) at an instant
 when the line M I E passes through S give equal and opposite
 momentums to M and E in the line M E so as to annul their
 relative motion in this line if they had any, and to cause each

 382          Sir W. Thomson on Periodic Jlotion.
 to move exactly perpendicularly to it. If the next time their
 line passes through S they are again moving perpendicularly
 to ME, their motion relatively to S I is rigorously periodic.
 This we see by considering that if both motions are reversed
 at any instant, M and E will exactly retrace their paths ; and
 if such a reversal is made at an instant of perpendicularly
 crossing the line ST, the retraced paths are similar to the
 direct paths which are traced when there is no reversal.
    19. Hence if the three bodies be given in line, S M E, we
 secure rigorous periodicity of their motion if we project them
in contrary directions perpendicular to this line with exactly
such velocities that the next time M E is again in line with S,
now S E M, their directions of motion are again perpendicular
to E M. The problem of doing this has three solutions ; in one
of which the velocities of projection are so great that M and
E are carried far away from one another, in opposite direc
tions round the Sun till they again come near one another
and in line on the far side of the Sun. Excludin this case
we have certainly only two solutions left. In these     describes
exceedingly nearly a circle round the Sun; while M and E
move relatively to the point I and the line IS, somewhat
approximately in circles, but to a second approximation in the
ellipses corresponding to the lunar perturbation called the
variation, and quite rigorously in two constant similar closed
curves each differing very little from the variational ellipse.
The centre of the variational ellipse is at I : its major axis is
perpendicular to S I and exceeds the minor axis by approxi
mately 1/179'6, being the square of the ratio (1/13'4) of the
angular velocity of S I to the angular velocity of M E, each
relative to an absolutely <U+FB01>xed direction. There are two solu
tions of this kind, in one of which (as in the actual case of
Earth and Moon) E M turns samewards as, in the other
contrary-wards to, SE.
    20. If M E were two or three times as     reat as it is when
the three bodies are in line, S ME, and 0t er dimensions the
same, we should still have a solution for periodicity corre
sponding to that of § 19, but with the orbital curves of M and
S round I differing very largely from circles and largely from
ellipses. When M E exceeds a certain limit, this kind of solution
becomes impossible. It would be not wholly uninteresting to
follow the character of the orbital curves round I for increas
ing magnitudes of M E until they are lost. The solution
referred to and rejected in § 19 is still available and becomes
now more interesting, but not so interesting as the correspon
ding solution in which M and E, now two planets, are pro
jected so as to revolve in the same directions round the Sun.

   21. Rigorously periodic motion of two planets. Given SVE
in line, the Sun and two planets at distances such as those of
Venus and the Earth :——it is required to project them with
such velocities that the subsequent motion is rigorously
periodic. A <U+FB01>rst solution is obtained by projecting them
perpendicularly to VE with such velocities that their periods
of revolution round S are approximately equal; and exactly
such that at the next time when V E is again in line with S,
the motions are rigorously perpendicular to this line. The
velocities which must be given to ful<U+FB01>l this condition must be
such that the major axes of the ellipses approximately described
are approximately equal. This solution, however, belongs
rather to the Cometary than to the Planetary Theory.
   22. Project the planets perpendicularly to S V E with
such velocities that after some given number of times of their
being in line with the Sun, their motions are, for the <U+FB01>rst time
again, perpendicular to S V E. The determinate velocities
which ful<U+FB01>l thiscondition must I think be such that the orbits
are approximately ellipses of eccentricities not differing much
from those required to make the major axes such that the
periods have the proper commensurability to render the line
of the three bodies at the second perpendicular crossing
approximately coincident with their line at the initial perpen
dicular crossing.

XLIX. On some of the Efects of lllagnetism on Rods of Iron,
   Nickel, and other Metals which have received a permanent
    Torsional Set ; and a new form of Chronograph Stylus. By
    FREDERICK J. SMITH, Mllard Lecturer lilech. and Phys.,
    Trinity College, Oxford“.
 DURING the present year I have gone through rather a
        long series of experiments with a view to discover some
 form of chronograph stylus which would respond to rapid
 vibrations and make a clear record of its vibrations on the
 moving plate of a chronograph. I have succeeded in <U+FB01>nding
 a combination which appears to give satisfactory results.
 During the research several facts of interest bearing on a
 certain branch of magnetic induction presented themselves.
 I beg respectfully to give a summary of some of them in the
                      * Communicated by the Author.

form of short notes.       In the last two notes will be found
a description of the application of one of the phenomena to
the production of a chronograph stylus. I have added below,
a list of some of the papers which treat of relationships which
exist between stress and electromagnetic induction.
    1. In 1841 Joule showed that if an iron bar was magnetized
it was increased in length ; he also found that if an iron bar
was subjected to considerable tension and then magnetized it
was shortened. Since Joule’s discovery the action of the force
of magnetization on iron subjected to stress has been investi
gated by Matteucci, Compt. Rend. t. xxiv. p. 301 (1847) ;
\Vertheim, ibid. xxxv. p. 702 (1852); also Ann de Chem. et
de Phys. [3],t. l. p. 385 (1857) ; Villari, Pogg. Ann. (1868);

Trans. 1879, p. 55; Prof. Hughes, Proc. R. S. (1881), xxxi.
p. 524 ; id. ibid. xxxiii. p. 25; Mr. S. Bidwell, Proc. R. S.
xi. p. 257 (1886) ; ditto. xlvii. p. 496 ; Prof. Ewing, Proc.
Roy. Soc. vol. xxxvi. p. 117 ; ‘ Nature,’ vols. xlii., xliii.
       Wiedemann, Galvanismus. p. 447, showed that under
certain conditions twisted iron wires untwist on magnetization.
His words are :—“ Die gedrillten Eisendrahte detordiren sich
also bei der Magnetisirung.” He made his experiments on an
iron wire suspended in a vertical position and weighted with
a considerable mass, viz. 1103 grammes. By means of a
disk attached to it, and a cord and weight, torsion was given
to the iron wire. A coil of copper wire, in the axis of which
was the iron wire, was used for magnetizing the latter ; change
of torsion was read by means of a mirror and scale seen in
the <U+FB01>eld of a telescope. In his experiments torsional set was not
produced, or if so in only a very small degree. In my own
work rods of iron, steel, and nickel which were not weighted
and had received permanent torsional set were experimented
on. The magnetizing force H used by me was many times
 greater than that used by Wiedemann ; as far as I can calculate
probably in some cases thirty-<U+FB01>ve times as great. I arrived
at this conclusion by assuming his coil to have had next to no
 resistance, also that the whole number of cells mentioned were
used by him.
    3. The <U+FB01>rst experiment was arranged to <U+FB01>nd out whether a
magnetic <U+FB01>eld of force acting on an iron rod only subject to its
own weight would set upa torsional stress in it. The follow
ing apparatus was used :—-A magnetizing coil 50 centim. long,
wound on a glass tube 08% centim. external diameter ; the
number of turns of silk-covered copper wire 0'6 millim.
diameter was 3865; the coil was wound so as to have no
component along its length, its magnetizing force for one

ampere was H: W —97 l C.G.S. units.                          The 0011
was <U+FB01>xed vertically on a strong board. Under its loWer
end, at a distance of 4 centim., a brass frame was <U+FB01>xed
carrying a mirror on an axle, the axis of which coincided with
that of the coil. The rods to be examined were the same length
as the coil but elongated at each end with nonmagnetic wire ;
these were passed through the coil and attached at one end to
the axle of the mirror, which was used in conjunction with a
telescope and scale. Any minute torsion of the rod could be
accurately measured. The scale was placed at a distance of
226 centim. from the axis of the mirror, the wire was passed
through collars within the tube; these kept it in a central
position and prevented any movement sideways. By means of
a liquid resistance in the circuit the current was regulated, so
that the value of H could be easily changed.
   4. The <U+FB01>rst iron rod which was tested was 50 centim. long
and 0'162 centim. in diameter, well annealed by being placed
in a tube furnace and raised to a bright red heat and cooled
slowly. (All the metals were supplied by Messrs. Johnson
and Matthey, and may be considered as pure as can be pro
cured.) The reading of the scale as seen in the telescope
was brought to zero, and then the rod was magnetized with a
magnetizing force H of 21'5 O.G.S. units. A rotation of
0'1 centim. was produced in a direction with clock-hands to a
person looking from the <U+FB01>xed end down the rod ; when the
current was broken it returned instantly to its initial position.
A very delicate thermometer was put from time to time in
the usual position of a rod under examination and then the
current was put on as for an experiment ; no change of tem
perature could be detected, so that the effect produced was
due to the magnetizing force alone.
   5. The rod in (4) was replaced by one which had received
a permanent torsional set of seven revolutions. To give this
amount of torsion the rod was <U+FB01>xed at one end and then the
other was rotated through over eight complete revolutions, it
was <U+FB01>nally left with a twist of seven revolutions. The twist was
with clock-hands to a person looking down the rod from the
<U+FB01>xed end as an axis of the couple ; it was then subjected to a
force H=21‘5. This instantly produced a further torsion in
the same direction as the initial torsion of 5 scale-divisions.
The scale (divided into centim. and millim.) was in this and
all the following experiments 180 centim. from the mirror.
The effect was carefully examined by several observers and
always reproduced when required. In subsequent experiments
I found that when the rotation was large it could be readily
made visible by the addition of a light pointer attached to the

    6. On reversing the current the direction of torsion was
'not reversed. A similar rod, with the same amount of torsion
 in the opposite direction,was further twisted by the magnetic
 force in the direction of the initial torsion. When the current
 was off, the rod returned to its original position. Subsequent
 experiments showed that there was a limit to this torsion by
 magnetism.
    7. The next experiment was arranged _to <U+FB01>nd out any re
 lationship which might exist between the magnetizing force
 and the amount of torsion.                                                   _

 permanent torsion of. 2 , 3 ,4, &c. showed that for a small
magnetizing force the de<U+FB02>exion rose almost proportional to
it, and that after a certain point further torsion was not pro
duced by increasing the magnetizing force, and that ultimately
with a greater magnetizing force the rod began very slightly
to untwist.
   8. The next experiment was made to discover any relation?
ship which might exist between the initial torsion of the rod
and that added to it by the force of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld when the
magnetic force was constant. The following results were ob
tained. Up to some value of initial torsion between 10 and
15 the de<U+FB01>exion produced ‘by magnetization is a maximum,
and then it decreases as the torsion rises.

By initial torsion I mean that the rod receiVed a permanent
torsional set of 1 ,2 ,3, &c. complete revolutions.
   9. I noticed in the case of the last two values that after
each magnetization the rod began to slowly untwist when
the current was taken off. After each experiment the reading
fell below the figure it started at. As an instance, the initial
position was at 60 divisions; when the current was on, 69
was reached, and when the current was taken off the reading
was 59.
   Subsequent experiments showed that when a rod having
permanent torsional set was used in induction experiments
with a ballistic galvanometer, the induction followed in value
the slow change of torsion of the rod.                In some cases I noted
the slow change from last February to the present time (July
30). Each induction experiment is modi<U+FB01>ed by its predecessor
having apparently changed the constitution of the rod.
   10. In the next experiment this step by step unwindinrr of
torsion after magnetization is shown in the case of a 1‘05 of
nickel. The rod was placed in exactly the same osition as
the iron rod of the former experiments. The behaviour of
nickel appears to be the same as that of iron, but in nickel the
increase of torsion with magnetization is not so great. The
twelve vertical lines, in the appended diagram, represent pro
longations of the scale. In each case No. 1 indicates the position

the de<U+FB02>exion has come. This was the starting-point of the
next de<U+FB02>exion. The magnetic force produced in all cases an
increase of torsion in the direction of the initial torsion, so
that in each case the amount of twisting in the direction of
torsion was 2, and the untwisting about 1 in each set of
magnetizations and demagnetizations.            The wire did not
untwist when left to itself, at least perceptiny in 100
minutes, but the untwisting after magnetization was im

   11. Beds of non-magnetic metals (On, St, Pt, Pb, Ag, Zn,
Cd, brass, and bronze) were subjected to the same treatment as
the iron rods, but no rotation of any kind could be seen.

           0n Rods of Iron, Nickel, and other llIetals.          389
into a glass tube when melted.        If the glass tube be kept hot
during the formation of the casting, and be cooled slowly,
very long rods may be produced, in some cases 25 centim.
long. The glass tube is removed from the metal by being
cracked. When treated as the iron rods were in the previous
experiments, no movement whatever could be perceived.
From the brittle nature of Bi it could be subjected to only a
slight amount of torsion.

    The galvanometer was so placed that it was in no way
 affected, either by the helix A B or by the magnetic action of
 the core.
    14. When the iron core C D was freshly annealed, and free
 from magnetization, except that produced by the inductive
 action of the earth’s magnetizing force, a current was passed
 through the helix ; a transient current was indicated by the
 galvanometer as existing in the circuit of which the iron core
 formed a part. The current produced a de<U+FB01>exion of 150
 divisions of the scale ;     a Rowland inductor circle in the
earth’s horizontal <U+FB01>eld gave 300 divisions.          (The log. of the

'390       Mr. F. J. Smith on the E<U+FB01>'ects' of Magnetism
 induction area of the Rowland coil=4‘97132 ; it has 42 turns,
 and a mean circumference 167'305 centim.) The value of
the horizontal component of the earth <U+FB01>eld at Oxford at the
time of these experiments was about 0179 C.G.S. units. On
breaking the circuit hardly any current was indicated, 1 or
 .1'5 divisions at the most. On again closing the circuit at K
  no current was indicated, and by repeating the closing no
 swing of the galvanometer-needle could be produced. The
 directionof the current was next changed by means of the
 commutator P. Then. on closing the circuit at K, a current of
 the same value as the former was indicated, but it was now in
 the opposite direction.   On breaking or making the circuit no
 de<U+FB01>exion could be got from the iron core under examination.
    So that in order to get a transient current from an iron
 core well annealed its magnetization must be reversed. An
 examination of cores under stress shows that the phenomenon
 may be modi<U+FB01>ed.
    15. The relationship between the direction of the magnetiz
 ing current in the long helix and 'iron core current is shown
 in the diagram (<U+FB01>g. 3).
" 16. The experiment was next arranged so that the. core
 might be as long 'as possible, and yet wound with a moderate
 length of copper helix.    An iron core, A B, 6'3 metres long,
.4 mm. diam., covered with a non-conducting coat, was
,coilcd into a ring, of about 15 centim. diam. It was next

          ' on Rods ofIron, Nickel, and other Metals.       391
 coiled with a thick layer of swansdown cloth, and then with
 600 turns of covered copper wire, so coiled as to have no
lateral component.      A, B were connected to the ballistic
galvanometer, and C, D to the battery-circuit and K, &c.
All the former effects were produced, but in a muchgreater
degree, the de<U+FB01>exion of the galvanometer=510 divisions.
The magnetizing force due to the ring coil was so arranged as
to be ahnost equal to that used in (ll). A minute de<U+FB01>exion
could be produced on either closing or opening the battery
circuit after the <U+FB01>rst effect.
    .17. An iron rod 1'5 millim. long, 1 centim. diam., was
next coiled with a helix, and all the former effects were pro
duced. The effect was not so marked as when bars of small
diameter were used.
    18. The remarkable feature of the phenomenon appears to
be that it is only on the entire reversal of the magnetism of
thecore that the transient current is produced in any marked
degree.
    19. None of the effects could be got from brass or copper
cores, so that the current from the iron core is due to the
reversal of the magnetic matter of the core.         In all the
experiments, already described, the cores were as free-from
torsional stress as possible. Similar experiments were next
made on cores which had a torsional set.
   20. The marks A A in the appended tables
indicate right-handed or left-handed torsion given to the core
under examination (see Table I.). The torsion was given by
<U+FB01>xing one end of the core and then rotating the other a
certain number of times, and then deducting the number of
turns in the opposite direction that the core took before
settling down at its “ set” torsional position. It was found
that when the cores received 20 turns that they untwisted four
turns, so that the whole torsion, at the condition of “set,”
was 16 turns. In all experiments tabulated, the marks 1'
indicate an experiment made next after reversal of the current,
   21. In these experiments, with cores subjected to torsional
“ set,” the same markedly large de<U+FB01>exion of the needle of the
galvanometer immediately after the reversal of the magnetizing
current was clearly shown, but now only large in one direction,
the direction depending on the direction of torsion of the
core.                                                  T
   22. In Table I. the relationship existing between the
direction of the magnetizing current, the iron core current,
and the torsion of the core are shown.
   In the next experiments (Table II.) the current was passed

392       Mr. F. J. Smith on the Efects of Magnetism
through the iron core while the coil was in circuit with the
galvanometer.
   23. Two similar cores (<U+FB01>g. 5), having their sense of torsion
opposite, but the amount of torsion in each equal, were put
into the helix together, their ends A, D and B, 0 being joined
to the battery-circuit; the current was passed through the
cores, but no indication of current was manifested by the
galvanometer G, the effect of one core apparently cancelling
that of the other.

   24. While a current was passing through the iron core sub
ject to torsional set, a couple, indicated by the arrows P Q, was
 applied in the direction of the torsion of the core (<U+FB01>g. 6).
_When the arm 0 A was moved through 10°, suddenly a.
 de<U+FB01>exion of 400 was given by the galvanometer. The length
 of the core was 50 centim., diam. 4 millim. The transient
 current was reversed by reversing the sense of the couple.
 When I made this experiment I had not read the work of
 Werthcim, 1852.       He produced the same effect in the same
 way—with an iron rod, but not under initial torsional set as
 was the case 111 my experiment.

    The relationships which exist between the current in the
iron core and transient current in the helix, and the current
through the helix and the transient current in the iron core,
the iron core being subject to torsion in the direction indicated,

    25. \Vhen the current which traversed the long solenoid,
used in the <U+FB01>rst experiment, was interrupted by a tuning
fork driven electrically, an iron wire subject to torsional set,
within the solenoid, gave out a loud musical note. It was shown
by Page, long ago, that an iron rod within a solenoid, through
which an interrupted current passed, would give out a musical
note ; but the note produced by a rod under torsional set in
my experiment appears to be due to a cause somewhat different
from that whereby Page’s effect was produced. His note is
said to be produced by minute elongation‘s and shortenings of
the rod. In the case of the rod being subject to torsion, as in
the experiment now described, the note is evidently produced
by torsional vibration, and that so great that, when a light
pointer was <U+FB01>xed to the free end of the twisted rod, a record
of its vibration was produced on the moving smoked-glass
surface of the chronograph. I found no dif<U+FB01>culty in making

 of Prof. Ewing on transitory currents were made on wires

A Course of Experiments in Physical Measurement—Part III
   Principles and Methods. By HAROLD WHITING, Ph.D. Boston,
   U.S.A.: D. C. Heath and Co.
IN the two volumes of this work which have already appeared
    the author has described the processes used in the measurement
of Physical Quantities, and has given full details concerning sources
of error and the various methods of avoiding or eliminating them.
Those parts of the theory of the subject upon which the experi
ments previously described are based are now brie<U+FB02>y treated of in
the book before us. The theory of errors also receives a very large
share of attention, and in connexion with it is included the calcu
lation of the mean from a series of observations, and the estimation
of the probable error in the result.
   The latter half of the volume consists of a collection of mathe
matical and physical tables, together with notes explaining their
use. In the case of the tables of powers, roots, and reciprocals of
numbers, and in one or two other cases also, two tables have been
given; a rough one for all numbers of less than three digits, and
a more complete one accurate to <U+FB01>ve <U+FB01>gures. The former should
prove useful for rapid work, and the latter for more re<U+FB01>ned calcu
lations.   We notice, however, that two tables are omitted which
we have found to be of immense value in ordinary calculations,
namely a table of four-<U+FB01>gure logarithms and a corresponding one
of antilogarithms. To be of maximum utility these should be
placed in a conspicuous position, say at the end of the book, and
should be so arranged that the whole of the logarithm table can be
seen at one opening, and the same in the case of the antilogarithms.
In our experience such tables are quite accurate enough for almost
all calculations with the exception of delicate weighings on the
balance, where the <U+FB01>ve-<U+FB01>gure logarithms given by the author would
be required. There is moreover a positive objection to the use of
too elaborate mathematical tables, since they deceive the student
into thinking that his results have the same order of accuracy as
the tables.
   The Physical Tables are fairly complete and accurate. The only
error we have noticed is in the table of electromotive forces of
cells, where the positive pole of the Clark cell is erroneously stated
to be carbon instead of mercury.               JAMES L. HOWARD.

tory, Sunderland,’ by T. W. Backhouse, has just been issued, and
gives the details on which the author’s previous papers “ On the
Structure of the Sidereal Universe” (published in the ‘Monthly
Notices,’ vol. i. p. 374, and in the ‘ Sidereal Messenger,’ vol. ix.
p. 337) were founded. The work is illustrated with <U+FB01>gures and
maps, and the numerous observations summarized in the text
furnish a useful contribution to one of the grandest problems in
astronomy. Mr. Backhouse’s instruments are a 2-inch <U+FB01>eld-glass
and a Iii-inch refracting telescope, and he appears to have made ex
cellent use of them. He remarks that certain large diffused nebu—
losities seen by Sir W. Herschel do not agree with those seen in a
 <U+FB01>eld—glass. This is not surprising when we re<U+FB02>ect that Herschel
 used powerful appliances in his unwearying examination of the
 hevaens. Mr. Backhouse says :-—“ We are brought to the conclusion
 that the galaxy is probably far nearer us than was at one time
 believed, and that therefore the greater part of the stars composing
 it are likely to be much smaller than the sun. The tendency of
 modern investigations is to diminish our ideas of the extent of the
 visible universe.”
    Astronomers will welcome further publications from the obser
vatory at Sunderland. Private e<U+FB01>orts of this laudable character
are none too numerous in this country.

           RETINAL OSCILLATIONS.       BY M. CHARPENTIER.
 I HAVE recently investigated certain phenomena which, viewed
     as a whole, demonstrate experimentally the production of oscilla
 tions in the visual apparatus, when elicited by light. These oscil
 lations seem rather connected with a reaction of the retina, when
 it is acted on by light, than with the act of sensation itself. They
 are none the less interesting to know, and may serve as starting
 point for a more minute analysis of the mechanism of the act in
 question.
  ' The fact which led to these researches, and which I had com
 municated to the Société de Biologie on May 10, 1890, is the
 following :-—I_f a black disk, on which is a larger or smaller white
  sector, is turned rather slowly, and if the centre of the disk is
  rigidly viewed when it is brightly illuminated, it is observed that
  that side of the white sector which <U+FB01>rst penetrates over the dark
  ground is bordered in its motion by a very sharp black band sepa
 rated from the ground by a similar White band. These two bands
  appear in the form of sectors concentric wit-h the disk, provided
  that certain necessary precautions are taken in the observation, in
  the detail of which I cannot enter here. The black band is shaded
  off at the edges; its angular extent, like that of the original \vhite
  band, increases with the velocity of the disk, and in proportion to

398           Intelligence and llfiscellaneous Articles.
it; but this extent expressed in time is always constant; the band
takes always the same time to pass in front of a point of the
retina; it commences about 313 or 7% after the passage of the white
and lasts appreciably the same time. It is more visible the brighter
the illumination of the white; but when it has been seen in these
conditions it is found again easily under feebler illumination, in
which it is only less striking. But this enfeehlement of the sensa
tion, more or less marked according to the intensity of the excita—
tion, is always observed.
   It may be said that in this experiment there is spread out in
space what Occurs in time. The black band is in fact only a kind
of reaction of the retina. against the excitation by light, a reaction
which may be made evident in a totally different way.
   I have in fact observed that if in complete. darkness we produce
an instantaneous luminous excitation, or rather one of a duration
which can be neglected in comparison with the <U+FB01>rst, the sensation
appears doubted; that is to say, that when once it is formed it
disappears, and again shows itself anew.         This takes place, for
instance, if we pass either through a Crookes or Geissler tube, or
simply, but with less effect, through air, a single discharge from a,
Bubmkorff coil. This doubling is more or less precise according
to various circumstances which I have mentioned, but it is readily
found again when it has once been observed; it is particularly
marked with indirect vision. I have shown that it cannot be
attributed to a. reaction of the pupil, as I at <U+FB01>rst believed when I
made my observations in a. room not perfectly dark; it is in fact
a retinal phenomenon.
   There is then in this experiment, as in the <U+FB01>rst, a negative
reaction under the in<U+FB02>uence of the excitation; the di<U+FB01>erence is
that in the <U+FB01>rst case the excitation lasts when this reaction is seen,
while here the excitation has come to an end, and only an obscu
ration of its persistent or consecutive image is seen.
   Is this reaction, this negative excitation, unique ? I do not think
so; for in certain cases I have seen the dark band followed by other
analogous bands uniformly spaced but much less distinct. The
observation is moreover dif<U+FB01>cult, for a. pretty great velocity of the
disk is required, and then the bands, as they become larger, con
trast less strongly with the ground, and become less perceptible.
What is certain is that the <U+FB01>rst dark band is much less marked,
and it dominates the phenomenon.
   It would be difficult, and in any case premature, to indicate the
causes of this appearance, but it may be permitted to characterize
it as the result of a retinal oscillation formed under the in<U+FB02>uence
of the start of the luminous excitation. What con<U+FB01>rms this inter
pretation is that this oseillation travels along the retina with a
uniform velocity from the point where it starts; and that by
placing ourselves under certain experimental conditions we may,
thanks to it, produce true phenomena of interference in the
sensation.
   The most convenient way of realizing these interferences is to
turn a large black disk of about 0'4 metre with a velocity of about

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                ’399
one turn in a. second, after having <U+FB01>xed on the periphery of this
disk is very small white. sector of 1° or 2°, and a height of 5 to 10
millim. In this way two necessary conditions are realized—a
motion so rapid that there is a persistent image of this sector as
extended as possible, and at the same time excitations at such
intervals that the persistent images do not run into each other.
It, then, the view is <U+FB01>xed rigidly towards a point at which the
sector passes, which is the delicate and essential condition of the ex
periment, the persistent annular image of the object is seen to be
channelled, and presents a certain number of dark zones regularly
spaced out on the light ground. An intense light is not needed
for this experiment.
   The extent of the successive zones on the retina as well as their
frequence is easily calculated.                                            .
   It is found that the apparent interval between two dark zones
on the disk diminishes with the distance from the eye. The image
on the retina of this interval, on the contrary, remains constant.
   For the same distance of the disk from the eye the interval in
question varies with the velocity of the former, and, what is a
point of capital importance, inversely as this velocity. This is not,
then, a. case of direct oscillations due to excitation, for they are, on
the contrary, spaced out in proportion to the velocity of the disk.
   This fact can only be explained by assuming that the object in
moving over the retina is, in relation to the induced oscillation, in
analogous conditions to those of an observer who moves away from
a source of sound. If the retinal undulation which we have,
actually observed in the experiment with the black band travels
with a constant velocity over the retina, the passage of a luminous
image moving with a suitable rapidity should <U+FB01>nd this membrane
in conditions periodically varying, in which the perception of the
object will be alternately favoured or opposed. The distance of
two neighbouring maxima and minima, which represents the appa
rent wave-length of this retinal undulation, should obey the relation
expressed by Doppler’s formula. This is what in fact is con<U+FB01>rmed
by experiment—Campina- Rendus, July 20, 1891.                            ‘

   The method consists in dissolving the pigment-colours in suit
able proportions in solvents which, differing considerably in speci<U+FB01>c
gravity, are not soluble in each other, and neither of which dis
solves the body in the other, and then, by violently shaking the
solutions, and thus as it were effecting a mixture of the physical
molecules, to bring about a mixture of colours.
   The perception of colours is here brought about by direct
action, as in the experiment of mixing colours by re<U+FB01>exion, and
not, as in the colour-disk, by after-action of the luminous im—
pression.                   v       g g

liquids after being shaken together gradually separate, and the
two layers of liquid are seen unchanged. By suitably changing
the degree of dilution of the solutions, or by altering the pro—
portions, any desired colour-effect can be easily obtained; on the
other hand, by adding suitable materials to one or the other solu—
tion the duration of their mixture can be varied at will.
   To exhibit the action of a mixture of red and green colouring
matters, aldehyde green in amylic alcohol is used for one solution
and cobalt salt in water for the other. Of the various preparations
of aldehyde green, the purest should be taken, which dissolves
easily in amylic alcohol with a colour like that of solutions of nickel
salts. It is not dif<U+FB01>cult just to hit the quantities in which the mixture
appears of a dull white colour. Experiment shows that mixtures
of pigments behave like mixtures of pure spectrum colours. Mix
tures of cobalt and nickel solutions can also be used to demonstrate
the action of complementary colours ; by the addition of ammonium
or sodium chloride, or other alkaline salts, to the solution of cobalt,
the separation of the mixed liquids, which otherwise takes place
slowly, can be accelerated at will. In order to get as pure a white
as possible, the illumination must be as intense as practicable, and
the experiment made in front of a dark background, care being
taken to avoid any white objects.
   To show the action of the mixture of blue and yellow colouring
matters, a solution of phenanthrenquinone in amylic alcohol may
be used, which gives a yellow solution, and for blue a solution of
ammonio-sulphate of copper.
   For the mixture of yellow and violet the same solution can be
used for the yellow, and a mixture of cobalt and copper salts in
water for the violet, the tint being as near that of the spectrum as
p0ssible.—Wiedemann’s Annalen, No. 6, 1891.

In the pure concentrated state it is a colourless liquid of extremely
pungent odour, which boils at 37° without decomposition, and can
be distilled, though it sometimes explodes with great violence at a
much lower temperature. In an aqueous solution it behaves just
as a halogen acid; like these it is monobasic, and forms salts with
readiness.    These salts, which are nitrides, correspond exactly to
the chlorides. Nitrogen silver, AgSN, and the mercurous salt
(N_.,),Hg2 explode when heated, or by a blow, with great violence.

 LII. The In<U+FB02>uence of Temperature on the Colour of Pigments
       By EDWARD L. NICHOLS and BENJAMIN W. SNOW *.
 OUR knowledge of the laws which govern the changes of
         colour which many substances undergo when heated is
 very incomplete.      Certain marked changes of colour which
 occur under the action of the blowpipe, and which are useful
 for the identi<U+FB01>cation of the substance exhibiting them, have
 been noted and described, and some attempts have been made
 to show that these and other colour-changes follow a general
law.
    To Schoenbein'l' we owe the eneral observation that colours
grow dark under the action of cat. E. J. Houstoni (1871),
working in association with Elihu Thomson, studied a great
number of substances and noted their change of hue when
heated.     They stated their conclusion as follows :—“. . . . the
addition of heat causes the colour to pass from one of a greater
to one of a less number of vibrations . . . .”
    Ackroyd§ (1876), in a short but admirable paper, con
<U+FB01>rmed the observation of a movement of colour-tones “towards
the red” upon heating. He supplemented naked-eye obser
vations with spectroscopic study and reached the following
result :—“ That metachromatism arises from increased ab

402         Messrs. Nichols and Snow on the In<U+FB02>uence of
sorption of light with elevation of temperature, the more
refrangible increment increasing at a greater rate than the
less refrangible.” How accurate a statement of fact this is
will appear when the measurements to be given in the present
paper have been described.
    The kindred topic of the in<U+FB02>uence of temperature upon
absorption-spectra has claimed the attention of Gladstone *,
 Bartley T, and, very recently, of Conroy i. Hitherto, however,
there have been but few efforts to analyse systematically
the selective re<U+FB02>exion which takes place at the surface of
 pigments§, and no attempts to trace out quantitatively those
variations in the amount and character of the re<U+FB02>ected light
 which are brought about by the action of heat.
    It is our purpose in this paper to present the results of an
 investigation of the colour-changes which pigments undergo
 when subjected to wide ranges of temperature. The deter
 minations included the spectroscopic analysis of the light from
 the pigment, with means of measuring its intensity, wave
 length by wave-length, and the estimation of the temperature
 of the coloured surface.
     The method of determining temperature which seemed to
 present the fewest objections, consisted in supporting a thin
 layer of the pigment on a ribbon of platinum foil, which could
 be maintained at any desired temperature by means of the
 electric current, and then measuring the linear expansion of
 the foil. To this end a strip, 25 centim. in length and
  7 millim. wide, was cut from a sheet of platinum. The strip
  was placed in the circuit of a Gramme dynamo, and heated
  to a cherry-red. The degree of incandescence, which was
  observed to be in all parts the same, afforded a su<U+FB02>icient test
  of the uniformity of the foil. To the ends of this platinum
  strip were soldered brass rods, capable of carr ing a heavy
  current without heating. These passed through the arms of
  a frame in which the strip was mounted, and one of them bore
  a compressed spiral spring, which served to keep the platinum
  ribbon properly stretched. By means of a dividing-engine
  two <U+FB01>ne diamond rulings, 89 millim. apart, were drawn upon
  the foil at right angles to its length. Two microscopes, each

     § With the exce tion of a few measurements made several years ago
  by one of us (Niche 8, American Journal of Science, vol. xxviii. p. 343),
  the only quantitative study of the spectra of pigments with which we are
  acquainted is that contained in the recent paper of Abney and Festing on
  Colour Photometry (Phil. Trans. clxxix. p. 549).

             Temperature on the Colour of Pigments.         403
provided with a micrometer eyepiece reading to 00025 millim.,
were now focused upon these lines, so that when the strip
expanded longitudinally, under the heating action of the cur
rent, the increment could be readily and accurately measured.
    The indications of this platinum thermometer enabled us to
calculate the temperatures to which, from time to time, the
foil and the <U+FB01>lm of pigment placed upon it were heated.       In
these computations we used Matthiessen’s well-known formula,
in which the length of a platinum wire is expressed as a
function of its temperature. This formula,
             I = 10(1 + “00000851 t + 000000003519),
was originally determined between 0° and 100° C., and is
strictly applicable only within that range.    Beyond its proper
interval it doubtless yields false values, and for very high
temperatures the correction may be a considerable one.
Although the correction-factor is at present unknown, the
equation gives a convenient arbitrary scale of temperatures,
which possesses the advantage of being readily reduced to the
Centigrade system when the proper formula shall have been
determined.
    In the preparation of the <U+FB01>lm of pigment one of the two
following methods was employed. In the case of the oxides
of zinc and of magnesium the foil was smoked over the <U+FB02>ame
 of the burning metal; in other cases the ribbon was well
 moistened with alcohol and the pigment was sifted upon it
 with a <U+FB01>ne cloth, a quantity just suf<U+FB01>cient to entirely conceal
 the metal being thus applied. Upon the evaporation of the
alcohol there remained on the platinum a thin adherent layer,
which possessed the natural surface of the dry powdered pig
 ment, nearly free from gloss or surface-re<U+FB02>exion.
    The instrument by means of which the photometric mea
 surements were carried out was a form of polarizing spectro
 photometer. The arrangement of its several essential parts,
 together with that of the apparatus used in connexion with it,
 is shown in the accompanying diagram (<U+FB01>g. 1). F F is the
 platinum strip, the mounting of which has already been
 described. To it were attached wires from a storage-battery
 of twenty cells, the amount of current, and consequently the
 temperature of the foil, being controlled by the variation of
 resistance in the circuit. The letters mm denote the positions
 of the diamond-lines ; M M are the microscopes focused upon
 them for the measurement of temperature. The other side of
  the platinum foil, upon which the coating of colouring-matter
  is Spread, is illuminated by an incandescent lamp, L’, which
  is supplied from another stor<U+FB01>ge-battery.      Light from this

404       Messrs. Nichols and Snow on the In<U+FB02>uence qf
lamp, diffusely re<U+FB02>ected from the pigment, enters a rectan
gular prism at B, where it sutfers total re<U+FB02>exion and is thrown
                               Fig. 1.
vertically downwards. The rays then enter another prism,
identical in size and form with the <U+FB01>rst, which sends them
through the upper half of the slit of the spectroscope in a
direction parallel to the axis of the collimator-tube, S C.
    In multiple circuit with the lamp L’, and supplied from the
 same battery, is the precisely similar lamp L, which serves as
 the reference standard. Rays from this lamp are <U+FB01>rst ren
 dered parallel by the lens of short focus A, and then, before
 reaching the collimator, pass through the pair of Nicol prisms,
 N and N’, which act respectively as polarizer and analyser.
 The light upon emerging from the analyser enters a pair of
 re<U+FB02>ecting prisms similar to those which have just been de
 scribed and symmetrically placed, and so through the lower
 half of the slit into the collimator and along a path every
 where parallel to that followed by the light from the pigment.
    The disposition of the four right-angled prisms before the
 slit is shown in <U+FB01>g. 2. This arrangement offers a certain
 advantage over the usual devices for         _    Fig- 2
 introducing the rays of the com
 parison-light into the collimator-tube.
 The adjacent edges of the two inner
 prisms are in contact with the slit,
 and when viewed through the eye
piece they form a sharply de<U+FB01>ned
 boundary in the middle of the <U+FB01>eld.
The result is that when two bundles
of light are introduced by means of the device under con~

               Temperature on the Colour qf Pigments.             405
 sideration, the spectra are separated by a much more clearly
 de<U+FB01>ned median line than can be secured with the ordinary
 comparison-prism at the slit. The sharpness of the inner
 boundary between the spectra to be compared has great
 in<U+FB02>uence upon the accuracy of the spectre-photometric de
 termination; indeed, where close measurements are desired,
 de<U+FB01>nition in this region may be regarded as essential. There
 is another condition which is met by the use of the four
 prisms. The selective absorption of the glass through which
 the light passes in a spectro-photometer is by no means
 negligible. Even in the clearest of optical glass the absorp
 tion varies in a marked degree with the wave-length of the
 ray; and it is therefore important that the two sets of rays
 which are to furnish the spectra to be compared should be
 subjected to the same treatment, passing through the same or
 similar lenses and prisms and traversing the same total thick
 ness of glass *. In the instrument used in our experiments
 this condition was ful<U+FB01>lled in ever respect but one ; viz. the
 light from the comparison-lamp 1?: passed through the con
 densing-lens A and the two Nicol prisms which were not in
 the path of the rays from L’.         The method by which the
 absorption due to these was eliminated will be indicated later.
    After having traversed the collimator-tube, the rays from
 the pigment and those from the lamp L were dispersed by the
 prism p and passed on to the eyepiece.          The <U+FB01>eld of view
 consisted of two spectra situated one above the other. By
 means of an adjustable diaphragm in the e epiece any desired
 region of the spectrum could be isolated. VThen thus restricted
 the <U+FB01>eld consisted of two narrow vertical strips of colour,
 separated by a black line which was the image of the adjacent
 edges of t e re<U+FB02>ecting-prisms before the slit. The two
 strips of colour were identical in wave-length and differed only
 in intensity. The brightness of the lower depended upon that
 of the comparison-lamp L, and upon the angle between the
 polarizing-planes of the Nicol prisms. Of these last the
 polarizer N (<U+FB01>g. 1) had freedom of rotation, and was provided
 with a circle reading to <U+FB01>ve minutes of arc. The brightness
 of the upper <U+FB01>eld depended upon the amount of light, of the
 wave-length in question, re<U+FB02>ected by the pigment under
 investigation. The spectrum of the comparison-lamp, although
 reduced by polarization, and by absorption and re<U+FB02>exion
 su<U+FB02>'ered in traversing the lens A and the calcite prisms, was

cited, have pointed out the importance of this precaution (see p. 549
of their monograph).

 still much the brighter of the two. The measurements con
 sisted in turning the movable Nicol until the spectrum of
 lamp L was reduced, region for region, to equality with that
 of the spectrum due to the pigment.
      In presenting the results of measurements with the spectro
 photometer it is not always desirable to reduce the intensities
 to absolute measure, since it is with the luminosity rather than
 with the distribution of energy that we have to do. One of
 the most satisfactory ways of de<U+FB01>ning colour is to compare it
 with white as a standard, and that is the method which we
 have adopted for the purposes of this investigation. The
 ideal white is one which re<U+FB02>ects all the wave-lengths of the
 visible spectrum in the same proportion. Whatever be the
 character of the illumination to which a body the colour' of
'which is the ideal white is subjected, therefore, the incident
 and re<U+FB02>ected rays will be identical in quality. Since no such
 body is known to exist, however, it becomes necessary to
 select some actual pigment as a reference-standard.
      Dr. Arthur Kaenig, in one of his papers on colour-blindness,
has suggested the adoption of magnesium oxide, obtained
from the smoke of the burning metal, as the normal white *.
Between this substance and magnesium carbonate, which one
 of the present writers has repeatedly used as a standard'l',
there is little to choose, so far as selective re<U+FB02>exion is con
cerned. Neither of them can be considered a true white, in the
sense in which that term is to be understood in spectro
photometryi, but the oxide possesses two great advantages:
the <U+FB01>lm is very readily produced, and the tint and the degree
of brilliancy reappear in each new specimen with a constancy
which leaves nothing to be desired. In our experiments, then,
magnesium oxide was adopted as the reference-white, and the
ideal white, in terms of the brightness of which all pigments
were to be measured, was de<U+FB01>ned as a surface which, re<U+FB02>ecting
all wave-lengths of the visible spectrum equally well, possesses
the same re<U+FB02>ecting-power for the wave-length 35890;» (region
of the D line) as does the smoke-<U+FB01>lm of magnesium oxide.
     Our <U+FB01>rst step was to determine the correction-factor for the
selective absorption suffered by the light from the lamp L, in
traversing the lens A, and the Nicol prism. For this purpose
a block of the carbonate of magnesium was cut in two. The

new faces thus formed were rubbed together until they had
acquired complete identity of surface-texure. One of the
pieces was placed in the position usually occupied by the
lamp L, the lamp itself being set up about ten centimetres
away. The newly prepared surface was illuminated by the
lamp, and it made an angle of 45 degrees with the axis
of the polarizing prisms. The other piece of the carbonate
was mounted in place of the platinum strip, and in the same
manner as the <U+FB01>rst one. It was illuminated by rays from L’,
which had been removed to a sufficient distance to restore the
ratio of brightness of the two spectra to a convenient value.
The spectra of the rays reflected by these two identical sur
faces were compared, wave-length for wave-length, from red
to violet. The difference, which was indeed most striking,
could be due only to selective absorption by the condensing
lens and the Nicol prisms.     Subsequent measurements, made
when both pieces of magnesium carbonate were illuminated
by the same lamp, showed that L and L’, which were lamps
of the same type carefully adjusted to the same temperature,
emitted the same quality of light, so that no correction for
difference of illumination was necessary. It was not essential
to our purpose to determine what portion of loss by absorp
tion was due to the action of glass and what to calcite, but
the effect of the two taken together was so surprisingly large
that it seemed well worth while to separate them. This was
readily accomplished by repeating the comparison of the
spectra with the lens removed, a condition under which
absorption within the calcite alone remained. The data
obtained in these experiments upon the selective absorption
in glass and calc-spar have no direct bearing upon the subject
matter of this paper. As they are in themselves of some
interest, however, they will be communicated under a distinct
title.
   This preliminary investigation being completed and the
correction—factors for absorption <U+FB01>xed upon, we proceeded to
study the spectrum of magnesium oxide at 25° C. This was
not one of the substances from which we expected marked
effects as the result of heating, but we were anxious to deter
mine in what manner it differed from true whiteness. The
brightness of its spectrum in the region of the D-line, more
over, was the value to which all subsequent measurements
were to be referred. Measurements were made at seven
points in the visible spectrum, the wave-lengths of which are
given in Table I. The brightness of each region is expressed
in terms of that of the corresponding region in the spectrum

of the ideal white (already de<U+FB01>ned); a method which was
followed in the case of all subsequent determinations. The
results are shown graphically in <U+FB01>g. 3. In this diagram and
in all that follow it, abscissae are wave-lengths and ordinates
are intensities. The spectrum of the normal white in each

case would be represented by a horizontal line, the ordinate
of which is 1'00. It will be seen that the magnesium oxide
differs from the ideal white in that it re<U+FB02>ects the less refran
gible rays more freely than it does those of shorter wave
length. The de<U+FB01>ciency increases steadily towards the violet,
where, in the region 425,14, the pigment re<U+FB02>ects only sixty-one .
one hundredths as much light as the ideal white would have
done under the same illumination. The strip of foil, still
bearing the smoke-<U+FB01>lm of magnesium oxide, was afterwards
brought to 758° C., and the measurements were repeated with
the pigment at that temperature. The values obtained (see
Table I.) show a very slight decrease in re<U+FB02>ecting-power but
no change of colour.

   First on our list of substances from which marked changes
of colour under the action of heat might be looked for was
sulphur. Every one is familiar with the increase in the inten
sity of the yellow hue when this substance is heated to tem
peratures in the neighbourhood of its melting-point.             Our
interest had been particularly aroused, however, by a state
ment of E. \Viedemann’s to the effect that, when exposed to
the intense cold obtained by contact with solid carbon dioxide,
sulphur is not yellow, but white. Professor Wiedemann‘
alludes to this as to a well-known fact ; but it was quite new
to us, and we repeated the experiment, extending it to various
other pigments, with results which will be described later.
   For the purpose of the determination of the spectrum of
sulphur, a layer of the powdered element was prepared by the
method of moistening with alcohol, already described. When
the <U+FB01>lm was dry, it was measured at 25° and at 103° C. The
results are given in Table II. and in <U+FB01>g. 4.

been given in one of the articles on colour already
cited *.
   All these substances show marked decrease of re<U+FB02>ecting
power as we pass through the spectrum from red to violet.
In the case of sulphur, the diminution is much less rapid than
in other yellows until the region of the F line of Fraunhofer
is reached. The curve then trends sharply downwards, indi
cating very rapid lessening of the reflecting-power towards
the violet end of the spectrum.
   The <U+FB01>lms of massicot and mercuric iodide were prepared
as follows :—Coatings of red lead and of the red variety of
mercuric iodide respectively were laid on in alcohol. When
these were heated by the passage of the current, they were
converted into the monoxide of lead (PbO) in the one and
into the yellow form of the iodide in the other.          The change
took place spontaneously, when the requisite temperature was
“reached, without any disturbance of the <U+FB01>lm, and the colour
of the pigment thus obtained was uniform and of uncommon
brilliancy. The unstable yellow mercuric iodide, however,
began to revert to the red form almost as soon as it became
cold, and measurements were obtained in four regions only.
The coating of molybdic acid was prepared by treatment with
alcohol.
   The results of our measurements of the spectra of these
three substances are given in Tables 111., 1V., and V.

   Our study of green and blue was a very cursory and in
complete one. It was con<U+FB01>ned indeed to the examination of
chromic oxide and “ arti<U+FB01>cial ultramarine.” The former was
of a very dull green colour.             It was the usual preparation of
the chemical laboratory, and not the more brilliant variety
known as chrome-green.
   On account of the very small amounts re<U+FB02>ected by these
pigments, the measurement of their spectra was attended with
some dif<U+FB01>culty. The results obtained, for which the same
degree of accuracy as in the case of the foregoing deter
minations is not claimed, are given in Tables X. and XI.
In the accompanying diagrams abscissae are on the usual
scale, but ordinates are increased <U+FB01>ve-fold.
   It was evident to the unaided eye that the result of heating
the ultramarine was to alter its hue permanently. A few
measurements upon the cooled pi ment were therefore made
to determine the amount of the c ange.                   The results, which
indicate very marked alteration in the colour of the substance,
are given by themselves in Table XI.

   Both chromic oxide and ultramarine had been measured
in the course of the earlier investigation on the spectro
photometry of pigments, to which reference has already been
made. A comparison of the curves then published with
those plotted from the data contained in Table X1. shows the
ultramarine used in the original experiments to have been of
very nearly the same brilliancy in the blue as the later
specimen. The chromic oxide, however, was more than three
times as bright in the green as that to which the quantities in
Table X1. refer.
   The series of experiments which have been described in
cluded also measurements of lamp-black, hot and cold, and of
the oxide of zinc.
   Our purpose in the study of lamp-black was simply to
determine whether this substance, like the other pigments
subjected to measurement, decreased in re<U+FB02>ecting-power with
rise of temperature, and if so, to what extent.

    Zinc oxide was one of the pigments from which we ex
pected to obtain very de<U+FB01>nite and well-marked results. The
 change of this substance from white to lemon-yellow, under
the blowpipe, is one of the most familiar of colour-reactions.
We anticipated no dif<U+FB01>culty in <U+FB01>xing the precise nature of
 the changes which take place with rise of term erature. 4
 Films obtained by smoking the platinum foil over t e <U+FB02>ame
 of burning zinc were studied by the methods which already
 have been described in this paper. Our measurements yielded
 most erratic and, at <U+FB01>rst sight, inconsistent results. It soon
 became evident that in the study of the selective re<U+FB02>exion
 from zinc oxide at different temperatures we had to deal with
 a set of very complex phenomena; and it was indeed not
 until we had completed an investigation of the radiation
 of zinc oxide at high temperatures, a piece .of work the results
 of which are to form the subject of another paper, that we
 were in position to understand the behaviour 'of that substance
 as regards re<U+FB02>ecting-power. Our study of the radiation of
 the oxide at temperatures above the red heat showed the light
 emitted to be strongly selective, in the sense of differing
 greatly in distribution from that emanating from incandescent
 carbon or platinum at the same temperatures. It was found
 also that the character and intensity of the radiation were
 functions of time as well as of temperature. Every sharp
 <U+FB02>uctuation in radiating-power had its counterpart in colour
 changes of the pigment, as viewed by re<U+FB02>ected light, and
the dif<U+FB01>culty which we had experienced in measuring the
pigment arose from the fact that we ,had to deal with a

             Temperature on the Colour of Pigments.         4:21
luminescent surface of extremely evanescent and unstable
character. At the time that our measurements of the re
<U+FB02>ecting-power were made, our knowledge of the conditions
to be met was very incomplete. It is not possible by means
of the data obtained to trace accurately the changes of colour
which the oxide undergoes between ordinary temperatures
and the red heat, to say nothing of the rapid time-changes
which must take place at some of the higher temperatures.
It is easy, however, to detect certain typical changes which
the colour-curves undergo. The data given in Table XIII.
have been selected with a view to illustrating these types.
   The readings at 25°, 578°, 750°, and 815° were made with
the same coating and in the order named. A set of measure
ments made at 884° have been discarded because they were
to some extent vitiated by the presence of light directly
radiated.   An attempt was, made to estimate the amount of
such light and to apply a correction. The result was un
satisfactory. The four sets just mentioned have been plotted
                             Fig. 14

together in <U+FB01>g. 14. The curves show, for the cold oxide, a
spectrum weak both in the red and violet, with marked

422      Messrs. Nichols and Snow on the lly‘luence of
indications of absorption between '5;/. and '6a.          At high
temperatures this absorption in the yellow disappears, and we
see the gradual development of a maximum in the red. The
case is of interest in that it is the only one in which re<U+FB02>ecting
power at high temperatures exceeds that at lower temperatures
for any considerable portion of the visible spectrum.         The
spectrum shown in <U+FB01>g. 14 is characteristic for zinc oxide at
25°, the same curves being obtained whenever a <U+FB01>lm was
measured.     The curves for high temperatures, however, were
found to be applicable only to a single <U+FB01>lm, the variations
being due to causes which we were not in a position to con
trol.   Another typical form is shown in <U+FB01>g. 15, in which the
curve for 600° is that which characterizes a simple sulphur
yellow (compare with <U+FB01>g. 4). The curve for the cold <U+FB01>lm

   In these experiments we investigated comparatively few of
the long list of substances given by Houston and Thomson
as subject to colour-change by heating, or of those catalogued
by Ackroyd as “ meta-chromic.” A suf<U+FB01>cient number were
tested, however, to make it clear that colour-change by
temperature is a very general phenomenon; also that the
statements of Schoenbein, and of the later authors just men
tioned, are accurate, in so far as their methods enabled them
to observe the facts.
   Our results may be summarized as follows :—
   1. None of the pigments tested equals the ideal white in
re<U+FB02>ecting-power, even in that part of the spectrum for which
its re<U+FB02>ecting-power is greatest.
   2. The re<U+FB02>exion spectrum of pigments arises from two dis
tinct sources: (a) light re<U+FB02>ected from the surface of the
substance ; (b) light re<U+FB02>ected from interior faces.               The light
re<U+FB02>ected from the surface is nearly white. Its brightness
varies from about 2 per cent. (as in HgS) to nearly 10 per cent.
(as in HgO). It is to the light internally re<U+FB02>ected that the
pigment owes its colour.
   3. The effect of heating a pigment is invariably to diminish
its re<U+FB02>ecting-power, the diminution being as a rule more
marked in regions of greatest refrangibility.
   4. The changes of colour, observable when a pigment is
heated, are due to this unequal loss of re<U+FB02>ecting-power, and
the e<U+FB01>ect which has been described as “a shifting of the
colour towards the red,” arises from the fact that the loss of
brightness

to extend our spectro-photometric measurements to the very
low temperatures obtainable by the use of solid carbon
dioxide, but we have been compelled by lack of time to content
ourselves with noting such changes as could be detected with
the unaided eye.        The change observed was in every case
that which would be brought about by increase of re<U+FB02>ecting
power. There was no increase in the saturation of the
colour, rather, on the other hand, a paling or dilution of the
tint, as though there were a tendencytowards white. Houston‘,
who made a similar set of observations at the higher tempera
tures reached by the evaporation of carbon bisulphide or
sulphurous acid, arrived at a similar result. Ackroyd, from
theoretical considerations, concluded that as the absolute zero
is approached the prevailing tints of pigments will be blues
and violets, merging <U+FB01>nally into white.
    Ackroyd, Hartley, as also Houston and Thomson, and still
earlier Schoenbein and Brewster, have had something to say
concerning the explanation of these phenomena.              Their
various views need not be touched upon here, unless it be to
call attention to the opening paragraph of Ackroyd’s paper,
which contains an important statement. Ackroyd says :—
“ These changes embrace a class of phenomena, quite as
important in their way as phosphorescence and <U+FB02>uorescence,
with which in fact they are intimately connected.” It is our
opinion that the connexion is indeed a most intimate one, and
that every change of colour that pigments undergo is to be
regarded simply as a symptom of changes in the radiating
power of the substance.

LIII. Dynamical Problems in Illustration of the Theory of
              Gases. By Lord RAYLEIGH, Sec. R.S.'l‘
                               Introduction.
THE investigations, of which a part is here presented, had
        their origin in a conviction that the present rather un
satisfactory position of the Theory of Gases is due in some

  degree to a want of preparation in the mind of readers, who
  are confronted suddenly with ideas and processes of no
  ordinary dif<U+FB01>culty.       For myself, at any rate, I may confess
  that I have found great advantage from a more gradual
  method of attack, in which effort is concentrated upon one
  obstacle at a time. In order to bring out fundamental sta
  tistical questions, unencumbered with other dif<U+FB01>culties, the
  motion is here limited to one dimension, and in addition one
  set of impinging bodies is supposed to be very small relatively
  to the other. The simpli<U+FB01>cation thus obtained in some
  directions allows interesting extensions to be made in others.
  Thus we shall be able to follow the whole process by which
  the steady state is attained, when heavy masses originally at
  rest are subjected to bombardment by projectiles <U+FB01>red upon
  them indi<U+FB02>'erently from both sides. The case of pendulums,
  or masses moored to <U+FB01>xed points by elastic attachments, is
  also considered, and the stationary state attained under a one
  sided or a two-sided bombardment is directly calculated.

     If u', v' be the velocities before collision, u, c after collision,
  of two masses P, Q, we have by the equation of energy

  As is evident from (1) and (2), we may in (4), if we please,
  interchange the dashed and undashed letters. Thus from the

In the application which we are about to make, P will denote
a relatively large mass, and Q will denote the relatively small
mass of what for the sake of distinction we will call a pro
jectile. All the projectiles are equal, and in the <U+FB01>rst instance
will be supposed to move in the two directions with a given
great velocity. After collision with a P the projectile re
bounds and disappears from the <U+FB01>eld of view. Since in the
 present problem we have nothing to do with'the velocity of
rebound, it will be convenient to devote the undashed letter 1;
to mean the given initial velocity of a projectile. Writing
also q to denote the small ratio Q: P, we have
                        ,         2
                       u=u+T_ig(u—v).      \    . . . . . (b)     .
If u and v be supposed positive, this represents the case of
what we may call a favourable collision, in which the velocity
 of the heavy mass is increased. If the impact of the pro
jectile be in the opposite direction, the velocity n”, which
 becomes u after the collision, is given by
                                 2
                     uH =u+1_qq(u+v).           .   .  .   .  .  (7)
 The symbol 0 thus denotes the velocity of a projectile with
 out regard to sign, and (7) represents the result of an un
 favourable collision.
      Permanent State of Free illasses under Bombardment.
    The <U+FB01>rst problem that we shall attack relates to the ultimate
 effect upon a mass P of the bombardment of projectiles
 striking with velocity v, and moving indifferently in the two
 directions. It is evident of course that the ultimate state of
 a particular mass is inde<U+FB01>nite, and that a de<U+FB01>nite result can
 relate only to probability or statistics.   The statistical method
 of expression being the more convenient, we will suppose that
 a very large number of masses are undergoing bombardment
 independently, and inquire what we are to expect as the
 ultimate distribution of velocity amonor them. If the number
 of masses for which the velocity lies between u and u+du be

                    Illustration of the Theory of Gases.                427
  denoted by f (u)du, the problem before us is the determination
  of the form off
     The number of masses, whose velocities lie between u and
  u+du,_ which undergo collision in a given small interval of
  time, is proportional in the <U+FB01>rst place to the number of the
  masses in question, that is to f (u) du, and in the second place
  to the relative velocity of the masses and of the projectiles. In
  all the cases which we shall have to consider 0 is greater
  than u, so that the chance of a favourable collision is always
  proportional to o—u, and that of an unfavourable collision
  to v +u. It is assumed that the chances of collision depend
  upon u in no other than the above speci<U+FB01>ed ways. The
  number of masses whose velocities in a given small interval
  of time are passing, as the result of favourable collisions,
  from below u to above u, is thus proportional to
                           J1}(w).(v1—w) dw,           .  .  .   .   . (8)*

  where u' is de<U+FB01>ned by (6) ; and in like manner the number
  which pass in the same time from above u to below u, in con

  u" being de<U+FB01>ned by                   In the steady state as many
  must pass one way as the other, and hence the expressions

  the form

  Now, if q be small enough, one collision makes very little
  impression upon u; and the range of integration in (10) is
  narrow. We may therefore expand the function f by Taylor’s
  theorem :—

The ultimate distribution of velocities among the masses is
thus a function of the energy of the projectiles and not other
wise of their common mass and velocity. The ultimate state
is of course also independent of the number of the projectiles.

   The form of f is that found by Maxwell. To estimate the

The ratio in question is thus éqv’, showing that the mean
kinetic energy of a mass is one half that of a projectile,
deviating from the law of equal energies <U+FB01>rst (1845) laid
down by Waterston. We must remember, however, that we
have thus far supposed the velocities of the projectiles to be
all equal.
   The value of A in (14) may be determined as usual. If

    If we were to suppose that the chances of a favourable or
unfavourable collision were independent of the actual velocity
of a mass, there would still be a stationary state de<U+FB01>ned by
writing v1=00 in (15). Under these circumstances the mean
 energy would be twice as great as that calculated above.
    It is easy to extend our result so as to apply to the case of
 projectiles whose velocities are distributed according to any
 given law F(v), of course upon the supposition that the pro
jectiles of different velocities do not interfere with one another.
 We have merely to multiply by F(v)dv and to integrate be

The mean energy of the masses is tq/k, and this is now equal
to the mean energy of the projectiles. We see that if the
mean energy of the projectiles is given, their e<U+FB01>iciency is
greater when the velocity is distributed according to the
Maxwell law than when it is uniform, and that in the former
case the VVaterston relation is satis<U+FB01>ed, as was to be expected
from investigations in the theory of gases.
   It may perhaps be objected that the law e“ "v’ is inconsistent
with our assumption that u is always great in comparison with
u. Certainly there will be a few projectiles for which the
assumption is violated; but it is pretty evident that in the
limit when 9 is small enough, the effect of these will become
negligible. Even when the velocity of the projectiles is
constant, the law e'1‘2/qu must not be applied to values of a
comparable with o.
   The independence of the stationary state of conditions,
which at <U+FB01>rst sight would seem likely to have an in<U+FB02>uence,
may be illustrated by supposing that the motion of the masses
is constrained to take place along a straight line, but that the
direction of motion of the projectiles, striking always centri
cally, is inclined to this line at a constant angle 9.

This may be regarded as a generalization of (6); and we
see that it may be derived from (6) by writing o/cos 9 for v,
and gcosed for g. In applying equation (10) to determine
the stationary state, we must remember that the velocity of
retreat is now no longer w, but w cos 6, so that (10) becomes
           ’0                 }f(w)dw=           10 cos 0f(w)dw.
    The entire effect of the obliquity 6 is thus represented by
the substitution of 0/005 6 for v, and of (1 cos2 0 for (1, and since
these leave {11:2 unaltered, the stationary state, determined by
 (15), is the same as if 0:0.
    The results that we have obtained depend entirely upon the
assumption that the individual projectiles are <U+FB01>red at random,
 and without distinction between one direction and the other.
 The signi<U+FB01>cance of this may be illustrated by tracing the
 effect of a restriction. If we suppose that the projectiles are
 despatched in pairs of closely following components, we should
 expect that the effect would be the same as of a doubling of
 the mass. If, again, the components of a pair were so pro
jected as to strike almost at the same time upon opposite sides,
 while yet the direction of the <U+FB01>rst was at random, we should
 expect the whole effect to become evanescent. These antici
 pations are con<U+FB01>rmed by calculation.

with that obtained when the connexion of the components of

    The method followed in the formation of equation (10)
seems to lead most simply to the required determination of
f (a) ; but it is an instructive variation to consider directly
the balance between the numbers of masses which change
their velocities from and to u.
    The number of masses whose velocities lie between a and
u +du being f(u)du, we have as the number whose velocities
in a given small interval of time are expelled from the range

may be taken to be i290.             Moreover, the chance of a.
 collision is at <U+FB01>rst sensibly independent of u. In the present

the ultimate state, with the mass and velocity of a projectile,

of the variable state. The latter depends upon the momentum
of the projectiles, and upon the number of impacts ; the

It must be distinctly understood that the solution expressed
by (24), (25), (26) applies only to the '<U+FB01>rst stages of the
bombardment, beginning with the masses at rest. If the
same state of thin s continued, the motion of the masses
would increase wit out limit. But as time goes on, two
causes intervene to prevent the accumulation of motion.
When the velocity of the masses becomes sensible, the chance
of an unfavourable collision increases at the expense of the
favourable collisions, and this consideration alone would pre-'
vent the unlimited accumulation of motion, and lead to the
ultimate establishment of a steady state.         But another cause
is also at work in the same direction, and, as may be seen.
 from the ar ment which leads to (13), with equal ef<U+FB01>ciency.

effect than the unfavourable ones, as is shown by (6) and (7).

attachments. And for the moment we will assume that the
stationary state is such that no change would occur in it were
the bombardment at any time suspended. To satisfy this con
dition it is requisite that the phases of vibrations of a given
amplitude should have a certain distribution, dependent upon
the law of force.    For example, in the simplest case of a force
proportional to displacement, where the velocity u. is connected
with the amplitude (of velocity) r and with the phase 0 b
the relation u=rcos 6, the distribution must be uniform wit
respect to 0, so that the number of vibrations in phases between
0 and 9+d9 must be d6/2'rr of the whole number whose am
plitude is r. Thus if r be given, the proportional number with

If the vibrators were left to themselves, x(r) might be chosen

  ' The argument in the preceding paragraphs depends upon
 the assumption that a steady state exists, which would not be
 disturbed by a suspension, or relaxation, .of the bombardment.
 Now this is a point which demands closer examination ;
 because it is conceivable that there may be a steady state,
 permanent so long'as‘the bombardment itself is steady, but
 liable to alteration when the rate of bombardment is increased
 or diminished. And in this casewe could not argue, as before,
 that the distribution must be uniform with respect to 0.

as determined by u, a), where

Any distribution of amplitudes and phases may thus be ex
pressed by(u, 11) du d1).
    If we consider the effect of the collisions which may occur
at t=0, we see that u is altered according to the laws already
laid down, while 17 remains unchanged. The condition that the
distribution remains undisturbed by the collisions is, as before,
that, for every constant 17,f(u, 17) should be of the form e_'“‘2,
or, as we may write it,
                        f(u, u) =x(n) e"“"
 But this condition is not suf<U+FB01>cient to secure a stationary state,
 because, even in the absence of collisions, a variation would
 occur, unless f(u, 17) were a function of r, independent of 0.

  Under this law of distribution there is no change either from
 the progress of the vibrations themselves, or as the result of
 collisions.
     The principle that the distribution of velocities in the
  stationary state is the same as if the masses were free is of
  great importance, and leads to results that may at <U+FB01>rst appear
  strange. Thus the mean kinetic energies of the masses
 'is the same in the two cases, although in the one case there is
  an accompaniment of potential energy, while in the other
  there is none. But it is to be observed that nothing is here
  said as to the rate of progress towards the stationary condition
  when, for instance, the masses start from rest; and the fact
  that the ultimate distribution of velocities should be inde
  pendent of the potential energy is perhaps no more dif<U+FB01>cult
 'to admit than its independence of the number of projectiles
  which strike in a given time. One difference may, however,
  be alluded to in passing. In the case of the vibrators it is
  necessary to suppose that the collisions are instantaneous;
  while the result for the free masses is independent of such a
  limitation.
     The simplicity off in the stationary state has its origin in
  the independence of 0. It is not dif<U+FB01>cult to prove that this

442         Lord Rayleigh on Dynamical Problems in
law of independence fails during the development of the
vibrations from a state of rest under a vigorous bombardment.
The investigation of this matter is accordingly more com
plicated than in the case of the free masses, and I do not
propose here to enter upon it.                                     '
   In a modi<U+FB01>cation of the original problem of some interest
even the stationary distribution is not entirely independent
of phase. I refer to the case where the bombardment is
from one side only, or (more generally) is less vigorous on
one side than on the other. It is easy to see that a one-sided
bombardment would of necessity disturb a uniform distribu
tion of phase, even if it were already established. The per
manent state is accordingly one of unequal phase-distribution,
and is not, as for the symmetrical bombardment, independent
of the vigour with which the bombardment is conducted.
   But in one important particular case the simplicity of the
symmetrical bombardment is recovered.         For if the number
of projectiles striking in a given time be suf<U+FB01>ciently reduced,
the stationary condition must ultimately become one of uniform
phase-distribution.
   Under this limitation it is easy to see what the stationary
state must be. Since the ultimate distribution is uniform
with respect to phase, it must be the same from whichever
side the bombardment comes. Under these circumstances it
could not be altered if the bombardment proceeded indiffer
ently from both sides, which is the case already investigated.
We conclude that, provided the bombardment be very feeble,
there is a de<U+FB01>nite stationary condition, independent both of
the amount of the bombardment and of its distribution between
the two directions. It is of course understood that from
whichever side a projectile be <U+FB01>red, the moment of <U+FB01>ring is
absolutely without relation to the phase of the vibrator which
it is to strike.
   The problem of the one-sided bombardment may also be
attacked by a direct calculation of the distribution of ampli
tude in the stationary condition.     The <U+FB01>rst step is to estimate
the effect upon the amplitude of a given collision.     From (6),

LIV. On the Discharge of Electricity through Exhausted
   Tubes without Electrodes. By J. J. THOMSON, MA.,
   F.R.S., Cavendish Professor of Eaperimental Physics,
   Cambridge.
                       [Continued from p. 336.]
           Phosphorescence produced by the Discharge.
THE discharge without electrodes produces a very vivid
     phosphorescence in the glass of the vessel in which the
discharge takes place; the phosphorescence is green when
the bulb is made of German glass, blue when it is made of lead
glass. Not only does the bulb itself phosphoresce, but a piece
of ordinary glass tubing held outside the bulb and about a
foot from it phosphoresces brightly ; while uranium glass will
ghosphoresce at a distance of several feet from the dischargip.
  imilar effects, but to a smaller extent, are produced by t e
ordinary spark between the poles of an electrical machine.
   The vessel in which the discharge takes place may be
regarded as the secondary of an induction-coil, and the dis—
charge in it shows similar properties to those exhibited by
currents in a metallic secondary. Thus no discharge is pro
duced unless there is a free way all round the tube; the
discharge is stopped if the tube is fused up at any point. In
order that the discharge may take place, it is necessary that
the molecules of the gas shall be able to form a closed
chain without the interposition of any non-conducting sub
stance; indeed the discharge seems to be hindered by the

446     Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Discharge of Electricity
presence in sucha chain of any second body, even though it may
be a good conductor of electricity. Thus, when
a tube such as that in <U+FB01> . 7 is used, which has          “8- 7
a barometer-tube attached to it, so that by raising
or lowering the vessel into which the tube dips a
mercury pellet may be introduced into the dis
charge-circuit, the spark-length in the primary
circuit may be so adjusted that a discharge passes
when there is a clear way round the tube, but
stops when a pellet of mercury is forced up so as
to close the gangway. I noticed a similar effect
in my experiments with a long vacuum - tube
described in the Proceedings of the Royal Society
for Jan. 1891.
    I had another discharge-tube prepared, of which
a section is shown in <U+FB01>g. 8, a, in which a dia
phragm (AB) of thin copper plate was placed
across the tube; the diaphragm happened to catch at the bottom
of the tube, so that it divided the latter rather unequally, and
 left a narrow passage round its edge. As much of the discharge
 as there was room for went round the edge of the plate; the
                               Fig. 8.
                                 BB                   7
 remainder was not able to get through the copper, but formed
 a closed circuit by itself in the larger segment qf the tube.
 1n another tube, which is represented in section In <U+FB01>g. 8, ,8,
 the copper diaphragm was attached to the walls of the tube
by sealing-wax, so that there was no free way ; 1n this case the
 discharge again refused to go through the copper, and split
 up into two separate discharges, as in the <U+FB01>gure. When the
 tube was divided by copper diaphragms into~s1x segments, as
 in <U+FB01>g. 8,'y, no discharge at all would pass through: When the
   rimary was slipped up the tube above the diaphragm, a
 brilliant discharge was obtained. These four experiments all
illustrate the dif<U+FB01>culty which the electricity has in getting
transferred from a gas to another conductor.

         through Ewhausted Tubes without Electrodes.         447
   There is no discharge through the secondary, if it is of such
a kind that, considering a closed curve drawn in it, the electro
motive intensity as we travel along the curve tends to
polarize the particles in one half of the chain in one direction,
and in the other half in the opposite direction, the direction
being reckoned relative to the direction we are travelling
round the curve.    Thus, for example, if we take a tube whose
axis is bent back on itself, as in the <U+FB01>gure, the electromotive
intensity will tend to polarize the particles in one part of the
chain in the direction of the arrow, and thosein the other
in the opposite direction ; it is impossible to get a discharge
through a tube of this kind.
                              Fig. 9.
                        \LEIL
   On the other hand, the molecules exhibit remarkable powers
of making closed chains for themselves when not
actually prevented by the action of the electro-       Fig-10
molive intensity. Thus the discharge will pass
through a great length of tubing in the secondary,
even if it is bent up as in <U+FB01>g. 10, where the
vertical iece in the upper part of the secondary
is at rig t angles to the direction of the electric
force, and where the molecules will receive no
help in forming closed chains from the action of
the external electromotive forces. 1 have suc
ceeded in sending discharges through tubes of
this kind 12 to 14 feet in length.
       Screening E<U+FB01>'ects due to the Currents in the Tubes.
   One very noticeable feature of these discharges is the well
de<U+FB01>ned character of the ring, if the pressure is not too low.
If a large bulb is used for the secondary with the primary
just outside it, when the sparks pass between the jars a

448 Prof. J. J. Thomson 0n the Discharge of Electricity
bright, well-de<U+FB01>ned ring passes through the bulb near to the
surface of the glass, the gas inside this ring being, as far as
can be judged, quite free from any discharge. If now a bulb
whose diameter is less than that of the luminous ring is
inserted in the primary in lace of the larger" bulb, a bright
ring will start in this, though at this distance from the pri
mary there was no discharge in the larger bulb. Thus when
the large bulb was in the primary, the discharge through 1ts
outer portions screened the interior from electromotive forces
to an extent suf<U+FB01>cient to stop a discharge which would other
wise take place.
   The screening action of these discharges is also shown by
the following experiment. A, B, 0,
<U+FB01>g. 11, is the section of a glass vessel            Fig. 11.
shaped like a Bunsen’s calorimeter; in
the inner portion A, B, O of this vessel
an exhausted tube is placed, while a           A         c
pipe from the outer vessel leads to a
mercury pump and enables us to alter
the pressure at will. The primary coil,
L, M, is wound round the outer tube.
When the air in the outer tube is at f                       o
atmos heric pressure, the discharge
cause by the action of the primary
passes in the tube E inserted in A, B, C;           B
but when the pressure in the outer tube
is reduced until a discharge passes
through it, the discharge in the inner                   *prump
one stops; the discharge in the outer
tube has thus shielded the inner tube from the action of the
primary.     If the exhaustion of the outer tube is carried so far
that the dischar e through it ceases, that in the inner tube
begins again.      t requires very high exhaustion to do this, and
as on account of the joints it is unsafe to make the vessel very
hot during the pumping, I have found it impossible to keep a
 vacuum ood enough to show this effect for more than from
 half to t ree quarters of an hour; in that time sufficient gas
 seems to have escaped from the sides of the vessel to make
 the pressure too high to show this effect, and it then takes
 from two to three hours’ pumping to get the tube back again
 into its former state. An interesting feature of this experi
 ment is that for a small range of pressure, just greater than
 that at which the discharge <U+FB01>rst appears in the outer tube,
 there is no discharge in either of the tubes ; thus the action
 of the primary is screened off from the inner tube, though
 there is no luminosity visible in the enter one; this shows

          through Exhausted Tubes without Electrodes.        449
that a discharge equivalent in its effects to a current can
exist in the gas without suf<U+FB01>cient luminosity to be visible
even in a darkened room. We shall have occasion to mention
other cases in which the existence of a discharge non-lumi
nous throughout the whole of its course is rendered evident
in a similar way.
   Another experiment by which the screening can be effec
tively shown is to place the primary coil inside a bell-jar
which is connected with a mercury pump, the electrical con
nexions with the primary being led through mercury joints.
An exhausted bulb is placed inside the primary, the bulb
being considerably smaller than the primary, so that there is
an air-space between the two.         Before the bell-jar is ex
hausted the discharge passes through the bulb, but when the
bell-jar is exhausted suf<U+FB01>ciently to allow of the discharge
passing through the gas outside the bulb the discharge in the
bulb ceases, and the only discharge is that outside.      I have
never been able to exhaust the bulb suf<U+FB01>ciently well to get
the discharge outside the bell-jar to cease, and that in the
bulb to appear again, as in the preceding experiment. In
this experiment, as in the preceding one, there was a range
of pressure when neither the bulb nor the bell-jar was lumi
nous ,showing again the existence of currents in the gas which
are not accompanied by any appreciable luminosity.
    A curious bending—in of the discharge which takes place
in a square tube provided with a bulb can, I think, be ex
plained by the principle of shielding. The discharge in the
bulb does not, unless very long sparks are used, take as its
course through the bulb the prolongation of the direction of
the tube, but is bent-in t0wards the primary. In <U+FB01>g. 12
 the dotted line represents the course the dis
 charge would have taken if there had been no           Fig-12
 bulb, the continuous line the course actually
 taken. This bending-in can be explained by
 supposing the currents started near the pri
 mary to shield off from the outlying space the
 action of the primary, and thus make the electro
 motive intensity along the axis of the tube
 smaller than it would have been if no discharge
 had been possible between the axis and the
 primary circuit.
    Before describing some further experiments on this shield
 ing effect, it will be useful to consider the means by which it
 is brought about. Let us suppose we have a vertical plate
 made of conducting material, and to the right of the plate a
    Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 32. No. 198. Nov. 1891,       2 H

450    Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Discharge of Electricity
region A which it shields. This region has to be shielded
from tubes of electrostatic induction coming from the left,
which have to pass through the shield before reaching A, and
from tubes coming from the right which have to pass through
A before reaching the <U+FB01>eld. The action of the shield in the
<U+FB01>rst case is very simple, for when a tube gets inside a con
ductor it at once attempts to contract to molecular dimen
sions, and after a time proportional to the speci<U+FB01>c resistance
of the conductor it succeeds in doing so. Thus if the shield
is made of a good conductor the tubes of electrostatic induc
tion will be transformed into molecular tubes before they
have time to get through; so that the shield will protect A
from all tubes which have to go through it.       The way the
shield destroys or rather neutralizes the effect of the tubes
coming from the right is somewhat different: when a positive
tube reaches the shield a negative one emerges from it, tra
velling at right angles to itself in the opposite direction to
the incident tube; thus when the <U+FB01>rst few tubes reach the
shield from the right they will produce a supply of negative
ones, and the presence of these negative tubes at A concur
rently with the positive ones which continue to arrive there
will weaken the <U+FB01>eld to a greater and greater extent as A
approaches the shield. At the surface of the shield itself the
neutralization will be complete. A dielectric whose speci<U+FB01>c
inductive capacity is greater than usual will behave in a
similar way to a metal plate, but to a smaller extent. It will
emit tubes of the opposite sign, but not so numerous as those
incident upon it. Thus a metal plate, or even one made of a
dielectric of considerable speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacity, will
reduce very considerably the tangential electromotive force
on either side of it.
    I have made several experiments in which this effect was
very strikingly shown. In one of these, two square discharge
 tubes of equal cross section placed near and parallel to each
 other were connected by a cross tube, so that the pressure
 was the same in both tubes; a <U+FB01>ne wire passed round the in
 side of one of the tubes, its ends being connected together so
 that it formed a closed circuit, the other tube contained
 nothing but air at a low pressure. When this double tube
 was placed outside the primary the discharge went, at the
 passage of each spark, through the tube without a wire, while
 the tube containing the wire remained quite dark. A similar
 experiment was tried by taking a cylindrical tube and sus
 pending in it a metal ring coaxial with the tube; in this case
 it was easy to adjust the spark-length so that no discharge

          through Exhausted Tubes without Electrodes.        451
 passed through the tube when the primary was placed round
 it at the level of the ring, while a discharge passed as soon
 as the primary was moved above or below the ring.
    Another very convenient tube for showing this e<U+FB01>'ect is
the one with the hollow down the middle, <U+FB01>g. 11; when
 this is pumped so that discharges can pass through the outer
tube the spark-length can be adjusted so that the discharge
 stops immediately when a metal tube, a test-tube containing
a strong solution of an electrolyte, or a tube containing air
at a pressure at which it is electrically very weak, is placed
in the central opening. The discharge is renewed again as
soon as the tubes are removed. On one occasion, when the
large tube was in a peculiarly sensitive state, I was able to
see distinctly the diminution produced by a dielectric in the
electromotive intensity parallel to its surface. The discharge
stopped as soon asa stick of sulphur or a glass rod sutliciently
large almost to <U+FB01>ll the opening was inserted, and was re
newed again as soon as these were withdrawn. It requires,
however, the large tube to be in an extremely sensitive state
for the effect produced by a dielectric to be apparent, and I
have onl on one occasion succeeded in getting the tube into
this con ition. The effect on that occasion, however, was so
 de<U+FB01>nite and regular that I have no doubt as to the existence
of the screening eti'ect due to the dielectric.
    When the tube is of average sensitiveness dielectrics do not.
produce any appreciable e<U+FB02>'ect, nor can the in<U+FB02>uence of even
comparatively so good a conductor as distilled water be de
tected, and it is not until after the addition of a considerable
quantity, 10 to 20 per cent., of sulphuric acid or ammonium
chloride, that the insertion or withdrawal of the tube stops or
starts the discharge.
    A tube containing air at a low pressure is very ef<U+FB01>cacious
in stopping the discharge, and the result of the comparison
of the relative effects of, an exhausted tube and a tube of the
same size and shape containing a solution of an electrolyte
are very remarkable. I found that an exhausted tube which
contained air at a very low pressure {less than      of a milli
metre) produced as much e<U+FB01>'ect on the discharge in the outer
tube as a tube containing at least 50,000 times as many
molecules of ammonium chloride. This would be expressed
in the language of electrolysis by saying that under the
electromotive intensity to which it was exposed in this ex
periment the molecular conductivity of the gas is 50,000
times that of the electrolyte. The proportion between the
number of air molecules and the number of molecules of an
                            2 H2

452 Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Discharge of Electricity
electrolyte, which produces an equal effect in stopping the
discharge, depends upon the length of spark in the primary
current, and so upon the electromotive force acting upon the
air. The longer the spark the greater is the molecular con
ductivity of the air in comparison with that of the electrolyte.
This indicates that the conduction through the air does not
follow Ohm’s law. This is what we should expect, as under
large electromotive forces more molecules are split up and
take part in the conduction of the electricity.        This great
conductivity of rare<U+FB01>ed gases in those cases where the elec
tricity has not to pass from metal &c. into the gas are in
striking contrast with the in<U+FB01>nitesimally small values for the
same property which are deduced from experiments on tubes
with electrodes.
    I was <U+FB01>rst led to suspect this high conductivity for rare<U+FB01>ed
gases by observing the appearance presented by the ring-dis
charge in bulbs ; the ring, unless the pressure is exceedingly
 low, ceases at a distance of little more than 1 centim. from
the surface of the bulb, this thickness of conducting gas being
 suf<U+FB01>cient to screen off the electromotive intensity from the
interior. From experiments which I had made on the screen
 ing effect of electrolytes (Proc. Roy. Soc. xlv. p. 269), I knew
 that it would require a very strong solution of an electrolyte
 to produce screening comparable with this.       To compare the
 screening effects more directly than by the method just
 described I tried the following experiment. The discharge
 tube, <U+FB01>g. 11, was pumped until the discharge passed throu h
it very freely; an exhausted tube was then pushed down the
 central opening, it remained quite free from any visible dis
 charge; the primary was now wound round a cylinder of the
 same diameter as the discharge-tube of <U+FB01>g. 11, and this
 cylinder was <U+FB01>lled with distilled water. When the tube, which
had previously remained dark when placed in the exhausted
discharge-tube, was immersed in the water, a brilliant discharge
 took place in it; and it was necessary to add about 25 per
 cent. of sulphuric acid to the water before the shielding effect
 of the mixture was suf<U+FB01>cient to keep the tube dark. This
experiment shows perhaps even more directly than the other
the great conductivity of a rare<U+FB01>ed gas under large electro
 motive forces when nothing but the gas is in the way of the
 passage of the current.
   An experiment made in this connexion illustrates the re
mark made before as to the large effects produced by dis
charges through the gas which are not accompanied b
luminosity. A bulb A was fused into a tube .3 which was

          through Emhausted Tubes wzthout Electrodes.     453
surrounded by the primary coil 0, D.     B was exhausted and
then sealed off, while A Was left connected to the pump.
When A was at atmospheric pressure a bright discharge took
place in B outside A; on pumping A a stage was reached in
which no discharge could be seen in either A or B. On
letting air into A the discharge appeared again in B; on
pumping A still further a discharge appeared in A, but not
in B. The appearance presented by the discharge round the
                            Fig. 13.
bulb A (<U+FB01>lled in this case with air at high pressure) is very
remarkable. At the highest pressure at which the discharge
passed it took the form of a thin ring round the middle of A;
as the pressure got lower and lower the discharge broadened
out, and at very low pressures formed for the greater part of
its course two separate rings which ran together in the space
between one side of the sphere and the tube.

                        Discharge-tube.
   The intensity of the discharge is very much affected by
the presence of conductors in the neighbourhood of the dis
charge-tube, especially conductors which have large capacity
or which are connected to earth. Let us take, for ex
ample, a very simple case, that of a bulb surrounded by a
primary which is connected to earth; in this case the ap—
proach of the hand, or any conductor connected to earth, will
make the discharge brighter and at the same time less well

 454 Prof. J. J. Thomson on theDischarge of Electricity
  de<U+FB01>ned at the edges; touching the tube, though this is
  already connected to earth, produces a very marked effect in
  increasing the facility of the discharge. We can, I think,
  understand the reason of this if we consider the behaviour of
  the tubes of electrostatic induction. When the spark passes,
  these tubes (see p. 327) rush out from the jars and make for
  the primary; in their journey to the primary they pass through
  the bulb and produce the discharge. Let us suppose now
  that there is a large conductor situated somewhere near the
  bulb ; the tubes, as before, rush from the jar to the primary,
  but in doing so some of them strike against the conductor;
  the tubes which do so lose the portion inside the conductor,
  acquire two ends each on the surface of the conductor, and
  swing round until they are at right angles to its surface;
  they remain momentarily anchored, as it were, to the con
  ductor, and if the conductor is in the neighbourhood of the
  bulb, they will in general help to increase the maximum
  density of the tubes passing through the bulb. Though these
  tubes may not approximate to closed curves, and so directly
  produce a ring-discharge, they may readily facilitate this dis
   charge indirectly; for even those tubes which go radially
   through the bulb may produce a glow-discharge from the
   glass into the bulb, and may thus furnish a supply of dis
  sociated molecules through which the ordinary ring-discharge
- can pass with much greater readiness.       For nothing is more
   striking than the enormous difference produced in the electric
   strength of these rare<U+FB01>ed gases by the passage of a spark.
   It is sometimes dif<U+FB01>cult to get the discharge to pass at <U+FB01>rst,
   but when once a spark has passed through the gas, a spark
   length one quarter the length of that necessary to originate
   the discharge will be found suf<U+FB01>cient to maintain it.
      It is sometimes convenient, in cases where dif<U+FB01>culty is found
   in starting the discharge, to avail ourselves of this property
   by connecting the mercury of the pump to which the tube is
   attached with one terminal of an induction-coil, the other
   terminal of which is put to earth. When the induction-coil
   is in action, a glow-discharge <U+FB01>lls the pump and tube, and
   while this glow exists the electrodeless discharge can easily
   be started; once having been started, it will continue after
   the induction-coil is stopped. An experiment of this kind,
    which I had occasion to make, gave very clear evidence of
    the way in which dissociated molecules are projected in all
    directions from the negative electrode in an ordinary discharge
    tube, but not from the positive. The discharge-tube was
    fused on to the pump, and at an elbow two terminals, 0 and
    d, <U+FB01>g. 14, were fused into the glass; these terminals were

           through Exhausted Tubes without Electrodes.       455
'connected with an induction-coil, and the pressure in the
tube was such that the elec
trodeless discharge would not                  Fig- 14
start of itself. When the coil
was turned on so that c was the
negative electrode, the elec
trodeless discharge in the tube
at once took place, but no effect
 at all was produced when c was
positive and (l negative. “To
may thus regard the effect pro
duced by the presence of a con
ductor as due to the conductor
catching the tubes of electrostatic
induction, and concentrating
 them on the discharge-tubes.
 These tubes in many cases
 acting indirectly by producing
 a glow-discharge through the
 tube, which, by diminishing the
 electric strength of the gas,
 makes discharges of any other
 kind very much easier. Though the presence of a conductor
 near the discharge-tube will, in general, concentrate the tubes
 of electrostatic induction on the discharge-tube more than
 would otherwise be the case, yet this does not always happen.
 When in some positions the conductor may hold back for a
  time from the discharge-tube tubes of electrostatic induction
 which would otherwise pass through it, and thus diminish the
 maximum density of the tubes of electrostatic induction in
 the discharge-tube, and hence tend to stop the discharge. I
 have frequently met with cases where the presence of a con
 ductor diminishes the intensity of the discharge. One of the
 most striking of these is when the two jars are insulated, and
 a square discharge-tube used. The spark was adjusted so
 that the discharge just, but only just, went round the tube.
 A sphere connected to earth was then moved round the dis
  charge-tube; in some positions it increased the brilliancy of
  the discharge, and the tube became quite bright, while in
  other positions it stopped the discharge altogether.
     The observation of the behaviour of the discharges through
  these tubes is a. very convenient method of studying the effect
  of conductors in de<U+FB02>ecting the <U+FB02>ow of the tubes of electro
  static induction which fall upon them; for the appearance of
  the discharge is affected not merely by the average, but also
  by the maximum value of the electromotiVe intensity which

456    Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Discharge of Electricity
produces it. Thus a high maximum value, lasting only for
a short time, might produce a discharge, .while a more
equable distribution of electromotive intensity havmg the
same average value might leave the tube quite dark. _
   I have employed these discharges to study the behaviour of
bodies under the action of very rapid electrical oscillatlpns
in the following way. In the primary circuit connecting
the outside coatings of the jar, two loops A and B (<U+FB01>g. 10)
were made, in one of which, A, an
exhausted bulb was placed, the spark              Fig. 15.
length and the pressure of the gas on
it being adjusted until the discharge
was sensitive, i. e. until a small alter
ation in the electromotive intensity
acting on the bulb produced a con
siderable effect upon the appearance            A
presented by the discharge.          The
substance whose behaviour under
rapid electrical vibrations was to be
examined was placed in the loop B.         The results got at <U+FB01>rst
were very perplexing. and at <U+FB01>rst sight contradictory, and it
was some time before I could see their explanation. The
following are some of these results.     When a highly exhausted
bulb was placed in B a brilliant discharge passed through it,
while the discharge in A stopped. A bulb of the same size,
<U+FB01>lled with a dilute solution of electrolyte, produced no appre
ciable effect; when <U+FB01>lled with a strong solution it dimmed the
discharge in A, but not to the same extent as the exhausted
bulb. A piece of brass rod or tube increased the brightness of
the discharge in A ; on the other hand, a similar piece of iron
rod or tube stopped the discharge in A at once. The most
decided effect, however, was produced by a small crucible
made of plumbago and clay: this when put in the loop B
stopped the discharge in A completely. I found, however,
that by considering the work spent on the substance placed
in B, the preceding results could be explained. When a
large amount of work is spent in B, the discharge in A will
be dimmed, while no appreciable effect will be produced on A
when the work spent in B is small.        Now let us consider the
work donein a secondary circuit whose resistance is R, whose
coef<U+FB01>cient of self-induction is L, and which has a coef<U+FB01>cient
of mutual induction M with the primary circuit. If the
frequency of the current circulating in the primary is p, we
can easily prove that the rate of absorption of work by the
secondary is proportional to
                              R M21)?

          through Exhausted Tubes without Electrodes.        457
Thus the work given to the secondary vanishes when R=O
and when R=in<U+FB01>nity, and has a maximum value when
R=Lp. Thus the condition that the secondary should
absorb a considerable amount of work is that the resistance
should not differ much from a value depending on the shape
of the circuit and the frequency of the current in the primary.
No appreciable amount of work is consumed when the resis
tance is very much greater or very much less than this value.
I tested this result by placing inside B a coil of copper wire.
When the ends were free, so that no current could pass through
it, it produced no effect upon the bulb in A ; when the ends
were joined so that there was only a very small resistance in
the circuit, the effect was, if anything, to increase the bright
ness of the discharge in A. When, however, the ends were
connected through a carbon resistance which could be
adjusted at will, the discharge in A became very distinctly
duller when there was a very‘considerable resistance in the
circuit. This experiment confirms the conclusion that to
absorb energy the resistance must lie within certain limits,
and be neither too large nor too small.
    We can now see the cause of the differences observed when
the substances mentioned above were put into B. The brass
rod and tube did not dim the discharge in A, because their
resistance was too low; the weak solution of electrolyte,
because the resistance was too great; while the resistances
of the crucible and the strong solution of electrolyte which
obliterated the discharge from A were near the value for
which the absorption of energy by the system was a maximum.
   The case of iron is very interesting because it shows that
even under these very rapidly alternating forces, iron still
retains its magnetic properties. A striking illustration of
the difference between iron and other metals is shown when
we take an iron rod and place it in B, the discharge in A
immediately stops; if we now slip a brass tube over the iron rod
the discharge in A is at once restored. If, on the other hand,
we use a brass rod and an iron tube, when the rod is put in
B without the tube the discharge in A is bright; if we slip
the iron tube over the rod, the discharge stops.
   To compare the amount of heat produced in the brass and
iron secondaries, let us take the case of an in<U+FB01>nite cylinder
exposed to an external magnetic force parallel to the axis
equal to Hoe‘P‘.
   If H is the magnetic force inside the cylinder at a distance
r from the axis, li satis<U+FB01>es the differential equation

and is thus proportional to the square root of par. Hence for
iron and copper cylinders of the same dimensions it would be
about 70 times as large in the iron as in the copper, assuming
that the iron retains its magnetic properties under these very
 rapidly alternating forces.      The result explains the effect of
the iron in stopping the discharge. As I am not aware that
 any magnetic properties of iron under such rapidly alternating
 forces have been observed, I was anxious to make quite sure
 that the difference between iron and brass was not due solely

 460     Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Discharge of Electricity
 to the differences between their speci<U+FB01>c resistances. The
 <U+FB01>rst experiment I tried with this object was to cover the iron
 rod with thin sheet platinum, such as is used for Grove cells.
 As the resistance of platinum is not very different from that
 of iron, if the effect depended merely upon the resistance,
 slipping a thin tube of platinum over the iron ought to make
 very little difference.    I found, however, that when the
 platinum was placed over the iron, all the peculiar effects pro
 duced by the latter were absent, thus showing that the etfect
 is not due to the resistance of the iron. It then occurred to me
 that I might test the same thing in another way by magnetizing
 the iron to saturation, for in this state 1.4. is nearly unity ; thus
 if the result depended mainly on the magnetic properties of
 the iron it ought to diminish when the latter is strongly
 magnetized. I accordingly tried an experiment in which
 the iron in the coil B was placed between the poles of
 a powerful electromagnet.      When the magnet was “off” the
 iron almost stopped the discharge in A; when it was “ on” the
 discharge became brighter, not indeed so bright as if the iron
 were away altogether, but still unmistakably brighter than
when it was unmagnetized. This experiment, I think, proves
that iron retains its magnetic properties when exposed to
these rapidly alternating forces.
    Another result worthy of remark is that though a brass
 rod or tube inserted in B does not stop the discharge in A,
yet if a piece of glass tubing of the same dimensions is coated
with Dutch metal, or if it has a thin <U+FB01>lm of silver deposited
upon it, it will stop the discharge very decidedly. We are
thus led to the somewhat unexpected result that a thin layer
of metal when exposed to these very rapid electrical vibra
tions may absorb more heat than a thick one. I <U+FB01>nd, on
calculating the heating-effect in slabs of various thicknesses,
that there is a thickness for which the heat absorbed is a.
maximum. Instead of takin the case of a cylinder, for
which the analysis is somew at long, I will take the case
(which is physically almost equivalent to it) of a plain elec
trical wave incident normally upon a plane sheet of metal.
    Let the electromotive intensity E in the incident wave be

that the rate of production of heat per unit area of the plate is

  When h vanishes the rate of heat-production, as given by the
  preceding expression, is in<U+FB01>nite. We have, however, in this
  expression used approximate values for A and B. If we use
  their accurate values we <U+FB01>nd that the rate of heat-production
  vanishes when h=O, but rises very quickly to a large value
  as h increases.
     The slight increase in the brightness of the discharge in A
  when a brass rod is placed in B is due, I think, to the dimi
  nution in the self-induction in the primary circuit produced
  by this rod, whose conductivity is so good that it absorbs
  practically no heat.
      We will now return to the case of bad conductors, where
  an is small; here the absorption of energy is proportional
  to the conductivity, and we might use this method to com
  pare the conductivityof electrolytes for very rapidly alter
  nating currents. I tried a few experiments of this kind, and
  found, as I did in the experiments described in the ‘ Pro
  ceedings ’ of the Royal Society, xlv. p. 269, that the ratio
  of the conductivities of two electrolytes was the same for
  rapidly alternating as for steady currents. I was anxious,
  however, to see whether these rapidly alternating currents
  could pass with the same facility as steady currents from an
   electrolyte to a metal. To try this, two equal beakers were
   <U+FB01>lled with the same electrolyte made of such strength that
   when inserted in B they put out the discharge in A.        I then
  placed in one beaker six ebonite diaphragms arranged So as
   to stop the eddy currents, and a similar metallic diaphragm
   in the other. The ebonite diaphragm made the beaker in
  which it was placed cease to have any effect upon the dis
  charge in A. I could not "detect, however, that the effect of
   the beaker in which the metal diaphragm was placed on the
   discharge in A was at all diminished by the introduction of
  the diaphragm. I conclude, therefore, that very rapidly
  alternating currents can pass with facility from electrolytes
   to metals, and vice versoi. In this respect electrolytes differ
  from gases, the currents in which, as we have seen, are
  stopped by a metallic diaphragm in the same way as they
  would be by an ebonite one.
'     It may be useful to observe, in passing, that a somewhat
   minute division of the electrolyte by the non-conducting
   diaphragm is necessary to stop the effect of the eddy currents;
   a division of the electrolytes into two or three portions seemeu’
   to produce very little effect.
      Another point which is brought out by these experiments
  is the great conductivity of rare<U+FB01>ed gases when no elec
   trodes are used as compared with that of electrolytes. An

464           Mr. C. Tomlinson on the Ignis Fatuus.
exhausted bulb will produce as much effect on the discharge in
A as the same bulb <U+FB01>lled with a solution of an electrolyte
containing about a hundred thousand times as many mole
cules of electrolyte. The molecular conductivity of rare<U+FB01>ed
gases when the electromotive intensity is very great and when
no electrodes are used must be thus enormously greater than
that of electrolytes.
   Bulbs <U+FB01>lled with rare<U+FB01>ed gas used in the way I have
described serve as galvanometers, by which we can estimate
roughly the relative intensity of the currents <U+FB02>owing through
the primary coils which encircle them. Used for this pur
pose, I have found them very useful in some experiments on
which I am at present engaged on the distribution of very
rapidly alternating currents among a network of conductors.
   I have much pleasure, in conclusion, in thanking my
assistant, Mr. E. Everett, who has done the whole of the
very large amount of glass-blowing required for these ex
periments, and has rendered very ef<U+FB01>cient help in other parts
of the work. My thanks are also due to Mr. A. T. Bartlett,
B.A., for the assistance he has given on several occasions.

LV. Some Remarks suggested by a popular Article on the
   Ignis Fatuus. By CHARLES Tomunson, F.R.S., F.C.S.,
   do?“
A NUMBER of distinguished scienti<U+FB01>c men form a com
        mittee of the British Association for encouraging the
teaching of science in elementary schools. In their Report
for 1889 they say :——“ This year has been one of continued
depression in regard to the teaching of science in elementary
schools, and of disappointment in regard to legislative action.”
In their Report for 1890, however, their object is said to be
more hopeful of attainment, seeing that the New Code is
favourable thereto, although it is a matter of regret that no
special arrangement has been made for the instruction of
pupil-teachers in some branch of science.
   In our middle-class schools, science and modern languages
apparently require to be more systematically studied than
they are at present, if we as a nation would maintain our
commercial and manufacturing position with respect to other
countries. There is hope that the various Polytechnic Institu
tions that are scattered about will supply the want. I have
                 * Communicated by the Author.

               Mr. C. Tomlinson on the Igm's Fatuus.             465
been honorary examiner in Physics to the Birkbeck Institu
tion during many years, and can bear ample testimony to the
excellence of its scienti<U+FB01>c teaching.
    There is, however, a good deal of indifference in private
life as to whether science is taught or not, or how it is taught.
In some cases this indifference is based upon ignorance of the
importance of such knowledge ; in other cases there is a
decided prejudice against it, because it is supposed to con<U+FB02>ict
with certain theological dogmas.
    Even when such prejudices are absent, there is a want of
discrimination in the selection of text-books for the young,
and it is often a mere chance if a book written by acompetent
hand is selected.
    I was led into these re<U+FB02>ections by a passage that was
recently submitted to me from a book on Popular Science
which has passed through many editions. It professes to
   've an account of the Ignis Fatuus.
    “ This luminous appearance (which haunts meadows, bogs,
 and marshes) arises from gas of putrefying animal and
 vegetable substances, especially from decaying <U+FB01>sh. These
 luminous phantoms are so seldom seen because phosphoric
 hydrogen is so very volatile that it generally escapes into the
 air in a thinly diffused state.    They <U+FB02>y from us when we run
 to meet it, because we produce a current of air in front of
 ourselves (when we run towards the ignis fatuus) which drives
 the light gas forwards. It runs after us when we <U+FB02>ee from
 it, because we produce a current of air in the way we run,
 which attracts the light gas in the same course, drawing it
 after us as we run away from it. The Welsh ‘ corpse candles ’
 are the same thing as the ignis fatuus. Swarms of luminous
 insects passing over a meadow sometimes produce an appear
  ance similar to the ignis fatuus.”
     It is impossible to suppose that this account was written
  by a scienti<U+FB01>c chemist; it was probably the work of one of
  those gentlemen in the Reading-Room of the British Museum
  who disturbed Mr. Carlyle in his studies :——“ The use they
  make of the Library,” he said, “is to assist them in drawing
  up articles for Compilation, Dictionaries, and Encyclopaadias,
  and the stuff called ‘ Useful Knowledge.’ They are a. very
  thick-skinned race.”*
     The gentlemen thus referred to are often greatly indebted
  to the Cyclopaedias in getting up books of Popular Science.
   But though the Cyclopaedias themselves have been greatly

improved of late years, seeing that they owe many of their
leading articles to competent writers, yet it must be admitted
that the very considerable number of short articles are en
trusted to inferior hands. I was anxious to see how such com
pilers might be led, or misled, by consulting the article Ignis
Fatuus in three well-known Cyclopacdias. The <U+FB01>rst reference
is to the “English Cyclopzedia ” (Arts and Sciences Division),
1860, where there is a short article under Ignis Fatuus, a
meteor resembling a <U+FB02>ame which is vaguely said to do a
number of things and may be seen over marshes or burial
grounds, and a case is related in which a weak blue <U+FB02>ame
came up from the sea, and burnt some ricks of hay. It is
also stated that “such meteors are most usually witnessed
during a fall of rain or snow.” After referring to some
other cases the writer remarks, “Little con<U+FB01>dence can be
placed in the descriptions given of them, as few persons have
been able to examine them with due attention ; and commonly
they have been observed under the in<U+FB02>uence of an ill-regulated
imagination rather than a philosphical spirit.”           That such
meteors are due to phosphuretted or carburetted hydrogen
gas is termed “a plausible hypothesis,” but “there is a great
dearth of satisfactory observations on moving lights seen_ in
nature, and the entire subject is at present in obscurity.” _
    The second example is from the Encyclopedia Britannica,
ninth edition, 1885, where the subject, oddly enough, is
treated in a few lines under Phosphorescence, which is said to
be “a name given to various phenomena due to different
causes, but all consisting in the emission of a pale, more or
less ill-de<U+FB01>ned light, not obviously due to combustion.” It
is stated that Ignis Fatuus, as seen in marshy districts, has
given rise to much difference of opinion. Kirby and Spence
suggested that it might be due to luminous insects, “ but it
is more reasonable to believe that the phenomenon is caused
by the slow ?] combustion of marsh-gas.”
    In Chambers’s Cyclopaedia, “A Dictionary of Universal
Knowledge,” New Edition, vol. vi. 1890, we have much
excellent writing in the longer articles, and only a feeble
grasp of subject in some of the shorter ones.           There is the
 same uncertainty in the treatment of Ignis Fatuus*, and the
 same confusion as in the earlier writers, arising from the
 application of the same term to meteors of very different
origin. The article begins by stating that Ignis Fatuus “is
a uminous appearance of uncertain nature which is occa
    * This article seems to have been entirely derived from the article
 117-lichter in the Konversatiom-Lexicon.

   sionally seen in marshy places and ohurchyards. The
   phenomenon has been frequently described, but it has been
  observed so rarely in favourable circumstances by scienti<U+FB01>c
  men, that there is no satisfactory explanation.” The theory
  that the meteor is due to ignited marsh-gas is dismissed as
  untenable, because the gas does not ignite spontaneously.
  The more plausible suggestion that it is due to phosphuretted
  hydrogen, which ignites on contact with oxygen, is also
  rejected, on the ground that a German observer, named List,
  “ passed his hand through the luminous appearance, and felt
. no warmth ;” while another German, named Knorr, “ held the
  metal-tip of a walking-stick in the <U+FB02>ame of a <U+FB01>xed ignis
  fatuus.. . fora quarter of an hour, but the metal was not
   warmed.”
       References to these observations are not given; but the
  luminous appearances were probably not gaseous, but elec-
   trical, as was also the meteor, which was seen to “ bound over
   the country like a ball of <U+FB01>re for half an hour at a time.”
       The scienti<U+FB01>c reader cannot fail to see that these notices in
   works of so much pretension, and of such recent dates, are
   quite unworthy of their fame. It is also curious to notice
   how the descriptions of earlier writers, with their ignorance
   of gases and imperfect knowledge of electricity, have stimu
  lated the timid doubts of the modern compiler. One example
   from an old writer, and in many respects an admirable one,
   may here be quoted, namely, Dr. Van Musschenbroek, Pro
   fessor of Mathematics and Philosophy in the University of
   Leyden *. In his Latin treatise on Natural Philosophy, vol. ii.
   page 291, is the following paragraph :—
       “ § 1329. Wandering <U+FB01>res, or Ignes Fatui, are ofa round
   <U+FB01>gure, in bigness like the flame of a candle, but sometimes
   broader, and like bundles of twigs set on <U+FB01>re. They some
   times give a brighter light than that of a wax candle, at other
   times more obscure, and of a purple colour. When viewed
   near at hand, they shine less than at a distance. They wander
   about in the air, not far from the surface of the earth, and are
   more frequent in places that are unctuous, muddy, marshy,
   and abounding with reeds. They haunt burying places,
   places of execution, dunghills. They commonly appear in
    summer, and at the beginning of autumn. But in the country
    about Bononia, they are seen throughout the whole year in a

dark night. For there in a cold winter, and when the ground
is covered with snow, they are in greater plenty than in the
hottest summer. Those also are observed in winter, which
 Gassendus says are seen at Rogon, atown of Provence. They
appear more frequently in hot than in cold countries. In
Italy near Bononia are the greatest, and in greatest plenty.
Sometimes they vanish on a sudden, and resently shine out
in another place. They are generally at t e height of about
six feet from the ground. Now they dilate themselves, and
now contract. Now they go on like waves, and rain as it
were sparks of <U+FB01>re, but they burn nothing. They follow
those that run away, and <U+FB02>y from those that follow them.
Some that have been catched were observed to consist of a
shining, viscous, and gelatinous matter, like the spawn of
frogs, not hot or burning, but only shining; so that the
matter seems to be phosphorous, prepared and raised from
putre<U+FB01>ed plants or carcases by the heat of the sun ; which is
condensed by the cold of the evening. and then shines. Yet
I do not think that the matter of all is the same, for without
doubt those of Bononia differ from those of Holland. It is a
mere <U+FB01>ction that these <U+FB01>res are evil spirits or wandering
ghosts, misleading travellers out of mere spite, to plunge
them into ditches and bogs as some tri<U+FB02>ing Philosophers have
told us.”
    In the above passage there is much admirable description
of the Ignis Fatuus, but the writer cannot reconcile the phe
nomena as due to one source, for he does not think that “ the
matter of all is the same.” It is clear that some of the
phenomena refer to gaseous meteors, others to electrical, and
others again to plzosp/lorescent*, but further advances in natural
knowledge were required before these distinctions could be
made clear.
   The <U+FB01>rst step towards a true explanation of the Ignis Fatuus
was taken by Priestley, who, in 1767, began his “Experi
ments and Observations on different kinds of Air,” and thus
   * In the Philosophical Magazine for August and December 1888 I
have cited a number of examples of low lying electrical meteors.        These
ma be multiplied to almost any extent, but they must not be confounded
wit the igm's fatuus. Whether phosphorescent lights are ever seen
hovering over graves, forming what are called “corpse candles,” has not

neighbouring wood. It was seen during several evenings after sunset.
Most of the inhabitants were too timid to investigate the cause, but one
bold spirit ventured and found the light to proceed from alarge putrescent
<U+FB01>sh which some one had thrown up into a tree.

              Mr. C. Tomlinson on the Ignis Fatuus.                469
 laid the foundation of Pneumatic Chemistry. Among his
 experiments are a considerable number on the in<U+FB02>ammable
 air produced during the decomposition of various kinds of
vegetable, and in vol. i., page 209, he says :—“ The air from
marshes also, which, with Sig. Volta, I doubt not comes from
putrefying vegetable substances, I have also found to be
 equally permanent ;” that is, not absorbed by water, as in
 the case of <U+FB01>xed air.
    The name of Volta makes me pause for a moment to ex
press my astonishment that Professor Kamtz, of the University
 of Halle, in his celebrated Le/e'r'buck der lileteorologie, published
in 1832, in the section on Irrlichter Oder Irrwische (Ignes
fatui, Ambulones, Fem: follets), expresses his opinion, and
 notes it as a remarkable fact, that no physicist has specially
 examined the nature of these lights (vol. ii. p. 490), and yet
 he gives a multitude of authorities most of whose observations
 are of very little value, except in the case of Volta, who, as
 he says, supposed that marsh-gas or carburetted hydrogen is
 the cause of these lights, and that the gas is kindled by means

    Now it is surprising that K'amtz, with his extensive
 knowledge of scienti<U+FB01>c literature, relating in any way to
 Meteorolog , should have ignored a work published in 1787,
 on Meteors, b the Abbé Bertholon, Professor of Experimental
 Physics at anguedoc, and member of various scienti<U+FB01>c
 societies. Taking advantage apparently of Priestley’s dis
 coveries, for, as he appropriately remarks, it was impossible
 to explain the Ignis Fatuus before gases were discovered, he
 describes a capital experiment which we must hear him relate
 in his own language :—
    “ Il est bien prouvé, ,par l’expérience et l’observation,
 que, dans les marais et les terrains marécageux, il y a de l’air
 in<U+FB02>ammable; i1 su<U+FB02>it, pour en obtenir, de remuer avec une
 canne la vase de ces endroits, aussitot on verra s’en échapper,
 a travers de l’eau qui en couvre plus ou moins la surface, une
 quantité assez considerable. Si dans cet instant on approche
 la lumiere d’une bougie on verra aussit<U+FB01>t l’air in<U+FB02>ammable
 s’allumer, et la <U+FB02>amme s’étendre au loin.” 1'
    The gas thus formed has often been collected in bottles full
 of water inverted over the spot ; it was found by Sir
 Humphry Davy and others to contain carbonic acid and a
 small quantity of nitrogen, the proportion of either or both of
 which would of course in<U+FB02>uence the character of the <U+FB02>ame.

   Many years ago, Major Blesson, of Berlin, made a number
of experiments in a valley in the Forest of Gubitz, in the
Newmarck, where the meteor was often seen. The valley
cuts deeply into compact loam, and is marshy at its lower
part. The water of the marsh contains iron, and is covered
with a shining crust. During the day, bubbles of gas were
seen rising from it, and at night bluish-purple <U+FB02>ames were
observed playing over the surface. On visiting the spot by,
night, the <U+FB02>ames retired as the Major advanced, the motion
of the air driving the burning gas before him.            On standing
still, the <U+FB02>ames returned, and he tried to light a piece of paper
at them ; but the current of air produced by his breath kept
the <U+FB02>ames at too great a distance. On turning away his
head, and screening his breath, he set <U+FB01>re to a strip of paper.
He also succeeded in putting out the <U+FB02>ame by driving it
before him to a part of the ground where no gas was pro
duced ; then, applying a <U+FB02>ame to the place whence the gas
bubbles issued, a kind of explosion was heard over eight or
nine square feet of the marsh; a red light was seen, which
faded to a blue <U+FB02>ame about three feet high, and this continued
to burn with an unsteady motion. As the morning dawned
the <U+FB02>ames became pale, and seemed to approach nearer and
nearer to the earth, until at last they faded'from sight. The
same observer also made experiments in other places. At
Malapane, in Upper Silesia, he passed several nights in a
forest where the meteor was to be seen. He succeeded in
extinguishing and in<U+FB02>aming the gas, but was not able to set
<U+FB01>re to thin strips of paper or shavings of wood by its means. .
In the Komski Forest, in Poland, the <U+FB02>ame appeared of a
darker hue than usual, and on attempting to ignite paper and
wood they became covered with a viscous kind of moisture,
thus reminding one of Musschenbroek’s observation when an
ignis fatuus was “ catched.” On another occasion he suc
ceeded in lighting up the igm's fatuus by standing at adistance
and throwing <U+FB01>re-works into the marshy ground. He visited
by night the summit of the Porta Westphalia, near Minden ;
the meteor was not visible, but on <U+FB01>ring off a rocket a number
of small red <U+FB02>ames were observed below, which soon went out,
but appeared again on <U+FB01>ring another rocket*.
    In conclusion, it seems scarcely necessary to remark that
writers in Cyclopaedias and Popular Guides to Science have
abundant sources of reliable information if they will only

take the trouble to look in the right places: for there cannot
be any ground for the doubts cast upon the subject in the
articles above quoted ; seeing that the ignis fatuus is produced
by the ignition either by lightning or by accidental <U+FB02>ame of
light carburetted hydrogen or marsh-gas which is generated
by the decay of vegetable matter in boggy places; and the
reason why the phenomenon is now so seldom seen is that these
places have been drained and brought under cultivation.

  LVII. On the Nature of Solution. By J. ALFRED WANKLYN,
                W. Jonnsronn, and W. J. COOPER‘“.
  THE venerable Dalton made the great discovery, about the
         year 1840, that contraction occurs when salts dissolve
  in water. In some instances the contraction is so great that
  the volume of the solution of the salt is not greater than that
  of the water itself—the contraction being as large as the
  volume of the anhydrous salt existing in the solution. Dalton
  experimented upon the same salt in its hydrated and in its
  anhydrous condition, and he also extended his investigation
  to a great variety of salts, and his results he sums up as
- follows‘l' :—“I have tried the carbonates, the sulphates, the
  nitrates, the muriates or chlorides, the phosphates, the arse
  niates, the oxalates, the citrates, the tartrates, the acetates,
   &c., &c., and have been uniformly successful : only the water
   adds to the bulk, and the solid matter adds to the weight.”
      Such was the condition in which Dalton left this subject
   about the year 1840. '
      Taking up the investigation where Dalton left off, we <U+FB01>nd
   that in the majority of cases there is indeed considerable con
   traction when salts dissolve in water, but that the degree of
   contraction varies very widely with different salts.            In some
   instances in which mineral matter dissolves in water, the
   contraction is so great that the volume of the solution is
   actually less than the volume of the water which forms it.
   This is strikingly exempli<U+FB01>ed by lime-water, which occupies
   less space than the water which it contains. On the other
   hand, there are cases where the volume of the solution of a
   mineral salt is almost as great as the sum of the volume of the
   salt plus the volume of the water in the solution.            (The solu
   tion of nitrate of silver is a case in point.) There are even
   instances where expansion takes place. This is exempli<U+FB01>ed
          “ Communicated by the Authors.

   474        Messrs. Wanklyn, Johnstone, and Cooper
  by some ammoniacal salts, where the volume of the solution
  has been found to exceed the sum of the volumes of water and
  dry salt.
      Finally, there is the very important and, we think, very
  common case where solution takes place without any change
  of volume whatever. Such a case is aiforded by solutions of
  cane-sugar*, which dissolves in Water in almost all propor
  tions, and the solutions of which occupy exactly the same
  volume as the separate water and sugar which enter into
  them.
      A characteristic example of solution is afforded by sugar and
  water ; and we hold that solution is mutual permeation with
  out change of volume, as exempli<U+FB01>ed by sugar and water.
      The changes of volume so frequently observed, in the
  instance of mineral salts, are due to chemical action, which is
  often a concomitant of solution.
      In order to trace the connexion between the speci<U+FB01>c gravity
 of solutions and the composition of solutions, the following
 method may be followed with advantage.
     We regard solutions as being generated by the entrance
 of successive units of' weight into a large unit of volume. The
 unit of weight is one gramme.           The unit of volume is 100
 cubic centim., or one litre. The unit of volume is taken to
 be constantly <U+FB01>lled with the solvent except in so far as it is'
 occupied by the thing dissolved.
     i = the increment-coef<U+FB01>cient ; that is to say, the increment
 of weight occasioned by the entrance of one gramme of the
 substance into 100 cubic centim., or one litre of solution. It
 is found experimentally by weighing the 100 cubic centim. or
 the litre of the solution, and subtracting the weight of 100
 cubic centim. or a litre of the pure solvent. If the solution
 contains more or less than one gramme of the substance in
 the 100 cubic centim. or litre of solution, the number of
 grammes must be ascertained and used as a divisor.
     When one gramme of a substance is inserted into 100 cubic
 centim. occupied by a solvent, one of three things must
happen :—
     (l) There may       be absolutely no change in volume—
neither contraction      n0r expansion. When one gramme of
mercury is dropped       into 100 cubic. centim. of water there is
neither contraction      nor expansion, and the gramme of mer
cury simply displaces its own volume of water, which over
<U+FB02>ows out of the 100 cubic centim. measure.             Sp. gr. bein

over<U+FB02>ows will be             : and the increment of weight in that
case would be
                             __    1
                                sp. gr:
Such a value we represent by 1'1.
                          i1=1— sp. 1gr. .
   This is the case of sugar, and no doubt of many organic
substances which simply dissolve in water without chemical
action of any kind.
   (2) There may be contraction. This is exempli<U+FB01>ed by
common salt and water. When one gramme of common salt
is inserted into 100 cub. centim. of water, the displaced water
is partly condensed and retained in the 100 cub. centim.
                      i—z'1=the condensate ;
that is to say, the weight of the water which, instead of
overflowing, is retained in the vessel when one gramme of
salt dissolves so as to give 100 cub. centim. of the solution.
    (3) There may be expansion. In such a case when one
gramme enters the 100 cub. centim. or the litre a larger
quantity than            will overflow and
                 sp. gr.
                 i—i1 becomes a minus quantity.
This is exempli<U+FB01>ed by chloride of ammonium, which under
goes decomposition when it is dissolved in water, and the
 volume of the solution of that salt actually exceeds the sum
of the volumes of the water and the salt in their separate
condition.
    In a series of papers which have recently appeared in the
‘ Chemical News,’ we have treated solution from this point of
 view, and shown that the condensate (i—il), in the case of
 very many salts, bears an atomic relation to the gramme of
 salt which occasions it.
                          Sugar and lVater.
    The ordinary tables of the speci<U+FB01>c gravities of solutions of
 different strengths are constructed so as to mask the regu-,
 larity of the relation between speci<U+FB01>c gravity and strength.
 The common sugar table, for instance, gives the speci<U+FB01>c
 gravities corresponding to the strength represented in per
 centage by weight. That mode of statement hides the regu
 larity; but when the table is transformed so as to set out

strength in terms of the number of grammes of sugar in 100
cub. centim. of solution, then there are indications of regu
larity. By a very obvious method of calculation this trans
formation may be e<U+FB02>'ected. The ordinary tables when so
treated exhibit some departure from regularity.
   We have undertaken a revision of the table and our result
is that these departures from regularity are experimental
errors.
   Our results are as follows :—

   In these experiments we have compared the weight of the
sugar-solutions with the weight of an equal volume of dis
tilled water at the same temperature as the sugar-solution,
and in each instance have used a half-litre speci<U+FB01>c-gravity
bottle *, except in the last experiment.
   The last measurement was made with a 100 cub. centim.
bottle, and has not the same claim to be considered highly
accurate as the other <U+FB01>ve measurements; and we attribute
the slight difference in that case to experimental error, and to
another cause which may be considered hereafter.
   The value of i for sugar we <U+FB01>nd therefore to be '388, and
it is constant over a very wide range, viz., from 1 grm. of
sugar per litre of solution up to 750 grin. of sugar per litre
of solution.
   The speci<U+FB01>c gravity of solid sugar required in order to
make i1='388 is 1'634. The speci<U+FB01>c gravity of sugar is
given in the text-books as l'606’f, which would make 2', = '37 73.
   Sugar, therefore, presents an example of equality between
i and i1 ; that is to say, its solutions in water occupy exactly
the same volume as the separate water and sugar which form
them.
   At the beginning of this paper we called attention to Dal
ton’s discovery of the contraction which takes place when

        Theorie der Quaternionen.     Von Dr. P. MOLENBROEK.
                             Leiden, 1891.
‘VE are told in the Preface that this theoretical volume, of 284
         pages, is to be followed immediately by another containing
systematized applications.     It is to be hoped, rather than expected,
that this second volume will not exhibit the prolixity and the
uncalled-for minuteness of detail which purposely characterize the
<U+FB01>rst. We say purposely because, though Dr. Molenbroek states
that Hamilton’s great Treatise (which is accessible to continental
readers in a German translation) is so extensive in its theoretical
part as to frighten readers away from the applications, he complains
that the work of Prof. Tait (also accessible in translations) gives
an inadequate (diirftig) account of the theory. Hence his own
work is designed to occupy a position midway, as it were, between
these two treatises.     And it does so more by laboriously spinning
out the parts treated by Tait, than by introducing other material
from Hamilton’s stores.
    When we examine the work itself, we <U+FB01>nd that Dr. Molenbroek’s
 notions as to the really important parts of the theory differ very
 widely from those of Hamilton and his pupil. So far as we can
 discover, there is not in his work even an allusion to v! How the
 promised applications, if they are to deal at all with potentials,
 <U+FB02>uid motion, &c., are to be made in the second volume, must
 therefore for the present remain a mystery. On the other hand,
 the subject of powers and roots of quaternions, not at present of
 much use in applications, is developed at disproportionate length.
    But the novel feature of the work, and one to which special
 attention is directed in the Preface, is of a really startling cha
 racter; inasmuch as it is entirely at variance with the elementary
 de<U+FB01>nitions given by Hamilton, and reproduced by Dr. Molenbroek
 himself ! Comment on such a proceeding is altogether unnecessary.
 We need do no more than state that he regards an imaginary
 scalar multiplier as an undetermined quadrantal quater-n'ion, which
 has the singularly felicitous but hitherto unsuspected power of
 adjusting its axis so as to be perpendicular to any vector to which
 it may be applied! His volume of examples and applications will
 certainly be eagerly expected, if it is to contain other gems like
 that enunciated (p. 104) in the following words :—
    “ Man kann somit sagen, ein doppelbrechender Krystall lionne
 \vie ein kouisch spaltender Qualernion wirken.”

form would appear to have even more singular and important

                  CHEMICAL ACTION AT A DISTANCE.
                       BY S. U. PICKERING, F.R-S.
IN the Philosophical Magazine for August (p. 145) there appears
      a paper by Prof. Ostwald bearing this somewhat theatrical
title: in it the author describes some experiments for which, in
his opinion, “a satisfying explanation can be <U+FB01>rst gained on the
ground of the Theory offree i0ns,”and which, having been “ worked
out at [his] writing-table before [he] had seen anything of the pheno
mena in, question . . . . speak,” he considers, “ more forcibly than any
polemics for the value of this theory.” The object of the present
note is to try and elicit some explanation as to what the dil<U+FB01>culty
is in explaining, or even predicting, the facts on the old theory of
electrochemical action, and whyr they are to be regarded as alford
ing any proof of the truth of the dissociation theory.                  ‘
   The chief experiment is as follows :—A zinc-platinum couple is
placed in a solution of potassium sulphate, and on adding sulphuric
acid to the liquid near the platinum the acid is decomposed with
liberation of hydrogen while the zinc goes into solution, whereas,
when the acid is added to the liquid near the zinc, no action occurs.
The explanation of such a result appears to be perfectly simple
without the aid of the dissociation hypothesis. We have only to
remember that a zinc-platinum couple will not decompose potas
 sium sulphate, but will decompose sulphuric acid, and that these
-e<U+FB01>ects will, in all probability, remain una<U+FB02>'ected by the slight modi
<U+FB01>cation of the ordinary contacts obtaining in Prof. Ostwald’s
 experiment : also that in all salt—solutions there is a continual
 interchange going on between the ions in contiguous molecules,
 which interchange involves no expenditure of work. That being
 so, the action will be represented by the following scheme :—
            +            l                                  -
           Zn        SOQK2       SOQK2          SO4§H2     Pt.
    No work, or only an in<U+FB01>nitesimal amount, is done in transferring
 the K2 from one SO4 to the next: no potassium sulphate is really
 decomposed, for there are as many molecules of it present after as
 there were before the reaction; and the only body which is decom—
 posed is the acid, a decomposition which we know a zinc-platinum
 couple will effect. The following scheme shows that if the acid is
 placed in contact with the zinc no decomposition could occur unless
 the couple were capable of decomposing the potassium sulphate,
 which it is not.

    Such an explanation appears to me to be much more simple than
 one which involves the idea that neutral zinc, when placed in a
 neutral solution, shoots OH positive ions, leaving the remaining
 portion of the metal negative; the electric charges which convert
 the atoms into ions consisting of a something, and the charging
 being accomplished in a manner, of which, as Prof. Ostwald
 admits (p. 148), no explanation can be given.
    Other experiments are quoted which seem no less inconclusive
 than the above in favour of the dissociation theory. The slow
 dissolution of copper in weak oxygenated sulphuric acid would
 seem to be explained at least as well on the view that the copper
 is <U+FB01>rst oxidized, and that the oxide of copper then dissolves (copper
 oxide, but not metallic copper, being capable of doing so with
 evolution of heat), as on the view that the hydrogen ions of
 the acid are oxidized, and thus give place for the copper ions shot
 oif from the metal. The dissolution of gold in chlorine-water
 obviously requires no recourse to the free ion theory for an expla
 nation ; nor does the following experiment, which practically closes
 the list of Prof. Ostwald’s “ proofs.” A beaker containing ferrous
 chloride solution is connected, by means of a siphon containing
 sodium-chloride solution, with another beaker containing chlorine
 solution: on inserting connected platinum plates into the beakers a
 current passes, and the ferrous chloride becomes chlorinated to ferric
 chloride. Here the platinum in the one beaker is slightly acted on
 by the chlorine, and therefore becomes electropositive towards the
 platinum in the beaker with the ferrous chloride; the latter pla
-tinum consequently becomes electronegative, the iron atoms in its
 proximity become more than usually electropositive, being thereby
 rendered capable of attaching to themselves more chlorine, accord
 ing to the following scheme :—

    It is perhaps more probable that the chlorine atoms which the
 sodium atoms on the extreme right combine with are derived, not
 directly from-the chlorine molecules as represented in this scheme,
but from molecules of hydrochloric acid or platinum chloride
present in the liquid. The chlorination of the ferrous chloride
naturally occurs with those molecules which are nearest to the
negative platinum, as Prof. Ostwald observes is the case.         It is
(lith'cult to see why such an experimentshould be regarded as a
   roof of the dissociation theory.

    The author raises the objection to previous investigations on this
subject, that exothermal chemical processes have in many cases
been used in which the heat developed must have a disturbing
in<U+FB02>uence. The apparatus of the author consists of two metal
vessels <U+FB01>tting one in the other, the inner one of which has a. capacity
of 7 litres; this is <U+FB01>lled with water which has been boiled and
then saturated with carbonic acid, and closed air-tight with a glass
plate. Carefully selected subaqueous plants were placed in the
water. This physiological actinometer was exposed to the sun’s
rays, and the quantity of oxygen found was determined. At the
same time the action of heat and the brightness of the solar radia
tion was measured. \Vith different heights of the sun the
ratio of the oxygen disengaged to the strength of the radiation was
almost constant.-—Boll. dell Acad. di C'utaniu, Jan. 1891 ; Beihliitter

     ON WHEATSTONE’S DETERMINATION OF THE VELOCITY OF
                 ELECTRICITY.     BY PROF. J. STEFAN.
    Kirchhoff, in his paper on the Motion of Electricity in Wires,
 <U+FB01>rst showed in 1857 that, under certain conditions, electricity
 moves in a thin wire according to the laws of wave—motion, and
 with a velocity which may be put equal to that of light. The
 agreement between the velocities of electricity and light is only
 attained when the <U+FB01>rst travels in a straight wire stretched in the air.
 Kirchhoff has restricted his investigation to this case. If the bases
 of his calculation are applied to other cases, for instance to a wire
 which is wound in a zigzag, or is coiled in a spiral, it is found that
 electricity travels in such a Wire with far greater velocity. In
 Wheatstone’s well-known experiment a wire was used which was
 coiled in twenty straight windings, and the velocity of electricity
 was found to be half as great again as that of light. I think that
 in the preceding I have given the right explanation of this result. 1
 have, however, attempted to give this explanation an experimental
 support, and have employed the method given by Hertz of pro
 ducing stationary waves in wires. I used a circuit like that in
 Wheatstone’s experiment, but on a smaller scale, connected it with
 a couple of long straight Wires, and compared the length of the
 wave in the circuit with the length of the same wave in the straight
 wires. The wave in the circuit is considerably longer, and in con
 formity with this the velocity of electricity in the circuit is greater
  than in the straight wires, and, according to my experiments, in a
  ratio which exceeds that found by Wheatstone.—Wiener Berichte,

  LX. The In<U+FB02>uence of Surface-Loading on the Flemure of
            Beams. By Prof. C. A. CARUS WILSON *.
                                [Plate H.]
THE practical treatment of the problem of beam-<U+FB02>exure at
        the present time is based on the hypothesis enunciated
by Bernoulli and Euler 1', that the bending-moment is pro
portional to the curvature.
   This assumes that the cross sections remain plane after
<U+FB02>exure and neglects the surface-loading effect.
    Saint-Venant has shownlt that the <U+FB01>rst assumption is
untenable ; but that, neglecting the surface-loading, Ber
noulli’s results are strictly true for one particular case of
loading, that, namely, of a beam doubly supported and carry
ing a single isolated load, where, although the cross sections
are distorted, the central displacement is zero.
    I propose in this paper to describe some experiments made
with a view to determining the actual state of strain in a
beam doubly supported and centrally loaded, the surface
loading effect being taken into account.
    The method of investigation adopted is based upon the
following assumptions :—
    (1) The true state of strain at the centre of the beam may
be found by superposing on the state of strain due to bending
only, that due to surface-loading without bending.

     (2) The state of strain due to surface-loading only may be
found, with close approximation to truth, by resting the beam
on a <U+FB02>at plane instead of on two supports.
     (3) The strains due to bending only may be obtained from
the Bernoulli-Saint-Venant results ; viz. :—
    (a) The stretch for any cross section varies as the distance
from the neutral axis.
    (18) The central axis is unstretched.
    (7) For the same point in different cross sections the
stretch varies as the bending-moment.
     Saint-Venant has dealt with the shearing-strains at some
little distance from the load in the case of a beam doubly
supported and centrally loaded* ; and Professor Pearson has
shown‘r that, in the case of beams continuously loaded, the
results of the Bernoulli-Eulerian theory can only be con
sidered as giving approximate formulae when the span of the
beam is not less than ten times its depthi.
    The mathematical determination of the state of strain pro
duced by the loading of a beam as it rests on a <U+FB02>at plane is
one of considerable analytical dif<U+FB01>culty.
    MM. Lamé and Glapeyron have attempted the solution of
a more general problem in their “Mémoire sur l’équilibre
intérieur des corps solides homogenes.”§ The object of this
paper is stated to be “to investigate the way in which the
interior of a body is affected by the transmission through it
of the action of forces.” Here they treat the problem of a
solid extending to in<U+FB01>nity on one side of a plane, on_ which is
a given distribution of tractive load, and also of a solid con
tained between two parallel in<U+FB01>nite planes. They obtain as
a result a set of de<U+FB01>nite integrals giving the displacements,
introducing a function involving the distribution of tractive
load, from which the stresses may be deduced, but concerning
which they add : “ Les formules précédentes, pour étre
obtenues en séries numériques et immédiatement applicables,
exigent la connaissance des valeurs d’un genre particulier
d’intégrales dé<U+FB01>nies, dont il ne nous parait que les géométres
se soient encore occupés.”

means of polarized light was <U+FB01>rst suggested by Sir David
Brewster*_. and his experiments are usually quoted as proving
the truth of the Bernoulli-Eulerian theory of <U+FB01>exure. It is,
however, easy to show experimentally that these experiments
must have been made under conditions where the surface
loading etfect was inappreciable ; though very accurate reason
ing on this point is impossible, as the drawings accompanying
Sir David Brewster’s paper are not to scale, and the span of
the beams and the precise method of application of the loads
are not indicated.

   It has already been pointed out* that “ Neither Neumann
nor Maxwell seems to have remarked that the difference of the
velocities of the ordinary and extraordinary rays depends
solely on the maximum slide of planes perpendicular to the
wave-front.”
    An important work on this subject is found in a paper by
Dr. John Kerr’f. He establishes the fact that “If a plate of
glass, compressed or extended in one direction parallel to its
faces, be traversed normally by two pencils of light, which
are polarized in planes respectively parallel and perpendicular
to the direction of strain, then both pencils are retarded by
the strain in the case of compression, and both are accelerated
 by the strain in the case of tension.” Also that “ strain
generated retardations, absolute as well as relative, are sensibly
 proportional to the strain,” thus con<U+FB01>rming Wertheim’s
 results.                                                 '
    Dr. Kerr employs in his experiments a bent glass beam,
doubly supported and centrally loaded, having the ratio of
span to depthi of 8'4 to 1, and assumed to obey the Ber
noulli-Eulerian theory.
    I would draw attention to the disagreement between the
results arrived at by M. Neumann and Dr. Kerr, the former
stating that the velocity of light in a medium is increased by
compressing it, while the latter states that the velocity is
diminished.
    Dr. Kerr examined a beam having a span equal to 8'4
depths, and at a point where the surface-loading effect would
be least; whereas M. Nenmann examined a beam—span to _
depth ratio not stated—immediately under the load.
   I can only attempt to account for the discrepancy by
pointing out that if the span is diminished to less than four
depths, the elements of glass that M. Neumann assumed to
be in a state of squeeze are actually, as will be shown later,
in a state of stretch.                                - .

two steel rollers, and is loaded by a micrometer-screw which
bears on a third central roller. The base of the frame is
divided, from the centre, in divisions of 2 millim. so that the
supports can be set for any required span. A micrometer
screw is placed in the base of the frame opposite the load, so

in any direction in its own plane, so that all parts of the beam
may be examined. The optical arrangements consist of two
nicols, of which the upper is provided with a graduated disk on
which the angle of rotation can be observed; a microscope
with micrometer-eyepiece can be <U+FB01>tted when it is desired to
measure the fringes; circularly polarized light can be used
when required.
   The beams used were marked on one side with 2 millim.
squares; they were covered with paraf<U+FB01>n and marked in a
dividing-engine and then etched ; the lines thus formed
enabled the position of dark bands to be determined with
accuracy.
                            Proposition I.
   If a beam of glass be laid on a <U+FB02>at surface and loaded across
its upper surface, the shear at any point on the normal at the
point of contact of the load is inversely proportional to the
distance from the point of contact.
   Eaperiment 1. A beam of annealed glass 61 millim. x 6'5
millim. X 20 millim. deep was placed in the steel straining
frame with its narrow side resting on a piece of thin paper.
   A steel roller 2 millim. in diameter, 10 millim. long, was
placed across the middle of the top surface and loaded by the
screw.
   The nicols were crossed and at 45° to the axis of the beam.»
   A quarter-wave mica plate was placed between the beam
and the analyser, with the plane containing the optic axes at
right angles to the length of the beam.
   At that point a on the normal where the difference of phase
between the ordinary and extraordinary pencils traversing the
beam is equal and opposite to the difference of phase produced
by the mica plate—the effect will be as if there were no
strained glass between the two nicols, and there will therefore
be a black spot as the nicols are crossed.
   The position of this spot on the normal is plotted on a
 sheet of squared paper, and an ordinate parallel to the axis
chosen to represent the shear.
   A second quarter-wave plate is now superposed on the <U+FB01>rst,
and the black spot consequently moves up the normal to where
the shear is twice what it was at a ; this point, 12, is noted, the
second mica plate removed, and the load reduced until the
black spot with one mica plate is brought to b. In this way
a series of points a, b, c, d on the normal are found at any one
of which the shear is twice what it is at the point below.
   Now -it is proved "later on that the strain at any point

488        Prof. C. A. Carus Wilson on the In<U+FB02>uence of
varies as the load on the beam ; hence by taking the ordinate
at b twice that at a, at 0 four times, and at d eight times, and
so on, the get points on the curve of loading along the normal
for the load that gives a difference of phase at a equal to that
of one-quarter wave-plate.
    The results are plotted on Plate II. <U+FB01>g. 1: the observed
  oints are indicated by circles, through one of which an
iiyperbola has been drawn taking the normal and the upper
 surface of the beam as asymptotes.
    It will be seen that the six upper circles lie very nearly on
 the hyperbola.
    It is clear that the upper surface of the beam is an asym
 ptote only when the surface of contact between the beam and
 the roller is a line—making the stress there in<U+FB01>nite ; but in
 practice this cannot be so, the smallest pressure giving a.
 bearing surface—as the roller indents the beam—making the
 stress there <U+FB01>nite, i. e. the asymptote will be at some <U+FB01>nite
 distance 0, say, above the point of contact, and 6 will vary
 with the load. I have calculated below that with a load of
 115-3 lb. on this same beam, the value of 0 is 0044 millim.
    The apparently irregular position of the two lower points
 observed indicates the amount of error made in the assumption
 (2) above that the surface-loading effect may be found by
 substituting a <U+FB02>at plane instead of two supports.
    This assumption would be correct only if the beam were
 of in<U+FB01>nite depth and the surface-loading effect of the support
 in<U+FB01>nitely small; here, however, the steel frame itself pro
 duces a surface effect, and this, added to that due to the load,
 makes the points observed lie off the hyperbola, which would
 be the true curve (as drawn) if the beam were of in<U+FB01>nite depth.
    The effect of the steel frame must be very small compared
 with that due to the load for points in the upper half of the
 beam. In drawing the hyperbola I have considered it as
 negligible at the centre of the beam ; in other words, I con
 sider that the correction of the position of the six upper
 points, required to allow for the surface effect of the frame,
 would not make them deviate seriously from the hyperbola.
    It must be noted, however, that when the beam is resting
 on two supports the surface effect of the frame disappears,
 since the beam only touches the supports and surface effect
 can only be caused by actual contact ; hence I conclude that
 the surface effect due to leading only is strictly represented
 by the hyperbola and is as if the beam were of in<U+FB01>nite depth*.
   * According to this reasoning there appears to be ashear of <U+FB01>nite
 amount at the bottom of the beam—when doubly supported—due to
 leading only, but this does not seem to me to be inconsistent with the
 surface conditions.

           Surface-Loading on the Flexure 0f Beams.                 489
   In order to establish the hyperbolic law with greater
certainty, experiments were made enabling as many as seven
points on the curve to be obtained within 3'5 millim. of the
point of contact, the highest point being about '5 millim.
from the top of the beam.
   Within this range the effect due to the steel frame may
with accuracy be neglected.
    Experiment 2. A beam of annealed glass, 61 millim. x 6'5
millim. x 20 millim. deep, was placed in the steel straining
frame, on a piece of thick paper, and loaded as before with the
steel roller 2 millim. in diameter.
    Nicols crossed and at 45° to the axis of the beam.
    The screw load was applied until six interference-fringes
appeared under the roller; these were examined through a.
microscope with a micrometer-eyepiece divided to thousandths
of an inch. Light from a sodium-<U+FB02>ame was used, and the
distance between the point of contact and the intersection of
 each fringe with the normal .was measured in micrometer
divisions.
    I. Distances in micrometer-divisions to successive fringes :
        11'0     13'5      170         230        350        71'5,
but the shears are as 6 . 5 . 4 . 3 . 2 . 1, since there is a difference
of phase of only % a wave-length required to produce a fringe,
hence taking the products of distances into shears we get
        660      67'5      68'0        69-0       70-0       71'5.
    But we have so far neglected the value of 0, the distance of
the axis of shears  from the point of contact.
    By taking the    two most reliable observations, where the
distance from the   point of contact is large and yet where the
fringes are well      de<U+FB01>ned, we should have, if the law is
hyperbolic,

      125      15-25       18-75     25-0      37-0      760,
and the products of the distances into the shears become
      75'0     76'25       75'0     75'0      740      760.

   To <U+FB01>nd 0 take 3(26+6)=4(l9'25 +6), whence 6:1.
   Correcting the distances, we have
      1175     135      16'25    20'25   27'0    400    815,

      82'25    81'0     81'25    810    810     800     815.
   The law of variation of shear along the normal is thus
shown to be hyperbolic.
   Experiment 3. The steel straining-frame was removed from
 the instrument and—by a screw inserted in the place of the
 straining-screw—hung from a balance, which could be loaded
 with shot and had a leverage of 50 to l : a steel stirrup
 was hung over the frame with two hardened points resting
 on the two guidingapins; one lower end of the stirrup was
 secured to the body of the balance, the beam inserted and
 balanced, and shot put in the pan. This lifted the straining
 frame and loaded the beam.
    Beam [B] 56 millim. X 20 millim. x 6'5 millim. placed on
 the base of the steel frame on a piece of thin paper : loaded by
 a steel roller 2 millim. in diameter. Viewed through nicols
 crossed and at 45° to the horizontal axis of the beam.
    The balance was loaded until the <U+FB01>rst blue fringe was
 brought down to a iven position on the beam, and the weight
 of shot observed ; l e same fringe was then brought down to
 a lower given position, and the weight of shot again observed,
 and so on for successive points.

   If the shear at 4'2 millim. with 147 lb. be taken as unity,
the shear at 5'2 millim. with this same load will be 4%}, since
the same shear is produced at 5'2 millim. with 181 lb. as is
produced at 4'2 millim. with 147 1b. Hence if the curve of

polarized light, as in Clerk-Maxwell’s experiments, in order
to obtain the variations in the amount of the strain uncom
plicated by variations in the directions of the principal stress
axes ; white light was used.
   The loci of points of equal shear were found to be circles,
as in the <U+FB01>gure; circles of equal shear were obtained up to
8 millim. diameter with this beam.
   Hence the shear at any point a equals the shear at b, if
0 ba is a circle, and o b the normal at o ; i. e. shear at a

inversely proportional to its distance from the point of contact.
                         Proposition III.
  The state of strain at the centre of the beam when doubly
supported may be found by superposing on the state of strain
due to bending only, that due to surface-loading without
bending.
          ' See Professor Boussinesq’s results quoted already.

             Surface-Loading on the Flemure of Beams.                 493
    It has been proved that the state of strain along the normal
at the point of contact due to the surface-loading may be
represented by an hyperbola whose asymptotes are re
s ectively the normal itself and a line parallel to the axis of
the beam at a distance 0 from the point of contact. Let
0 C, O D in <U+FB01>g. 3 represent these asymptotes, O E=0 ; let an
h perbola be drawn whose ordinates parallel to O D represent
t e shear at any point along E C for a given load : since the
shear is proportional to the compressive stress, these ordinates
may be considered as proportional to the compressive stress at
anyr point along E O.
      y our (0:) assumption we may represent the stresses at an
point along E 0, due to bending, by a right line drawn through
 C, the centre of the depth.
    Let G K be such a line, drawn on the same scale as the
hyperbola, so that E K represents the shear (vertical stretch)
at E due to bending *, while E M represents the shear (vertical
 squeeze) due to loading.
     These two curves must intersect at some point N ; at the
 corresponding point P on the normal the shear (vertical
 squeeze) due to the loading is equal to the shear (vertical
 stretch) due to the bending : an element of volume at P will
 therefore be subject to voluminal compression only, and the
 shear will be zero, there will therefore be no birefrin ent
 action, and when viewed with crossed nicols there shoul be
 a dark spot on a white <U+FB01>eld.
     If the load is kept constant and the span diminished, E K
 will decrease until 0 K cuts the hyperbola at a second point ;
 we should now get two points of darkness.                As the span is
 still diminished these dark points should rise and fall re
 spectively until they coincide, when 0 K is a tangent to the
 hyperbola ; after this they should separate out at right
 an les.
     Tlate II. <U+FB01>g. 2 gives the results of an experiment (5) made
 with constant load and varying spans. The beam was 128
 millim. x 19 millim. deep X 5‘5 millim. thick, supported on
 two steel rollers 2 millim. in diameter and centrally loaded
 over a similar roller: the nicols were crossed and at 45° to
 the axis.     The following table gives the spans :—
    * The compressive stress due to bending, at any point on O E, produces
  a shear (vertical stretch) and a voluminal compression, and both are pro
  portiona to the stress, similarly for the shear (vertical squeeze) and
  voluminal compression roduced by the stress due to the loading; so for
  this purpose it is indi 'erent whether the ordinates of the two curves
  represent the compressive stresses or the shears produced.

   This experiment shows that there are, generally, two \points
of zero shear which close up as the span diminishes and then
open at right angles.
   The same phenomena may be observed by placing a beam
on a <U+FB02>at surface and loading it, and then placing over this
beam a second, which may be bent with a very long span, or
by two couples at the end ; the effect is the same for different
degrees of bending as for varying spans in the former
experiment.
   Thus for spans of four to <U+FB01>ve depths the normal under the
load is divided into three parts by two points of zero shear,
elements between these points being subject to shear (vertical
stretch), while elements above and below them are subject to
shear (vertical squeeze).
   When, however, the span is less than four depths, every
element in the cross section under the load is subject to shear
(vertical squeeze) and the greatest strained element is im
mediately under the load.
   These results may be further checked and con<U+FB01>rmed by
examining each part of the normal by placing over it a beam
bent in the hand ; if the part under examination is in shear,
say (vertical squeeze), darkness may be produced by super
posing a part of the second beam oppositely strained; if the
strains were similar, increased brightness would result.
   I exhibit also the results of experiments made to determine
the position of the black bands for lower ratios of span to
de th.

nicols crossed and at 45° to the axis.
   Here the effect of the supports is very marked, so that
when p==2 the black band only just touches the axis.
   It must be remembered that at the point where the black
band cuts the normal the shear is zero, but that everywhere
else on the hand all that is indicated is that the directions of
resultant tension and compression are at 45° to the axis of the
beam.

           Surface-Loading on the Flemme of Beams.           495
   Experiment 6 was made to establish Proposition III. with
greater certainty.
   Beam 128 millim. x 19 millim. x 5'5 millim. was placed
on the base of the straining-frame, on a piece of thin paper,
and loaded with shot until the <U+FB01>rst blue fringe came down to
a point 1'7 millim. from the top. The load was 65 lb.
   The same beam was then supported on two steel rollers
2 millim. in diameter and 120 millim. apart, and centrally
loaded over a similar roller until the same blue fringe appeared
at the bottom of the beam.     The load was 55 lb.
   An hyperbola has been drawn (see <U+FB01>g. 1, Plate II.) of con
venient proportions, cutting the horizontal through the above
mentioned point at 28'5 divisions from the normal ; the shear
corresponding to the blue fringe is thus represented by 28‘5
divisions, and there is that shear at the point with a load of
65 lb.
   Now the stress due to bending, at the extreme bottom <U+FB01>bre
of a beam 19 millim. deep, 120 millim. span, and 5'5 millim.
thick, with a load of 55 1b., is 1'436 tons per square inch.
   The vertical compressive stress at this point, due to the
load of 55 1b., is, as is shown later on, 0121 ton per square
inch ; but we are not justi<U+FB01>ed in superposing the shears pro
duced by these two stresses, being tensile and compressive at
right angles, and the former as much as twelve times the
latter, so I shall take the stress at the blue fringe as 1'436
tons per square inch.
   Hence the compressive stress produced by 65 lb. over a
span of 120 millim., at the top <U+FB01>bre, is               -
                           1436 x   Q5
                                    55’
and the corresponding value in scale-divisions is
                       65     28'5
              l      X g X         = 33'7 divisions.
    This distance is set off along the top surface in the <U+FB01>gure,
and the point so found joined to the centre of the middle
 section : where it cuts the hyperbola we should get darkness
 on the normal with a span of 120 millim. Vl’e can also
 draw lines representing the bending-stresses for other spans
 for the same load of 65 lb.
    The position of the black bands on the normal, as found by
 experiment for spans of 120 and 100 millim., are indicated on
 the normal, and will be found to a ree very closely with those
 points found independently by t e intersection of the two
 curves.

496      Prof. C. A. Carus Wilson on the In<U+FB02>uence of
   The curve of bending-stresses is a tangent to the curve of
loading at a span of 73 millim., as measured from the <U+FB01>gure,
whereas it is apparently 82 millim. when actually observed ;
it would appear more correct to determine this span by draw
ing the curve through two points which can be observed with
accuracy, and then drawing the tangent and measuring the
intercept, since the experimental determination of the span
giving coincidence of the two dark bands is one liable to
considerable error.
   By drawing lines from the centre to the points along the
top surface corresponding to longer spans we see that the
deviation of the so-called “neutral axis” from the centre is
considerable : thus even at a span = 10 depths = 190 millim.
it should be 1 millim. above the centre.
                         Proposition IV.
   The strain at every point along the normal due to loading
varies directly as the load.
   Emperiment 7. The beam is placed on two supports as
before, with a small central load, and the points of intersection
of the black bands with the normal are noted. The load is
now increased up to the safe limit when the points of inter
section are observed to remain unaltered.
   We know that the strain at any point on the normal due to
bending is proportional to the load ; hence if the point of
intersection of the curves of bending and loading remains the

any point due to the loading must vary as the load.

This memoir was shortly followed by a second i, treating of
the integration of the equations involved.
      Rankine has examined the form of the curves of Principal
Stress, and given an expression from which the curves can be
drawn §. He neglects the surfacealoading effect as “in most
cases practically of small intensity when compared with the
other elements of stress.”            On comparing his curves with
those in Plate II. it will be noticed how closely the curves of
tension agree, while the curves of compression are very
dissimilar.             ,                                                    .
      Sir George Airy has calculated and drawn the curves of
principal stress for several cases of <U+FB01>exure, including that of
a beam doubly supported and centrally loaded II. He assumes
“that there is a neutral point in the centre of the depth ; that;
on the upper side of this neutral point the forces are forces of
tension, and on the lower side are forces of compression, and
that these forces are proportional to the distances from the
neutral point; ” but he says“ These suppositions seem to imply
that the actual extensions or compressions correspond exactly,
to the curvature of the edge of the lamina.” The. surface:
leading effect is not here taken into account; and it would
have been interesting to compare the results as shown in
<U+FB01>g. 6, for a beam in which the span equals ten depths, with
the actual curve as found by experiment. This comparison,
however, would lead to erroneous conclusions, since it has
been shownil that the results arrived at are not consistent
with the fundamental equations, and the form of the curves
can be accepted only as a very general approximation.

deepx 5'5 millim. thick, was placed in the steel straining
frame on two steel rollers 2 millim. in diameter, and centrally
loaded over a similar steel roller.                            .
   The span chosen was 60 millim., giving for p the value 3'15.
   The nicols were crossed and set at an observed angle, and
the black band plotted on squared paper corresponding to the
squares on the glass beam. This band of course represents
the locus of points where the axes of principal stress are
parallel to the directions of the planes of the nicol.
   The nicols were then turned through a small angle a, the
new position of the black bands plotted, and so on for several
different angles. These curves are sh0wn in Plate 11. The
lines of principal stress are easily deduced from these and are
shown in Plate II. <U+FB01>g. 4.
    Since communicating the above, Sir George Stokes has
gone very fully into this problem, and has kindly allowed me
to quote the following extracts from letters I have received
from him on the subject :—
   “Let A be the point in the upper surface where the pres
sure (P) is applied ; B, G the points of support below, which I'
suppose to be equidistant from A; D the middle point of BC.
Let y be measured downwards from A; denote BD or DC
by a, and AB by b. You have the expressions for the stresses
produced by P in an in<U+FB01>nite solid (x: g; -             , and the
 question is, What system must we superpose on this to pass
 to the actual case? This, as 1 showed you, is the system of
 stresses produced bya system of forces applied to the surface.
 The forces consist—(l) of the two pressures %P at B and C;
 (2) of a continuous oblique tension below, represented in
 drawing by a fan of tensions directed at every point of the
 lower surface from the point A.
    “Imagine now the beam cut into two by a plane along
 A D. Consider one half only, say that on the B side. Every
 thing will remain the same as before, provided we supply to
 the surface A D forces representing the pressures or tensions
 which existed in the undivided beam. On account of the
 symmetry, the direction of these must be normal.
    “At D the vertical pressure on a horizontal plane in the
 in<U+FB01>nite solid is compounded with an equal vertical tension
 due to the fan. Hence, of the vertical pressure in A D which
 must be superposed on the vertical pressure in the in<U+FB01>nite
 solid, we know thus much without obtaining a complete solu
 sion of the problem, namely, that it must equal minus 2P/1rb

          I Surface-Loading on the Flewure of Beams.        501'
at D and 0 at A. If we suppose it to vary uniformly between,
we are not likely to be far wrong.
   “ This leads to the following expression for the vertical
pressure 'in A D :—
                         . 2P (1        y
                            7r y        b" I
   “ Now for the horizontal. We know that the complete
system of external forces must satisfy the conditions of equi
librium of a rigid body. The direction in each element of' the
fan passes through A, about which therefore the fan has no
moment. Hence the moment of the horizontal forces along
A D taken about A must equal éPa. Again, the resultant of
the semi-fan is a force passing through A, and its vertical
component is #1). Its horizontal component is the integral
of

   “ Hence of the horizontal forces along A D we know these
two things :—
            (l) The sum must equal 2,
            (2) The moment round A must equal lgrPa.
. “ In default of a knowledge of the law according to which
the force varies with y, it is natural to take it, for a more or
less close approximation, to be expressed by the linear func
tion A+ By, or say Y. To determine the arbitrary constants
A, B, we have only to equate the integral of Y . dy to g, and
that of Yy . dy to &Pa, the limits being 0 to b. We thus get

    LXI. Damping of Electrical Oscillations on Iron Wires.
                       By JOHN TROWBRIDGE *.
IT has generally been assumed by those who have studied
         the subject of very ra id oscillations of Electricity, such
as occur in Leyden-jar disc arges, that the magnetic character
of the conductor has very little in<U+FB02>uence upon the character
of the discharge. Thus, in a note to an article on Electrical
Waves (Annalen der Physik and Chemie, vol. cviii. 1859,
p. 499), W. Feddersen states that electrical oscillations may
suffer a slight weakening on iron ; but this diminution is very
slight, and results from the resistance of iron being greater
than that of other metals
    In Dr. Lodge’s treatise on Modern Views of Electricity
(ed. 1889) we <U+FB01>nd the following :—
    “But in the case of the discharge of a Leyden jar iron is of
no advantage. The current oscillates so quickly that any iron
introduced into its circuit, however subdivided into thin wires
it may be, is protected from magnetism by inverse currents
induced in its outer skin, and accordingly does not get mag
netized; and so far from increasing the inductance of the
discharge-circuit, it positively diminishes it by the reaction
eifect of these induced currents; it acts, in fact, much as a
mass of copper might be expected to do” (p. 365).
    Fleming writes as follows :—
    “ With respect to the apparent superiority of iron, it would
 naturally be supposed that since the magnetic permeability
 of iron bestows upon it greater inductance, it would form a
 less suitable conductor for discharging with great suddenness
electric energy. Owing to the fact that the current only
 penetrates just into the skin of the conductor, there is but
 little of the mass of the iron magnetized. Even if these instan
 taneous discharges are capable of magnetizing iron, . . . . the
 electromotive impulses or sudden rushes of electricity do not
 magnetize the iron, and hence do not <U+FB01>nd in it any greater
 self-inductive opposition than they would <U+FB01>nd in a non
 magnetic but otherwise similar conductor. “ Dr. Lodge’s further
 reSearches seem to show that there is a real advantage in using
 iron for lightning-conductors over copper, and that its greater
 speci<U+FB01>c resistance and higher fusing-point enable an iron rod
 or tape to get rid safely of an amount of electric energy
    " From an advance proof communicated by the Author.

    “ In the experiments on alternative path,” as described by
Dr. Lodge, “ the main result is very brie<U+FB02>y summed up by
saying that, where a sudden discharge had to pass through a
conductor, it was found that iron and copper acted about
equally well, and indeed iron sometimes exhibited a little
superiority, and that the thickness of the conductor and its
ordinary conductivity mattered very little indeed. In the
case of enormously rapid oscillations the value of the impul
sive impedance varies in simple proportion to the frequency
of the oscillations, and depends on the form and size of the
circuit, but not at all on its speci<U+FB01>c resistance, magnetic per
meability, or diameter. . . . . For discharges of a million per
second and upwards, such as occur in jar-discharges and per
haps in lightning, the impedance of all reasonably conduct
ing circuits is the same, and independent of conductivity and
permeability, and hardly affected _by enormous changes in
 diameter” 1’.
    Turning now to the observations of Hertz, we <U+FB01>nd it stated
that the material, resistance, and diameter of the wire of
the micrometer-circuit employed by him have very little
in<U+FB02>uence on the result. The rate of propagation of an elec
trical disturbance along a conductor depends mainly on its
capacity and coef<U+FB01>cient of self-induction, and only to a small
 extent on its resistance.       Hertz concludes that, owing to the
great rapidity of the alternations, the magnetism of the iron is
 unable to follow them and therefore has no effect on the self
induction. When a portion of the micrometer-circuit em
ployed by Hertz was surrounded by an iron tube, or replaced
 by an iron wire, no perceptible effect was obtained; and thus
 the result was apparently con<U+FB01>rmed that the magnetism of
 the iron is unable to follow such rapid oscillations and there
 fore exerts no appreciable effect. The velocity of propagation
 in a wire has a de<U+FB01>nite value independent of its dimensions
 and material. Even iron wires offer no exception to this,
 showing that the magnetic susceptibility of iron does not play
 any part in the case of such rapid motions

   Although the impulsive impedance is apparently not affected:
by the magnetic character of the wire, our experiments lead
us to believe that discharges of the quick period of a Leyden
jar are atfected very appreciably by the magnetic nature of
iron, steel, and nickel conductors. This etfect is so great
that it damps the electrical oscillations, and makes it dif<U+FB01>
cult to determine whether the time of oscillation is also
affected by the permeability of the conductor.
   The apparatus employed was similar to that described
in my investigations of electrical oscillations with an air
condenser (Proc. American Academy of Arts and Sciences,:
May 28, 1890). Certain important modi<U+FB01>cations, however,
were made. The plane mirror which I used in the former
research was replaced by a concave mirror of IO-feet focus and
3% inches in radius. This mirror was mounted upon the end
of the armature-shaft of a one-half horse-power electric motor.
   The discharging apparatus consisted of a sharp cutting-tool,
insulated, and mounted on the edge of the rotating disk bear
ing the mirror. It was metallically connected with a grooved
ring of brass mounted upon the shaft and insulated from it
by hard rubber.      Around this was wound a copper wire, one
end of which was connected with the discharging wire and
the other drawn taut by a rubber band. The electrical
discharge was thrown upon the circuit by pushing forward a
lever, which brought a solid hinged frame containing a strip
of soft type-metal into contact with the rapidly revolving
steel cutting-tool. An electrical contact was thus insured by
 the tool cutting a groove in the strip of type-metal. In order
to avoid a spark at the contact, the type-metal was thickly
 covered with a wax of peculiar composition. The only spark
 therefore that occurred was the one the oscillations of which.
 I desired to study. At each trial the type-metal was movedv
 so as to expose a new cutting surface. The type-metal was
 insulated from the rest of the apparatus but connected with
 the outer coating of the Leyden jar. First, both terminals
 of the Holtz machine were thrown off, and immediately after,
 the cutting-tool, ploughing its way through the type-metal,
 placed the outer coating of the Leyden jar in circuit with one
 of the two parallel wires leading to the terminals of the spark.
 The other wire was permanently in connexion with the inner
 coating of the jar.

              Electrical Oscillations on Iron Wires.         507
   Besides the short lead wires above described, the discharging
circuit consisted of two parallel wires 30 centim. apart and
510 centim. long. These were the only portions of the appa
ratus changed during the experiment, and they were replaced
by wires of different material and of different size. The other
conditions—length of spark, lead wires, and the copper cross
wire connecting the outer ends of the long parallel wires—
remained undisturbed throughout the experiment.
    The Leyden jar was charged each time as nearly as pos
sible to the same potential, judging by the number of turns
given the_ Holtz machine. It is unfortunate that no more
accurate means of measuring it were at hand, although the
different negatives showed but slight variation. The capacity
of the jar with alternations of this period was 5060 elec
trostatic units.                                                 -
    I describe the discharging portion of the apparatus
minutely, for the success of an investigation of this nature
depends upon the suppression of all sparks save that which
one wishes to observe, and my method surely and completely
accomplished this. The photograph of the spark could thus
be made to fall very accurately on the sensitive plate. When
one considers that the image of the spark was flying through
the air on a circle of ten feet radius with a velocity of a
mile a second, it will be seen that an extremely small
deviation in the point of contact between the cutting-tool
and the type-metal would have thrown the image entirely
o<U+FB02>' the sensitive plate. A singular phenomenon was noticed
in this connexion. When a comparatively low potential
 was used, such as that afforded by the air-condenser used in
our previous investigation, the cutting-tool ploughed two or
three millimetres along the surface of the type-metal before
 a spark passed at the point in the circuit where it was desired.
 With higher potentials this phenomenon was also observed
 but the extentof cutting was diminished. It is possible that
 the insulating wax may have melted under the sudden blow
 of the cutting-tool, and, flowing around it, prevented instant
 contact. This seems to me improbable, for a deep and clears
 cut groove was made in the soft type-metal. Great attention
 was paid to the solid structure of this contact apparatus.
 It was entirely separate from the support of the revolving
 parts and was perfectly steady.
    The other end of the armature-shaft was lengthened into a
 cylindrical chronograph, similar to that described in the
 article already cited, and its performance left nothing to be
 desired. A small Ruhmkorf coil excited by two storage
 cells, and interrupted by a scconds pendulum, gave a record

 508              Mr. J. Trowbridge on Damping of
 of the speed of the mirror.        The stylus which drew the spiral
 turns on the barrel of the chronograph was drawn along
 the barrel by means of a small heavily loaded carriage,
 which, on being released at the moment the lever arm threw
 the type-metal in contact with the cutting-tool, descended an
 inclined plane of adjustable height. A small Toepler Holtz
 machine charged a large Leyden jar, and it was found to work
 admirably in all states of the weather.
     The apparatus which I have thus described was the result
 of the experiments of the previous year and worked for months
 without failure; and the taking of photographs of the oscil
 lating discharge by it became a mere matter of routine.
     The following cases were tried :—
     (1) When the long parallel wires were of copper (diameter
 '087 centim.), the number of double oscillations visible on the
 negatives averaged quite uniformly 9 or 9‘5.
     (2) Where the wires were of German silver (diameter
 '061 centim.), 3 oscillations were visible.
     (3) But when an annealed iron wire (diameter '087 centim.)
was substituted, only the <U+FB01>rst return oscillation was distinctly
visible, with occasionally a trace of the <U+FB01>rst duplicate discharge.
     ( 4) On substituting fine copper wire (diameter '027 centim.),
 5 complete oscillations were quite uniformly visible.
     (5) Fine German silver wire ('029 centim.), nickel wire
 ('01!) centim.)*, soft iron ('027 centim.), and piano steel
wire ('027 centim.), gave but faintly the <U+FB01>rst return discharge
after the pilot spark.
     The pilot sparks were in all cases strong.
     The single return discharge through the iron wire did not
admit of measurement suf<U+FB01>ciently accurate to furnish any
basis for calculation of its self-induction. The time did not
apparently differ, if at all, by more than 14 or 15 per cent.
Some general reasoning based upon the number of oscillations
may be of interest. It must be acknowledged, however, that
this reasoning is open to criticism, although it affords the
most plausible explanation of the phenomenon. The phe—
nomenon itself is not a doubtful one.
  , The time of a double oscillation for the large-sized copper
wire was '0000020 sec., for the small copper wire '0000021
sec. The others, as far as could be determined, did not differ
much from these values, and for this purpose either value is
su<U+FB02>iciently accurate. Denote by R' the ohmic resistance of
the parallel wires to alternating currents of this periodicity,

w=2'4 ohms.

'8 ohm, leaving as a possible value for the resistance of the
Spark about 2 ohms.

    But neglecting the magnetic property of the iron,.its cal
culated resistance to alternating currents of this periodicity
was R’ =2'78 ohms. This is obviously inadequate and would
point to the conclusion that the oscillation is not, as some
times stated, too rapid to admit of the magnetic action of the
iron.

   It should be noticed that this estimate of ,u. necessitates
assuming that T and L remain the same within broad limits.
Measurements of the single oscillation on the negatives show
that this is near enough the case. Part of the more rapid
decay of the oscillation in the iron may be well ascribed to the
dissipation of energy by hysteresis. While we cannot place
much reliance upon an estimate of its value in such a case—
its percentage effect probably increasing rapidly with the
decay of the spark—it is not dif<U+FB01>cult to show that its in<U+FB02>uence
may be very great.
   There still remains the fact, not generally recognized, that
in Leyden-jar discharges through iron wires the magnetic
property of the iron has time very materially to modify the
character of the spark.
   I give an example of the measurement of the half. oscil
lation,which was the only one visible on the photograph of
the discharge over iron wires, all the others having been
damped or extinguished by the iron, in comparison with
the measurement of the similar half oscillation on copper
wires of the same diameter as the iron wires. The number of
oscillations on the copper wires was from eight to ten. The
total duration of the discharge on iron wires was only three
millionths of a second, while that on similar copper wires was
three hundred-thousandtbs of a second. A steel wire gave the
same results as the annealed iron wires.                                   "

    With a short Explanation and some Illustrations of its use
   by Professor JOHN PERRY, 17.80., F.R.S.*
                               [Plate 1.]
I HAD intended merely to present to the Society for publi
      cation a table of Zonal Spherical Harmonics. But some
Members whom I have consulted seem to think that I ought
also to give one or two examples of the practical use of such
a table. The Members of the Society will, I hope, pardon
my putting before them one or two elementary examples.
   The use of Spherical Harmonics in the numerical solution
of practical problems is almost unknown, I believe, except at
the Finsbury Technical College, where, every year, I have
been accustomed to make some Electrical Engineering students
work a few common examples. My students have for some
years been in possession of tables of zonal harmonics, but this
year I have thought it well to make the tables more complete
and to get them published for the general use of students of
practical physics.
   I have been told that many of the users of such a table
would be glad of a few statements of the general principles
underlying its use.     For the proofs of these statements readers

 be satis<U+FB01>ed with the treatment of the subject in Mr. Ferrer’s
 excellent treatise, which is, however, written only for beginners.
     In problems on Heat Conduction (V being temperature),
 on Hydrodynamics 0f incompressible <U+FB02>uids (V being velocity
 potential*), in Electrostatics (V being electric potential), in
 Magnetism (V being magnetic potential). and in many other
 applications of Physics, we require to <U+FB01>nd V a function of
 :v, y, z which shall satisfy the equation

 or, as it-is usually written, V9V=O . . . (1), and which shall
 also satisfy certain other conditions.             Now there are many
 kinds of function which satisfy equation (1).                 The de<U+FB01>nition
 of a Spherical Harmonic is “ a homo eneous function of
 .r, y, and 2, which satis<U+FB01>es equation (1).’                             '
     If such a function can be found, say of the 2th degree, and
 if we divide it by 12"“ where r2=m2+y2+z<U+FB01> it can‘be proved
 that the resulting expression will also satisfy (1), where i may
 be a positive or negative integer or fraction.
     Now if a Spherical Harmonic of degree 2' (generally called a
 Solid Spherical Harmonic) be divided by r‘, we get what is
 called a Surface Spherical Harmonic of degree 2'.
     It was shown by Green that if there is a function V
 which satis<U+FB01>es equation (1) at every point of any given
 surface, then it is the only function which satis<U+FB01>es (1)
 throughout space ; and there is always a function V obtainable
 which satis<U+FB01>es              It is the characteristic property of a
 surface spherical harmonic distribution of density of attracting
 matter on a spherical surface, that it produces a similar and
 similarly placed spherical harmonic distribution of potential
 over any concentric spherical surface throughout space, ex
ternal and internal.
     Instead of using .2, y, and z coordinates we may of course
use r, 0, and ¢ coordinates.

    In a great number of practical cases V is symmetrical
about an axis, and a symmetrical spherical harmonic is said
to be a Zonal Spherical Harmonic. Taking the axis of sym
 metry as the axis of .2, V is a function of z and Vw2+y2.
 Or, in polar coordinates, V is a function of 1- and 9.
    Let 0 be a point in the axis, the origin of coordinates;
let the distance of any point P from 0 be called r, let the
angle between 0 P and the axis be called 9, then in any dis
tribution which has an axis of symmetry we need only to
know 1* and 9. And over any spherical surface whose centre
is O,_the distribution will be a function of 9.       Any zonal
surface spherical harmonic is then merely a function of 9, and
I give a table of values of these for values of 9 differing by
 1° from 0° to 90°, up to the harmonic of the seventh degree.
These are indicated by P0, P1, P2, 850. P7.

a series of Zonal Spherical Harmonics. Take, for example, the

  There is an easy rule for expanding any function of 6 in
terms of P0, P1, P; &c.
  The following table up to P5 was primarily calculated
separately by Messrs. G. E. Holland and P. R. Jones, who
checked each other’s result by comparison.
  Mr. C. G. Lamb applied certain checks to the results of
Messrs. Holland and Jones, and then calculated P6 and P7.
  It is quite easy to extend the table to P8, for it can be
proved that there is a law connecting three consecutive har
monics, say the (12—2) th, (n—l)th, and the nth.

       When P1, P2, &c. are plotted 'as radial heights and depths
    above and below a quadrant, the resulting curves, especially
    if coloured, are exceedingly interesting. A student can draw
    them to a useful scale in about one hour.

outside. Taking the diametral plane as the equator and 9 as
the co~latitude, it is obvious that

The expansion of p." in spherical harmonics is already given as

So that we have 0' in spherical harmonics,
                         0' = 2P0 + 4P2.
Hence, as A and B are derivable from the same surface
harmonics,
                       A=Ao P0 + A27‘2P2’
                       B=1i1Po+ 1—352P2;

   Now at the surface, that is where r=1, A: B, and we can
apply this to every harmonic separately. Hence
                        Ao= B0;       A2 = B2
   Again, we know from the theory of attraction that the
resultant force just outside and just inside the shell di<U+FB02>'ers by
the amount 41m, or

  I had no notion of how the equipotential surfaces would shape,
and I tried to avoid forming any such notion, as it was my
object to test the usefulness of the tables in working out any
new problem. The <U+FB01>rst thing that it strikes one to do in this
case is to <U+FB01>nd the potential on the sphere itself. This can be
done from either (1) or (2) by putting r=1, and then

   We can now <U+FB01>nd a for various values of 0, using the table,
Thus when 0:0, P2: 1, and therefore a: 1'4. Thus we have
the following values :—

    Now on a sheet of squared paper I plotted the values of 1'
 and a or ,8, and so found the values of r for such particular
 values of a or B as seemed suitable for curve-drawing.           In
 fact I found the values of r for 9:45o for various equi
 potential surfaces.
    Repeating this for other values of 0 and drawing radial
 lines on a sheet of paper, it was easy to draw the equipoten
 tial surfaces;
    The <U+FB01>gure (Pl. 1.) was obtained in this way by Mr. Joselin.
 It shows the equipotential surfaces from 0'5 to 1'4.        These
 surfaces are surfaces of revolution. Of course the resultant
 force anywhere is inversely as the normal distance apart of
 the equipotential surfaces, and the direction of the force is
 everywhere normal to the equipotential surfaces.
                                Example 11.
    One circular spire of wire of radius a has an electric cur

    At any point on the axis, z centimetres from the centre,
the potential is
                      V=2wc(1--V-z%<U+FB01>). . . . . (1)
It is always worth while at <U+FB01>rst to get an idea of the range of
values of V.
   Putting                z=0,         V= 211-(1
                          z=a,         V='293 X 27r0.
                          z=w,         V=O.

     For the sake of ease of calculation let 27rG=1, and let
 a=1 centim.                         a
     Then                V=l—        ”     .
                                  442’ + 1
  We can expand this in powers both of z and of %, and we have
 either                                          6

 Now, if we can <U+FB01>nd V as a. function of 1- and 9 which is correct
 along the axial line, then it must be correct everywhere.
  [This is Green’s theorem, assuming that the axial line to
 in<U+FB01>nity is a cylindric surface of no lateral dimensions]         But
 it is obvious that

becomes (3) when 9:0.
    Hence these express the potential everywhere.         The <U+FB01>rst
of these is useful for calculation only when r is less than 1.
The second is useful only when 1- is greater than 1.
    And this shows a defect of the Spherical Harmonic method.
For if r is nearly 1 we cannot easily calculate V from either
of the series, having to use too many terms. It will, however,
be found, even in this case, that when we use the harmonics
up to P11 for any value of 9 we can plot V on squared paper
from r=0 to r=0'9, and from 1': 1'1 to values of 1- as
large as we please. If the intermediate part of the curve from
73:0-9 to r: 1'1 be drawn with a little judgment, it is astonish
ing how quickly and accurately the equipotential surfaces
may be drawn. The result may be compared with the lines
of force as worked out by the elliptic integral method of
Sir William Thomson.
   Any such Electromagnetic solution is also the solution of a
Hydrodynamic problem.
   The principle adopted in this example is very useful. It is

      I gave to Mr. Holland, as an example, the case of a hollow
  cylindric coil of wire, 2 centim. long, 1 centim. in radius
  inside, and 2 centim. radius outside: to <U+FB01>nd the magnetic
  potential everywhere when there are n turns of wire in the
  coil per unit length of the coil and there is unit current in
  the wire. Mascart gives for such a case the force at any
  point of the axis, and it is possible to expand Mascart’s ex

  press1on in powers of z and again in powers of g ; so that 1t
  is easy to get the potential in powers of z and of g, and there
  fore, as in the last case, the potential everywhere. Now
  inside the coil and well outside it only a few terms of the
  series need calculation ; but just at the ends of the coil the
  calculation is troublesome because many terms are required.
      Mr. Holland tried to shorten the work in the following
  way. He found that the potential at points along the axis
  could be expressed appro<U+FB02>mately from 2:0 to z: 2'5, with a
  maximum error anywhere of only 2 per cent., by
       V=2vm2 (2—‘4884z+'05513za—'00518z5+'00022 5),
  .1 being measured from the middle point of the coil.
      Hence, he said, the magnetic potential at a point r, 6 is
V = 2m2{2 -'4884 Pl'r + '05513 1331'8 — '00518 Ps'r5 + "00022 P705}.
  From this he plotted equipotential surfaces and lines of force.
  He found that, inside the coil, and indeed everywhere near the
  coil except certain critical positions, these were approximately
  correct. But at the <U+FB02>at ends close to the wire they were
  absurdlv wrong. It is easy now to see the physical meaning
  of Mr. Holland’s approximation, and why we cannot use this

 LXIII. A Kinetic Theory of Solids, with an Experimental
           Introduction. By WILLIAM SUTHERLAND.
                       [Concluded from p. 225.]
                             THEORY.
      HE working out of a kinetic theory of solids ought, on
       purely theoretic grounds, to have proved a simpler matter
 than that of the kinetic theory of gases, because in solids
 each molecule abides about a <U+FB01>xed mean position; but the
 generality of the two great experimental laws of perfect
gases stimulated theory to overcome the more dif<U+FB01>cult task
 <U+FB01>rst. The experimental laws which have just been estab
 lished for solids seem to give as good a guarantee that in
its essence‘the kinetic theory of solids must be as simple a.
 matter as that of gases.
    We will therefore start out on the assumption that in solids
the molecules have the properties assigned to them in the
kinetic theory of gases, that they attract one another, and
that each one moves in a small region of space round a
certain mean position. In the almost purely statical mole
cular theories of solids put forth in the early part of this
century by the great French elasticians, repulsive forces had
to be imagined to equilibrate the attractive; for example,
Poisson’s molecular theory was founded on the supposition
that while molecules of matter attracted molecules of matter,
they repelled the particles of heat, so that each molecule was
in equilibrium under two sets of opposite central forces. But
it is easy to see that no theory founded on purely central
attractions and repulsions can explain the facts of rigidity as
we actually know them, because in a pure shear, as there is
no change of volume, there can be no change in the potential
energy of the purel centrally acting molecules; or, more
accurately, a small shear of the <U+FB01>rst order will produce a
change of potential energy of the second order of small
quantities, but experiment shows that the change of energy
in a shear is of the same order of magnitude as the change
that accompanies a change of volume : hence purely central
attractions and repulsions, while they can (rive a sort of
rigidity, give one in<U+FB01>nitely different from that of nature.
The statical theory can give equations of the same form as
the natural ones, but with some of the coef<U+FB01>cients in<U+FB01>nitely
smaller.
   Attempts have been made to avoid this dif<U+FB01>culty by giving
the molecules polar properties, which, however, can hardly be

        Mr. W. Sutherland on a Kinetic Theory of Solids.      525
  got to be compatible with the behaviour of isotropic bodies.
  The true solution of the dif<U+FB01>culty lies in taking account of
  the kinetics of the molecules. The motion of the molecules
  is a fundamental part of the phenomenon of elasticity of
  solids as of gases.
     The subject-matter of the kinetic theory of solids will be
  taken in the following order :—
     1. Establishment of the characteristic equations of solids.
     2. Testing of the equations on the supposition that the
  molecules are unalterable.
     3. Testing of equations on the supposition that the mole
  cules alter somewhat with change of temperature.
     4. Further evidence of the alteration of molecules with
  change of temperature.
      5. Periods of vibration of the molecules of metals.
      6. Comparison of the theoretical variation of Young’s
   modulus with temperature with the experimental.
      7. Rigidity according to the kinetic theory.
      8. Ratio of lateral contraction to elongation in Young’s
   experiment.
      9. Dulong and Petit’s law, Joule and Kopp’s law, and the
   equation for compound solids.            ~
      10.. The parameter of molecular force.
      1. Establishment of the characteristic Equations of Solids.—
   In the kinetic theory of gases molecules are supposed to
   exercise pressure on an external body by colliding against its
   molecules, and the molecules are supposed to collide with
   one another. Let us imagine, then, a number of molecules of
   equal mass and size moving amongst one another under the
   in<U+FB02>uence of an attractive force ¢(r) exerted by each, and
   colliding and rebounding with coef<U+FB01>cient of restitution unity.
   If the molecules are close enough together, it is evident that
_ each separate molecule is hemmed in by its neighbours, so
   that it cannot change its position beyond vibrating about in
   its own limited share of space which I call its domain. Such
   a collection of molecules has one characteristic property of a
   solid body. Liquefaction occurs when each molecule ceases
   to be hemmed in and just manages to wriggle through
   amongst its neighbours. In the solid body each molecule as
   it knocks about in its domain has its mean position preserved,
   just as if it were held there by central repulsive forces
   emanating from all the other molecules, or only from its
   immediate neighbours, while it itself by colliding with its
   neighbours many times a second in all directions acts vir
   tually as a centre of repulsion to them. There is this much

 526                Mr. W. Sutherland on a
 in common, then, between the kinetic theory and the old static
 ones, with the great difference, however, that the kinetic state
 of the molecules is taken account of and regarded as the
 fundamental cause of the effective repulsions, and these repul
 sions act only between immediate neighbours, and do not
 extend to all distances as the attractions do.
    What are the conditions of equilibrium in our system of
molecules? First, let us take the case of a solid homoge
neous and isotropic body free from external force. Suppose
it divided into two arts by a plane, and on unit area in the
plane suppose a rig t cylinder erected in one part of the
body ; this cylinder as a whole is attracted by the half of the
body on the other side of the plane, and this attraction can
be equilibrated only by the repulsion due to the collisions
occurring across the base of the cylinder. Accordingly we
must evaluate these two forces. Let the distribution of
molecules be a cubical one with edge of cube 0 ; then, in the
manner of Poisson (Journal de l’Ecole Polytech. Cahier xx.),
the attraction on the cylinder is easily proved to be
—1—32r¢(r) where the summation extends to all molecules
6e          ’
within reach of appreciable action of one <U+FB01>xed molecule.
   To evaluate the collisional repulsion on the base of the
cylinder, we will <U+FB01>rst take a short cut justi<U+FB01>ed by the theory
of gases, and then verify the result b another method. The
short cut consists in assuming that t e collisional transfer of
momentum goes on as if all the molecules had the average
velocity square, and as if one third of the number alwalys
travelled parallel to each of three rectangular axes. Ta 'e
one axis to be perpendicular to the unit-base of the cylinder,
and let 1:. be the number of molecules per unit area, so that
n=l/e’, then 11/3 molecules collide against the base of the
cylinder with velocity 1:, and the number of times per second
that each strikes the base is v/Za, where a is the mean swing
of a molecule inside its domain. As each molecule has its
velocity reversed by a collision, the force of the collisions on
the base of the cylinder is 521m; 2% or mv’/3e’u, and for equi
librium we have the equation
                    mv’I    1

well sum for all the molecules of the body and put our result
in the form

   The same equation will now be established from Clausius’s
equation of the virial, taking account of the virial of the
repulsions during collision as Lorentz does (Wied. Ann. xii.)
in the case of gases. Let F be the repulsive force between
two molecules in collision when their centres are distance E
apart, then the equation of the virial is

   Now suppose each encounter to last a time 1', then, since

    In the usual theory of gases the molecules are treated as
 elastic spheres, in which case E is constant; but as change of
 temperature is known to produce changes inside the molecule,
 it will be safer to consider E as possibly a function of the
 temperature ; E can hardly depend appreciably on the pres
 sure, except in cases where, by the application of external
 pressure, the number of collisions per second becomes great
 enough to in<U+FB02>uence the internal structure of the molecule, as,
 for example, when        reat pressure produces crystallizations
 and combinations.        n the most general case, then, we have

528                 Mr. W. Sutherland on a
to consider E as possibly a function of both temperature and
pressure. But we can <U+FB01>rst see how the supposition that E is
constant will work. The equation (1) then states that, given
E the size of the molecules, their total energy, and their law
of force, then e, the mean distance apart of the molecules free
from external force, is determinable. The equation speci<U+FB01>es
the law of expansion of the simplest solid free of external
stress. For example, imagine that we know only that
solids expand very slightly with rising temperature, then
j—Eerer) is probably nearly constant, and therefore a must
be nearly proportional to the kinetic energy, or the expansion
from absolute zero is nearly proportional to the absolute
temperature, which is the de<U+FB01>nite experimental result. But
before discussing this equation any further, we may as well
make it more general by taking account of external stress
and removinor the condition of isotropy.
   Imagine the properties of our molecules to be different in
different directions, and in such a manner that all the circum
stances can be speci<U+FB01>ed with reference to three rectangular
axes. Let the paths and velocities of the molecules be such
that they produce the same collisional pressure in the direc
tion of the .2: axis as if they were an isotropic system with
mean kinetic energy mu2/2 per molecule, and similarly kinetic
energy mcz/2 and mica/2 along the y and z axes, so that
(mu2+mc’+mw2)/2 = 3D, where D is the mean kinetic
energy per molecule of the actual system. Let the mean
positions of the molecules correspond to a parallelepiped dis
tribution with sides f, 17, g to the parallelepiped, so that the
mean distance apart of the molecules along the 'a: axis is f,
and so on. Let the external stress be speci<U+FB01>ed by pressures
P, Q, R parallel to the three axes, and let the mean compo
nents of the swing of each molecule in its domain be a, ,8, y,
then for equilibrium parallel to the .1: axis we have merely to
add P to the molecular pressure in equation (1), and make
the necessary slight alterations to get

   If EHZ are the values of E, 07, f when the molecules are in
contact, we have three equations of the form 8—5 = 0:. Hence,
given E, H, Z, a“, v“, w“, P, Q, R, and the law of force, the
problem of <U+FB01>nding E, 07, § is determinate ; that is, the law of
expansion in the three directions with increase of kinetic

 u’, v”, w2 are not given, but only D the mean kinetic energy,
 then, given P, Q, R, D, that is to say the stress and the
 temperature as well as E, H, Z, there are four relations
 connecting the six quantities M, v’, w”, 5,1], {. Two other
 relations would make the connexion between energy and size
 in different directions quite determinate ; it is the business of
 experiment to ascertain these two relations.
    If the body is homogeneous and isotropic when free from
 external stress, then the equations (2) are a little simpli<U+FB01>ed
 by the relation E=H=Z=E, and we have
                    "mu2            1

    If, further, the body is subjected to hydrostatic pressure 1)

Thus, if the size of the molecules is given, and also the law
of force, then the relation of pressure, volume, and kinetic

a de<U+FB01>nite value for each body.      Apart from all speci<U+FB01>cation
of the law of molecular force, if the potential energy and the
virial of a number of molecules are proportional to the den

forms as Bp, where B is constant for each substance, the same
conclusions will hold as those I am about to draw from the
law of the inverse fourth power. My previous arguments in
favour of the inverse fourth power law amounted to this, that
that is the only simple natural law, like the law of gravitation,
that will make the potential energy of a number of molecules

approximately, and assert that theoretically the bulk-modulus
varies inversely as the temperature, and that the product
kh’Hm/p is the same for all metals. This result makes the
bulk-modulus in<U+FB01>nite at absolute zero, which, of course, is
merely the result of our assumption that the change of
volume of the molecules produced by collisions is negligible.
At any rate the bulk-modulus at absolute zero is probably
very large, that is, the molecules are probably only slightly
compressible, as will be seen later on.
    In our equations (7) and      for h we know all the quanti
ties on the right-hand side (if h=1) for the metals, and we
also have some quasi-experimental determinations of It, so
that we can proceed to test how our assumption of E being
constant will hold. The values of Is are not purely experi
mental, because they are not obtained by direct measurement,
but by calculations from other elastic measurements on the
assumption that the metals are homogeneous isotropic solids.
In such solids h is connected with the rigidity n, and Young’s
modulus g by the relation k=nq/ (9n ~3q).
    When It is calculated from the experimental values of n and
1], the worth of the result depends entirely on the nearness to
perfect isotropy of the solid. Thus, on the assumption of
perfect isotropy, it is possible to calculate a value of h for
many metals at 15° C. from the average values of n and 9
given above in Tables III. and VII.       Tomlinson has given
(Phil. Trans. 1883) values of /c calculated from his measure
ments of n and q ; and there is this advantage in using his
values, that n and g were measured on the same specimen.
Amagat has found (Compt. Rend. cviii.) values of k for a few
bodies by measuring q, and also the change of volume pro
 duced by external pressure on hollow cylinders, and then
 calculating on the assumption of perfect isotropy. It will be
 shown afterwards that the metals are at least nearly isotropic,
 but yet we must assume that all our values of k for the metals
 are only more or less rough approximations to true values,
 because small departures from perfect isotropy produce large

    There are large discrepancies in the quasi-experimental
values of la; for example, in the case of tin k, is impossible,
because 9n—3q is negative; accordingly tin is so far from
being reliably isotropic as to make attempts at calculating k
illusory. If, besides tin, we reject platinum, we <U+FB01>nd fairly
good agreement amongst the values of the ratio of k4, the
theoretical value, to the mean quasi-experimental value. The
mean value of the ratio, leaving out iron, is 62, and including
iron is 69 ; so that we can say that the theoretical values of
the bulk-modulus of the metals, on the assumption that the
molecules do not change in size with changing temperature,
are about 70 times the actual values. Thus, while the
assumption of constant size in molecules is proved by this
comparison to be untenable, the general form of our equation
receives some partial veri<U+FB01>cation from it, as it shows kaGm/p
to be nearly the same for 8 out of 9 metals, and this is what
the form of our equation demanded.
    But fortunately there is a more satisfactory comparison to
be made between theory and experiment in the matter of
latent heats of melting. We cannot imagine our equation to
bridge the gap in continuity between the solid and liquid
states and calculate the latent heat by the formula
                         A=f asap/Beat,
where ’02 and 1:, are the volumes of unit mass in the liquid
and solid states. But without any bridging of the gap in
continuity we have the thermodynamic relation

where dp/dd means now the rate of increase of the melting
pressure with the melting-temperature. Now, according to
our theory, melting occurs when molecules are able to escape
from imprisonment by their neighbours, that is, when the
s ace between molecules attains a certain value relatively to
t e size of the molecules. Hence, if the size of the molecules
is invariable, melting must always occur for the same value
of e whatever the pressure is, and we have rip/(i0 of the last

   In the case of silver it was not safe to extrapolate for
speci<U+FB01>c heat up to the melting-point of 954° C. from experi
ments up to 320°, so I made a determination of its mean
speci<U+FB01>c heat between 20° and 860° in comparison with that
of gold, which is known ; the result was ‘0663, which, over a
range of 934°, gives 61'9 calories in place of Person’s 57.
In the case of tin I used Tomlinson’s determination of the
speci<U+FB01>c heat, as Naccari omitted it. The ratio X30», comes
out nearly constant, especially if we omit mercury as uncer
tain on account of the smallness of A, and tin as uncertain on
account of its tendency to crystallize ; the mean value of the
ratio for the other four metals is 4'75. In each case the cal
culated value of )t is about 4'75 times the experimental, and
here again, while the actual equation and the assumption of
inalterability in the molecules are not veri<U+FB01>ed, the form of the
equation is con<U+FB01>rmed in a striking manner if we remember
that the latent heat ranges from 2'8 for nercury to 28 for
zinc.     In other words equation (10) asserts that
                            2("(101—1’2l/3bP17\
is constant on purely theoretical grounds, and the tabulated
comparison shows it to be constant, only that the value of the
constant is, on the average, 4'75 instead of 1 ; still it is pro
mising con<U+FB01>rmation for the kinetic theory that it should be
constant at all.
    We may state, then, that collections of unaltering mole
 cules, having the coet<U+FB01>cients of expansion of the different
metals, would, on the kinetic theory, have bulk-moduluses

about 65 times as large as the actual, and latent heats about
4'75 times as large.
   3. Testing of Equations 0n the supposition that the Mole
cules alter somewhat with Change of Temperature.—The next
step is to ascertain what modi<U+FB01>cation in the assumptions so
far made would bring theory and experiment into accord.               If
we return to the approximate expressions
                  (6) /.-= —2D/9e(e—E)2
and
                  (9) >.=2D(v,-v,)/3e(e-E),
we see at once that if E, which represents the linear dimen
sions of the molecule, were to diminish with rising tempera
ture, then theory and experiment could be brought to better
 accord. Now the shrinking of molecules with rising tempe
 rature is a result required by the kinetic theory of gases, for
 the variation of the viscosity of gases with temperature is
 such as can be accounted for satisfactorily only by shrinkage
 of molecules with rising temperature.
    Holman (Phil. Mag. 5th ser. vol. xxi.) has made a thorough
 comparison of the results of all the best measurements of the
 effect of temperature on the viscosity of air, includin his
 own, and his series of curves shows that up to 250°                 the
 viscosity of air at any temperature is best given in terms of
 that at zero 0. by the exponential formula
          ’lt=’lo(l+0'00367t)°'76       0r     770:97273(6/273)0wo,
 where 9 is absolute temperature. Now, according to the
 kinetic theory of gases, assuming the molecules to be spheres
 of sectional area 0'}, and ignoring molecular attraction, we
 have
                      770=1727sia'213/0'a) 2 (9/273ib
 and hence
                        (Fara/0'02: (6/273ym;
 that is to say, the molecules shrink with rising temperature.
  Now Barns (Amer. Journ. Sci. 3rd ser. vol. cxxxv.) has
  given weighty support to this idea of molecular shrinking by
  pushing the study of the viscosity of air and hydrogen up
  to 1200° 0., and showing that up to that temperature the
  viscosity of both gases is well represented by

      Now both these formulae for o- are derived by combining a
   theoretical equation with empirical formulae, and in the theo
   retical equation molecular attraction is supposed not to exist.
   But the effect of molecular attraction on viscosity will partly
   account for the apparent shrinkage of molecules, because
   slowly moving molecules coming near to one another without
   actually colliding are swung round their common centre of
   mass by the action of molecular force, and are affected as
   regards their subsequent paths, as if they had suffered a col
   lision. At high velocities two molecules, which pass close to
. one another without actual collision, shoot past one another
   with . only a slight mutual de<U+FB02>exion ; thus the molecules
   behave as if they had larger volumes at lower temperatures.
   This effect of molecular force on the temperature-variation of
   viscosity is a dif<U+FB01>cult problem in the kinetic theory of gases,
   which remains yet to be worked out.       Steps towards its solu
   tion have been taken by Maxwell (Phil. Trans. 1867) and by
   L. Natanson (Kinetische T/zeor'ie unvollkommener Gase), but
   no de<U+FB01>nite enough result has yet been reached to give a
   quantitative estimate of the importance of molecular force in
  viscosity of gases. Yet from a general point of view we may
  feel pretty sure that in the case of hydrogen the large appa
  rent shrinkage of the molecules cannot be traced entirely to
  the e<U+FB02>'ect of molecular force, and must be regarded as a true
  phenomenon.       If we take our deduction from Barus’s expe
  riments,
                          “213/60: (fl/273)
  we notice that, although 6 ranges from 273° to 1489°, yet
  0‘1’ ranges only from 1'60 to 1'84 ; and thus, while the for
  mula for 0-, if supposed to hold down to absolute zero, would
  give the impossible result of 0' being in<U+FB01>nite at zero, this
  impossible result is merely the consequence of trying to
  extrapolate with an empirical formula over a range seven
 times as great as that covered by experiment.
     Accordingly, we can get no de<U+FB01>nite assistance from the
 present state of the theory of viscosity of gases, but only a
 general assurance that molecules shrin with rising tempera
 ture. For the law of shrinka e of the molecules of solids I
 will take the expression E=%<]0/(1+b'0), which, up to the
 melting-point, may more conveniently be used in the form
 E=E0(1—b'0), so that e—E=E0(b+b')0.
     The steps in the differentiation for <U+FB01>nding the bulk-modulus
 are not affected by the variability of E with temperature: as
 before, we have (6),

whence, using the mean of the quasi-experimental values of k
given above as lcl, kg, ha, and the other known experimental
terms, we can get the values of b' for the metals.
   But our expression for the latent heat will be altered by
the variability of E. We have to <U+FB01>nd at what rate the
melting-pressure varies with the melting-temperature for a
collection of molecules that shrink with rising temperature.
N0w melting has chie<U+FB02>y to do with the mobility of the indi
vidual molecules. Each molecule of a solid, if it is not close
to the surface, moves as if it were free from the action of
molecular force, because the attractions of the molecules all
round it equilibrate one another. Let us conceive molecular
force not to exist, that is conceive a perfect gas compressed
till its molecules hem one another into <U+FB01>xed mean positions,
this will be identical with our solid; except that molecular
pressure is replaced by external pressure, the condition of the
individual molecules is the same. Now melting occurs when
the molecules escape from their domains, and suppose this
happens for values 0, E, p, and 0 of the variables: it is desired
to <U+FB01>nd how much the temperature is to be raised to reach the
melting-point when p is increased to p+olp. It is obvious
that e/E must remain constant, and the only other condition
is that the collisional pressure increase must be equal to zip.
Hence, if in our equation we ignore the molecular-force term

   If we now compare our expressions (11) and (12) for the
bulk-modulus and latent heat with those which before gave
results respectively 65 and 4'75 times too large, and neglect
for a moment the small terms, we see that in a general way
the theoretical bulk-modulus (11) and the experimental
would agree if h’ were put equal to 7b as 82=64, and the
theoretical latent heat (12) would agree with the experi
mental if b’=3'75h. But if in (11) and                   we take account
of the small terms and solve for b', we <U+FB01>nd that on the aver
age the relation b'=6h will bring the theoretical values of
both the bulk-modulus and latent heat into accord with the

tabulate the values calculated from (11) and (12) by means

   4. Further evidence of the Alteration ofMolecules with Change
of Temperature—It is important now to see what further
justi<U+FB01>cation there is for the idea that molecules shrink with
rising temperature. The small amount by which metals ex
pand on being heated from absolute zero to their melting
points, namely about 2 per cent. of their linear dimensions,
has made it dif<U+FB01>cult to form a mechanical conception of mole
cular behaviour during melting, because if the molecules are
really at rest against one another at absolute zero it is hard

                    Kinetic Theory of Solids.               539
to see how an increase of only 2 per cent. in the distance
apart of the molecules can give them the freedom and mo
bility of the liquid state. But if while heat is driving the
molecules apart from one another it is also shrinking each,
the dif<U+FB01>cult disappears, for if the shrinkage is six times the
expansion t en at the melting-point the distance apart of the
molecules is nearly 16 per cent. greater than the diameter of
the molecule; that is to say, the complete swing of the vibra
tion is 16 per cent., and when two molecules have swung to
their greatest distance apart that distance will be 16 per cent.
greater than the diameter of the molecule. This is suf<U+FB01>cient
to make melting quite comprehensible. Let us take a de<U+FB01>nite
instance : suppose four molecules at absolute zero in contact
so that their centres form a square of side E0, and as the
temperature rises, suppose each to oscillate along a diagonal,
then the maximum distance apart of the opposite molecules
becomes 1'16~/ 2 times the diameter of the molecule, that is
1'63 times, so that a molecule vibrating at right angles to the
plane of the square towards its centre, would, if it arrived at
the right moment, <U+FB01>nd an open space whose narrowest part
is '63 times its own diameter. This shows how, in the various
combinations possible in a large number of molecules, several
can occur favourable to the escape of a single molecule in a
neighbourhood, and a suf<U+FB01>cient number of such escapes, even
though a small number, would upset the stability of the whole
system, which falls into the mobility of a liquid. This theory
of melting can be roughly tested by experiment; it is only
necessary to agitate a number of equal spheres in a closed
box and observe what ratio the free space bears to the volumes
of the spheres when each sphere acquires a noticeable amount
of mobility. I took a box which, when closed, just held 100
marbles, with <U+FB01>ve specially coloured ones placed near the
centre, and then noted how many had to be removed from
the box to allow the <U+FB01>ve coloured ones to scatter on agita
tion ; a slight motion of the <U+FB01>ve as a body was not accepted
as a sign of mobility. It was necessary to remove 16 to get
slow and partial scattering of the central 5, and 20 or 25 to
get quick and decided scattering. Thus for mobility among
a set of marbles the free volume must be between 25 and 33
per cent. of the volume of the marbles. Of course the cir
cumstances are in most ways vastly different from those of
perfectly rebounding swiftly moving molecules, but the com
parison was worth making in passing. In the case of mole
cules mobility is reached when the free volume is 1'163—1
or 50 per cent. of the volume of the molecules.         But the
melting volumes of the metals give more de<U+FB01>nite evidence.

540                    Mr. W. Sutherland on a
    According to the kinetic theory of solids now under dis
cussion, it is necessary, if the molecules of different metals are
not much different in shape, that the ratio of the domain of
the molecule at the melting-point to the volume of the mole
cule should be the same for all, because melting is merely
the result of the domain reachinga size at which the molecule
escapes from it. Hence (1 +bT) (1 +b’T) is to be the same
for all, that is bT+b’T is to be constant ; but b'=6b, hence
bT is to be constant. Now in a previous paper (Phil. Mag.
Oct. 1890) I mentioned that bTmi is nearly constant for the
metals, and used the result to calculate the periods of vibra
tion of the molecules of solids at their melting-points with
satisfactory results. But the range in the value of mi for the
metals is not great, and it will be worth while tabulating side
by side the values of bT and bTmi. Fizeau’s values of b are
used.

   This comparison shows that the requirement of theory that
bT should be constant is approximately satis<U+FB01>ed, bT having a
mean value “021 when tin is excluded; but as bTmi is more
nearly constant, having a mean value ‘044, it is evident that
the power of a molecule to break away from its domain de
pends slightly on its mass, that dependence being expressed
in the empirical relation bTmi=constant.
   5. Periods of Vibration of the Molecules of Metals.—As the
vibrational motion of the molecules is fundamental to the
kinetic theory of solids here unfolded, it will be well at this
stage to secure such support for the theory as is given by the
harmonic relations I have shown to exist among the periods
of vibration of the molecules of metals at their melting-points
 (Phil. Mag. Oct. 1890). The full swing of a molecule in one
direction is
                     e—E = E0(bT + b’T) = 7 EobT.

                      Kinetic Theory of Solids.                  541
    Let M stand for the molecular weight of a molecule re
ferred in the ordinary way to that of h drogen, and let H
denote the real mass of a molecule of ydrogen, then the
 swing of a molecule is.
                          7(MH/p<U+FB01>-044/Mt.
 But its translatory kinetic energy is

   In the Li family the periods run as 1, 2, 3, 4'5, 6 with
the copper sub-family connected ; in the Be family the
periods run as 1, 2, 3, 4‘5, 6, with the zinc sub-family re
lated in somewhat the same wa as the copper to the lithium,
but not exactly. Al and La fiave periods nearly as 2 to 6.
The other periods do not call for comment at present ; but it
is Worth noting that the periods of the Be family are half
those of the Li family. These beautiful harmonic relations
ahnost amount to a proof that the expansion of the metals is
a true measure of the amplitude of vibration of their mole
cules. It will be interesting to try to get an absolute value
of one of these periods, and compare it with known periods
of light- and heat-vibrations.      Sir W. Thomson estimates that

542                  Mr. W. Sutherland on a
there are between 3 x 1024 and 1026 molecules in a cubic
centimetre of ordinary liquids and solids.    Now the limiting
volume of a gramme of hydrogen is about 4 cubic centi
metres, so that if we take 1025 as the number of molecules in
a cubic centimetre of hydrogen H=2'5 X 10‘26 gramme, and
the numerical factor dropped above becomes 8 x 10"“, which
makes the absolute period of the Lithium molecule 1'6 X 10—14
second; that is to say, there are 6 x 1013 complete vibrations
of the molecule in a second. Now the A line of the spectrum
represents 3945 X 1014 vibrations, and the H2 line 7'628 X 1014
vibrations per second, while in the dark part of the spectrum
Langley has found a line of 1'1 X 1014‘, and in the radiation
of bodies below 100° 0. av line of 2 x 1013 vibrations in a
second. Accordingly, the periods of vibration of the mole
cules of the metals at their melting-points fall within the
limits of actually measured periods of non-luminous vibra
tions.   This fact supplies good general veri<U+FB01>cation to the
theory, and shows how interesting a bolometric study of the
radiation of solids just about to melt would be.
   6. Comparison of the Theoretical Variation of Young’s Modu
lus with Temperature with the Emperimental.—The next subject
to apply the theory to with advantage is the theoretical law
of variation of Young’s modulus with temperature for com
parison with the experimental results given in the introduc
tion.   The metals, as will yet be shown, may be assumed to
be approximately isotropic. In isotropic solids the relation
between 9, n, and k is q=9kn/(3lc+n). Now in the intro
duction it was'shown for all the metals that n/N= l—(9/T)2,
where N is rigidity at absolute zero, and from the theoretic
eqpiation (11) we have the values of lc at all temperatures,
an
                      _ 3Nil—(9/Tlg'r
                    '1— 1 +N{1— (6/1‘)2}/5k'
   Now, according to (11), h is in<U+FB01>nite at absolute zero, which
we will interpret to mean that it is very large, and hence Q
thc value of Young’s modulus g at absolute zero is 3N.
Accordingly we have
                  Q{1-—(9/T)2}(1/q-1/9k)=1 . . . (13)
as the de<U+FB01>nitely prescribed law of variation of Young’s mo
dulus with temperature. Because of this de<U+FB01>nite theoretic
relation I did not, in the introduction, dwell on the demon
stration of any empiric relation, but the values given for
different temperatures and different metals will now furnish a

                   Kinetic Theory of Solids.                543
good test of the kinetic theory of solids. The best way to
apply the test will be to calculate for each metal from the
observed values of g and the theoretic values of k the values
of Q,—these should come the same.      For example, according
to my experiments on zinc the values of 1110-6 at absolute tem
peratures 289°, 333°, and 376° are 821, 758, and 682, and
the corresponding values of QIO‘6 are 1280, 1320, and 1320,
which satisfy well the requirement of constancy. Kiewiet’s
values for zinc, found by the method of bending at 283°, 325°,
and 353°, are 1031, 975, and 924, which give for QlO"6 the
values 1710, 1800, and 1870, which do not satisfy the con
dition of constancy. It will be seen from equation (13) that
a good deal depends on a correct absolute value of g, as well
as on the relative values at different temperatures.    For the
other metals I will simply give the values of (.210—6 calcu
lated from 3 values of g at temperatures from 289° to 376°
on the absolute scale. For tin 880, 890, and 990, and ac
cording to Kiewiet 740, 750, and 720; lead 326, 332, and
339 ; magnesium 439,443, and 433 ; copper 1590 and 1540;
aluminium 818 and 839; aluminium unannealed 735, 746,
and 752 ; and iron 2253, 2241, and 2226. It is evident that
experimental uncertainties do not at present let us expect any
better agreement between theory and experiment than that
just shown. But there is another form in which the same
comparison can be made. One of the results of equation (13)
is that Young’s modulus at absolute zero is 3 times the
rigidity.    Now by means of (13) we can from the mean
values of q at 15° 0. given in Table V11. calculate the values
of Q, and compare them with the values of N, given in
Table V.

   With the exception of platinum, the only metals for which
 the departure of N/Q from the value 3 is beyond. the limits
 of experimental error are zinc, tin, and lead, the metals for
 which the results of different experimenters disagree most, as

 544                   Mr. W. Sutherland on a
 shown in the compilation of data given in the introduction.
 These disagreements would seem to indicate that even if these
 metals can be got in an approximately isotropic state at all,
 their isotropy is easily disturbed, but this point will be re
 turned to immediately. The mean value for the ratio Q/N
 for the 7 metals Cu, Ag, Au, Mg, Al, Fe, and Ni is 3'0,
and accordingly it appears that these metals may be regarded
as isotropic, and as having molecules so nearly incompressible
as to give the relation Q=3N characteristic of incompressible
molecules.
   The study of the ratio Q/N leads naturally to the famous
controversy amongst elasticians as to whether there is a <U+FB01>xed
value of the ratio of lateral contraction to longitudinal exten
sion for all isotropic bodies subject to traction ; but this
matter had better be postponed a little until we have seen
what account the kinetic theory can give of rigidity.          This
is the most important point in a theory of solids, and as I
have already pointed out that no static theory can give an
adequate ex lanation of rigidity, there is great interest in
seeing how t e kinetic theory will fare.
   7. Rigidity according to the Kinetic Theory—The funda
mental equation for a solid, homogeneous and isotropic and
free from external force is

   Suppose the solid now subjected to a pure shearing stress
speci<U+FB01>ed by a traction P parallel to the axis of w, and a pres
sure P parallel to that of y : the traction counts as a pressure
—P, and the corresponding strains are an elongation of e to
5 parallel to .z', and a contraction of e to 07 parallel to y. The
strained body is no longer isotropic, and equations (3) are
applicable to it if we write —P for P, and put Q=P and
R=O_ Let f=e+85, and ay=e+31b and §=e, then 817: —SE.
The elfective kinetic energies in different directions are no
longer equal each to D, but become %mu’, @1102, and émw’,
which will be denoted by D1, D2, and D3, and let D1=D +8D‘
and so on. We do not know at present how we are to ex
press the condition that the shear is made at constant tem
perature, for when the effective kinetic energy is different in
different directions, what is the relation between these dif
ferent energies and temperature? All that we can assert is
3D2=—5D1. Now the shear produces a change of volume

This equation gives a statement of what rigidity is according
to the kinetic theory; it depends on the rate of change of
the effective kinetic energy in a direction with the change of
the distance apart of the molecules in that direction. This
ratio of 8D, to SE is fundamental in the theory of solids ; the
condition for zero rigidity or <U+FB02>uidity is
                      eSDl/DSE=e/(e—E)—1.
   It would be possible to calculate the ratio of 8D, to 8? on
 purely theoretical ground with the aid of suppositions as to
the distribution of kinetic energy in different directions and
its relation to temperature, but this is not worth doing at
present; it will only be shown shortly that even in solids
  D\/5E dili'ers only from the large number e/(e—E) by a
small number, that is, a number not much greater than 1.
 But <U+FB01>rst it may be as well to determine Young’s modulus
 from our equations in the same way as we have just found
 the rigidity. It is only necessary to put —P for P1, Q=0,
 Z=O, §=e+3§, 8§=807=—0'5E, and replace Zr¢(r)/6e3 by

   The values for zinc and cadmium are about double those
for the other elements; if for the moment we take half of
them as the true values, and take the mean of all, we get for
B+ 1 the value 4'6, the serious departures from which are in
the case of gold 3'2, aluminium mean 5'7, tin mean 5'8, and
palladium 3'2; in the case of palladium the fault lies probably
in the absolute value of g at 15° 0., which is the mean of
Wertheim’s static and kinetic values 980 x 106 and 1130 x 106,
while before annealing they are 118O><106 and 124OX 106.
In the case of tin uncertain isotropy and experimental un
certainty explain the discrepance, but for gold and aluminium
no adequate explanation is available except one suggested
below. On the whole the theoretical conclusion is well borne
out. In the case of zinc and cadmium, the fact that the
product is double the normal value is connected with the fact
that the molecules of zinc and cadmium are known in the
vaporous state to be monatomic. The product 7Qbm/Jcmp is
independent of m the molecular mass; but as we do not know
the dynamical signi<U+FB01>cance of the constant B+ 1, we cannot
tell whether or not it ought to be twice as large for mona
tomic molecules as for diatomic. The assertion that B+1
must be the same for all metals goes on the assumption that
they are dynamically similar systems of molecules at absolute
zero; if they are not so, then the assertion no longer holds,
and this may be the cause of the difference in the case of gold
and aluminium.                                        '
   The theoretical relation that Qbm/p is to be the same for
all metals corresponds to Wertheim’s empirical discovery that,
if q is Young’s modulus at 15° O., q(rn/p)i is approximately
the same for all the metals (Ann. dc Ch. et de Ph. sér 3. t. xii.).

548                 Mr. W. Sutherland on a
Tomlinson (Phil. Trans. 1883) has investigated the same re
lation. We have seen, in the experimental introduction, that
the elastic properties of the metals correspond only at tempe
ratures which are the same fraction of the melting-tempera
tures, and accordingly any relation connecting Young’s
modulus at a <U+FB01>xed temperature with molecular volume or
domain must be empirical. Now as the coef<U+FB01>cient of expan
sion b is roughly proportional to the molecular domain m/p,
the relation Qbm/p=constant becomes Q(m/p)2=constant ap
proximately, whence we see the origin of Wertheim’s relation.
There are various other approximate empirical relations dis
covered by ditferent physicists which correspond to combina
tions of those already established, on theoretical grounds in
this paper, but there is no use in discussing them further.
   8. Ratio of Lateral Contraction to Elongation in Young’s
Experiment—We can now take up the famous question as to
whether the ratio of lateral contraction to longitudinal ex
tension in the Young’s modulus experiment has the same
value for all isotropic bodies, as asserted by various builders
of statical molecular theories of elasticity, and as denied by
the upholders of a science of elasticity apart from molecular
considerations. As no statical theory founded on central
forces can give a true account of rigidity, it seems useless to
discuss a deduction of such theories, but the important point
of getting a test for isotropy is involved. We see at once,
 from the results of the experimental introduction, that tem
perature is an important condition which has never been
taken into account by the upholders of a constant ratio. In
isotropic solids we have the following equations for a- the
 ratio of contraction to elongation :—
           o'= (3k—2n)/2(3k + n) and 0'=q/2n— 1.
    Now we have seen experimentally that
                        "= N 1 ~(9/T)Q},
and by theory (11)
                      [CZ—9"2 Jcm(1 — 28b0) ’
                                 49b29m/p
so that 0' is a not simple function of the temperature.      At
absolute zero Is is according to our theory very large, and
may be regarded as in<U+FB01>nite, while n remains <U+FB01>nite, and there
fore the value of 0' at absolute zero is 1;. But again at
the melting-point n is zero, while k is <U+FB01>nite, so that at the
melting-point 0' again attains the value 4. Now a- has been

measured directly for a few metals by Mallock (Proc. Roy.
Soc. xxix.) by one method, and by Amagat (Compt. Rend.
cviii.) by a quite distinct method, and also by an indirect
method.     We will compare the values given by the <U+FB01>rst -
equation for a at 15° C. with these experimental values.
                      Values of a- at 15° C.

For iron theory gives a value '41, while Mallock found for
steel the value '25, and Amagat for steel '27, but Okatow
(Pogg. Ann. cxix.) has shown that steel according to its
treatment gives values of a- ranging from '275 to '40. If we
calculate 0' according to the second equation above, using the
mean experimental values of q and n at 15°, as given in
Tables III. and VII. of the introduction, we get the follow
ing values :—--Cu '42, Zn '33, Pb '13, Fe '33. These
values for zinc and lead are in complete disaccord with the
experimental values, that for zinc being much too large, and
that for lead much too small. Now in studying the values of
the ratio Q/N, which ought theoretically to be 3, we found
for zinc 3'5, and for lead 2'3; but as the values of Q and N
are both calculated from the mean values of q and n at 15° 0.,
it is very likely that there is experimental error in q and n
as individual experimenters differ greatly in their values.
Hence if 3 is the true value for Q/N for all the metals, q/n is
wrong in the same proportion as Q/N; and if we multiply our
values of g/n by 3, and divide by Q/N, and use the result
in our second equation for 0', we shall see whether theory will
thus eliminate the discrepancy above for zinc and lead as due
to experimental uncertainty in q/n. Doing this, we get for
Cu '38, Zn l4, 'Pb '47, and Fe 42, which agree well with
the values given by the <U+FB01>rst equation for 0', and with the
directly observed values of Mallock and Amagat.
   This agreement of theory and experiment shows that all
idea of a constant value for a- in the case of isotropic bodies
must be abandoned, and, what is much more important, that
the metals are at least approximately isotropic. Amagat has
already shown by some <U+FB01>ne experimental work (Compt. Rend.
cviii.) that some metals and alloys are isotropic, although
his method of calculation makes the proof a little more per
fect than it actually is.    His method is to measure Young’s
modulus directly by statical experiments ; let P be the pressure

    9. Dulong and Petit’s Law, Joule and Kopp’s Law, and the
Equation for Compound Solids.—The physical meaning of
 Dulong and Petit’s law of the constancy of the atomic heats
 of the elements has been a subject of speculation with chemists
and physicists ever since its discovery.     As the kinetic theory
 of gases in regarding temperature as proportional to kinetic
 energy of the molecule, required that apart from internal
 motion and work the molecular heats of all gases should be
 the same, it has been felt that a similar connexion between
 temperature and molecular kinetic energy is at the founda
 tion of Dulong and Petit’s law. The kinetic theory of solids
 makes this quite plain, that Dulong and Petit’s law is simply
 the expression of the fact that temperature is proportional to
 the kinetic energy of the molecule, or, to be more accurate, of
 the atom. The meaning of Dulong and Petit’s law becomes

                     Kinetic Theory of Solids.                  551
 still clearer when taken in conjunction with that of Joule and
 Kopp, that the molecular heat of a solid compound is the sum
 of the atomic heats of the component atoms. This means
 that the freedom of the atom within the molecule is such that
 each atom vibrates independently of the others. On this
 basis it is easy to sketch the investigation of the equations
 for a solid compound. Let us consider a compound whose
 molecule consists of n1 atoms of an element A1, 11, of A2, and
 so on. Suppose a cubical arrangement of molecules at dis
 tance e apart, then the number of molecules per unit area is
 l/e’, and hence the number of atoms A1 per unit area is
n<U+FB01>/e'”. Let m1, m9, and so on be the masses of the atoms,
 and v1, 1;, their mean velocities, then the collisional pressure
 per unit area due to the atoms A1 is nl'gmlvlg/ezalid, if a1 is the
 full swing of the atom in its domain. For the total colli
 sional pressure we have the sum of such pressures for the
 different sorts of atoms. For the pressure due to molecular
 attraction it does not matter whether we consider the attrac
 tions of the atoms separately or of the entire molecules; if we
 take the entire molecules, then we get the former expression
 2r¢(r)/6e3. For a solid compound submitted to hydrostatic
 pressure p we have the equation
       1 nlimlvl2     rtgtmgvc,2                1          _
      3—e.,( “1    + ~07?        + . . .)—p—6832rqb(r)_0.
    Kinetically, then, a compound in the solid state behaves
like a mechanical mixture of its component atoms, because
the molecules are almost as close to one another as the atoms
in the molecule.     It is evident that a complete kinetic theory
of compounds must be a very complicated affair.
    10. The Parameter of Molecular Force.—Hitherto we have
managed to dispense with a close knowledge of the molecular
attraction because we have always managed to eliminate it by
using the fact that when the external pressure is small we
can put
                   2r¢(r)/<U+FB01>ea= 2D/3e9(e—E),
which is the fundamental equation for a solid free from ex
ternal force. But it is desirable to obtain an independent
estimate of molecular force for comparison with that given by
this equation, and Quincke’s measurements of the capillary
tensions of the metals at their melting-points give an excellent
opportunity (Pogg. Ann. cxxxv. and cxxxviii.).
    I have shown (Phil. Mag. 5th ser. vol. xxvii.) that if the
law of molecular force is 3Am2 r‘ then the surface-tension is
proportional to Amtpi. Let us denote the surface-tension by

s, then A the parameter of molecular force is proportional to
s/mip’g'.   But if        =3Am2/r‘, then

small or large; hence
  211p (14)/6eB = 2Ap2'n' log R/a = 2D/3e?(e -— E) = 2Jcmp/21mb,
or A is proportional to cm/mbp, or, as cm is constant, to l/mbp.
Thus s/mil pg is proportional to l/mb, or bsmi/pgr is constant
It is to be noticed that while 2rd>(r)/6e3 or 2Jcmp/21mb is
independent of the molecular mass, the surface-tension
.rAm‘i pg is not, so that if the molecular weights of the metals
are not all the same multiple of the atomic weights, excep~
tional metals will give exceptional values of bsmi/p‘}.
   The following is a list of the values of 1000 bsmi/pi, s being
given in milligrammes per millimetre.               Where Quincke
found two values of s by different methods, both are given.
In the case of lead the surface-tension was'determined by

   The value of the surface-tension of iron is uncertain, as is
the case also with sodium and potassium ; for the value of b
for Hg, Na, and K, I used the relation bTmi'='044. The
mean value of 10005smi/p'g for Pt, Pd, Au, Ag, Sn, and
Pb is 7'4, for Zn and Cd it is 123, which is once and a
half as large or about 2% as large, for Na it is twice as large,
and for Hg and K four times. These relations and the
whole subject of surface-tension in melted solids require further
investigation. I have touched on the matter here to show
 that in the kinetic theory unfolded, the law of molecular
force has not been lost sight of.
    There are many phenomena of solids that invite investiga
 tion by the light of a kinetic theory, but it has seemed better
to me to con<U+FB01>ne the present paper to the broad fundamental
 ones. One of the results of the inquiry is that the molecules
 of solids so nearly <U+FB01>ll up their domains that the phenomena

of crystalline form are the outward results of the form of the
molecule; this has often been imagined to be the case, but
the kinetic theory proves it. It is hardly necessary to enu
merate the paths of experimental and theoretical investiga
tion opened by a kinetic theory of solids ; but it is obvious
that a kinetic theory of liquids requires to be seen to.

LXIV. Note supplementary to aPaper on the Solitary Wave.
                 By J. McGowan, M.A., B.Sc.*
    N the concluding section of a paper “On the Solitary
      Wave,” printed in the July number of the Philosophical
Magazine, I offered a brief criticism of certain views of Sir
George Stokes, which are contained in a paper ‘ On the
Theory of Oscillatory \Vaves,’ republished in the <U+FB01>rst volume
of his Collected Papers, on the possibility of a solitary wave
being propagated without change of form. He has, however,
privately called my attention to the fact that not only had he
himself seen the error of his former opinion, but had, in a
paper“ On the Highest Wave of Uniform Propagation ” ( Proc.
(lamb. Phil. Soc. vol. iv.), suggested a method by which the
solitary wave might be approximated to by a sort of trial and
error process, though he had not attempted the approxima
tion itself, which would be laborious. He has also published
a note to this effect in the September number of the Philo
sophical Magazine, which, however, I have only just seen,
owing to my absence from town during the summer recess.
I greatly regret that, in ignorance of his more recent paper,
I should have offered any criticism of Prof. Stokes’s earlier
views, a criticism to which I was only led by the considera
tion that it would be impossible to pass over in silence the
opinions of an authority of such eminence when they were in
con<U+FB02>ict with the results of my paper.
   In his last “Note on the Theory of the Solitary Wave,”
already referred to, Prof. Stokes has explained how he had
  reviously been led to a wrong conclusion, and this need not,
I) think, call for any remark on my part; but he has further
olfered certain objections to my criticism to which it is
necessary for me to reply to prevent misinterpretation of my
remarks, which were possibly too brief to be quite free from
ambiguity. I refer to the third paragraph of the “Note.”
He begins by saying that he cannot agree with me that the
expansion which he used is inadmissible. With respect to
                    “ Communicated by the Author.

554           Mr. J. McOowan on the Solitary Ware.
this, I have only to point out that I have nowhere said that it
was inadmissible. I am not therefore concerned with his
further statement regarding the expression of non-periodic
functions by series of periodic functions: Fourier’s repre
sentation of such functions in de<U+FB01>nite integral form is well
known. ‘
    He goes on to say further, “I cannot agree with Mr.
McOowan . . . . . . . . that the form which he proposes at
p. 58 to substitute, that of a series involving exponentials
in which the coef<U+FB01>cient of .r in the index is real, is (at least
for my purpose) admissible.”       It is “inadmissible, on account
of the discontinuity of the expression.” To this, again, I
must reply that I have nowhere proposed to use any such
series. To clear away whatever obscurity may remain, let
me quote the part of the paper “On the Theory of Oscillatory
Waves,” which I have criticised in § 12 of my paper.         In §2
                                               2     2
he says “the general integral of (2) [t(%$+%;=0,             where
(I; is the velocity potential,] is
                           ¢=2Aem+"9,
the sign 2 extending to all values of A, m, and n, real or
imaginary, for which n12+112=0 . . . . . . . In the present
case, the expression for 4) must not contain real exponentials
in :0, since a term containing such an exponential would become
in<U+FB01>nite either for .r=—w, or for w= +00, as well as its
differential coefficients which would appear in the expressions
for u and v [the components of the velocity] ; so that 111. must
be wholly imaginary.”
    The italics and the added explanations within square
brackets are mine. I understand this to mean that it is only
for the reason given that real exponentials are omitted.
Remembering then the difference in the notation, that my
“imaginary m” is his real m, and that my z is his y, and
that my ¢+Uzc is practically his <5, refer to § 12 of my paper.
I explain that he has “put aside imaginary values of the m
as inadmissible,” having “concluded that such a value would
imply in<U+FB01>nite velocity, &c., either when ac: +00 , or when
,7): —oo ;” and then I go on to criticise this view, saying “ but
this is not necessarily so . . . . . for in fact the value of (1)

    I have here corrected a slight misprint in the exponential,
 which would, however, cause no dif<U+FB01>culty. I have also added
 for the sake of clearncss within square brackets the expansion
 to which reference only was made, and it may be noted that
 though I explain that (5) may be so expanded, I make no
suggestion that such an expansion should or could conveniently
be used.

  part of a periodic path ; let Q be a position on it between 0P’

  Let OP’ and DP now be taken to coincide in a position which
  we shall call 0; in other words, let 01” Q 0P, or ()QO, be the
  complete periodic circuit, or orbit as we have called it               2
  above). Our path P’ P is now a path in<U+FB01>nitely near to this
  orbit, and P’ and P are two consecutive positions in it for
  which 1!! has the value zero. These two positions are in<U+FB01>nitely
  near to one another and to 0.              We shall call them 0;, and
  0,-4.1, considering them as the positions on our path in which
  1]» is zero for the ith time and for the (i+1)th time, from an

         now to modify our notation as follows :—

    31. Our result proves that every path in<U+FB01>nitely near to the
 orbit is unstable unless every root of the equation for e has a
 real value between 1 and ~l. It does not prove that the
 motion is stable when this condition is ful<U+FB01>lled. Stability or
 instability for this case cannot be tested without going to
 higher orders of approximation in the consideration of paths
 very nearly coincident with an orbit.

                  POSTSCRIPT, November 10, 1891.
     The subject of periodic motion and its stability has been
 treated with great power by M. Poincaré in a paper, “ Sur lo
 probleme des trois corps et les équations de la dynamique,”
 for which the prize of His Majesty the King of Sweden was
  awarded on the 21st of January, 1889. This paper, which
  has been published in Mittag-Le<U+FB01>ler’s Acta Mathematica, 1?),
  1 and 2 (270 4to pp.), Stockholm 1890, only became known
  to me twelve days ago through Prof. anley. I am great-1y
  interested to <U+FB01>nd in it much that bears upon the subject of my
  communication of last June to the Royal Society “ On some
  test cases for the Maxwell-Boltzmann doctrine regardin r
  Distribution of Energy ; ” particularly in p. 239, the following
  paragraph :—“ On pent démontrer que dans le voisinage

560              Sir W. Thomson on Periodic diction.
d’une trajectoire fermée représentant une solution périodique,
soit stable, soit instable, il passe une in<U+FB01>nité d’autres trajectoires
fermées. Cela ne suth pas, en toute rigueur, pour conclure que
toute région de l’espace, si petite qu’elle soit, est traversée par
une in<U+FB01>nite des trajectoires ferme'es, mais cela sut<U+FB01>t pour donner
a cette hypothcse un haut caractére de vraisemblance.”*
This statement is exceedingly interesting in connexion with
Maxwell’s fundamental supposition quoted in § 10 of my
paper, “that the system if left to itself in its actual state of
motion, will, sooner or later, pass through every phase which
is consistent with the equation of energy;”T an assumption
which Maxwell gives not as a conclusion, but as a proposition
which “ we may with considerable con<U+FB01>dence assert, . . . except
for particular forms of the surface of the <U+FB01>xed obstacle.” It
will be seen that Poincaré’s “hypothesis, having a high
character of probability,” does not go so far as Maxwell’s,
which asserts that every portion of space is traversed in all
directions by every trajectory.           The conclusion which I gave
in § 13, as seeming to me quite certain “that every mode
differs in<U+FB01>nitely little from being a fundamental mode,” is
clearly a necessary consequence of Maxwell’s fundamental
supposition; the truth of which still seems to me highly
probable provided exceptional cases are properly dealt with.
    I also <U+FB01>nd the following statement, pp. 100—101 :—“ 11 y
aura done en général n quantités a2 distinctes. Nous les
appellerons les coqficients de stabilité de la solution périodique
considerée.
     “ Si ces n coe<U+FB02>icients sont tous réels et né atifs, la solution
périodique sera stable, car les quantités E; et #74, resteront
inférieures a une limite donne'e.
     “ Il ne faut pas toutefois entendre ce mot de stabilité au
sens absolu. En e<U+FB01>et, nous avons négligé les carrés des E et
des a] ct rien ne prouve qu’en tenant compte de ces carrés, le
résultat ne serait pas change. Mais nous pouvons dire au
moins que les E et 17, s’ils sont originairement tres petits,
resteront tres petits pendant trés longtemps. Nous pouvons
exprimer ce fait en disant que la solution périodique jouit,
sinon de la stabilité séculaire, du moins de la stabilité temporaire.”
Here the conclusion of § 31 of my present paper is perfectly
anticipated and is expressed in a most interesting manner.
M. Poincaré’s investigation and mine are as different as two
investigations of the same subject could well be, and it is very
satisfactory to <U+FB01>nd perfect agreement in conclusions.
  * The “ trajectoire fermée” of M. Poincaré is what I called a “ funda
mental mode of rigorously periodic motion,” or “ an orbit.”

  A Course of Experiments in Physical JIIeasurement.—Part . 1V.
     Appendix for the Use of Teachers. By HAROLD WRITING, PhD.
     Boston, U.S.A. D. C. Heath and Co. 1891.
  WITH the present volume Dr. Whiting’s treatise on Practical
         Physics is brought to a conclusion. He discusses in it those
  portions of the subject which are primarily of more importance to
  the teacher than to the student, such as the cost of providing
  apparatus for the course described in the three previous volumes,
' and also the most suitable arrangement of tables in the laboratory
  in order that the teaching may be imparted with the maximum of
  convenience both to teacher and student. The author recommends
  that the practical work be preceded by a special lecture on the
  theory and practice of the experiment to be performed, these
  demonstrations being quite distinct from the ordinary formal
  course of lectures on Physics. It is an open question, and one
  which the author does, not discuss, whether the experimental
  demonstrations ought to precede or follow the formal course; in
  the case of the more mathematical portions of Physics it seems to
  us advisable to interest the student by means of an experiment,
  before introducing him to the complete theory of it as given in the
  lecture course.    This is especially the case with Mechanics, in
  which subject the formal lectures ought to follow the demonstra
  tions and experiments rather than precede them.
     A great portion of the volume is devoted to tables of actual
  observations and results obtained in each of the experiments pre
  viously described.   Then follow lists of the experiments, a know
  ledge of which is required in the case of candidates for admission
  to Harvard University; this section is of course of greater interest
  to American teachers. The remainder of the volume is taken up
  by proofs of the mathematical formulae used in the earlier part of
  the work.
     In reviewing the treatise as a whole we think the author has
  done well to insist upon the necessity of always making mea~
  surements, whatever their nature may be, as exactly as possible,
  and of. eliminating errors by taking the mean of several observa
  tions; so that with comparatively rough apparatus really valuable
  results may be obtained by a careful student.   On the other hand,
  the work has one drawback which it shares in common with all
  text-books on practical Physics, namely, that the experiments de
  scribed are supposed to be performed with apparatus of a special
  pattern, which other laboratories do not possess. To a large
  extent, therefore, the course of experiments in each laboratory is
  arranged in accordance with the form of the apparatus possessed
  by it, and such text—books as the present one only serve as general
  guides which must be supplemented by printed or manuscript
  notes.                                          JAMES L. HOWARD.

     MOLECULAR THEORY OF DIFFUSION AND ELECTROLYSIS.
                                    BY E. RIECKE.
FOR a dilute solution of a. body which is not an electrolyte, the
      concentration of which is constant in all plane layers which are
at right angles to an axis (z—Axis), but is variable in the direction of
this axis, the author <U+FB01>nds that the excess of the molecules moving
downwards (that is, the strength of the diifusion-current) is
                                     S= _   lit 3N

molecular velocity, N the number of gramme-molecules in unit

 which move through unit section in a second in the direction of
 decreasing concentration. The coef<U+FB01>cient of di<U+FB01>usion k for the

                                BY H. SENTIS.
     A rectangular plate of iron of the volume abs and the weight 1)
 <U+FB02>oats _on mercury; the actual dimensions were about 120 x 8 x 2
 c. millim. The depth h to which it sinks is determined by means
 of a spherometer.      On the one hand, we have from the principle
 of Archimedes,               “
f )                     p=ath+2(a+b)Fcosa;
 in which D is the density of mercury, F the surface-tension, and
  a the edge—angle, and the second term on the right is the weight
 of the mercury which would <U+FB01>ll up the groove about the plate.
 The error which is due to the corners may be eliminated by
 means of another plate of volume ale, and weight 11’, immersed
 to the same extent, which gives exactly the same error. On the
 other hand, the well-known equation
  holds, and by eliminating the error and the edge-angle we get the
  formula
                      F= Di” + M

                           ALLOTROPIC SILVER.
     Mr. M. Carey Lea requests us to correct a typographical error
  occurring in his paper, entitled “ Notes on Allotropic Silver,”
   which appeared in our October number. In this paper in several
   places appears “ protochloride” where photochloride is the correct
   reading. Silver photochloride is the name proposed some years
   ago by Mr. Lea for the coloured compounds resulting from the
  union of normal silver chloride with small quantities of subchloride
  in no de<U+FB01>nite proportion, but after the manner of lakes as specially
   described by him—The violet substance resulting from the expo
   sure of silver chloride to light is a photochloride.
