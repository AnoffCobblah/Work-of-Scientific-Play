  I. On the Nature and Laws       of Friction.    By Mr. Thomas
                             Tredgold.
The     great perfection to which the art of constructing machines
has  arrived in this country would lead a person, unacquainted
with the real nature of its progress, to imagine that the laws which
regulate the motion of hodies had been deeply studied ; and that
every aid which reason or scientific experiment could give, had
been successfully employed to surmount the natural difficulties of
the  subject.
    This, however, is not the case;  as it has been through repeated
trials, and tentative   methods only — attended with an immense
loss of capital — that this perfection has been attained : and it is
a lamentable fact, that even now the knowledge of machinery is
so much confined to particulars,      and exists in so detached and
unconnected a state, that were any sudden revolution to happen
in the affairs of this country, the greater part of it would be
buried in oblivion.
    One great defect in the theory of machines is the want of pro
per formulae to calculate    the effect that can be produced by a
given power ; and one of the most common causes of failure i3
our imperfect knowledge of the nature, laws, and quantity of
friction.
    How often has an ingenious machine been contrived with the
fairest prospect of success, but, when tried on a large scale, it
has either been racked to pieces in a few months by requiring a
greater moving power than it was calculated to sustain—or it
has been totally inefficient for its intended purpose ?
    Long practice may give the power of erecting machines of the
same kind with tolerable success, under a considerable difference
of moving power ; but this very practice must have arisen out of
repeated trials, and is generally deaT-bought wisdom, though
seldom at the mechanician's      own expense.
    In whatever manner an effect is produced by the intervention

of machinery, a certain portion of the moving force is lost in
friction ; in some cases nearly the whole, and in all it is consi
derable.     The importance therefore of a correct mode of calcu
lating the effect of friction is perhaps one of the greatest desi
 derata in mechanical science.
    The greater part, if not the whole, of our knowledge respect
ing friction, is the result of experimental inquiry ; and the few
 investigations that have been attempted have been conducted as
if it depended wholly on the internal structure of bodies : at least
such is the principle adopted by Parent and Belidor *, who con
 sidered bodies to be composed of spherical particles, and that
friction consisted in the force lost in raising these spherical pro
 tuberances over one another. But were that the case, there could
 not be a difference in the friction of different bodies.   The most
 ingenious and elegant illustration of the nature of friction is that
given by Professor Leslie (in his Inquiry into the Nature of Heat,
 &c.)    The Professor very justly observes that " its existence de
 monstrates an unceasing mutual change of figure, the opposite
 planes during the passage continually seeking to accommodate
 themselves to all the minute and accidental varieties of contact.
 The one surface being pressed against the other becomes, as it
were, compactly indented by protruding some points and re
 tracting others.   This adaptation is not accomplished instanta
neously, but requires very different periods to attain its maxi
mum, according to the nature and relation of the substances
concerned"
 -
    I will now endeavour to exhibit, in its most simple form, the
relation between the friction and those properties of bodies by
which it is affected, in hopes that it may tend to elucidate the
 subject; and also furnish some valuable hints respecting the na
ture of the bodies that are best adapted to move on one another
with the least friction.
    The form of the surfaces of bodies is determined by their in
ternal structure ; and whatever degree of smoothness may be
given by art, it is impossible to render those surfaces perfect
planes : and when two bodies are pressed together, the surfaces
in contact will, in proportion to the force, become indented into
one another.     Whatever may be the depth of indentation, when
the body is caused to slide, a part equal to this depth is supposed
to be abraded or torn away. That 'such an abrasion does take
place, is apparent from common observation, as all bodies wear
when exposed to friction. There are, however, some very flexible
bodies that by yielding escape being abraded, such as caoutchouc,
&c. which appear to require an extension of these principles to
include them.

    When the extensibility        and cohesion are at the least,            I  would call the body

it can only            be torn away to the depth                           which the more coherent

    Consequently, — adhering to the definitions of hardness, &c.
given in a preceding note, — hard body moving on a soft one

ductions in a practical point of view, particularly when       re                                     it   is
collected that Coulomb obtained results which agree    with them,
in his experiments on friction.

 III. Of the Friction of Bodies when the Motion is uniformly
                                   accelerated.
   In this case the general         proportion (6) remains the same        as
 when the motion is uniform , that is             I   :   —   •
   But by the laws of accelerated motion the space abraded will
be as -thesquare of the velocity; the body being moved from
rest.    Therefore           A: V>, (9).
   And F : I x A, becomes F : I, (10).
Consequently in this case friction is an uniformly retarding force,
as Professor Vince has shown by his ingenious experiments.
    In the case of bodies moved from rest, the theory above stated
fully explains the phenomena observed by Coulomb: it removes
all the seeming anomalies respecting the friction of heterogeneous
bodies, and enables us to determine the quantity of friction from
the properties    of bodies which have been investigated.      The
most convenient method of doing this is to change the general
proportions into equations ; the constant members of which may
be easily got from experiments.     Let these constants be a, vy
and c, for the three cases then,
             In bodies moved from rest                F=PxExCxo,

And in uniformly accelerated motions, F=P xE x C xc.
Consequently when a, b, and c are determined for one body, the
friction of any other body may be found, its extensibility «nd co

    The bodies should be free from any intermixture of hard par
 ticles, otherwise these laws will not obtain : and it may be further
 observed, that friction is increased by introducing the fragments
 of hard bodies between the rubbing surfaces ; as these fragments
 become indented into the surfaces in proportion to their hard
 ness, and consequently cause a greater degree of abrasion.               On
 this principle the art of stone-sawing, &c. depends.               On the
 contrary, the introduction of soft substances prevents the sur
 faces acting upon one another, thus lessens the abrasion, and
 consequently the friction ; but in order that these substances may
produce the desired effect, it is necessary that they should be of
a sufficient degree of consistence to keep the bodies from in
denting into one another : hence it is that tallow answers better

than oil.      When grease of any kind is in too liquid a state for
preventing friction, it may be improved by adding the powder of
any mineral that soils easily, such as black-lead, &c.
     On the preceding principles the durability of bodies exposed
to friction might be easily ascertained.       When the surfaces are
of the same kind, the durability will be inversely as the indenta
tion, and consequently inversely as the extensibility.       When the
surfaces are of different kinds, the durability will be inversely as
the extensibility of the harder surface.
     It is obvious that when bodies roll, different laws will obtain ;
but the subject might be treated in a similar manner, which will
be considered at some future period.

     II.  On Roads and Wheel-Carriages.        By Mr. Benjamin
                              Wingrove.
That        important branch of our political ceconomy, the manage
ment of the public roads, whether considered in reference to con
venience or burthen, forms an object of such consequence to the
community at large, and to the agricultural interests in particu
lar, that I think no apology necessary for intruding on the public
a communication on that subject.
     The vast increase of the commerce and wealth of this country
has long demanded the convenience and luxury of good roads ;
and the whole art necessary for their construction and preserva
 tion has been, for many years past, imparted to the public by
various treatises and essays, which are to be found in the libraries
 of every establishment for the advancement of science and know
 ledge. Our enlightened legislature has too, by various general and
 local statutes, furnished all the requisite powers and authorities
 for effecting so important a design. Yet, notwithstanding a call
  so imperious, information so adequate, and power so efficient, a
  supineness truly unaccountable has, till within a few years past,
  prevailed throughout the country on this interesting subject.        I
 might     indeed aver that, in some parts, the  system has  been alto
  gether retrograde.     The inconveniences which have resulted from
  this great popular neglect, have however, at last, proved insup
  portable; and in consequence the reformation of the road system
  has commenced with a zeal and energy that cannot fail to pro
  duce the most successful issue.
      In the northern counties, particularly in Yorkshire and Not
  tinghamshire,     and in some parts about London, (in all which
   Mr. Clay has successfully introduced his ingenious machinery,
   improvements have been effected.       In this part of the kingdom,
                                                                    the

the Bristol commissioners began the work of amendment ; and
their general surveyor, Mr. M'Adam, has revived, with improve
ment, a plan long practised in this county, and admirably cal
culated for roads which, like those in the Bristol trust, are com
posed of excellent materials.       The commissioners of this district
also determined on removing the reproach which the bad state
of their roads had brought on Bath and its neighbourhood. They
confided the execution of their works to my direction ; and not
withstanding the existing paucity of proper materials, and in
spite of usage more destructive than in any other part of Eng
land, the system I have adopted has been crowned with com
plete success ; as the present excellent state of our roads will, I
trust, sufficiently testify. From these and other districts, in which
reformation has been adopted, the light of improvement is ex
tending throughout the country with a rapidity and spirit that
promise to overcome every obstacle, and fmally to effect a grand
and general scheme of reformation in the road system.
     My pbject in this address is not to discuss plans or theories.
 In passing, however, I may be allowed to rema'rk, that in all po
pular objects taken up with enthusiasm, schemes of delusion are
often hastily adopted.       Thus, in this instance, the art of the en
gineer,    on  which  the stability of every system of road-making
must depend, appears to be overlooked ; and the whole merit and
importance of the scheme is ascribed to mere mechanical means,
 which will not bear indiscriminate application, and, even where
 locally advantageous, may afford only a temporary benefit. The
 partial disappointments hence arismg may occasionally prove pre
judicial to the progress of the general work : but as the spirit of
 inquiry, when once awakened, is too strong to be subdued, science
 will, in the end, be sure of its triumph. I therefore entertain
  a belief, that within a few years,      if due legislative precautions
  le taken, the highways of this kingdom will exceed in excellence
  all that has ever been enjoyed by a nation, since the dissolution
 of the Roman empire.
     The means of giving permanency, then, to a measure, on which
  so much of the ease and safety of society depends, must infallibly
  excite the solicitude and inquiry of the public.        But surely it is
  always   better to  meet  evils by  anticipation,  and    guard against
  them by timely exertion,     than  to wait  their effects  before a re
  medy be devised ; and I trust that this communication will be
  found contributive to that end.       •  -
      I think that I shall be supported in stating as an axiom, that
  it is not only essential, but indispensable, that there should be a
  reciprocal adaptation between the roads and the carriages which
  pass over them.      That this adaptation does not now exist, more
   particularly where the roads are properly constructed, must be
                                                                   obvious

obvious to any observer of facts.     An inspection of the wheel-
carriages now in common use throughout the country will, I ven
ture to affirm, afford abundant evidence of the accuracy of that
observation.    Many of these carriages might justly be described
as engines for the destruction of good roads, and for the punish
ment of the animals doomed to drag them along.         My observa
tion and experience in the usage of roads has wrought a convic
tion in my mind, that, unless a reformation be effected in the
construction and regulation of wheels and wheeled carriages, mil
lions will be wasted, and roads in a state of excellence will be al
together denied to those districts which do not possess the means
of providing good materials.
   This subject has- within the last twenty years been so often
brought before the public, and explained with so much perspir
euity and ingenuity, that it would be highly presumptuous in me
to descant on it.    Need I mention the works of Edgeworth, the
admirable essays and experiments of Cummings, (whose posi
tions, though doubted or disputed on some points, still appear to
lead the mind to conviction:) or should I remind the public that
years ago the whole of this important matter, both as regards the
construction of wheels and the general management of roads,
underwent a full examination before a Committee of the House
of Commons, and that a copious and valuable mass of evidence
was obtained, which has been long since published to the world ?
Notwithstanding these proceedings of the legislature, which pro
duced an exposition fraught with so many valuable facts, still has
this matter, so important to the country at large, and to the landed
interest in particular, been permitted ever since to remain dor
mant.     To what can such an extraordinary apathy or indifference
be attributed ?   Is it that human ingenuity is believed to have
attained to its acme, and that mechanical improvements          have
ceased ?    The numerous philosophical establishments and public
repertories of the country will prove the contrary.   Are not, then,
these delays solely attributable to the inveteracy of custom and
its concomitant prejudices ? To overcome such obstacles is a
difficult task.  Scepticism will ever come in aid of ancient esta
blishments. Let it be so.    I would not overturn one system, until
the merits of that which is to be substituted had undergone due
investigation, and its superiority been proved.     As however opi
nions are, or may be, at variance on this subject, inquiry is the
only means of attaining to the truth ; and it is with an humble
desire to kindle and extend that spirit of inquiry, that I have
framed this address.
    Having thus declared that my views in this publication are
merely to excite inquiry and investigation, it would be neither
necessary nor becoming in me to impose on the attention of the
                                                               public

public by any schemes or measures of improvement which I may
contemplate      in reference to the foregoing.     I trust, however,
that 1 may assume the privilege of mentioning a few points of a
general nature, which call loudly for parliamentary interposition.
    The present mode of dragging waggon wheels in descending
hills, if continued, will render every effort for the preservation
of roads in hilly countries wholly unavailing ; for, in fact, the
smoother and more even we render the surface, the more de
structive is the system of dragging. The custom on smooth roads
is to drag    " rough," as it is termed, that is by tying the wheel
so as to bear on a projecting angular nail, which sometimes rises
above the streak of the wheel, half and even three-quarters of
an inch, operating on the most consolidated surface literally as a
plough.      This destructive plan cannot be more severely felt than
on the roads about Bath ; where the hills, which are the avenueo
to the city, for all ponderous materials, stone and coals, are steep
and long.       But every hilly country will exhibit abundant evi
dences of this terrific mischief.     1 am unwilling to express my
opinion as to a remedy ; but I should think that a shoe, as it is
here designated, not as made at present, but properly constructed
and properly used, is preferable to any other mode of dragging:
 at all events, " dragging rough" should be interdicted.
    The restrictions now in force as to the breadth of carriages are
 also productive of serious evils.    At the period when the general
 Highway     and  Turnpike   Acts  were  passed, (13th of the present
 king,)  the  roads were  then generally narrow, especially at the en
 trances of towns and cities ; but the commercial intercourse of
 the country, though       comparatively with its present extent of
 small importance, was increasing, and wheeled carriages of all
 burthens obtaining.      The legislature, therefore, to meet the con
 venience of the public, thought it necessary to regulate the width
 or breadth of wains and waggons, so as to make them suitable
 to the then confined state of the roads ; and it was accordingly en
 acted, that all wains and waggons should be of the width of four
 feet six inches from inside to inside of the wheels; but a breadth
 of wheel was allowed to heavy carriages. It was, according to some,
 from this restriction, that the extreme conical wheel now so much
 in public use, and deemed so injurious to the roads, owes its in
 troduction.     Now it will be readily seen, that this compulsive
 uniformity in the breadth of carriages has conduced in a great
 measure to the rutting of roads, as every carriage covers the same
 space.    By repealing this law, (and the roads being universally
 extended in width, there is no reason for its continuance,) and
 regulating the breadth of carriages, those with broad wheels by
 a maximum and minimum,           and those with narrow wheels by a
 maximum only, an immediate improvement, or rather diminution

of injury, to the roads, would of course follow: for by varying the
breadth of carriages according to the breadth of wheel, or accord
ing to any other given rule, the wheels of each would require a
different line, and so, in a certain degree, each successive car
riage would operate as a roller, instead of contributing to make
ruts, which is the effect of the present restrictions, from the in
surmountable aptitude of horses and drivers to pursue the same
track.
    Although no exposition of the injurious effects of this law has
appeared in any of those parts of the printed evidence taken be
fore the Committee of the House of Commons which have •fallen
under my eye, yet, I conclude that a mischief and a remedy so
obvious could not have escaped the attention of the numerous
and well-informed gentlemen who have inquired into, or written
on, the subject.        I do not, therefore, either in that or any other
point embraced in this address, claim the merit of originality.
My motive,      as already   disclosed, is merely to invoke an investi
gation, which may, in the end, bring all the conflicting opinions
which have been promulgated, or which may exist, on these im
portant matters, into collision ; and thus that errors may be de
tected,    and the necessary changes and reformations established
on   bases  of truth and science. I have, therefore, refrained as much
as possible from intruding my own humble opinions on the notice
of the public. I think it necessary however to add, that I shall
at all times be ready to disclose my sentiments on the matters to
 which I have in any degree alluded, should it appear necessary;
 and an inclination to forward the work of improvement induces
 me thus publicly to invite fair criticism on my works, and to de
 clare that the public may obtain from me a full exposition of the
 plans I have pursued.

 III.  On the Scheme      of a Perpetual Full Moon. By Mr. Henry
                                  Mejkle.
                              To Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir, —     Of    all the various ways in which human weakness ma
 nifests itself, perhaps there is none wherein it is more pompously
 displayed than by pretending to improve the mechanism of the
 universe.
     Our own country is not altogether barren of such pretensions ;
  and if at any time we are likely to run short of scepticism, we
 have only to call for help from the continent.           There is an in
 stance of this, in a work from which better things might have
                                                                     been

the moon been made to enlighten the earth, Nature has been
frustrated in her design, for that end is not answered.   Our
author then, compassionating the weakness of Nature, proposes
the scheme of a perpetual full moon.       With how much wisdom,
we shall see immediately.
    If the moon were always in opposition, or full, it is evident
that she would then be a primary planet, and a superior one too ;
for she would revolve about the sun as a centre, and her orbit
would also include the orbit of the earth.      Now, since in this
case the periods of the earth and moon are equal, the forces with
which they are urged to the sun must be as their distances from
it.      therefore, ©, 0, and

the action of the moon to raise the tides                            is      reciprocally as the

times the mass of the earth, or fully eight times its size.
   Laplace has certainly in this, as well as in some of his other
pious speculations, extended his researches beyond the bounds of
truth. Manifold doubtless were the ends of the moon's creation                                                              ;

           t               To Mr. Tilhch.
 Sir, — ^
                                Strathendry Bleachfield, Dec. 7, 1818.
          v/n  reading my communication On the Swallow, inserted
in your Number for October last, I find I had omitted one anec
 dote, which, although trivial in itself, may without impropriety
be inserted, as it tends in some measure to elucidate the wisely-
discriminating penetration of these wonderfully sagacious little
 creatures, when deviating from the general habits of their species.
 The anecdote was connected with, and should have followed,
    " I have known both kinds in a bad season, when short of flies
 to nourish and bring forward their young, abandon whole nests
of the last sittings to perish, when the ultimate period of their
departure arrived, but never knew them separate and leave the
other divisions behind."     Neither did I ever know even a strag
gling deviation, except in one solitary instance, and which must
have been the result of deliberation, dictated by the peculiar cir
cumstances of the season, conjoined with heart-ties of the ten-
derest parental affection.
    In the year 1814, by accident the nests with the second incu
bation of two pair had fallen and the eggs were broken.            This
misfortune was repaired with all possible dispatch by rebuilding,
and a fresh sitting of eggs produced . but by this circumstance,
and consequent delay, these nestlings were thrown far behind
their twin-kindred of the same brood. And when the period of
departure arrived, they had not gained sufficient fledging to leave
the nest.    The weather however was dry, and the season upon
the whole favourable. The parents of both nests, contrary to the
practice in unfavourable years, allowed the colony to depart, re
mained behind after every swallow but themselves was gone,
nourished and brought forward their second brood, put them
through all their trainings and facings, and, in about fourteen
days after their associates had gone, took their departure, direct
ing and protecting the flight of their young to join the departed
colony.
    I have now to communicate one additional fact, which I con
sider a complete refutation of their fancied subaquatic hiberna
tion. During the past summer, the servants observing the atten
tion I was bestowing on every movement of the swallows, were
quite alive to point out every thing regarding them that appeared
any way particular.     From the fineness of the season, and no
lack of food, the young brood all survived ; and towards the period
of their hibernating, joined in all probability by other distant
colonies, they mustered numbers far beyond what I ever remem

         On the Mamifacture and     Uses of Animal Charcoal.      17
ber to have seen iti any former year, but not a white-tailed one
could ever be detected in the assembled multitude.         Their ga
thering song was .more than usually cheerful ;    their training and
spiral nights, from their augmented numbers, were particularly
amusing ; and their merry-making was louder and longer heard
after their flight was beyond the reach of the visual organs : per
haps this might be heightened by an uncommonly mild humidity
in the air, which being more conductor)' of sound than a dry at
mosphere might aid the vibration of their noisy clamour.          At
length they took their final departure, leaving
                                                   " not a rack be
hind," under all the similar circumstances of former years. On
the evening of the seventh day, however, after they had totally
disappeared, we had again the unusual pleasure of a revisitation
from our old friends.    It was a fine summer evening; the exhala
tions of the meridian sun hovered over our heads in calm sere
nity; while not a breath of wind nor the rustling of a leaf dis
turbed the rays of the sun, half smothered, half reflected, glim
mering through a misty veil of snow-white brightness, and heightr-
enedbythe increasing obliquity of the departing beams,which threw
over the waning day an air of heavenly sublimity.       Enticed from
the elevated regions (to which I am of opinion they retire, and
keep on the wing during the whole of their absence, or throughc
which they wing their flight to distant climes) by the uncommon
mildness and calm serenity of the evening, the swallows- were
first heard but faintly, as at a great distance in the air. Their
well-known voice however was instantly recognised, and the sound
of the ethereal crowd (of swallows) brought some of the servants,
from the field, to intimate the return of their old and particular,
friends. From the increasing sound, we discovered they were-
gradually continuing their descent, till their well-known and fa
miliar tones were distinctly heard in loud clamour by every ser
vant on the field.    None ventured to descend below the vapour ;
 consequently   none  of them were seen, although they remained
within hearing for nearly an hour together.        They reascended
with the going down of the sun, and have never been heard nor
seen again.                Yours sincerely,
                                                    Gavin Inglis.
V.   On the Manufacture and Uses of Animal Charcoal, known
    ly the Name of Ivory Black, &c.         By the Chevalier Cadit
    be Gassicourt.
The      physical and chemical properties of animal charcoal have
been known only for a few years. Formerly bones and ivory were
calcined in close vessels merely to procure a fine black for paint-

   IS      On the Manufacture          and Use    of Animal Charcoal
 mg ; but, since the discovery of the properties of charcoal as a
 purifier and clarifier, they make use of it in sugar-refineries, la
 boratories, and stills, as well as for purifying oil, &c.               Many
 manufactories have been established, and (he preparation of bone-
 black is now become a separate art, of interesting consideration.
      There are many manufacturers of animal charcoal in Paris.
 Their process is very simple.            Some, after filling a number of
 earthen or iron pots with broken bones, lute on the cover with
potters' earth, then pile one over the other in a potters' kiln,
which      is heated with wood or pit-coal : when the degree of
heat becomes sufficient to decompose the gelatine and oil of the
bones, the luting cracks in small fissures, and gives issue to the
carbonized hydrogen gas, which escapes from the furnace by se
veral small apertures made for the purpose, one above another,
 and on reaching the atmospheric air becomes ignited, and is con
sumed. When this flame goes out, the combustion is completed.
 In England and France, other manufacturers distil bones in cy
linders of cast-iron that run through a great fire-place, or in iron
 alembics ; but in these manufactories the bone-black is looked
upon as of only secondary importance; for it is for the purpose
 of making carbonate, sulphate, and muriate of ammonia, that
 they generally distil bones. Without that, the black would come
 too dear, and be seldom demanded, notwithstanding its utility.
      In this process, the form of the vessel is of small importance,
 provided it be well closed : the great point is to mske use of the
 least fuel possible, and apply the heat equally every where. When
•this is done on a large scale, the most convenient furnaces are
 those employed in London, and of late in Paris, for the gas-lights.
 With this apparatus, you have two choices to make ; the first,
 to make use of the gas for lighting, and it renders a whiter and
 more lively flame than the gas of mineral coal ; the second is the
 conveniency of burning this gas in the fire-place itself, and thus
 greatly oeconomizing fuel *. If the gas is to be employed as fuel,
 the iron cylinders or cucurbits should be so disposed as to admit
 of their contents being easily renewed.             There are several means
 for this purpose ; but the simplest is to place a disk of strong
  plate-iron in the bottom of each cylinder, riveted to one or two
     * We here omit a few lines in which the author recommends, if the gas
  is to be employed as fuel, " to adapt two diaphragms of wire-gauze to the
  funnel which conducts the gas under the fire-place, to prevent explosions."
  It is plain, from his recommending this, that he has never tried any ex
  periments respecting the combustion of hydrogen, or hydro-carbonic gas,
  neither of which can explode till after they have been mixed with the atmo
  spheric air. He has been thinking of Sir H. Davy's lamp, where it is ne
  cessary to prevent the passage of combustion, the surrounding gas being
  in a mixed state, ready for explosion; — and so in Dr. Clark's lamp, in which
   the gas in the reservoir is in a like condition.

                                        of Ivory Black,                        1   9
 iron rods a little longer than the cylinder. As soon as the combus
  tion is over, by drawing out the rods the disk at once carries
 down all the coal into an extinguisher adapted to the mouth of
 the cylinder.      The disk is then pushed down, and the cylinder is
 charged and stopped again before it has time to cool.          The time
 saved by this method ceconomizes a considerable quantity of fuel.
     It is, however, very essential that the cylinders or cucurbits
 receive the heat equally every where, and that depends on the
 construction of the furnace.       This is a difficult problem to re
 solve : however, many coal-distillers have effected      it,    by
                                                               rendering
 their cylinders or cucurbits moveable, so as to be able to turn
 them four or five times during the operation, and present every
 side to the full force of the fire alternately.
     In Monsieur Robert's manufactory at the Gros Caillou, where
 they extract oil from garbage, Monsieur Barruel, head chemist of
 the School of Physic, got a great furnace constructed for distilling
 bones, in which the laws of pyrotechny are so strictly adhered
 to, that he can heat his cylinders with cow-dung only, and com
 pletes the distillation   byconsuming the gas in the body of the fur
 nace.      His cylinders are always hot; and the operations succeed
 so rapidly, that the expense of fuel       hardly sensible.
                                            is
     Every kind of bones employed in close vessels does not yield
a   similar kind of coal this coal varies in quality, according as
                          ;
they employ old or young animals' bonss, round or flat, heavy
 and compact, or spongy and light ones.           The analysis of these
various kinds of charcoal has made us acquainted with the cause
of this difference.   It   was natural to think that young animals'
 bones contained more gelatine than those of old quadrupeds                     ;
and, consequently, ought to yield a deeper black and more char
coal.      This was an error for great round bones, such as the
                                ;                                              fe
mur and tibia of oxen, yield more coal when distilled than similar
bones of equal weight taken from calves. The proportion of black
charcoal in young animals' bones            only four or five per cent.,
                                            is
while that of old compact bone amounts to forty.             This     the is
reason why ivory black         the most intense of all animal blacks.
                              is
     Animal charcoal  is   a mixture of phosphate of lime,         small
                                                                      a
quantity of quick-lime, and coal (or calx of carbon). The pro
perty of clarifying liquids depends on the mixture of these four
substances, none of which separately enjoys this property so per
fectly.     Now, as all manufacturers are in the habit of deciding
on the quality of their materials, — when the bones do not appear
to contain much gelatine, they take care to add, in the furnace,
soft animal matter, such as clotted blood, tripe or guts, mem
branes, &c.       This
                     is   the roison why many refiners esteem most
the black produced         bythe calcination of blood and potash, in
Prussian-blue manufactories.
                                    B   2                                 From

20         Ora the Manufacture and    Uses of Animal Charcoal.
      From the foregoing observations it is evident, whether animal
charcoal is intended for painting or clarifying, that which con
tains the greater proportion of carbon is to be preferred; and
this proportion is always easily discovered, by the application of
muriatic acid to the coal.        This acid dissolves the calcareous
salts and the      lime;  after which  the purged coal remains alone.
 It .is then dried and weighed:    —  should it equal forty-hundredths
of the analysed coal, it is very fit for painting and clarifying ; but
the painters require it much finer than the refiners.
      Manv refiners, who make advantageous use of animal black,
have wisely judged that it might serve more than once.          So that
when it has lost its effect as a filtering clarifier, they wash it well
 in a great quantity of water, and calcine it again with or without
 the addition of animal matter.         They have remarked, that this
 coal, twice or thrice calcined, was more advantageous, and clari
 fied syrups better, than that which had been calcined only once.
 The manufacturers of bone-black are, consequently, interested in
 buying up the coal from the refiners (after they have made use
 of it), to calcine it over again.
      We have remarked, that bone-black was the better for con
 taining a great quantity of carbon : that is true, but that is not
 all; it is indispensable that the mixture of these different ele
 ments be exact, and, above all, that it be well powdered.          For
  this purpose, some manufacturers make use of a pounding-mill,
 like the paper-makers ; others, mill-stones; and some, cylinders.
  All these methods are good, and the nature of the situation must
  decide on which.       Now, some manufacturers grind the bone-
  black dry, while others make use of water; and this latter method
  is both more expeditious and wholesomer for the workman ;
  after that, it is dried before being offered for sale.
       In sugar-houses bone-black is sometimes employed as a sim
  ple filter, and in this case they only pour the syrup on the moist
  ened animal coal: but when required as a clarifier,        it must be
  boiled up with the sugar, in the proportion of one-tenth to the
  quantity of sugar to be clarified.     Before the sugar, dissolved in
   a sufficient quantity of water, has been boiled, and brought to the
   consistence of syrup, the coal is poured, little by little, into the
   boiler. After seven or eight minutes' longer boiling on the fire, all
   is thrown together into a woollen bag disposed for that purpose.
   The syrup at first passes a little coloured by the coal it carries
   along with it ; but then they pour it back into the bag, and it
   runs out clear.
       Syrups worked with coal yield a much more abundant crystal
   lization, and of a very superior quality, to syrups worked with
   out it.
        It is to M. Lowitz we owe the discovery of the property of
                                                               powdered

powdered charcoal for clarifying animal and vegetable substances,
at the    same time that it takes away their smell.             In 1791 he
clarified gum-arabic, gelatine, beer, milk, red wine, vinegar, tinc
ture of cochineal, &c. ; but the greater part of these substances
had been decomposed.            He attenuated the smell of bitumen,
flowers of benzoin, bugs, empyreumatic oils, the infusion of vale
rian, &c. by the sole use of wood coal.
    In 1810, M. Figuier, professor of chemistry in Montpellier,
after repeating M. Lowitz's experiments, tried animal charcoal,
and found it possessed a stronger power of clarification than ve
getable coal.       Since this period, both are employed to keep wa
ter fresh at sea, and to purify oil and water, meat and fish, in the
first stage of putrefaction.      They moreover make use of it to ren
der the most corrupt water potable, to clarify honey, syrups, &c.
    M. Guilbert, a confectioner in Paris, remarked that wood-
charcoal, which had been long moist, and during this state ex
posed to the rays of the sun, clarifies much better than what is
pulverized dry, and employed immediately.             He advises to leave
the charcoal intended for purifying some time in pure water, to
grind it in the water, and then expose it to the light, covered an
inch deep with this liquid ; and to employ it after being drained,
but still in a moist state. No one has as yet examined the ef
 fect of light on animal charcoal, according to M. Guilbert's pro
cess: this experiment, however, is worthy the attention of che
 mists and manufacturers.
       VI.  On new Combinations       of Oxygen     and Acids.       By
                         M. L. J. Thenard*.
 These       combinations were obtained by treating the peroxide of
 barium with acids.         They are mostly very remarkable, and de
 serving    of  the attention  of chemists.
     The first I observed was the combination of nitric acid with
 oxygen.       Peroxide of barium (barytes saturated with oxygen)
 when moistened, falls to powder with but little increase of tem
 perature.       When mixed, in this state, with seven or eight times
 its weight of water, if dilute nitric acid be poured gradually on
 it, by agitation it will dissolve without giving off any gas. The
 solution is neutral, producing no change on turnsole or on tur
  meric.      If the requisite quantity of sulphuric acid be added to
  this solution, a copious precipitate of sulphate of barytes is thrown
  down, and the liquid when filtered is merely water holding oxy
  genized nitric acid in solution.
      This acid, which in almost all its properties resembles nitric

acid, is liquid and colourless.       When heat is applied, it instantly
gives off oxygen ; but to effect complete decomposition it must
be kept boiling for some time.          From this it follows that to con
centrate it by heat, without altering                     it,
                                                     would be very difficult.
The method         by
                    which succeeded was,
                                  I                    placing  by   in     cap   it   a
sule, along    with another     capsule  full  of  lime,  under   the    receiver
of an air-pump, and then exhausting the receiver till the mercu
rial gauge stood ten or twelve centimetres below the common ba
rometer;     by which means got       I  sufficiently concentrated to give
                                               it
out eleven times its bulk of oxygen gas, whereas in its first state                          it
gave out only one and a half time its volume of that gas.
    This oxygenized acid readily combines with barytes, potash,
soda, ammonia, and neutralizes them; but                  fear   I will      next
                                                                              it       be

application of heat the acid            decomposed, giving out oxygen.

They    are  decomposed      even when   left to spontaneous evaporation                         :
at least I   found      so with the oxygenized nitrate of barytes, at
                        it
the very instant of crystallization.            They decompose likewise
under an exhausted receiver           as  ;  the case with alkaline bicar-
                                                     is
bonates, which boil violently in an exhausted receiver and be
come simple carbonates.           But the oxygenized nitrates when re
duced to nitrates do not change their state of neutralization.
     Hence    is
             it   apparent that oxygenized nitric acid, instead of be
coming more fixed when united with bases, acquires, on the con
trary, the property of abandoning, with greater facility, its oxy
gen.     So true      this, that
                       is             a concentrated solution of potash
                                          if
be poured on a neutral concentrated solution of oxygenized ni
trate of potash,       brisk effervescence ensues, and oxygen
                        a                                                   given      is
off nor can
     :             be doubted that the potash acts upon nitrate pro
                  it
perly so called.       Thus, relatively to oxygenized nitric acid, the
bases act as the ordinary acids do relatively to certain peroxides;
for instance, sulphuric acid on the black oxide of manganese.
    The oxygenized nitric acid does not act upon gold but                     dis ;     it
 solves very readily the metals soluble in nitric acid; and the solu
tion generally takes place without the disengagement of gas, and
 produces heat     : but in some cases a little oxygen             given off at
                                                                              is
 first, particularly the action be too violent, as the case when
                            if                                               is
 this acid, so concentrated as to contain fifteen times its volume
 of oxygen,   is  poured upon zinc.
     To ascertain how much oxygen this acid contains,                   began bv   I
 analysing    the deutoxide    of barium.         heated  Isome   barytes with
 an excess of oxygen in a small curved tube standing over mer
 cury.    This base,       passing to the state of peroxide, absorbed
                             in                                      a

that exists in the protoxide ; while in the neutral nitrates the
quantity of oxygen of the acid is to that of the oxide as 5 to 1 ;
consequently in oxygenized nitric acid the azote will be to the

was this : I   took   fragment of barytes, which,

 no action on gold at the ordinary temperature, at least in the space
  of a few minutes. With silver it occasions as lively an efferves
 cence as when an acid is poured on a carbonate ; because water
  and chlorine being formed by the reaction of the oxide and the
 muriatic acid on each other, the oxygen united with the acid be
 ing suddenly disengaged assumes the gaseous form.
    This property of the oxygenized muriatic acid being decom
posed by oxide of silver, liberating the oxygen, may probably
-enable us to form several other oxygenized acids with facility.
 Thus, with this acid and a solution of fluate of silver we may ex
pect to obtain oxygenized fluoric acid.
     In oxygenized muriatic acid the hydrogen and oxygen are in
the proportions required to form water.
    These, which are the principal results that I have hitherto ob
 tained, make us acquainted with a new class of bodies, which
may probably prove numerous in species.           We must discover
them, ascertain their properties, and the different circumstances
in which they are capable of being formed; and see whether
other bodies, besides acids, be not capable of combining with
oxygen.       A laborious set of experiments is thus chalked out, the
  results of which shall be laid before the Academy.
    I have, since these observations were read, satisfied myself that
by the process pointed out to obtain oxygenized fluoric acid, not
only this, but likewise oxygenized sulphuric acid, may be ob
tained. Indeed all the acids susceptible of being oxygenized may
easily be procured in that way.        Oxygenized fluoric acid does
not give off its oxygen at a boiling temperature, but oxygenized
sulphuric acid parts with it easily.
    I have also ascertained that oxygenized nitric and muriatic
acids may be combined with new doses of oxygen ; as is proba
bly the case with the other acids.       To obtain these new com
 pounds, it is only necessary to treat the oxygenized acid with the
 deutoxide of barium, as stated above : thus to superoxygenize
 oxygenized muriatic acid, saturate this acid with deutoxide of
barium. The sulphuric acid precipitates the barytes, and the li
quid is then decanted off, which will be found to contain all the
oxygen furnished by the two portions of deutoxide of barium on
which the operation is performed.
     It deserves to be noticed, that the same acid may be repeat
 edly oxygenized by the same process.        I have oxygenized it as
often    as seven times.
    Whether these kinds of combinations take place in definite or
 indefinite proportions, must be ascertained by future experiments.
 But however this may be, when an excess of barytes water is
 poured on the oxygenized nitric or on the oxygenized muriatic
 acid, or into these acids superoxygenized, an abundant crystal

  or Uric   Acid. By William Prout, M.D.         Communicated
   by   W. H. Wollaston, M.D. F.R.S.*
During        an investigation of the principles of the urine, with the
view of elucidating the pathology of that secretion,         was led to
                                                                   I
examine the well-known beautiful purple substance produced                        by
the action of the nitric acid and heat upon the lithic acid, and
which has usually been considered as one of the characteristic
distinctions of the lithic acid.      This purple substance proved to
be compound of ammonia, and a peculiar principle having the
   a
properties of an acid — the description of which, and of its com
                           ;

    This acid principle may be obtained              by
                                                 digesting pure lithic

neutralized with ammonia, and the whole slowly concentrated                       by
evaporation.      As the evaporation proceeds, the colour of the so

26                Description     of an Acid Principle
ammonia, above mentioned, was dissolved in a solution of caustic
potash, and heat applied to the solution till the red colour entirely
disappeared.      This alkaline solution was then gradually dropped
into dilute sulphuric acid, which uniting with the potash, left the
acid principle in a state of purity.
    The acid principle is likewise produced from lithic acid by
chlorine. Iodine has also the same remarkable property, though
in a much less striking degree. When lithic acid is boiled with
iodine for some time, a partial solution of the lithic acid is ef
fected ; and if to this solution a little ammonia be added, and the
whole evaporated to dryness, a perceptible quantity of the beauti
ful purple compound of ammonia and the new acid principle will
be obtained.      1 am not aware that any other substance is capa
ble of producing this change, though the circumstance is by no
means improbable.
    To prevent circumlocution, I shall in future call this principle
the purpuric acid, a name suggested by Dr. Wollaston, from its
remarkable property of forming compounds with most bases of a
red or purple colour.
    The purpuric acid, as obtained above, usually exists in the form
of a very fine powder, of a slightly yellowish or cream colour ;
and when examined with a magnifier, especially in water, appears
to possess a pearly lustre.       It has no smell nor taste. Its speci
fic gravity is considerably above that of water, though, from the
minute state of division in which it exists, it usually takes a con
siderable time to subside in that fluid.          When suffered to sepa
rate slowly from a large quantity of water, or any other fluid ca
pable of holding it in solution, it sometimes assumes the form of
thin pearly scales.
    The purpuric acid is very little soluble in water.          One tenth of
a grain boiled for a considerable time in 1000 grains of water
was not entirely dissolved.         The water assumed a purple tint,
which it retained after it was cold, though it became very slightly
turbid on cooling*. The purpuric acid is insoluble in alcohol and
ether.    In all the mineral acids, when coiicentrated and in excess,
and in solutions of the different alkalies, it dissolves readily ; but
it is insoluble, or nearly so, in dilute sulphuric, muriatic, and
phosphoric acids, and also in solutions of the oxalic, citric, and
tartaric acids.     Concentrated nitric acid readily dissolves it with
effervescence ; and if the acid be in excess, and heat be applied,
    * I am not quite sure whether the purple tint here mentioned depends
 upon the actual solution of a minute portion of the purpuric acid ; and, con
 sequently, whether it naturally forms a purple solution, or whether the co
 lour be owing to the formation of a little ammonia from the decomposition
of a minute proportion of the acid, which, combining with the remainder of
the acid, forms the purpurate of ammonia.     I incline to the latter opinion.
                                                                     a portion

            prepared from the       Lilkic  or Uric    Acid.            27
a  portion of the purpuric acid is decomposed, ammonia is formed;
and on driving off the excess of nitric acid by heat, the purpurate
of ammonia is obtained, precisely as if a little of the lithic acid
had been treated in a similar manner.             Chlorine, likewise, dis
solves    the purpuric acid, and apparently produces the same
changes upon it as the nitric acid.           It readily dissolves also by
the assistance of heat, in concentrated acetic acid.
    The purpuric acid does not sensibly affect litmus paper, pro
bably on account of its insoluble nature.            When exposed to the
air it does not deliquesce, but gradually assumes a purplish tint,
apparently by attracting a little ammonia from the atmosphere,
or perhaps from the evolution from itself of a little of the same
alkali by spontaneous decomposition.
    Submitted to heat, it neither melts nor sublimes, but acquires
a purple hue from the formation of ammonia,                and afterwards
 burns gradually, without yielding any remarkable odour.              Sub
jected   alone  to  heat in close  vessels, it  yields a considerable pro
portion of the carbonate of ammonia, some prussic acid, and a
little fluid having an oily appearance ; while a portion of pulveru
 lent charcoal remains.       When given quantities were burnt with
 the oxide of copper, in the manner formerly described by me *,
 data were obtained, which appeared to show that one hundred
 parts consist of
    Hydrogen       4-54 corresponding with 2 atoms or proportions.

     The purpuric acid combines with the alkalies, alkaline earths,
  and metallic oxides. It is capable of expelling the carbonic acid
 from the alkaline carbonates, by the assistance of heat, and does
 not, as far as I have observed, combine with any other acid.
 These are circumstances sufficient, as Dr. Wollaston has observed,
 to distinguish it from an oxide, and to establish its character as
 an acid.     On the supposition then, that it be named the purpu
 ric acid, its compounds with different bases must be denominated
 purpurates: on some of the most remarkable of which I shall
  now proceed to make a few remarks.
     Purpurate of ammonia. This salt crystallizes in quadrangular
  prisms, which, when viewed by transmitted light, are transparent,
  and of a deep garnet red colour; but by reflected light, their two
  broadest opposite faces appear of a brilliant green, closely resem
  bling that of the wings of some of the beetle tribe, as for exam
  ple, of the Cetonia aurata, while their other two opposite faces
  appear of a dull reddish brown colour; or, if the light be very
  strong, slightly green.      This peculiarity seems to be possessed

28               Description   of an Acid Principle
in a greater or less degree by all the other alkaline, and perhaps
earthy salts ; and doubtless depends upon the structure of the
crystals.    The purpurate of ammonia is soluble in about 1500
parts of water at 60°, but in boiling water is much more soluble.
The solution is of a beautiful deep carmine, or rose red colour.
In pure alcohol and in ether, it is little if at all soluble. The
aqueous solution has a slightly sweetish taste, but no smell.          By
adding this aqueous solution of the purpurate of ammonia to
neutral saline solutions of other bases, most of the following pur-
purates were formed.
   Purpurate of potash.         When a saturated boiling solution of
the purpurate of ammonia is added to a solution of the bicar
bonate of potash, a dark brownish red precipitate takes place,
which is the purpurate of potash.         If,however, this salt be slowly
formed,    itmay    be obtained in
                                 a   crystalline form    and the crystals
                                                           ;
appear    to possess   the same  peculiarity  with respect to colour, as
those of the pupurate of ammonia above mentioned.                This salt
is much more soluble than the purpurate of ammonia.
   Purpurate of soda. This salt, when obtained                       by
                                                                the same
means as the purpurate of potash,         is of dark brick red colour.

ble than the purpurate of potash.             Three thousand times its
weight of water at 60° did not completely dissolve it. The co
lours of the solutions of this salt, and of potash, differ slightly
from one another, and also from that of the purpurate of am
monia but
       ;        it   isnot easy to describe these differences so as to
render them intelligible.
   Purpurate of lime. This salt, when obtained                 by

 more soluble, aiid the solution     is   of a beautiful reddish purple
colour.
   Purpurate      stronlian. This salt obtained as above, with the
                 of
nitrate of strontian, exists in the state of a dark brownish red
powder, with    aslight tinge of green.       seems to be more solu
                                                  It

   Purpurate      barytes.
                 of           Obtained as before described, with the
acetate of barytes, this salt assumes the form of          dark greena
powder,   not apparently differing  much   in  point of solubility from
the purpurate of strontian   ; and forming, like that salt,      purple   a

   Purpurate     of magnesia.    This      is very soluble salt.

               prepared from the Lithic or Uric Acid.             29
ammonia was added to a solution of alum, no perceptible change
took place immediately ; but after some time the colour of the
solution disappeared, and a small quantity of a white substance
separated, which was presumed to be the purpurate of alumina,
but it was not examined.
    Purpurate of gold. When a solution of the muriate of gold
is dropped into a solution of the purpurate of ammonia, the co
lour becomes yellowish, but no precipitation takes place. Hence,
this salt may be presumed to be very soluble.
    Purpurate of platina.     The muriate of platina changes the
colour of the purpurate of ammonia to a yellowish scarlet, but
produces no precipitation.
    Purpurate of silver. Solutions of the acetate or nitrate of
silver, dropped into a solution of the purpurate of ammonia,
produce a deep purple precipitate ; and the water is left nearly
 colourless.    Hence the purpurate of silver appears very in
 soluble.
     Purpurate of mercury.     A solution of the proto-nitrate of
 mercury produces, with the purpurate of ammonia, a beautiful
 reddish purple precipitate,    and the water is left nearly colour
 less.    A solution of the oxymuriate of mercury produces at first
 no change ; but after some time a copious light rose-coloured
 precipitate occurs, and the solution is left colourless.
     Purpurate of lead. A solution of the nitrate of lead, dropped
 in a solution of the purpurate of ammonia, renders it of a rose     '
 red colour; but no precipitation takes place.
     Purpurate of zinc. A solution of the acetate of zinc pro
  duces with the purpurate of ammonia a solution and precipitate
  of a beautiful gold yellow colour; and a most brilliant iridescent
  pellicle, in which green and yellow predominate, forms on the
  surface of the solution.
      Purpurate of tin. A solution of the muriate of tin changes
  the purpurate of ammonia to a scarlet; but this rapidly dis
  appears, and the solution becomes colourless. After a few hours,
  white pearly crystals form in abundance, which is the purpurate
  of tin.
      Purpurate of copper. A solution of the acetate or sulphate of
  copper changes the purpurate of ammonia to a bright yellowish
  green colour, but produces no precipitation.
      Purpurate of nickel.   The nitrate of nickel imparts to the
  purpurate of ammonia a greenish tinge, but produces no pre
   cipitation.
      Purpurate of cobalt.    The acetate of cobalt changes the co
  lour of the same salt to a pale scarlet. After some time, reddish
  granular crystals form, which are the purpurate of cobalt.
      Purpurate of iron. A solution of the green sulphate of iron

30        An Acid Principle from          the  Lit hie  or Uric Acid.
changes the colour of the purpurate of ammonia to yellowish
red, but produces no precipitate.
    Such is a very brief account of the purpurates, as far as I have
examined them. It may at first sight appear singular, that such
an insoluble acid should form so many soluble compounds ; but
when we reflect upon the subject, and consider what a very small
 quantity of the purpurate of ammonia is retained in solution by
water, and that this small quantity has been made the standard
of comparison in the above experiments, our surprise is consi
derably lessened, and we feel no difficulty in conceiving, that if
 the purpurates were compared with the nitrates, for example, the
former would be found by far the least soluble.
    From the very small quantities on which I have been obliged
to operate, and from other circumstances, I can offer but little
respecting the constitution of the purpurates.               Those which I
have attempted to analyse appear to be anhydrous, and to be
composed of two atoms of the acid, and one of the base ; and if
this be correct, the same composition may perhaps be referred
to most, if not all the compounds above mentioned.                   The pur
puric acid, however, appears capable of forming subsalts and su-
persaits, with most bases, many of which seem to be very little
soluble.
    With respect to the characteristic properties of the purpuric
acid, I apprehend it may be readily distinguished from all other
substances by the beautiful colours exhibited by its alkaline and
earthy salts, independently of its other properties, which are like
wise peculiar.
    The purpuric acid and its compounds probably constitute the
basis of many animal and vegetable colours.                 The well known
pink sediment, which generally appears in the urine of those
labouring under febrile affections, appears to owe its colour
chiefly to the purpurate of ammonia, and perhaps occasionally to
the purpurate of soda.           Some of the purpurates, as for example
that of lime, might be probably used as a paint. They might
be also used for dyeing, especially wool and other animal produc
tions*. On this part of the subject, however, as I have little
that is certain to offer, I do not deem it prudent to enter at
present.
   * I may here observe, that the solution of lithic acid in nitric acid has
the property of tingeing the skin and other animal substances in a very per
manent manner.       The colour does not, in general, appear till the substance
has been exposed to heat, or, what is more effective, to the light of the sun.
In the latter case, particularly, a deep purple tint soon makes its appearance,
and the substance tinged (more especially the skin) emits during the pro
cess a strong and peculiar smell, closely resembling that produced by the
nitrate of silver, when applied to the skin, and exposed to similar circum
stances.

Sir, — Having terminated the examination of the Speaker in
your    Magazine for December, and offered my opinion in that,
as  well as in the preceding numbers, on the apparent analogy
between our modern music and the character of speech, I have
now ultimately to present you with a narration of the different
experiments that I made for the intended improvement of the
Speaker, in the delivery of written language; — which process, I
have the pleasure to assure you, not only realized, to a certain
extent, my wishes, but also added (and very considerably too) to
the dignity and impressiveness of his ordinary conversation.
    Experience has every day shown us, that even the most easy
and graceful speakers in common life, are frequently incapable of
modulating any species of language, whether written or extem
poraneous, whose composition is much superior to that of their
politer colloquy.      The Speaker was similarly unfortunate.                  I
essayed his capability with a few passages of the
                                                             " Spirit of Pa
triotism" by Lord Bolingbroke.          He studied them — pointed out
the emphatical words, nay even Jell the subject ; and then re
peatedly attempted the delivery
                                     — but failed. With him, as with
the generality of our orators who aim at dignity, a wearisome
monotonous see-saw was substituted for that easy and expressive
modulation which the passages required.                Selections from our
Church Service were then delivered ; and in these his modulation
was more varied — but at the same time was altogether inappro
priate, and destitute of solemnity.         What was to be done ? Ex
periments were the object     —   and on these the solution of our ques
tion  "  Whether music is necessary to the orator" was eventually
to depend.
    The different experiments then to which I resorted shall con
stitute the subject    of my present and following letter ; and al
though it will appear that I have led the Speaker, by my inex
 perience in this novel walk, to one particularly ill-judged pro
 ceeding [solfaying the entire octave] ; yet as the candid declara
 tion of my error may in all likelihood be attended with some ad
vantage to others,    I  acknowledge it without reserve.

   When the execution of this solfay was tolerably attained, I in
dulged the Speaker in the playing, and attempting at the same
time to sing, a few favourite songs with which he was in some de
gree acquainted — an indulgence that I fear was injudicious, every
one of those songs, " God save the King" excepted, being, for
oratorical purpose, too extensive in compass and too wide in its
intervals.     Undecided, however^ at this period, as to the pro
priety or impropriety of this modulating exercise, I acquiesced in
the desire of the Speaker, and facilitated the acquirement of those
songs by the following very simple contrivance, which any gen
tleman unacquainted with music, who wishes to devote a leisure
hour to the cultivation of suitable productions, may instantly em
ploy.

    Prepare a thin slip of deal or any other timber, sufficiently long
to extend from any C of the piano to its double octave ; — and
about one inch and a half broad.             Glue to its bottom an equally
long slip [fourteen inches] of white paste-board, which shall pro
ject about one inch beyond the margin of the timber.                 On this
paste-board the musical letters of the double octave, exactly cor
responding with their local situation on the piano, are written in
the manner specified.          Then insert perpendicularly in the tim
ber, at x z, two wires, each about six or eight inches long, more
or less, bent backward at the upper extremities in the form of
hooks. The implement is now complete ; and while in use it is
suspended horizontally, by means of these hooks, from the top
of the piano — over, and almost in contact with the keys of any
 appropriate disdiapason.
    The extremities of the black keys of the piano must project
about 3-4ths of an inch beyond the margin of the paste-board.

    A suitable alteration of the characters of our lime-table, for
 prosodial equivalents, rendered this little plan still more satisfac
tory to the Speaker.         Instead of the usual minim crotchet, qua
 ver, and semiquaver,      I  substituted the following signs:
                                                                          For

     Now with respect to the application — it is hardly necessary to
                                                              should previously be
 say, that the songs intended for execution
 transcribed by a musical assistant              \.    In   the   doing of this, it is
 in my opinion preferable not to set               down    the    words of any sub
ject, but the representative letters of the tune; each of
                                                                               which
letters, by its own name, (with the exception of F pronounced
Fa,) should be played and sung distinctly and separately, without
regarding the slurs. The accurate execution of time, too, is quite
unnecessary; nor should the oratorical practitioner, while singing
 or playing, indulge himself in the attempt of heating it at all.
 As to the flats and sharps, each should be individually noted, at
 all times, for his convenience ; every unmarked letter being thus
 considered     as a  natural.
     The manner in which 1 set down for the Speaker, our own na
 tional air " God save the King," will sufficiently illustrate my
 design, case having been taken to give him the chastest concep
 tion of the time, by singing for him smoothly, and yet with as much
 variation of forte as I deemed expedient, this as well as every
 other tune which he attempted.
                              God save the King.

 34         *»  Whether Music is necessary to the Orator?
 as indispensably          connected with my theme, I have dwelt much
longer, than        I  could otherwise have desired.               Let us now turn to
 a more interesting topic.               What were the evident effects pro
 duced on the Speaker by solfaying the octave ; and accompany
ing with his voice, after much perseverance, some ten or a dozen
y-lselected tunes which he had fancied?— The reverse of improve
ment — alternate rant and feebleness without modulation ; some
 times striking even the octave itself by a sudden plunge — and at
other times exhibiting a puerile imbecility, by sinking beyond
the power of graceful recovery.                  This total' extinction of all" mo
dulation I was not indeed prepared to expect; but I must cer
tainly take to myself the credit of foreseeing that the articulation
of his short unemphatic syllables would sustain some injury. It
did so — and to that extent, that in the recital of poetry, a person
who had not known the subject must frequently have guessed at
the meaning by the context.
     For the present, then, I relinquished all hopes of improvement
by musical expedients.               Nothing short of a radical subversion of
all antecedent oratorical habits, and the substitution of new ha
bits in their stead, could to all appearance realize my ultimate
design — and hence, the delivery of ancient hexameter presented
itself to my view.
     My consideration now was — By what eligible means could such
delivery be accomplished, and especially by the Speaker?                             I re
collected     the    beneficial   result   predicted    to   practitioners    by Messrs.
de Port Royal, in their excellent Greek Grammar*, and to that
     * As I have mentioned this admirable Grammar, I shall call the reader's
attention to a remarkable fact which it records
                                                           — that in ancient practice the
 ru of TiTufufi.iv was the accented      or highest   note  of this word ; while the
although      a  lower    note,  was  (like   our  long   emphatic    syllables) sustained
longer and fuller than any other syllable of the word ; which grave and ma
jestic pronunciation has been called by Martian Capella, who lived in the
fifth century, " the very soul of sounds and ;he foundation              of harmony."
                                                                      " Dissonants of the
     Dionysius Thrax's definition of accents in general as
 enharmonic voice" is too vague for any rational deduction: he meant, in all
                                                         were spoken, not sung;, or, in
 probability, no more than that such syllables
 Italian phraseology, were syllabized          not  vocalized.     [For the interpretation
 of these   terms     see Phil. Magazine    for May   1818.]
     The author of ProsoUia Hatiomlis, who tortures every quotation without
                                                            i> tr,        which are used
  ceremony, would interpret the words ln^mnct
               T.  in  the  same  passage  —  as
                                                  " levelling to the grave j" and this
  by  Dion.
  for the mere justification of his own (Steele's) doctrine, that the grave ac
  cent was constituted by a downward slide!              If any obvious meaning can be
  attached to the quoted words, is it not that of levelling a syllable [depriving
  it of its upward slide] in the act of executing the grave?
      Obscurely as Dionysius Thrax may have written, he is perspicuity                 itself
  compared with our own Mr. Steele or Mr.
                                                       Walker, in their " Prosodia Ra-
  tionalis," and " Elements of Elocution."             However, it is very possible that
  D. Thrax understood his subject.
                                                                                      work

       to what   Extent, and how most readily attainable ?"               35
work I turned in expectation of materials.            It is an easy matter
in pronunciation," says Mons. Lancellot, to elevate any sylla
ble we please, and, if requisite, to make it slide nimbler; and on
the contrary, to depress another, and at the same time to give it,
if necessary, a slower motion. Wherefore, although several have
been of opinion that it would he advisable not to mark any ac
cents at all, yet I would not proceed to such an extremity; for,
by giving a double sound to the diphthongs so as to let the two
vowels be heard, though all in one breath, and uttering the long
vowels more slowly and more in the hollow of the mouth than
the short ones — and adding afterwards the difference of the ac
cents, which only consists in pushing the voice a little in order to
give it its elevation, [the syllables maked grave in the series of a
period should be merely sustained,r] we shall easily fall into that
proportion which is neither harsh nor difficult, hut contains a
sweetness acknowledged by all the ancients, and an utility which
will be quickly perceived by those who will give themselves the
trouble of a little application."
    This is the learned declaration of Messrs. de Port Royal with
regard to accent and quantity — particularly calculated, as the
writer informs us, for the meridian of France.             But as neither a
foreign pronunciation,        nor  even the original  sounds   of the Greek
and Roman letters are in any way auxiliary to the improvement
of our language, for the more dignified delivery of which a rude
approximation and no more towards accent, and a comparatively
close approximation          towards quantity are here intended— I
could not by any means consent to Mons. Lancellot's proposal.
And particularly with respect to accent; although I have no
doubt that Mons. L. himself did really find the execution as fa
cile as he describes ; yet, judging by my own experience, I must
 consider it altogether unattainable by the generality of even our
 musical countrymen. The very simple method, therefore, which
 I suggested to the Speaker, as a mmcular rather than a musical
 exercise — and which, in the outset of his practice, he perseve-
 ringly pursued *, was this.
                                  OF ACCENT.
     1st. That every acuted syllable should          be   pushed up — and
    * After sufficient
                       practice in this muscular exercise, the student must
 himself determine how far any occasional after-application may be useful ;
 and he may likewise, if desirous, converse rather frequently-for some days
 in his native tongue, so as to obtain his ordinary facility of utterance — of
 which (if his pristine habits have been sufficiently broken) he may fancy
 himself almost deprived. The Speaker on whom this accentual experiment
 was tried, became actually alarmed.     He imagined that he had lost his
 voice, or at least the usual power of connecting his words even in common
 colloquy.
                                       C2                                with

36        " Whether Music is necessary to the Orator?
with considerable exertion when such syllable is comparatively
jm-emphatic ; as for example, the first syllable in aei&s or the
third syllable of ouXo/xlvrjv.      If in a higher note too than the pre
 ceding syllables, which in the first instance is the viv of Mipiv,
 and in the second the Xo or Xofx. of ouXofis'vrjv, so much the better.
     2d.  That   every circumflexed       syllable be rounded (a charac
 ter appertaining to Forte and Piano rather than to Note or In
 flexion, although introductory to the latter); the Speaker holding
 always in recollection that this accent was particularly destined
 for the preservation of equability, which either undue elevation
or depression, abstractedly considered, must destroy.
     3d. That every syllable marked grave be prevented from un
 duly rising — viz. in such manner that the delivery of such syllable
 shall not interfere with the independence of the succeeding, as
the j^stf of ^wx*? with the a of ai"8». *
     4th. That every syllable preceding an accent, as the two first
of ouXo,u.£V>jvoiajK)7(ri and ^oAioSeij, be steadily and evenly delivered.
     5th. That the syllable immediately following an acuted ante
penult should, when emphatic, as the e- of aufa, be steadily
sustained (not suffered to ascend) 6n whatever part of the scale
it may happen most conveniently to be struck: but when com
paratively «w- emphatic as the third syllable gi of sXcugia — that
then every effort, if necessary, be employed to prevent it from
sinking too much below the acuted syllable.
     6th. That the final syllable of every word whose penult or
antepenult is acuted, as the h and vrjv in uetie and ouXoju.s'vrjv,         be
kept down.
     7th.   That the final syllable of every word whose penultimate
is circumflexed, as the 05 of /l^iXijoj, be delivered as inclination
or necessity may suggest.
     The accentual, or rather muscular exercise which was practised
by the Speaker being thus minutely detailed, I shall offer a few
words on his progress.          During this exercise, which, accompa
nied by that of quantity, lasted, with ordinary interruptions, for
three or four weeks, he was occasionally visited by my associate
— who, perceiving that certain syllables were at length habitu
ally slided upward, pointed out those syllables to his notice.
The capability of executing several other upward slides soon
followed ; and this was afterwards succeeded by the graceful exe-
    * The last syllable of       which should be grave, is printed as an acute
in most of our copies ; whereas the latter character, if attempted by an un
musical student, would involve the succeeding word A^maTf. Except when
succeeded by a Pause or by Enclitics, the grave accent should never (in the
case of exercise) be exchanged for an acute: and even before pauses (the
final one or Period excepted) the grave character may be optionally re
tained.
                                                                       cution

          to what Extent, and how most readily attainable P"                 37
 cution of an occasional        circumflex*, together with a more close
 approximation       to accentual      rules in general.      The downward
 slide too, after previous elevation, and when succeeded by a pause,
  (as for example on the cuv of 'Hgcvcav in the exordium of the Iliad,)
,was also found practicable : and, what may appear in some de
 gree extraordinary
                         — this slide was on such occasions not very
 ill-suited for manly recitation. Nevertheless it must he observed,
 that as energy increased, the downward slide of every description,
 even that characteristic portion attached to the circumflex itself,
 did in the same ratio disappear.               I shall next proceed to my
 suggestions    on
                           TIME     OR   QUANTITY    f.
     1st.   That the vowel of every syllable prosodially           long, whe
ther by nature or position,         should obtain what is termed by our
countrymen
                 " the long sound" — the Speaker particularly guard
ing, in the cases of position, against rendering the syllable too
long.
     2d. That the diphthong ov, as generally pronounced by us,
being     in many instances too short for the completion of long
quantity (as in the word owXofte'vijv) — should in such cases be
pronounced nearly as if written ouoo: that is — that the diph
thong ou itself should be wholly retained, but dexterously extended
by the annexation of a sound nearly similar to the vocal element
oo in poor; thus constituting a graceful triphthong, the execution
of which may almost instantly be attained, and which when pro
perly accomplished," shall be altogether undiscoverable in many
English words, even by the most delicate English ear J.
    * Moving up and down the stopper of a Pitch Pipe during the continu
ance of sound, is probably the best method, if the Experimenter has a tolera
ble ear, of learning the slide and circumflex.
    f  The bestgeneral rule for the execution of quantity, with those who are
unwilling to give themselves additional trouble, is this : That every syllable
whose quantity is long be rendered perceptibly longer than its contiguous
syllable whose quantity is short : And that no long syllable interposed be
tween two long ones shall be decidedly short. As to short syllables compared
with each other, the difference between these is immaterial, if the Greek or
Latin language be properly articulated.        Not so with our own language —
our particles and other muttered syllables give all the effect of long quan
tity to the contiguous articulated short ones.       Hence, in a great degree,
the impossibility, in English, of establishing any rules for quantity.
    X This artful management of our short vowels should be studied by our
Tragedians, as decidedly preferable to that puerile whine, which, until
 Mr. Kean appeared on our stage, was perpetually obtruded on our ears. I
have heard the last syllable of " accomplisrid
                                                  "
                                                    pronounced, in solemn reci
tation, fully as long as the first syllable of " Glory" — to the astonishment of
 every person present. It (the vowel) was originally practised thus, ieei, but
 was afterwards so artfully shaded that no one could discover the deception.
 The ordinary sound of short i was first given to the ear — ee instantaneously
followed — and the syllable or rather vowel then terminated as it began.
                                      C 3                                   3d*

38                  New experimental       Researches

 lt On   the elastic Force of Vapours, with new Formulae to de
    termine it at any Temperature; and a Review of those given
    by Dalton and Biot.
The      phanomena attending the conversion of liquids into elastic
fluids, were first accurately investigated by Dr. Black.          He ob
served in the rising of vapour, and melting of ice, a beautiful sy
stem of relations, connecting and modifying the grandest opera
tions of nature, while they were destined to afford new principles
for the advancement of the arts.          If it be the prerogative and
characteristic of genius, to discover in the most familiar, or, as
some would say, vulgar phenomena, that mystic chain of causa
tion, which had eluded all other eyes, unquestionably, the doc
trines of latent heat entitle their author to rank in the first class
of philosophers.
    Dr. Black directed his attention principally to the establish
ment of the general laws, which he placed on an immoveable

basis  ; leaving to his pupils, the subordinate task of investigating.
their individual applications.      Hence, the elastic fprces of the
vapours, arising from different bodies, at different temperatures,
seem to have occupied him very little, if at all. This subject was
examined, however, with great ability, by two of his most di
stinguished friends, Professor Robison and Mr. Watt.            The in
vestigations of the former were published in the Encyclopedia
Britannica, article Steam ; while we have still to regret our ig
norance of those executed by the latter philosopher, with pro
bably a more complete apparatus, andnc more extensive views. We
are indebted to him, indeed, for some curious observations qn ther
latent heat of steam, at different temperatures, which, make us
lament more, the want of those on the elastic forces themselves.
    Mr. Dalton, whose peculiar speculations on caloric and me
teorology led him to study the foimation and variable elasticity of
vapour with great attention, has since then favoured the world
with many excellent dissertations, and is now reckoned the first
authority on the subject.         Mr. Dalton's experiments on the
steam of water were carried no higher than its ordinary boiling
point ; but from the observed progression of its elastic force he
investigated a formula, and calculated from it a table for the
higher temperatures*.
    In the second number of the Journal Poly technique, M. Be-
tancourt, an eminent Spanish engineer, lqng resident at Paris,
published a set of experiments on the same subject, the results
of which differ from those of Mr. Dalton in many particulars,
but most remarkably in the higher part of the scale.
   Having had my mind often called to this important inquiry in
the course of my public lectures on the applications of Science to
the Arts, an apparatus of a very simple nature occurred to me,
about two years ago, by which I hoped to be able to determine,
with great precision, the elastic forces of vapours at any tempe
rature, from zero of Fahrenheit to a much higher degree of heat
than even Betancourt seems to have reached.             The experiments
were made soon after that time, but circumstances have till now
prevented me from arranging them for publication.
   With Betancourt's apparatus I am not acquainted, having seen
only the brief table of results, inserted in our systematical works
on chemistry.    Professor Robison 's consisted of a strong boiler
or digester, containing the water, and furnished with three small
apertures ; the first receiving the bulb of a thermometer, the se
cond covered with a safety-valve, and the third having a baro
meter tube attached.      At first I used a similar construction ; but
finding it hazardous, and somewhat unmanageable in the high
                * Manchester Memoirs,     vol. v. p. 563.
                                                                  heats-,

40                       New experimental            Researches
heats, and difficult to render air-tight in the lower temperatures,
I abandoned        it,
                    after some unsatisfactory trials.      At the low de
grees of heat, the vacant part of the barometer tube introduces
errors, since it. has not the temperature of the boiler            and the  ;
bulb of the barometer, used in high heats, occasions a similar
fallacy   in the determination of the true elasticities.
    Still, however,      was ingeniously conceived, and the results
                         it
furnish good approximations, creditable to the celebrated experi
menter*.       They agree nearly with those of Betancourt, being
                                               The method adopted
                                                                                          is by
obtained probably in         similar way.
                              a
Mr. Dalton          recommended
                   is                   an byelegant simplicity.                     It
merely    a common barometer, into which           little of the vapour-
                                                         a
giving liquid      introduced,. so as to moisten, and float above the
                   is
mercury.      The vapour which       generated, depresses more or less
                                      is
the barometric column.         Hence,           by
                                           subjecting the liquid to suc
cessive degrees of temperature, the corresponding depressions of
the barometer,- or elasticities of the vapour, are obtained.
    The only difficulty in this mode of operating,        to bring con
                                                              is                 a
siderable length of vertical tube to an uniform temperature.
    Mr. Dalton, well aware of this source of error, obviated           in a      it
great    measure,   by taking    series
                                  a     of  different  tubes,   decreasing
in their lengths with the increasing expansions of the vapour, and
concomitant descent of the mercurial column.             In several expe
riments conducted on this plan,          found
                                           I          scarcely possible to
                                                         it
obtain results rigidly corresponding with each other, when the
column of vapour, exposed in the barometer tube to the influence
of surrounding heat, exceeded two inches in length.
     M. Biot, in his system of physics recently published, while he
 adopts Mr. Dalton's results as the basis of his reasoning, treats
 fully of this difficulty, and suggests an ingenious means of avoid
 ing it. " We have had occasion several times to remark," says
 he, " that the temperature of mass of liquid which cools in the
                                      a
 air,is   not entirely the same at the bottom, as             at the top of
                                                              it   is
 the vessel    ;because the colder particles subside into the lower
 strata,   by the excess of their weight. Thus the temperature of
 the column of hot water, which surrounds the tube in the pre
  ceding experiment, cannot be rigorously uniform throughout its
 whole height.       We may endeavour to render            equal,
                                                              it       agi       by
  tating and mingling the different strata of which             composed
                                                                  it   is                  ;
  but this would be attended with no little difficulty.               would     It
  be better to have several thermometers suspended at different
  heights, in the body of the water, and to take the arithmetical
  mean of their indications Or otherwise, which would probably be
  more exact, we might employ a thermometer having               cylindrical
                                                                        a

                                                                then
be    necessary   that the column  of water should rise sufficiently
above   this vapour to allow the thermometer bulb to be equally
immersed,    or we must make on its indications the small correc
tion mentioned p. 59, in order to reduce the temperature of the
cylinder of mercury to the temperature of the reservoir.          The
employment      of  such  a  thermometer    may appear  at first sight
sufficiently  difficult, since it seems that the length of the cylin
drical reservoir must be very considerable, if the elastic force of
the vapour be        great*."
   He then proceeds to show how this difficulty may be obviated
(as indeed
              it had previously been by Mr. Dalton), by taking
barometer tubes successively shortened, as the force of the steam
is augmented by heat.       He proposes to use four, between the
freezing and   boiling points  of water, each being two decimeters,
or nearly 8 inches long, and the thermometer bulb having also
that length.     The plan which I imagined, as it completely ob
viates the source of errors arising from the large and variable
space occupied by the vapour, supersedes the necessity of employ
ing M. Biot's singular remedy.          It likewise avoids other com
plications, introduced   by  the  heating and consequent elongation
of the mercurial column itself attending all the other methods ;
and  scarcely capable of being exactly appreciated at high tempe
ratures with the apparatus of Professor Robison.
   The space over which the vapour extends in my instrument,
need never be greater than half an inch of the barometer tube,
against the side of which part the oblong bulb of a delicate ther
mometer rests, so as to indicate the true temperature.        And
though the liquid and incumbent vapour are thus always restricted
to the summit of the barometer tube, we can, notwithstanding,
measure its progressive range of elasticity, from zero of Fahren
heit to one hundred, or even two hundred, degrees above the
boiling point of water, from an elasticity of 0.07 of an inch, to
that capable of sustaining 14 feet, or even 36 of mercury. Fig.l
(PI. I. f) reprtsents   the construction    employed for tempe
ratures under and a little above the boiling point.     Fig. 2 and
3 are used for higher temperatures ; the last is the more con
venient of the two.    Each was suspended from a lofty window
ceiling, and placed in a truly vertical position by means of a
plumb     line.

42                  New experimental      Researches
 the primitive level below, in order to restore the quicksilver to
 its primitive level above, at I.     These two stations, or points of
 departure, are nicely defined by a ring of fine platinawire twist
 ed firmly around the tube.
    At the commencement of the experiment, after the liquid well
 freed from air has been let up, the quicksilver is made a tangent
 to the edge of the upper ring, by cautiously pouring mercury in
 a slender stream into the open leg of the syphon D. The level
 ring below is then carefully adjusted.
    From the mode of conducting my experiments, there remained
 always a quantity of liquid in contact with the vapour, a circum
 stance essential to accuracy in this research.               ,
    Suppose the temperature of the water or the oil in A to be;
32° F., as denoted by a delicate thermometer, or by the lique
 faction of ice ; communicate heat to the cylinder A, by means
 of two Argand flames, playing gently on its shoulder at each side.
 When the thermometer indicates 42°, modify the flames, or re
move tliem, so as to maintain an uniform temperature for a few
minutes.      A film or line of light will now be perceived between
the mercury and the ring at /, as is seen under the vernier of a
mountain barometer when it is raised a few feet off the ground.
Were the tube at I and L of equal area, or were the relation of
the. areas experimentally determined, then the rise of the quick
silver above L would be one half, or a known submultiple of the
total depression, equivalent to the additional elasticity of the
vapour at 42° above that at 32°.         Since the depressions, how
ever,   for 30 or  40 degrees in  this part of the scale are exceed
ingly small, one half of the quantity can scarcely be ascertained
with suitable precision, even after taking the above precautions.
And besides, the other sources of error, or at least embarrass
ment, from the inequalities of the tube, and from the lengthening
space occupied by the vapour, as the temperature ascends, ren
der this method of reduction very ineligible.
    By the other plan we avoid all these evils. For whatever ad
ditional elasticity we communicate to the vapour above /, it will
be faithfully represented and measured, by the mercurial column
which we must add over L, in order to overcome it, and restore
the quicksilver under I to its zero or initial level, when the pla
tina ring becomes once more a tangent to the mercury*.
    At E a piece of cork is fixed, between the parallel legs of the
syphon, to sustain    it, and to serve as  a point   by
                                                      which the whole
is   steadily suspended.
     For temperatures above the boiling point, the part of the sy-
     *
     Rings of other metals will not suit; for, their expansions being much
greater than that of glass, they become loose with the elevation of tem
perature.
                                                                    phon

          on some   of the leading Doctrines  of Caloric, &c.       43
phon under E is evidently superfluous, merely containing in its
two legs a useless weight of equipoised mercury.          Accordingly
for high heats, the apparatus fig. 2, or        3,  is employed, and
the same method of procedure is adopted.           The aperture at O,
fig. 3; admits the bulb of the thermometer, which rests as usual
on /". The recurved part of the tube is filled with mercury, and
then a little liquid is passed through it to the sealed end.     Heat
is now applied by an Argand flame to the bottom of C, which is
filled with oil or water, and the temperature is kept steadily at
212° for some minutes.          Then a few drops of quicksilver may
require to be added to D" till L" and       I"  be in the same hori
zontal plane.       The further conduct of the experiment differs
in no respect from what has been already described.         The liquid
in C is progressively heated,      and at each stage mercury is pro
gressively added over L" to restore the initial level, or volume at
     by equipoising the progressive elasticity.     The column above
L" being measured, represents the succession of elastic forces.
When this column is wished to extend very high, the verti
cal tube requires to be placed for support in the groove of a
long wooden prism.
    The height of the column in some of my experiments being
nearly 12 feet, it became necessary to employ a ladder to reach
 its top.    I found it to be convenient in this case, after observing
 that the column of vapour had attained its primitive magni
tude, to note down the temperature with the altitude of the co
 lumn ; then immediately        to pour in a measured quantity of
 mercury nearly equal to three vertical- inches, and to wait till the
slow progress of the heating again brought the vapour in equili
 bria with this new pressure, which at first had pushed the mer
 cury within the platina ring at           When the lower surface of
 the mercury was again a tangent to this ring, the temperature
  and altitude were both instantly observed.
    This mode of conducting the process will account for the ex
 perimental temperatures being very often odd and fractional
 numbers.       I present them to the public as they were recorded
 on the instant in that particular repetition of the experiment
 which I consider most entitled to confidence.          To trim and
 fashion the results into an orderly-looking series, would have
 been an easy task ; hut in my opinion this is a .species of decep
tion very injurious to the cause of science, and a deviation from
 the rigid truth of observation, which ought never to be made for
 any hypothesis.      We shall afterwards have ample opportunities
 of exposing the fallacy of such premature geometrical refine
 ments.
     The thermometers were constructed by Creighton, with his
 well-known nicety, and the divisions were read off with a lens,
                                                                     so

so   that TL- of a degree could be distinguished.        After bestowing
the   utmost  pains  in repeating  the  experiments during a period of
nearly two months, I found that the only way of removing the
little discrepancies, which crept in between contiguous measures,
was to adopt the astronomical plan of multiplying observations
and deducing truth from the mean.            It is essential to heat with
extreme slowness and circumspection, the vessels, A, B, C. One
repetition of the experiment occupies on an average 7 hours.

X.      On Specific Heat.       By Mr. Joseph Luckcock, of Bir
                                 mingham.
IVItjch     ingenuity and patient research have been displayed on
the subject of Specific Heat ; the thermometer, the meltings of
ice, and the times of cooling heated substances, have been the
basis of these calculations ; and imposing algebraical formulae
have been brought in aid, to give to them the air of demonstra
tions : the results, however, are unsatisfactory ; for in the attempts
to fix the natural zero, or point of absolute privation of heat,
some have placed it at 900° below the scale of Fahrenheit, whilst
others have depressed it to 1 1000D.
     This has principally arisen from a want of precision in our
ideas, from the want of a definition of heat.           My Essay on the
 atomical philosophy, published by Longman and Co., has been
 some time before the public ; wherein I have endeavoured to set
 this matter right.      I have identified the matter of heat with the
 electric fluid, that it is the element of fluidity, and to which I
 have given the name of Fluidium ; because of the meagreness of
 the terms applied to the subject ; such as heat of capacity, or
 specific heat; heatof transmission, or thermometric heat; creating
 a confusion of ideas in the mind, of hot heat and cold heat : the
 term Fluidium may well express latent heat, or heat of capacity,
 or specific heat ; and the term Heat will well express its trans
  mission by the means of chemical or electrical agency ; and in
 which sense I shall use the terms, considering Fluidium as a sub
  stance, and Heat as a quality.
      Sir H. Davy, speaking of the production of light and heat,
  very happily expresses himself
                                      4
                                        that it is a general result of the
  actions of any substances possessed of strong chemical attrac
  tions, or different electrical relations, and that it takes place in
  all cases in which an intense and violent motion can be conceived
  to be communicated to the corpuscles of bodies :' and he might
  have added that there can be no chemical attraction, no chemi
   cal action whatever, without electrical relations, without the aid
                                                                         of

  ponderable matter must be inert and dead.
      Mr. Dalton, after a train of reasoning, considers the proposi
  tion as demonstrated, ' that the specific heats of equal bulks of
  elastic fluids are directly as their specific gravities,' &c. The
   means before noticed for ascertaining the bulk of fluidium in cer
  tain bodies, appear only to show the degrees of heat, as a quality ;
  the result of the action of bodies operated upon ; whether it
  is the expulsion or attraction of fluidium, in its passage to or from
  those bodies, its force or velocity, or whether they are placed in
  the relative situation of an electrical machine, and become the
  mere carriers or conductors of fluidium ; and appear to have no
  thing whatever to do with its bulk or quantity.
      Suppose a substance could be found, whose specific gravity
 was such, that it should contain 1 cubic inch of solid ponderable
 matter, in a cubic foot or 1728 inches ; it is evident that the
 ponderable matter would be 1 inch, and the fluidium 1727
 inches ; and a substance of twice the density, or specific gravity,
 containing 2 cubic inches in a cubic foot, would contain of flu
 idium 1726 inches, &c.            To apply this proposition to the case,
 we have only to assume a zero, or a condensation of ponderable
 matter that shall be supposed to have its fluidium totally abs
 tracted ; and from which will result the following table :

Observations  on the Preparation of Extracts which are ob
  tained by the Method of StoBiCK, avd on the spirituous Ex
  tract of Fanilla.  By Dr. F. MaRabelli, Emeritus Professor
  in the University of Pavia, &c.*
In   pharmacy there is a number of important remedies derived
from the vegetable kingdom, and known by the generic name of
Extracts. Modern chemists have counted among the immediate
principles of vegetables, one, designated by the name of extractive
principle, having particular characters; but the class of medicines
known in pharmacy as extracts, although they contain this ex
tractive, principle are yet very compound bodies, having         mixed   it.
more or less     with  different other  substances.    The   exact and
perfect preparation of l these extracts has in all ages occupied the
attention of the zealous cultivators of pharmacy.         Hence      has       it
happened to these medicines, the same as to all others, that                         it
depends on the manner in which they are prepared, to account for
their greater or less efficacy   inthe diseases to which they are ap
plied and also, whether they are entirely inert, or even injurious.
     ;
To obtain these extracts in state fit for the various purposes to

which they are employed in medicine,              generally necessary,
                                                         it   is
besides the usual precautions for the preparations of all extracts,
to observe also another relative to the particular kind or species
of such remedies. In fact, how much does             assist in the pre
                                                                   it

the juice employed for the preparation of these extracts, parti
cularly those from poisonous plants, such as cicutp, aconitum,

                                     !
tables from which the first-mentioned extracts are made,is known
to be destitute of any medical virtue and hence, whenever, in the

as not to contain the smallest portion.of fecula, extracts will be
produced mixed more or less with an inert substance, which                          is   a
useless weight on the stomach     on the other hand, the celebrated
                                     :
Dr. Baron de Storck has demonstrated, that in the fecula incor
porated with the other abovementioned extracts resides in great              a
measure the activity of those remedies.      Under this impression

                                                                                     he

he wished always to prepare extracts   with the unpurified juice of
these plants, that   with juices evaporated to the due consistence
                            is,
without separating from them the fecula: this practice has been
generally adopted even                 by
                                  other physicians.
    But, on attentively observing the extracts obtained                 by
                                                                     this pro
cess,it   was discovered that the fecula existing in them undergoes
a  greater or less degree of carbonization during, their prepara
tion; and hence the extracts themselves experience                     marked
                                                                        a
alteration.       It was  imagined   to  avoid  this  inconvenience       pro   by
ceeding in the preparation of this kind of extracts in the following
manner, which consists in exposing the juiee of the vegetable from
which  it    was designed to make an extract, to              gentle heat, in
                                                                   a
collecting     a  part of the fecula   which    isseparated from the juice
by  means of the heat, in evaporating the juice purified in this
manner to the consistence almost of an extract and finally, at     ;
the end of the operation incorporating with                the fecula placed
                                                              it
apart.      In   a similar  manner    the abovementioned        extracts have
been prepared          Parnientier,
                       by             one of  the  more   recent  writers who
has diffused much light on the nature and preparation of the ex
tracts;     and this method has been followed in preference to that
of Storck by the best informed French and Italian therapeutists.
But this process runs the risk, that sometimes the first fecula
which can combine with the extract may suffer some alteration,
and this in consequence of the length of time necessary to re
duce the purified juice to         due consistence, especially where the
                                       a
quantity    is   considerable.    In  other respects,              is
                                                               unquestionable
                                                              it
that  by   this process we may succeed           incorporating the extracts
                                                in
with this fecula in its natural state, and consequently obtain
these extracts exempt from carbonization. But, opposed to this
advantage, the extracts prepared according to this process are
subject to another imperfection, since, in consequence of the fe
cula which       isfound in grumous state,
                                   a                 cannot be incorporated
                                                     it
either intimately or equally throughout the mass: the extracts
thus obtained contain more or less of small clots of a different
colour besides,
      :                it  difficult to reduce them to

  I   shall now proceed to notice the spirituous extract obtained
 from what    is commonly called vanilla, or the pod of an exotic ve
 getable called     byMurray Epidendrum vanilla.           Since 802 the
                                                                       1
 excellent Professor Carminati had urged me to subject this drug to
 a chemical analysis, particularly as was occupied in taking from
                                              I
it  a spirituous extract, he being desirous to add on the vanilla
 other observations to the numerous interesting medical experi
 ments which he had undertaken in that and the succeeding years.
 This obliges me to relate the preparation and the result of re            it
lative to the abovementioned spirituous extract, adding to them
my own reflections.        Iplaced six ounces of the pods of vanilla
 cut into very small pieces to digest four days in 108 ounces of
 alcohol. The tincture which extracted was of reddish-brown
                                     I                         a
 colour, and had the same aromatic taste as the vanilla.             After
 wards,I    subjected the extracted tincture to       careful distillation,
                                                           a
until had collected about two-thirds of the alcoholic liquor,which
     I
in taste and smell could scarcely be distinguished from pure al
cohol, although when mixed with water some very thin white
flakes were separated.       Iafterwards filtered the liquor which re
mained after the distillation;       ithad a deep reddish-brown co
lour, and in both taste and smell          resembled vanilla itself, the
                                          it
taste was even somewhat piquant.          Finally,    exposed this liquor
                                                        I
to a mild and     uniform  evaporation,       the by

           Maralelli   on the spirituous  Extract of Vanilla.         49
 468 grains of the spirituous extract of vanilla nearly equal to the
 first.   Thus, from six ounces of vanilla I had two ounces and
 -ff-ths, or ISO grains of a spirituous extract of vanilla, composed
 of a resinous extractive substance, containing a condensed quan
 tity of the aromatic principle of vanilla itself analogous to that
 of benzoin, very diffusible, and durable for a long time ; it con
 tained besides the benzoic acid peculiar to this drug; and in con
 sequence of these principles, such an extract retains the original
 intense odour and taste of the vanilla pods.
    These observations are not reconcileable with the remark of
 the erudite Murray speaking of the vanilla pod, in his apparatus
medicaminum,       vol. v. that with alcohol none of its fragrant
odour is extracted ; but he subjoins, with his usual ingenuous
ness, the assertion of Geoffroy, Traitc de Matiere Medic, torn. iii.
that by digestion with spirit of wine the taste and smell of
vanilla are extracted. Considering that from the physical charac
ters only of the vanilla pods, it is evident that they are capable
of exercising a considerable medical action sufficiently sensible
and energetic, it is inconceivable why they are so rarely employed
in medicine.      Murray in the above-mentioned work observes,
t' rarissime instar medicaminis adhibetur, licet multa
                                                               spondeat
in systemate nervoso refocillando."         Professor Canmnati and
Chevalier Borda make similar reflections; and the latter advises,
 instead of the aqueous infusion of vanilla, prescribed by some prac
titioners, that the spirituous infusion should always be preferred,
as more certainly active and advantageous.           The spirituous ex
tract of vanilla, therefore, as far as  I know,  has  not hitherto been
introduced, nor used in medicine, except by Professor Carminati;
who has used it with the most complete success.              I also have
seen this extract attended with the most happy effects in cases
of hypersthenic nervous affection, and have observed it evince an
action very similar to that of musk, exercising even a property
intensely stimulating and diffusible.      Hence I conclude, that the
extract of which I have been speaking should be considered with
out doubt as a most efficacious remedy, and of great value, in
many important cases of disease; and in the treatment of affluent
persons it unites the estimable advantage of being of a grateful
and pleasant taste to the greater part of patients.       It is also un
questionable that this extract merits the preference to vanilla
taken in substance, since it contains detached and in a small
compass the active principles of vanilla, and may be administered
more usefully in smaller doses, more conveniently and exactly
than the vanilla itself.
    Finally : considering the condensed quantity of the aromatic
principle of vanilla which this extract contains, its particular
nature, and the medicinal properties which it exercises on the

animal oeconomy, I conclude that it should occupy in the ve
getable kingdom the same place as musk does in the animal, to
which it has much analogy.            In addition to this, I shall add
another observation which accident enabled me to make in con
firmation of the preceding. In the year 1802, I happened to neg
lect a quantity of this extract left to settle in an earthen ves
sel, simply covered with a slip of paper which was even badly
adapted to the handle of the vessel.        After fourteen years, having
accidentally discovered this same extract, I was agreeably sur
prised to find that although forgotten so many years, and badly
covered, it was still in an excellent state, and the odour alone
which it exhaled was sufficient to convince any one that it was an
extract of vanilla.     I left it in the same state, and now after six
teen years it  has all the  fragrance of vanilla, almost the same as
when newly prepared.
 Osservazioni   per servire alia Storia di una Specie di Julus. —
   " Extract   of Observations to illustrate the History of a Species
   of Julus very common in the Plains of Pisa." By Dr. Paul
   Savi, Assistant Professor of Botany in the University of
    Pisa.
    The species of Julus called by the Italians Centogamle is ge
nerally viewed with some feelings of aversion, and hitherto has
been very little observed, although its powers of destruction are
very considerable.     The individuals of the species here described
vary in size according to their sex, the males being always less
than the females ; the greatest length of the former amounts to
two inches and 3-twelfths, that of the latter to three inches and
 10-twelfths, and thick in proportion.           These insects are of a
blackish brown colour on the upper side, on the under of a
whitish yellow : their heads are nearly of the same thickness as
their bodies, round, of a dark colour, somewhat deeper on the
 upper part ; in the middle is a small depression with two cavities
 or slight indentations; the anterior part advances like a kind of
upper lip, and is rounded in the middle.           The eyes are an ob
long    oval, manifestly composed        of  several  small hemispheric
black shining eyes.        The antennae are placed in two cavities
under the eyes, are clavated, a little longer than the head, dark
yellow, pubescent, and composed of seven articulations.              The
under lip is round, having its external or inferior superfice un
equal, with four protuberances, the two lateral and larger ones
terminating in two obtuse teeth.          The mandibles are composed
of three pieces ; the superior is round, deep yellow, very hard,
 dentated, and situated inside the mouth ; the middle piece is al
 most triangular, of a softer consistence and grayish yellow colour:
 the inferior or third piece is of a cubic figure ; the two latter are
                                                                  outside

     Savi's Illustration  of the History of a   Species of Julus.   51
outside    the mouth laterally on the under lip.     Behind the head
is  the first segment or ring, curved in the form of a saddle, broad
above and narrow below; it is about double the size of the other
rings, and is called the corselet; from the corselet to the extremity
of the body there are many rings, the number of which varies ac
cording to the sex and age ; in males the most mature there are
 about 59, in females 64 ; these rings are of a horny nature, clear,
smooth and incomplete, having the figure of two flat rings or
hoops inchased into each other, broader on the upper side and
narrower on the under; their juncture has a button-like appear
ance ; the breadth of each ring is about one-third its diameter;
the colour of these rings is black in the part superior, yellowish
white in the inferior, at the edges of a dirty yellow and shining ;
the first two rings and the last three are without the button-like
structure, to which in all the others the legs are attached ; the
sixth ring in the male is also without this kind of button, having
in its place the organs of generation;       the body of the insect is
terminated by two kind of hemispheres which are covered with
a yellowish down.        The legs of this insect vary in number like
the rings, and generally consist of four situated on the narrow
part of the button; they are of a whitish yellow, diaphanous, co
vered with a thin down, sufficiently long, composed of six pieces
almost equal, and terminated by a nail of a darker colour ; their
length is equal to two-thirds of- the diameter of the insect's
body. The second ring in both male and female is without legs,
and in the female between this ring and the first are situated the
generative organs.       The following is the best technical descrip
 tion which the author can give of this insect, which is different
from the Julus terrestris and    J.  sahdosus, and approaches nearer
 to the   J, fuscus  and  J. Indus,  although both the latter are Ori
 ental animals ; hence he calls it    J. communis.
 Julus segmentis supra nigris, subtus albidis, pedibus unicolo-
     ribus albidis, antennis capili subcequalibus, albo-cinereis, ano-
     obtuso, ultimo segmento obtuse acuminalo.
     The Professor, although he kept a number of these animals in
his house, has never been able to observe them deposit their eggs,,
they being sterile with him ; but in the body of females he ob
served eggs nearly mature, roundish, of a dirty yellow colour, and
the diameter of half a line ; the females deposit an immense
number of eggs in the earth, on stones or wood according to the
nature of the places which they inhabit, the eggs occupying the
whole length of their bodies.       The youngest Julus which he has
seen was two lines long and one-third thick, of a clear yellow,
and semi-transparent.        Immense numbers are found under rot
ten wood ; their growth is not very rapid, increasing consecu
tively their rings and legs, changing successively tneir skins.
                                   D   2                          This

     litis      mutation of skin resembles more that of the crustaceous
 1/Ariitnals. than the insects, differing from the former in this, that
        every mutation brings a slight increase to the young Julus, and
  '
       the successive mutations continue till it has finished growing.
       Previous to casting the bid skin, which opens at the Head above
 "the eyes, the animal walks out of it in the new. The Julus is
                               '
        drowsy or torpid, aW does not eat, a state which continues
 /"twenty-four hours. It appears that, like theCnistucea, the young
        Julus eats its old skin. In one of those ejected covers Dr. Savi
"
      'found all' the parts quite distinct, as the eyes, antennae, rings,
        legs, and, what is more extraordinary, the intestinal canal and
        the superficies of the trachea. This .lulus also, like the crabs and
      'shrimps, can reproduce its legs and antennae if destroyed. The
:
        stigmata and trachea were discovered at the junctures of the legs
        with the body, and immediately within the button-like juncture
r of the rings. The circumstance which led to this discovery of the
    '
        position of the stigmata and trachea was in consequence of im
        mersing these insects in Olive oil to ascertain the duration of
        their life ; when little air bubbles immediately appeared at the
        junction of every pair of legs.              Hence it appears that the stig-
' mata and trachea pass along the under side of the msect in its
         whole length. Lastly, this animal is furnished with a foetid liquor,
 '. which it can secrete occasionally,                  and which has some singular
        properties.      It was     Well    known     that   these insects have a very

       "Offensive smell, but it remained for Dr. Savi to discover its cause.

nor nitrate of silver poured into the vinous solution of this liquor
produced any precipitate ; a little oxalic acid produced a slight
whiteness* At a moderate degree of heat it evaporates without
changing its colour, yielding yellowish vapours.        In uniting the
vapours of this liquor with those of nitrie acid, no white smoke
appeared. Put the aqueous infusion into a small portion of
spirit of « ine in which an infusion of those bladders had been         nd
made, and no whitening or precipitate occurs, but a very rapid
vertical movement takes place as if the vesicles had become ani
mated.        It is probable that the spirit of wine which enters Into
these vesicles, in uniting with the water, gives them this motion.
On examining another species of Julus, the author found it pos
sessed of a foetid liquor having a milky white colour, and of an
insupportable smell.

     Dr. Spurzheim      is preparing for the press a Treatise on the
Education of Youth, founded on the Discrimination of individual
Character by the Form of the Head.
     One of the most useful observations made by Dr. Spurzheim
in his late physiological work on the Brain, is that on the na
ture of Hydrocephalus, and of the state of the brain in that dis
                                                                       -
ease. This is a subject in a great measure unconnected with
his Craniology ; it is one which is duly appreciated by most ana
tomists, as having been handled by him ; and the anatomists of          •
various countries who have written on the same disorder, have
borrowed their most useful observations from his elaborate dis
 sections.     The, anatomical reader is particularly referred to
 " Spurzheim's Reply to the Reviewers," recently printed at
 Edinburgh, and to the Physiog. Syst. article Hydrocephalus.
     A small tract has been circulated lately respecting the oppo
 sition which the Doctrine of the Brain met with in England,
 wherein the author represents the opposition as proceeding on
 the selfish principle of envy, and the fear of personal observation ;
 and makes the shrewd observation, that " those persons who are
 most strenuous against Spurzheim's doctrine are conscious of not
 having the most intellectual heads."                 ,
     An amusing Work has just issued from the press, from the
 pen of Thomas Bewick of Newcastle, the celebrated wood-
 engraver.      It is a collection of ancient fables principally from

 Nov. 5, 1818.    The      Croonian Lecture was read by Sir E. Home.
 It had for its subject the conversion of Pus into granulations of
 new Flesh.     According to Sir Everard, granulations which appear
 to consist of a congeries of tortuous vessels, are formed in a way
 similar to the blood-vessels, as described by him in a former pa
 per*.     Pus, when first secreted, is a transparent fluid, a pellicle
 of which, in this state, covers the little prominences of the gra
 nulations.     Under this pellicle particles of air (supposed to be
 carbonic acid) are exuded, upon which vessels seem to be
 moulded, which soon become distended with the red blood.
 They chiefly lie horizontally, and minute red spots are also visi
 ble, supposed to be the terminations of vessels running in a perpen
 dicular direction.      This paper was accompanied with drawings.
     Nov. 12. A paper " On the Laws which regulate the Absorp
 tion   of polarized Light by doubly refracting Crystals, " by Dr.
 Brewster, was read.         He was led to this investigation by ob
  serving the phaenomena presented by the acetate of copper when
  exposed to polarized light.          The paper treats first of the ab
  sorption of polarized light by crystals of one axis ; and, secondly,
  by crystals having more than one ; and concludes with remarks
  on the effects of heat in modifying        the absorption of polarized
  light by crystallized bodies.       Heat does not, as is     generally
  posed, produce     the  pink  colour  of some topazes, but discharges
  the yellowish colouring matter of one medium, Jeaving the pink
  colouring matter of another, and which originally existed in it.
  The author seems to be of opinion, from his experiments, that the
  colouring particles of crystals are confined to different media, and
  are not dispersed indiscriminately        throughout their mass, as is
   commonly believed.

    The sittings on the 19th and 26th were suspended on account
 of the death of   the Queen.    On the 30th, being St. Andrew's
 day, the annual election of the President, Council, and other
 Officers took place ; and the Copley Medal was presented to
 Robert Seppings, Esq. for his papers relative to improvements in
 ship-building; accompanied with a suitable speech by the vene
 rable Presiddent.
    Dec. 10. A paper entitled "Observations on the Decompo
sition of Starch by the Action of Air and \yater at common Tem
 peratures," by M. Theodore de Saussure, was commenced. The
 reading was continued on
    Dec. 17. Some starch boiled in water was, for two years, ex
 posed to a temperature between 6S° and 77° under a glass jar.
About one-third of it was, at the end of that time, found con
verted iiito saccharine matter, presenting all the properties of
 sugar made from starch by the action of sulphuric acid.        The
 author also found, on examination, that a species of gum was
formed, like that obtained by roasting starch, and another sub
stance which he denominates amidine, which remained insoluble
in water and acids, and gave a' blue colour with iodine.      When
air is present, during the exposure, water and carbonic acid gas
are given off in considerable quantities, and charcoal is deposited :
when air is excluded no water is formed, only a little carbonic
acid and hydrogen are liberated, and no carbon is deposited.
The author could not determine whether the quantity of sugar
produced was effected by the presence or absence of air.
   A paper by C. Bahbage was also read at this meeting, On the
Solution of certain Problems relating to Games of Chance, cal
culated to show that some questions supposed, hitherto, to defy
analytical investigation may be subjected to algebraic reasoning.
   Dec. 2-1.   A paper by Capt. Duff, R.N. was read, On the Pre
vention of the Dry Rot in Timber. The author proposed that
experiments should be instituted, to ascertain whether the water
of peat mosses employed to impregnate sound timber, and also
timber partially decayed by dry-rot, would save the one, and pre
vent the further ravages of the dry-rot in the other.       He rests
his suggestion on the well-known fact, that wood submerged in
peat-moss is preserved sound for ages.

      " The subject of these experiments was a middle-sized, athle
 tic, and extremely muscular man, about thirty years of age.           He
was suspended from the gallows nearly an hour, and made ho
 convulsive struggle after lie dropped ; while a thief executed along
 with him, was violently agitated for a considerable time.             He
 was brought to the anatomical theatre of our University in about
 ten minutes after he was cut down.            His faOe had a perfectlv
 natural aspect^ being neither livid nor tumefied ; and there was
 no, dislocation of his neck.
     " Dr. Jeffrav, the distinguished Professor of Anatomy, having
 on the preceding day requested me to perform the galvanic ex
 periments, I sent to his theatre with this view, next morning, my'
 minor Voltaic battery, consisting of 270 pairs of four-inch plates,
 with: wires of communication,       and pointed metallic rods with in
 sulating handles, for the more commodious application of the
 electric power.      About five minutes before the police officers
 arrived   with  the  body, the battery .was charged with a dilute
nitro-sulphuric acid, which speedily brought it into a state of in*
tense action.       The dissections were skilfully executed by Mr,
Marshall, under the superintendance of the Professor.            ..< : -
    :".EScp.. 1;e— rA large incision was made into the nape of the
 neck, , close below the occiput.       The posterior half of the atlas
 vertebra was then removed by bone forceps, when the spinal
 marrow was brought into view.              A considerable incision was
at the same time made in the left hip, through the great gluteal
 muscle, so as to bring the sciatic nerve into sight; and a small
 cut was .made in the heel.        From neither of these did any blood
flow. "; The . pointed rod connected with one end of the battery
was now placed in contact with the spinal marrow, while the other
rod was applied to the sciatic nerve.         Every muscle of the body
was immediately agitated with convulsive movements, resembling
a violent shuddering from cold.          The left side was most power
fully convulsed at each renewal of the electric contact.       On mOv.-
ing the second rod from the hip to the heel, the knee being pre
viously bent, the leg was thrown out with such violence as nearly
to overturn one of the assistants, who in vain attempted to pre
vent its extension,

58                      Galvanic Experiments performed
made by the side of the sterno-cleido-mastoideus.                Since this
nerve is distributed to the diaphragm, and since it communicates
with the heart through the eighth pair, it was expected, by
transmitting the galvanic power along            it,   that the respiratory
process would be renewed.          Accordingly, small incision having
                                                 a
been made under the cartilage of the seventh rib, the point of
the one insulating rod was brought into contact with the great
head of the diaphragm, while the other point was applied to the
phrenic nerve in the neck.            This muscle, the main agent of re
spiration,   was   instantly contracted, but with less force than was
expected.       Satisfied, from ample experience on the living body,

           leaving the extreme communicating             rods in close con

truly wonderful.        Full, nay-, laborious breathing instantly com
menced.       The chest heaved, and fell; the belly was protruded,
and again collapsed, with the relaxing and retiring diaphragm.
This process was continued, without interruption, as long as            I
continued the electric discharges.
     " In the judgement of many scientific gentlemen who wit
nessed the scene, this respiratory experiment was perhaps the
most striking ever made with            aphilosophical apparatus.     Letit
also be remembered, that for full half an hour before this period,
the body had been well nigh drained of its blood, and the spinal
marrow severely lacerated.             No pulsation could be perceived
 meanwhile at the heart or wrist            ;butit  may be supposed that,
 but for the evacuation of the blood, — the essential stimulus of
 that organ, — this phenomenon might also have occurred.

mitting the electric power from the spinal marrow to the ulnar
nerve, as it passes by the internal condyle at the elbow; the fin
gers now moved nimbly, like those of a violin performer ; an
assistant, who tried to close the fist, found the hand to open
forcibly, in spite of his efforts.   When the one rod was applied
to a slight incision in the tip of the fore-finger, the fist being
previously clenched, that finger extended instantly; and from the
convulsive agitation of the 'arm, he seemed to point to the dif
ferent spectators, some of whom thought he had come to life."
   An hour was spent in these experiments, when an experiment
was made with a view of determining the quan:ity of residual air
in the lungs ; after the detail of which, the author proceeds as
follows :

electrifying the phrenic nerve (which may be done without any
dangerous incision,) there       is probability that life might have

Dr. Philip,     appears that the action of the diaphragm and lungs

heart and great vessels, subservient to the circulation of the

tricity hitherto  pursued  in  such cases, are, in my humble appre
hension, very defective.      No advantage, we perceive,   is likely to
accrue from passing electric discharges across the chest, di

 developed      by

we should transmit along the channel of the nerves, that substi
tute for nervous influence, or that power which may perchance
 awaken its dormant faculties.      Then, indeed, fair hopes may be

     " I would, however, beg leave to suggest another nervous chan
nel, which I conceive td be a still readier and more powerful one,
to the action of the heart arid lungs than the phrenic nerve. If a
longitudinal incision be rriade, as is frequently done for aneurism,
through the integuthe.nts of the neck at the outer edge of the
sternd-mttstoitieus muscle, about half-way between the clavicle
and angle of the lower jaw ; then on turning over the edge of
this muscle, we- bring into view the throbbing carotid, on the
outside of which, the par vagum, and great sympathetic nerve,
lie together hi one sheath.       Here, therefore, they may both be
 directly   touched  and pressed by a blunt metallic conductor. These
 nerves communicate directly, or indirectly, with the.phrenic; and
 the superficial nerve of the heart is sent off from the sympathetic. ,
      " Should, however, the phrenic nerve be taken, that of the left ,
 side is the preferable of the two.    From the position of the heart,
 thei left. phrenic differs a little in its course from the right.      It
 passes    over the pericardium,   covering  the  apex of the  heart,-:
     *' While the point of one metallic conductor is
                                                          applied to the
 nervous cords above described, the other knob ought to be firrnly
 pressed against the side of the person, immediately under the
 cartilage of the seventh rib.     The skin should be moistened with
 a solution of common salt, or, what is better, a hot saturated so
 lution of sal-ammoniac, by which means the electric energy will
  be more effectually conveyed through the cuticle, so as to com
     "
  plete the Voltaic chain.
         To lay bare the nerves above described, requires, as I have
  stated, no formidable incision, nor does it demand more anato
  mical skillj Or surgical dexterity, than every practitioner of the
  healing art ought to possess. We should always bear in mind, that
  the subject of experiment is at least insensible to pairi; and that
  like- is at stake, perhaps, irrecoverably gone.      And assuredly, if
  we place the risque and difficulty of the operations, in competi
  tion with the blessingsdf and glorv consequent on success, they
  will weigh as nothing, with the intelligent and humane. It is
  possible, indeed, that two small brass knobs, covered with cloth
  moistened with solution of sal-ammoniac, pressed above and be
  low, on the place of the nerve, and the diaphragmatic region,
  may suffice, without any surgical operation.          It may first be
   tried:

           In a paper read some months ago before this Society, the au
        thor states, that on opening a paper in which he had some time
        before put some sulphate of zinc, he found in its place a yellowish-
        brown substance entangled in a fine silky thread.     On searching
        the bottom of the box in which this little parcel with others had
        been deposited, he found a portion of the lost sulphate and a large
        spider.qf the species Aranea scenica.    To ascertain whether the
        spider was the thief, the author closed him up in the box with
        two ounces of.the sulphate, of which it was found, at the end of
        ten weeks, he had eaten a considerable quantity,   .At the time
        the paper was read, the insect seemed in perfect health, having
        in .about six months    eaten nearly four ounces of the sulphate.
        Other metallic salts — sulphates, muriates, and nitrates, were also
        offered to the -spider, but he would not touch them, even when
        denied his favourite salt.   From some experiments made on JLhe
        yellow. powder,, the author concludes that the sulphate, pf zinc had
        been deprived of part of its acid in passing through the spider.

bent.     Cadmium, when exposed to heat, is changed into an
orange-yellow oxide, not volatile, and easily reduced again to the
metallic state: it gives no colour to borax ; dissolves readily in

   A neutral solution of the nitrate gives, with prussiate of potash,
a white precipitate ; with hydrosulphuret of ammonia, a fine
bright yellow precipitate ; with a solution of sulphuretted hy

son when heated, but becomes yellow again on cooling; with
oxalate of ammonia, a white precipitate insoluble in. oxalic acid.

    Cadmium is readily precipitated by zinc from its solution in
hydrochloric acid, in the metallic state ; but not so readily from
nitric acid.
    When ammonia is employed to precipitate the oxide o& cad
mium from its solution in an acid, the precipitate is redissolved
by excess of the alkali : potash does not dissolve the oxide, but
throws it down from its solution in ammonia — furnishing a ready
method of separating it from zinc, and of ascertaining its pre
sence when accompanied by a largr portion of that metal, as in
blende.
    "Dissolve the mineral supposed to contain cadmium, in ni
tric acid ; to the filtered solution add ammonia in excess, to
throw down the oxides of iron, and redisSolve those of zinc and
cadmium : pure hydrate of potash will then separate the latter,
which, when redissolved in diluted hydrochloric acid, will afford
the characteristic bright yellow precipitate on the addition of sul
phuretted hydrogen." — By this process Mr. Children separated
the metal from a brown lamellar blende from Freyberg, furnished
to him by Mr. Heuland.
                              LAMPIC ACID.
    In the course of his experiments on the nature and properties
of flame, Sir Humphry Davy made known the curious fact, that
certain combustible bodies may be made to combine: with oxy
gen at comparatively low temperatures.          Sir Humphry's disco
very    was  applied  to  the  keeping a  platinum wire in a state of
ignition by means of a lamp with spirit of wine — the result by
this slow combustion is a peculiar acid. To obtain this in larger
 quantities, J. F. Daniel, esq. employed the head of an alembic
properly supported, to the beak of which he applied a receiver,
 and under its larger opening placed a small lamp, with a coil of
platinum wire.       In the account which he has published in the
 Journal of Science (No. XII.) he states that a little nicety is re
 quisite in trimming the lamp, and in placing it so as to obtain the
                                                                  best

best results.  Too much of the cotton must not be exposed, to
much of the liquid will evaporate unchanged and adulterate the
product ; nor must the lamp be placed too high in the alembic,
which would extinguish            it,
                            or so low as to allow the vapour or
be dissipated. With this lamp Mr. Daniel made several experi
ments.
     The first vapours which he collected were those from spirit of
wine. The condensed liquid was slightly acid, and of pleasant            a
pungent smell.        In the sequel the acid was proved to be the
same as that produced from ether largely diluted with water and
spirit of wine.
    Spirit of turpentine gave liquid of light amber colour, and
                                    a              a
agreeable odour, which,           by
                                 evaporation of the superfluous spirit,
gave     aresin of  a deep amber colour, very fragrant, and quite
free from turpentine, inflammable, and yielding much charcoal.                        It
is  soluble in spirits of wine, from which      precipitates in
                                                    it             white     a
 state    byadding  water  to the solution.
     His experiments with camphor did not succeed to his satisfac
 tion but with ether he succeeded perfectly, and obtained above
      ;
 a pint and    a half of the condensed vapour, consisting principally
 of the new acid, to which, as pledging no hypothetical views of
 its composition, and merely serving to recall to the mind " its
 mode of formation, and its connexion with that brilliant chain
 of investigation which        the boast of science and the triumph
                              is

66                          Lampic Acid.
    Lampate of ammonia is of a brown colour, volatile, evaporates
 below 212°, and gives a very disagreeable odour, like that of
 burning animal matter.
    Lampate of lime is very deliquescent, of a caustic bitter taste.
     Lampate of magnesia has a sweetish astringent taste, some
 thing like that of sulphate of iron.
    All these salts are inflammable, and burn with flame, leaving
 a large residue of charcoal.
    But, according to the author, the most curious and distin
 guishing characters of the lampic acid arise from its action upon
 the metallic oxides.
    Lampate of gold. When some of it is poured into a solu
 tion of muriate of gold, the metal in a few hours is precipitated
 in the metallic form, and a thin film of gold attaches itself to the
 glass.   The reduction is almost instantaneous if the mixture be
 heated.    If the lampate of potash or of soda be poured into the
 same solution, a light yellow precipitate is thrown down, decom
 posable by a very low heat, and which then gives a beautiful pre
 cipitation of the metal.
    Lampate of platinum.         The colour of muriate of platinum is
 much heightened by the acid, but the muriate is not reduced.
 Lampate of potash and of ammonia both precipitate from it a
yellow very crystalline salt, not reducible separately by a boiling
 heat; but when mixed, an instant precipitation of metallic pla
tinum ensues, which coats the tube : the liquid becomes colour
less.
    Lampate of silver.       The acid added to nitrate of silver gives
a precipitation, which at first is of a purplish brown colour — an
effect resulting from the action of the metallic particles on the
rays of light.     A portion of the metal lines the tube, and part
falls to the bottom.     It is easily fused by the blowpipe. The so
lution of oxide of silver on the lampic acid is of a sea green co
lour. A heat below 212° decomposes           it, and precipitates the
metal.
    Lampate of mercury. When the acid          is  added toa   solution
of nitrate of mercury,  a   metallic shower takes place, and globules
of mercury accumulate at the bottom of the vessel.              It acts
readily on the red oxide of mercury, yielding       a white bulky salt
sparingly soluble in water.        Dried on blotting-paper it  sponta
neously decomposes     in
                        a    few  days, yielding globules of mercury.
Lampate of mercury exposed to heat in a retort, a violent efferve
scence takes place  ;   metallic globules immediately begin to col
lect, and dense fumes are given off, which when condensed are
pure lampic acid.
    Lampate of copper. Black oxide of copper dissolved in the
acid gives a   liquid of beautiful blue, which

                          lead.
gives a white easily-crystallizable salt, of a sweetish taste, which
hurns with flame, and glows like a coal.
   Neither the acid nor its salts have any action on the oxide of
tin or on salts of tin. The acid has no action on the red oxide,
on the sulphate, or on the nitrate of iron ; but the lampates of
potash and ammonia, separately, turn the nitrate to a beautiful
blood-red colour, without precipitate, and joined throw down
the red oxide.

to  it,and    large quantity of carbon

   By analysis the acid appears to Mr. Daniel to be composed
of 40-7 of carbon, 7-7 of hydrogen, 1-6 of oxygen and hydrogen,
                                                     5
in the proportions which form water=l00. — This analysis                                       is
interesting, as affording an exception to the general rule laid down
by the French chemists, that in all vegetable acids the oxygen                                  is
to the hydrogen in proportion greater than
                              a                    necessary to formis
water.
   Mr. Daniel suggests that the singular property of the lampic
acid and its salts, of precipitating the metals, may hereafter be
usefully applied to the plating of delicate works with gold and
platinum.

Tjase   anew metal (lithium), we are indebted to            pupil of Ber-   a

it consists of oxygen 43-5 and lithium 56,5. Sir Humphry Davy
was, we believe, the first who reduced it to the metallic state.
Lithium bears a strong resemblance to sodium.
    By some recent experiments of Mr. Children *, 177 grains of
the sulphate contain lithia 57 ; sulphuric acid 12 ; and lithia it

                              PLATINUM.
   A  new method of purifying platinum has been discovered by the
Marquis of Ridolfi, calculated to diminish the price of that most
useful metal.    His process is as follows: Separate, mechanically,
froni crude platina, such foreign bodies as can be detected by
the eye: wash the crude metal in dilute muriatic acid; fuse it
with four times its weight of lead, and throw the melted alloy
into cold water. Then pulverize it ; mix with it an equal weight
of sulphur ; throw the mixture into a Hessian crucible previously
heated to whiteness ; put a cover on the crucible, and keep it at
a red heat for ten minutes.        When cold a brilliant metallic but
ton, containing platinum, lead and sulphur, will be found under
the scoriae.   Add a little more lead, and fuse the alloy again.
The sulphur now separates itself with the scoriae, and an alloy of
platinum and lead is found at the bottom.           Heat this button to
whiteness,   and   in  this  state hammer    it on  an anvil with a hot
hammer, and the lead will be pressed out by the hammering.
Platinum thus prepared is malleable and ductile like the best pla
tinum prepared by more expensive processes ; and is of the speci
fic gravity of 22-630. It is probable that this platinum still
contains a minute portion of lead, being heavier than pure pla
tinum ; but it will be found equally applicable to most purposes,
and especially for vessels for the makers of sulphuric acid.
                               WOODANIUM.
    M. Lampadius gives      the  above name to a new metal which he
 has discovered in some English ores ; but the characters of the
ores are not mentioned in the letter which he has addressed to
 Dr. Miiller on this subject.
                HYDROGURETTED         CARBONIC OXIDE.
    Dr. Thomson has discovered a new compound inflammable gas
 to which he has given the above name.           Its specific gravity is
 913, that of common air being 1. It is not absorbed nor altered
by water.     It burns with a deep-blue flame, and detonates when
 mixed with oxygen, and fired. It is a compound of oxygen, hy
drogen and carbon ; and Dr. Thomson considers it as being three
volumes of carbonic oxide, and one of hydrogen, condensed by
 combination into three volumes.

in a mortar, and then boiled in a large quantity of water, the-
liqnor acquires a green colour before it begins to boil ; when it
becomes brown, and a precipitate is formed, which, though treated
with acids, does not resume its blue colour.   The liquid forms a
fine Prussian blue when a solution of sulphate of iron mixed with
an equal volume of solution of chlorine is added to it. When
evaporated no gluey substance is deposited ; but, if evaporated
to a small volume, on being suffered to cool, it yields a glutinous
matter, Which dries in the open air, and may again be easily dis
solved in water.    The starch, therefore, has changed its nattoe
and been converted into a kind of gum.
                                STARCH-SUGAR.
  The process of M. Kirehoff for converting the amylaceous fe-
cula (starch) into sugar by means of sulphuric acid, has already
                                                                a is,
received some useful applications ; but the most useful      doubt
less, the conversion of this sugar into beer. Mingled in     proper
quantity of water, set in fermentation and hopp'd according to
the method of brewers, this syrup furnishes      beer which
                                                     a        light,

brisk, strong, and of an agreeable savour. This refreshing and
healthy beverage may be prepared any where;         requires neither

make  it  in their dwellings.  Already two manufacturers are em
ployed in preparing       in quantities, and they estimate that
                           it                                                it

                                  RED SNOW.
   Our readers must all have heard of the red snow stated to have
been found      by
                 our northern navigators lying upon the surface of
snow lodged in ravines, for upwards of 100 miles along the coast
of Baffin's Bay. Quantities were collected and brought home in
bottles that

                  the colouring substance and the water of the snow
on which   it lay, with other substances apparently foreign, which
had been taken up with the snow. Dr.Thomson has published the
result of experiments made upon small quantities of the colouring
substance.    On opening a phial of what had been collected, an
offensive smell, similar to that of putrid sea weed, or excrement,
was perceptible.    After some time the colouring matter subsided,
leaving  the water  colourless.  Examined with magnifier a       ap     it
peared to consist of minute particles, somewhat globular, of a
brownish-red colour.       This, separated on a filter and dried,

parted with its red colour, which was succeeded by a yellowish -
green tint.    The smell now somewhat resembled that of train oil.
Even    when   heat was used it was found insoluble in alcohol,
 caustic potash, and other menstrua that were tried.       Nitric acid
assisted by heat changed the colour to green ; and if concen
 trated and in excess, decomposed it entirely.      When the excess
of acid was driven off by heat, a greenish-yellow residuum was
obtained, without any trace of the pink hue afforded by lithic
acid under similar circumstances.       Chlorine instantly bleached
it. Exposed alone to heat, it gave a dense white inflammable
smoke. The charcoal left, yielded by incineration a minute quan
tity of ashes, presenting
                          " traces of lime, iron and silex, the last
two of which were probably extraneous."       It is evident then that
this substance does not owe any of its properties to lithic acid,
or oxide of iron ; but, on the contrary, seems to be an organized
substance ; and the most probable opinion respecting its nature
is,  that
        it   is"a production of some cryptogamous plant." It
seems probable, from the red colour disappearing                  by

                            AMERICAN   SEA SERPENT.
  T. Say, esq. of Philadelphia, in a letter received from him by
Dr. Leach, announces that a Captain Rich had fitted out an ex
pedition purposely to take this leviathan, of which so much has
been said in the newspapers and even in some scientific jour
nals. He succeeded in " fastening his harpoon in what was
acknowledged by all the crew to be the veritable sea serpent
 (and which several of them had previously seen and made oath
to) : but when drawn from the water, and full within the sphere
of their vision, it proved that this serpent, which fear had loomed
to the gigantic length of 100 feet, was no other than a harmless
Tunny (Scombrus Thynnus) nine or ten feet long!"
                            SINGULAR PHENOMENON.
    Some time last week, Mr. John Lacock of this place, a gen
tleman of undoubted integrity and veracity, while splitting a
cedar-tree into quarters, for posts, discovered in the heart of it
a living toad about half-grown. The cavity in which it was lodged
was but merely large enough to contain            it,
                                               and there was not
even the smallest communication from the cavity for the circula
tion of any air the tree was perfectly solid, and from its size is,
                    ;
supposed to be of twenty or thirty years growth.   As soon as the
tree was quartered, the toad instantly crawled from its confine
ment, and still lives. — From the Westchester fN. York) Herald,

   Sir, — You will   no doubt permit me to recall your attention to
a letter signed " Unus," which appeared in your Magazine for
last April, referring me to a   " Pocket Companion" for harmonic
information. Not imagining that any writer, though anonymous,
could venture intentionally to mislead me, or rather to mislead
the public, when the means of almost instantaneous detection
were in every man's power, I ordered that work from London ;
and having lately perused it throughout, I can safely take upon
me to assure you, that, so far from containing any harmonic in
formation, it can hardly be said to glance at this question at all.
   In future, therefore, I shall take no notice of any anonymous
production which, (like that of " Unus" ) does not in itself im
mediately bear upon my subject.
                   I am, sir, your most obedient servant,

   Sir, — I      beg to hand to you for insertion in your useful Ma
gazine the quantity of rain and evaporation at Croydon in Sur
rey during the year 1818 ; and it will be found by comparison
with the last year's gauge that the quantity of rain fallen this
year is less by full one inch than what fell in 1817, the quantity
in 1817 being 25-849 inches, and this year only 24-252 inches;
and (what is remarkable) that although this year has been so fine,
we had more rain by one inch and seven-tenths during the
progress of the year to the beginning of October, than we had in
the same period of 1817 ; the comparative dryness of October
and December last past, having reduced the quantity on the whole
year to the result above stated.
   The evaporation you will perceive has this year been greater
than the last by nearly five inches, the evaporation in 1817 be
ing 22-227 inches, and in 1818, 27"064 inches.
                                   I remain, sir, your obedient servant,
                                                            Henry Lawson.
   P. S. The gauges are placed four feet from                    the ground, as
 described in your Magazine for January 1818.

XIV.      On the Question " Whether Music is necessary to the
    Orator, — to what Extent, and how most readily attainable?"
    By Henry Upjngton, Esq.
                            [Continued   from p. 38.]
           j
                               To   Mr. Tilkck.
                                               Blair's Hill, Cork, Jan. 7, 1819.
Sir, —     AN   the  early part    of this  letter    I laid before the reader
an easy and expeditious method for executing the notes of any
simple tune on the piano, by means of an oblong board.                        The
mensuration of the time of syllables in the ratio of two to one is
equally facile, nothing more being necessary than a pendulum,
which, set in motion by the hand, shall perform a sufficient num
ber of vibrations for the occasion* . That employed by the Speaker
consisted of an ivory ball one inch in diameter, with a delicate
brass hook, suspended by a silken thread, from a similar hook
                          n
inserted in the under part of the projecting arm of a wooden,
stand — thus,
                          r      t
                               ,   which, during operation, was fastened
on a table by an iron clamp ; and was used in the following
manner for the cultivation of hexameter f.
    The first exercise, and certainly the easiest, was that of Tityre
tu patulce down to sylvas. A fifteen-inch string, which is nearly
equivalent to a three-quarter-second             pendulum J, regulated the
measure of the long syllable.           Ti consequently occupied one vi
bration, tyre § the succeeding one, tu the third, patuthe fourth,
                                                                              and
   *
      Notwithstanding tlie very great difference in the extent of jaung.as the
power ot" this pendulum declines; yet the perceptible difference in the re
lative time of its vibrations, while any tolerable motion exists, is too trivial
to affect our measurement.
   t The experimenter will immediately discover by his pendulum, that al
though the stately and solemn recitation of an articulate language like the
Greek or Roman, rather constantly admits the full ratio of two to one in its
syllables; yet that in the ordinary reading of such languages, he must con
tent himself for the most part with the ratio of three to two. The mensu
ration of this latter, and indeed of any other ratio than that, of two to one
— is, for the purposes of speech, not only useless but absurd.
   J This pendulum is too long for ordinary poetry, and consequently a great
deal too long for prose.     The judicious practitioner must feel this observa
tion as he proceeds.
   § For comparing the short syllables of any given dactyl with each other,
the pendulum must be shortened in the ratio of four to one; i.e. if the long
syllable shall occupy the vibration of a sixteen-'mch pendulum — the short

 32        " Whether     Music is necessary to the Orator, —
 and so on throughout the passage; the Speaker steadilv perse
 vering until this slow movement was thus thoroughly commanded
  [not read, nor stops regarded] in a manly firm tone without
 whine or drawl, and his ear habituated to proportion. The pas
 sage was then recited, with occasional reference to the pendu
 lum : and such licenses were taken for the convenience of de
 livery as were most approved by my associate — even the ratio of
 — ° u
 3, 2, 2, being in many cases preferred by him to that of the per-
                — o u           — —
 feet dactyl 4, 2, 2; and 3, 3 for the spondee instead of 4, 4.
     Were I not unwilling to surpass the reasonable limits of this
 paper, I should submit to the inspection of the reader, not only
 this passage, but also that of Arma virumque cano, and jV/jjviv
 auh Ssa, as recited by the Speaker.             The last however having
 been more approved than the others, for its chasteness in the
 distribution of forte or emphatic syllables, by the musical gen
 tlemen before whom it was delivered, must be considered most
worthy our present attention : I give it therefore in its exact form *
 (as nearly as our ears could determine), with the relative propor
 tions set down in figures over the respective syllables.             In place
too of encumbering this passage with rests, I have set down not
all the actual pauses (which are more or less optional), but the
ordinary prominent ones which are represented by grammatical
stops; viz. the small, the intermediate, and the great, leaving it
to the good understanding of the reader to supply those minor
pauses which the necessary separation of words or the momentary
                                                                         relief
syllable [half the length of the long one] must require a pendulum of four
inches — no more. In adjusting these pendulums, the centre of the ball
must be considered as one extremity, the summit of the string as the other.
This practice of equalizing the short syllables with each other is very useful,
and is worthy the attention of most professional musicians. The Speaker's
oratorical pendulum afforded me no small share of amusement in putting
some excellent musicians to the test.      I suspended from the ceiling of a
room, a long string to which was attached an ivory ball similar to that be
longing to the pendulum. Now, by the lengthening or shortening of either
string  I regulated different ratios or rendered them irregular, at pleasure ;
and setting both strings at the same time in motion, I found, to a demon
stration, that in place of measuring a ratio of three to two, (or, as some
pretend, a ratio of thirty-two to one) — scarcely an individual could be
found who was capable of the accurate mensuration of even a duple ratio !
Is not this an irrefragable proof that the principal requisite for the preser
vation of modern time (as I observed in a former paper) is merely the ha
bitual crowding of the integral parts within the given boundary or bar, and
not the relative proportions of those integral parts themselves?
    * The author of Prosodiu Rativnulis has amused himself in his own scien
tific way by setting this passage in musical time, ratio of syllables six to
one, — for the edification of Homer !      If no other reason could be found
                                                                            for

 relief of the organs may require.                        Barring, or even delineating
 the rhythmical boundaries in this sublime and wonderfully im
 pressive language was found too troublesome:                                 Although regular
in the extreme, it is yet governed, when properly read, by such
peculiar proportions, and so perpetually syncopated, that no mu
 sician whom I consulted could succeed in the operation*.

 for the rejection of Mr. Steele's metrical doctrine, than the monjtrous un
meaning pauses which are introduced for the creation and preservation of
tars, these pauses alone should seal its condemnation.                        To exhibit this sub

the usual comma, semicolon, and colon j as pauses in their stead, let us apply
 them to the following          passage which for the instruction of the English

       A pendulum, it is true, if used as on a former occasion, might have
 determined this useless question.
    t  The syllables >» and a, when independently considered, are equal to
 each   other; while the previousisyllable M. is equivalent to both : and yet
 this Dactyl cannot, in technical phrase, be barred or beat,m consequence of
                        [much less than the usual time of a comma] which, in well
 a minute interval
 executed delivery, is interposed between the mi and x.                       The same observa
 tion will hold good with many other Dactyls and Spondees throughout the
  passage: pauses are the principal agents of syncopution.

    Having thus circumstantially .set down, as well as could be as
certained, the exact quantity in which this beautiful exordium
was delivered by the Speaker, I could willingly indulge the reader
with an equally exact notation of the intervals : but in truth, the
modulating babitsofthe Speaker, although wonderfully improved
by his muscular exercise, were yet, at this period, so very un
chaste, ranting even in octaves, that I deemed it an inexpedient
task; especially as his ear, notwithstanding his improvement, was
still too incorrect to enable him to retrace any given number of his
own intervals with sufficient accuracy for the purpose. However,
as a desirable appendage to the foregoing representation of quan
tity, I shall anticipate my intended subject by the notation of
those intervals in which this truly majestic passage was after
wards delivered.        And as this passage so set, shall terminate my
letter, I have to request of the intelligent reader, especially if a
musical amateur, that he may not too hastily condemn either the
apparent limitation of the measure, or the apparent limitation of
the intervals.     Musicians, — and, without any meditated offence,
musicians perhaps equally scientific as the reader himself, — have
wondered at the effect ; nor did they previously believe it possi
ble that so much sublimity, and at the same time so considerable
a portion of melody, could be realized by language.

    The apparatus employed in obtaining these results, has the
 peculiar advantage over all others, that the mercurial column                                                                                          is

SS                         New experimental Researches
being 105 inches, the latter 102. Being perfectly convinced, by
repeating the experiments in different circumstances, that Mr.
Dalton's ratio of progression, though apparently accommodated
to the intervals between 32° and 212°, could not serve for the
higher ranges*, I endeavoured to discover a simple rule of more
general application.      It is above 212°, indeed, that for the pur
poses of art, the knowledge of the force of steam is required.
   I first tried the differential method, so useful for determining
the distant links of a concatenated series.
   Without doing much violence to the above numbers, the forces
corresponding to 100°, 110°, 120°, 130°, 140°, and 150°, may
be written in a series of which the 5th order of differences =0.
Then if df d" df" d'r d", represent the first terms, in the first,
second, third, fourth, and fifth order of differences, the 7<th term
of the series is
     a+ „_1         .   a, + «-i •—             d , +          „-\   .— g—      •—   •«    +
   In the above series for steam, d'= 0-65, <i"=0-19, d!" —
0 04, div=0-01, dv=0 . a= 1-92.
   Example 1st. To determine the 8th term in the series, or
the elastic force at 8 x 10, above 90°, (the first term 100° being
included) or at 170°.

  * Dr. Young remarks on Dalton's ratio,                      " It is certain that this cannot
be the law of nature, since about 394° the elasticity would become uniform,
and then decrease,     the law be true."— Young's Natural Philosophy, 4to,

   By the same equation we find the 20th term or for 290° to be
124*28, while experiment gives 120-15, showing a difference of
4'i8 inches; At a higher point the error becomes greater. We
here see that a geometrical series may coincide apparently through
a considerable Tange with experiment, and yet be inaccurate when
further extended.
   Dissatisfied, therefore, with this approximation, I prosecuted
the inquiry, and had the happiness to discover a very simple and
beautiful ratio, which wiil actually apply through an extensive
scale of temperature, and is incomparably easier in practice than
the preceding rule.    The elastic force at 212° = 30 inches being
divided by 1.23, will give the force for 10° below; this quotient
divided by 1-24, will give that for 10° lower; and so on pro
gressively.    To obtain the forces above 212°, we have merely to
multiply '30 by the ratio 1-23, for the force at 222° ; this pro-
dactiby 1'22 for that at 232°, and thus for each successive in
terval of 10° above the boiling point.
   Thus 30 x 1-23 = F222„       30 x 123 x 1-22=          using F
to denote the force at any temperature w, according to the nota
tion of Laplace.
   By departing from the point of 210° F., we shal! obtain re
sults equally accurate, but more convenient for comparison with
the experimental table.   The following numbers exhibit the cor
respondence of this ratio with actual observation.

    The rule on which the preceding table is formed, may be ex
 pressed in a manner better fitted to give directly the elastic force
 corresponding to any given temperature moderately distant from
 212°.     It becomes also more accurate.
    Let r — the mean ratio between 210° and the given tempera
 ture; n — the number of terms (each of 10°) distant from 210°;
 F= the elastic force of steam in inches of mercury.
    Then, Log. of F = Log. 28-9+ ?i. Log. r; the positive sign
 being used above, the negative below 210°.
    Or by common arithmetic, multiply or divide 28-9, according
 as the temperature is above or below 210°, by the mean ratio,
involved to a power denoted by the number of terms. The pro
duct or quotient is the tension required.
    Example 1st. The temperature is 140°. What is the corre
sponding elasticity of the vapour from water heated to that point?

   Such a correspondence, therefore, of observation with the cal
                                                                     culated

dilated results, shows that we have found a rule of perfect ac
curacy for all purposes of engineering, &c.         If I am asked
whether this formula coincides at every link with the chain of
nature, I freely acknowledge, that I do not imagine it strictly so
to do.   But still it affords approximations such, that within mo
derate limits, I cannot tell whether to place more confidence in
them, or in those found by experiment.      It has moreover the rare
advantage     of being extremely simple, and level to the capacity
of all practical men.
   In Biot'.s excellent work  above quoted, where many of the
hitherto vague disquisitions of  physical science have been hap
pily brought within the pale of geometry, this celebrated philo
sopher has deduced, from Mr. Dalton's experiments on the force
of steam, a general formula for determining its elasticity at any
temperature.
   In investigating this formula, he represents the decrease of the
logarithms of the elastic forces by a series of terms of the form
an + ln1 + cn,i ale being constant coefficients.
           Thus, Log. Fn =Log. 30 + an + In1 + cnK
   It is unnecessary to employ powers of n higher than the cube,
because their coefficients would be insensible, as the calculation
will show.    To determine the coefficients a b c, he makes use of
the elastic forces, observed at the temperatures on the centigrade
scale of 100°, 75°, 50°, and 25°; whence result these con
ditions,
                      71   =    0
                      n = 25
                      n=50
                      77 = 75
   Substituting these conditions in the above general formula, and
bearing in mind that the logarithm of a fraction is equal to the
logarithm of the numerator minus the logarithm of the denomi
nator, we have the three following equations of conditions.
          —0 42596S7= 25. a + 625 b + 15625 c.
          -0-9330519= 50. a + 2500 b + 125000 c.
          -1-5180799= 75. a + 5625 b + 421875 c.
   Doubling the first, and subtracting it from the second, a dis
appears ; trebling        it,
                        and subtracting     from the third,
                                              it               also
                                                                 a
disappears.    Then dividing each of the resulting equations         by
the coefficient of    we have
                      b,
                    -0-000064S9l60=           + 75   c.

  Subtracting the one of these from the other,  will disappear;
                                                      b
and dividing   it    by
                  the coefficient of   we shall have c.
                                          c,              Next,
                                                                     by

92                  New experimental     Researches
by substituting the value of c in one of these equations, we get b.
Lastly, putting b and c in one of the two first equations, we have
a. Thus we find
                        a.=-0-01537419550
                        b =-000006742735
                        c = +0-00000003381
    Whence the whole formula Log. Fn = Log. 30 + an + bnx + cn1
is completely determined, and may serve for calculating Fn, re
lative to any proposed value of n.
    If we make, for example, w=100, we shall have the elastic
force at 100 degrees below the boiling point, or at the tempera
ture of melting ice.  We thus obtain
      Log. F„ = l-4771213-2-1778831 = -0-7007618.
   Or employing negative indices in order to make use of the or
dinary logarithmic tables,
               Log. Fn = 1-2992382, whence
                        Fn =0-19917 inches ; and observation
                    gives us 0-200.
   The error is obviously insensible ; and we may adopt, oays
M. Biot, our formula as representing the experiments of Mr.
Dalton.     To introduce the Fahrenheit degrees into the formula,
calling themy., and counting from 212°, we have ^f=n; and
substituting this value of n in the preceding formula, we obtain
                       a =-0-00854121972
                        b=  -0-00002081091
                        c =+0-00000000580,
whence Log.     F^.   =1-4771213 + o/.+ bf +          cp,

     130° centigr. gives by  M. P. force of vapour =1907-07 millimetres; of

                     New experimental Researches
  that we ought to receive such geometrical representations witn
 great caution.      M. Biot, indeed; with a candour becoming his
 genius,    admits these formulae to be merely tentative approxima
  tions.    The high reputation of this philosopher, and the geo
 metrical skill here displayed, might have led the scientific world
 to repose confidence in his formula, within the limits of 55{ de
 grees centigrade = 100 Fahr.        It was therefore entitled to a de
  liberate examination.
      It is curious to observe that my very simple formula, Log.
 F = Log. 28-9 + n. Log. r, gives good approximations, through
 a much more extensive range, than the elaborate formula of the
 distinguished French geometer.        Even when carried so high as
 the 310th degree of Fahr., we have
         Log. 28-9 + n. log. r = 2-19S10=L, F,00; hence
         F100= 157-8.
     Experiment gives 161-3, a difference of only 3{ inches at this
 prodigious elasticity; which may be deemed altogether unim-             •
 portant in practice.
     Biot's formula gives a result 31 inches, and Mr. Dalton's 40
 in defect.
     Of Professor Robison's higher numbers, it is merely necessary
 to examine the successive differences for every 10° above 212°.
 These are 7'2, 8-9, 10-2, 11-9, 13-5, 13-8, 11-8, and the se
cond differences are + 1-7 + 1-3+ W + l'6+0-3— 2-0.
     Such striking irregularities cannot exist in the progression of
nature.      Betancourt's are liable to a similar censure.     We may
find indeed small discrepancies in the best observations at such
temperatures.
§ II. Experiments       to determine   the elastic Forces of the Va

     The determination of the elasticities of these vapours    is a very
interesting problem      in chemical   philosophy.    It  may possibly
unfold the law which connects temperature and elastic energy,
and- it may furnish likewise some useful applications.

                          Remarks on the preceding Table.
  The ether of the shops        as prepared      the eminent London  by
apothecaries   boils    generally  at  112°;  but  when washed with
water,  or redistilled,    boils  at
                                 it  104° or 105°.     may    rectifi         It         by
cation, however, be made to boil at a still lower temperature.
   Concerning the boiling point of oil of turpentine, curious (may
we say ridiculous) discrepancies exist in our systems of chemistry.
Dr. Murray, for example, in the table of the scale of temperature
                                                                     at

96               AW    experimental   Researches
at the end of the first volume of his valuable System, last edition,
places the boiling pointof oil of turpentine at 560°.        Mr. Dal-
ton, vol. i. p. 39, of his new System of Chemical Philosophy,
says :
        " Several authors have it that oil of turpentine boils at 560°.
 I do not know how the mistake originated, but it boils below
212°, like the rest, of the essential oils."   I made with much care
several experiments on this point, previous to ascertaining the
force of its vapour, and found its boiling point to be about 316°.
When recently distilled, however, it will boil at 305°.          Did it
boil below, or even at 212°, as Mr. Dalton asserts, then, long
before the included portion in the above experiments had reached
the 304th degree, it would have acquired such an elasticity as to
support a high column of mercury, instead of being barely in
equilibria with the atmospheric pressure.
    Plunge a phial half filled with fresh oil of turpentine into a
metal cup containing any fixed oil.          Heat the cup gradually.
 It will be found that, at the temperature of 316°, the oil remains
in steady ebullition, as indicated by a thermometer suspended in
the centre of the phial.     Prior to this, even at 212°, some small
bubbles will be evolved, principally owing to the moisture di
spersed in the pores of the oil, from the water originally mixed
with the crude turpentine in its distillation. If the heat be very
rapidly thrown in, while the upper surface of the oil of turpen
tine has the area only of a one or two ounce phial, it is possible
to heat it to 360° or 370°, in apparent contradiction to the theory
of latent heat ; for when a liquid boils in an open vessel, ac
cording to Dr. Black, its temperature should remain stationary.
The true cause of this phaenomenon is developed towards the
conclusion of this memoir.       The specific caloric of the vapour of
the volatile oil is so small, compared to that of water, that the
heat may readily he quicker introduced than the boiling process
can abstract it.    Concerning the boiling point of this oil, I have
since inquired of a manufacturer ; and he states its boiling point
at 320°.     Essential oil of rosemary, when kept for some time,
boils at 270° ; recent oil at 212°.        To assign the cause of this
difference, is foreign to our present object.
    The vapour of ether follows nearly the same rate of expansion
as water, if we start from their respective boiling points.        This
was observed also in Mr. Dalton's experiments ; and from this
single analogy, chiefly, he laid down the general law,     "   that the
variation in the force of vapour from all liquids is the same for
the same variation of temperature, reckoning from vapour of any
given force."                            f
    My experiments    on oil of  turpentine and petroleum show the
fallacy of this generalization, if we reckon the common thermo-
metric scale a tolerably correct index of temperature ; but         if,
                                                                 with

            on some of the leading Doctrines        of Caloric,    £s"e.       97
 with    Mr. Dalton,     we consider our thermometric           scale, as very
 erroneous,    then   either itself  is an exception   to its  own   law, ta use
 this paradoxical, though just expression.            In  consequence       of his
 peculiar thermometric ideas,         Mr.  Dalton  has  abrogated      the  above
 law, which he had himself framed ; though it               is  curious    to ob
 serve, in some respectable treatises on chemistry, both hypo
 theses detailed, without indicating their mutual incompatibility.
 M.Biot, likewise, far from imagining that the law had been re
 pealed for eight or nine years, proposes to judge by its provisions
 of the total elastic force of every vapour at 100° centigrade, to
 serve as the basis of the determination of their respective specific
 gravities at that temperature *.
     My experiments show that from 105° to 167°.5 Fahrenheit,
 ether trebles the tension of its vapour, as water also does from
 212° to 2720,7 ; both containing nearly, but by no means ex
 actly, equal intervals of the Fahrenheit graduation.                 According
 to Mr. Dalton's corrected scale of temperature,               we   have
         212° Fah. = 212° Dalton.            105° Fah.= 119° Dalton.
         273    F.     =256-4 D.            167 5  F.     =176       D.
  real   interval      = 44-4 by Dalton. By Dalton 57 = the real
  interval of temperature.
     Thus we see, that while the interval for trebling the tension of
  ethereal vapour is 57°, that for aqueous yapour is only 44*.4;
  quantities that are to each other nearly as 100 : 80.                   Hence,
  according    to  this, eminent   chemist,   ether  must     take   for trebling
  the force of its vapour a fifth part more heat than water does.
      I hope presently to be able to adduce satisfactory experimental
 mevidence, that our thermometric indications are not at all so un
  equable as Mr. Dalton conceives.
      Meanwhile, in examining closely the table of the vapour of
  ether, a beautiful analogy with that of water presented itself.
  The series of ratios representing the progression of the latter be
  ing lowered a single step, will accurately fit the former.                At 30
  inches of elasticity 1-23 was our initial number for aqueous va
  pour; for ethereal, it becomes 1-22; increasing or diminishing
  by unity each time in the second decimal figure, according- as we
  descend or ascend by intervals of 10° of the Fahrenheit scale.
     The following is a general view of the results.

    The numbers derived from calculation give a surprising ac
cordance with those observed in the lower range.               In the upper
range, the correspondence is as good as the delicacy of the ex
periments at such temperatures could permit us to expect.                The
experiments     have  been   presented    without  modification.       I must
own, that when first the above perfect coincidence appeared, it
gave me no small pleasure, as it led me to suppose that I had
discovered the hidden chain of nature.
    In treating of the vapour of alcohol, Mr. Dalton considers it
as irregular in the progress of its elastic force by heat, owing to
its not being a homogeneous liquid. He suspects " that the
elastic force in this case is a mixture of aqueous and alcoholic
vapour."      I cannot see the cogency of this argument; for, if
the separate bodies have a regular progression, the mixture ought
not surely to be anomalous.           I believe, however, that if the ex
periments    were  made    with  due   accuracy, alcohol would be found
as methodical in the elastic march of its vapour as other bodies.
The following table will afford satisfactory proofs of the justness
of these views. For absolute alcohol, the progression is pro
bably as simple as that of the preceding vapours.              But for alco
hol, sp. gr. 0-813, which though highly rectified contains not a
little water, we should expect it to result from a composition or
modification of ratios.       After some search on this principle, I
accordingly found it.       Starting from the boiling point 174°, or,
for the convenience of comparison with the table, from the de
 cade 170°, we move not by a unit, as before, but by a unit and
 a tenth j or the initial ratio 1-26 is affected at each step or term

   Oil of turpentine is regulated by the constant ratio 1-122,
which converts any elastic force into that 10° above or below,
multiplying as usual in the former, and dividing in the latter case.
For petroleum the ratio is 1-14 ; it is also constant.

100                 New experimental Researches
   The whole of the preceding research is closely interwoven
with a question of the first importance in chemical philosophy;
mwhat are the relative portions of temperature denoted by the
graduations of our thermometric scale ? Mr. Dalton regards the
progressive elasticities of aqueous and ethereal vapour as afford
ing countenance, if not support, to his thermometric innovations.
He affirms, that if our instrument for the measuring heat were
accommodated to his doctrine, the quantity of expansion of its
mercury is as the square of the temperature from its freezing
point ; then " the force of steam in contact with water increases
accurately in geometrical progression to equal increments of
temperature, provided these increments are measured by a ther
mometer of water or mercury, the scales of which are divided by
the above-mentioned law*."
    Were this position true, it would certainly bring a powerful
analogy in aid of his theoretical views.     We are now furnished
with data to verify, or refute it. The following tables show the
correspondence between that principle and experiment.            In the
table of aqueous vapour, the Jirsl column presents his geometri
cal progression of that vapour, coordinate with his equal inter
vals of real temperature contained in the second.         In the third,
are the coresponding points of the common scale, as given bv
Mt. Dalton. To these points the elastic forces, as determined
liy experiment, are placed opposite in the fourth column.
    Table second, for vapour of ether, is similarly arranged ; the
first three columns being Mr. Dalton 's ; the fourth, the faithful
transcript of observation.
    " The force of the vapour cf sulphuric ether," says Mr. Dal
ton, " in contact with liquid ether, is a geometrical progression,
having a less ratio than that of water."
                                               " Ether, as manufac
tured in the large way, appears to be a very homogeneous li
quid. I have purchased it in London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and
Manchester, at different times, of precisely the same quality in
respect to its vapour f."      This shows that no exception can be
made to my experiments on account of a supposed difference in
the quality of the ether.     From the mode of conducting my ex
 periments,   there  remained    always a quantity of liquid ether in
contact with the vapour, a circumstance essential to accuracy in
 this research.   The results were verified by frequent repetitions,
 and discover, in my opinion, the consistency of truth.

from experiment are even more remarkable, since as 282° new

  When     we   turn our attention to ether, we find the discre
pancies,   if possible, less easy to reconcile.  At the temperature
of 212°, for example, where the old and new scales meet for the
last time, the force of its vapour by the geometrical progression
exceeds that found from experiment, by the enormous quantity
of 67 inches and a half ; amounting to two-fifths of the whole
elastic force evolved.
    May we venture, then, to conclude, from these multiplied com
parisons, that the progressions of elasticity in vapours, taught by
Mr. Dalton, are geometrical fictions, intended to quadrate with
his notions concerning temperature ; but not consonant with the
laws or phaenomena of nature ?
    Within a moderate compass, indeed, it is not difficult to suit
the ratio of elastic force and the thermometric graduation to each
other ; but the prosecution of the inquiry into ranges more re
mote, detects the fallacy of such hypothetical adaptations.      My
experiments on the vapours of water, alcohol and ether, seem to
show, that the ratio of tension decreases in a certain progression
as the temperature augments.           Were the ratios 1 "23, l-22,
 1.21, &c, which are seen to apply so well to aqueous vapour for
a considerable range above 212°, to be adopted as representing
the progressive march of nature, it would lead to the absurd con
clusion, that at 240° above the boiling point, or 452* F., the
further influx of caloric would occasion a diminution of elasticity
in the steam.      The truth however       is,
                                           that at the 312th degree,
indications of divergence begin to appear between the two lines
                a
of experiment and calculation, which had run for so long space
                                                            a
nearly parallel.    The curve representing the expansive force of
steam, I   consider to be logarithmic, in which the ratios, as or-
dinates, continually diminish, without ever vanishing, or coming
to an equality.     The axis  is an asymptote to the curve, as in the
atmospherical    logarithmic.

Sir,
   I      am glad to see the important subjects of Wheel-carriages
and Roads, brought under the notice of your readers,            by
                                                               the
communication of Mr. Benjamin Wingrove, in your last Number;
wherein he recommends two important improvements; viz. to pre
vent or lessen the evils of dragging waggon wheels down the hills,
and the constructing of carriages      an uniform breadth, so that
                                         of
their wheels repeatedly follow in the same tracks, and cut ruts in

the Road ;     I have been surprised however to find   Mr. W. unac
quainted with the circumstance, of the necessity of this latter
improvement having been shown, in the Reports of the Com
mittees of the House of Commons on the subject of Roads and
 Carriages, because in the 1st Report ordered to be printed 11th
 May 1808, p. 1 14, Mr. C. W. Ward; in the 2d Report ordered
to be printed 17th June 1808, p. 176, Mr.        J. F.Erskine; and
in the 3d Report, ordered to be printed 1 1th June 1809, p. 156,
 Mr.   J. C. Hornblower, have distinctly done this ; and so have
 many writers on the subject, particularly Mr. Robert Beatson
 and Mr. Richard Whitworth.                                  ,
     In my Derbyshire Report, vol. iii. p. 242, I have related the
 particulars, of an Act of Parliament obtained in 1 808, for a Turn
 pike Road between Ashover and Tupton, wherein (on the sug
 gestion of Mr. Joseph Butler) the Tolls on Carriages, have been
 apportioned, to several different breadths of their wheel-tracks,
 for inducing their owners to co-operate in the improvement in
 question.     In p. 241 I have thus expressed myself ; viz. " It has
 occurred to me, from a long and careful attention to Roads, in
 all situations, and I know numbers of intelligent Travellers and
 Road Surveyors, who have made the same observation, viz. that
 nothing is more essential to the goodness and permanence of a
 Road, than causing the wheels of carriages continually to change
 their places on the Road, by which alone, Ruts thereon can be
 avoided, and a smooth surface be obtained and preserved : this is
 remarkably exemplified, at the meetings or turnings of Roads, in
 most situations, notwithstanding the grinding action of the
 wheels thereon while turning (which action, Mr. Cummings and
 others have so greatly magnified, in the use of conical wheels,&c.)
 and on the slopes of hills of considerable steepness, where the
 horses, in order to ease the ascent or descent, endeavour to cross
 continually from one side of the Road to the other : as also in
 such parts of Roads, as are full of carriages, going different ways
 and paces, and are consequently obliged often to turn out, and
 change their tracks."
    In the Work mentioned, I have endeavoured to enforce the
 great importance of obtaining hard Materials,        for all Roads,
 which are subject to much wear, at almost any cost ; and have
 pointed out the important aids which the art of Mineral Survey
 ing may furnish, towards the discovery of such materials, in nu
 merous districts, where now, soft and bad materials are used
 on the great Roads.

XVII. Report of the Surveyor- General of the Board of Works,

Sir, — X have
                                         Office of Works, Jan. 14, 1819.
                    the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your
letter, dated the 14th of March last, directing me, by command
of Lord Sidmouth, " to ascertain, by experiment, how far it is
safe and practicable to supersede the practice of climbing boys in
sweeping chimneys, by the use of machinery;" and I beg leave
to acquaint you, for his Lordship's information, that upon the
receipt of your letter, I proceeded with as little delay as possible,
to secure by every means in my power, a fair and impartial trial
of all the different machines that had been collected, for the pur
pose of sweeping chimneys without the aid of climbing boys.
    From the many difficulties I had to encounter at the com
mencement of this undertaking, I found it necessary, in order to
secure a faithful execution of the commands I had received, to
appoint Mr. Davis, an active and intelligent clerk in this office,
to superintend personally the progress of each separate experi
ment, and to give such directions and assistance, in the use of
the different machines, as circumstances and situation might re
quire.
    It will not, I conceive, be necessary for me to enter into a de
tailed statement of all the numerous trials made by Mr. Davis,
to sweep chimneys, without the aid of climbing boys; and I shall
therefore only submit, for his Lordship's information, the follow
ing list of experiments, where machinery has succeeded in effec
tually cleaning such chi\nnevs, as presented particular difficulties
in sweeping, from the size, situations, and peculiar construction
of the flues.

    Report  of the Surveyor-General   on Climbing Boys,  &c.    105
    This statement contains, I believe, with some few exceptions,
specimens of nearly every difficult description of chimney that
can be met with in the generality of either old or newly-con
structed buildings, and will afford, in my humble opinion, suffi
cient evidence, that even at present by far the greater proportion
of the chimneys throughout the country, can be effectually swept
by machinery without the aid of climbing boys.          There were
however many chimneys that, from their very confined and hori
zontal construction, Mr. Davis could not succeed in sweeping,
either with a machine or with the ball and brush ; but this diffi
culty he thinks might be overcome by inserting iron registers or
doors in some convenient parts of such flues, where machinery
might be used with ease ; and, if these registers are properly con
structed and fixed, without either danger or inconvenience. The
best constructed registers for this purpose, that I have seen, were
exhibited here by Mr. Thomas White, of Air-street, Piccadilly, and
by Mr.WilliamFeetham, of Ludgate-hill. And the danger to which
climbing boys are so constantly exposed when employed in sweep
ing narrow and intricate flues, would, in my opinion, in a great
measure be obviated, were such iron registers or doors directed to
be made at proper and convenient distances in every flue of this
construction.      The machinery that principally succeeded in the
above experiments, was the invention of Mr. Smart, and has
proved far superior in utility to any that has been submitted for
trial upon the present occasion.       This machine is simple in its
construction, easily worked, can be repaired, when out of order,
with little trouble or expense, and may be carried by a single
 person from place to place without any difficulty.      During the
 progress of these experiments, I have had every possible assist
 ance and advice, that the abilities and experience of Mr. Browne,
 the assistant surveyor-general, and of Messrs. Nash, Soane, and
 Smirke, the architects attached to this department, could afford
 me upon this very interesting subject ; and from the information
 I have obtained from these-gentlernen, as well as from the ob
servations I have been enabled to make in attending to several
of the trials made with the different machines, I beg leave to
 offer it to his Lordship, as my most decided opinion, that the
 total abolition of climbing boys in the sweeping of chimneys, is at
 present impracticable, and could not be attempted without in
 curring much risk of danger to the general safety of the metro
 polis.
    I shall beg leave to annex, for Lord Sidmouth's further infor
 mation, copies of three letters, which I have received from the
 attached architects, upon the subject of superseding the use of
 climbing boys in sweeping chimnevs; together with a copy of
                                                                Mr.

 made, to promote this very desirable object ;
                      and have the honour to be, sir,
                                   Your most obedient servant,

                                              Dover-street, 31st Dec. 1818.
     Sir, — Having attended to several experiments made to sweep
 chimneys of intricate construction by machines, without the use
 of climbing boys, I am of opinion, that though it will be difficult,
 and perhaps impossible, to construct a single machine which will
.clean every chimney, yet by the use of various machines almost
 any chimney may be swept clean ; and that experience would,' in a
 short time, render the operation quite easy: but I do not think the
 use of climbing boys can be wholly dispensed with, the pargetting
 or plastering of flues will require repairing ; new buildings will
  require to have the mortar and knobs of bricks which stick to
 the plastering cleared away, which I think cannot be done by
 any other means than boys.          I beg also to observe, that till the
 use of machinery shall by experience be made easy, and the
 adopting of the most efficacious form of the different machines
 shall be ascertained, much damage will be done to the plastering
  or pargetting of the flues, which will require climbing boys to
 repair.     I should advise also, that a clause be inserted in the
  Building Act, that all chimney funnels hereafter to be built, or
 old chimneys when taken down and rebuilt, should have the flues
 made circular in form ; there would be then little difficulty in
 cleaning them with any machine ; and if tubes like chimney pots
 were worked upon the walls as funnels for the smoke, they would
 be a great security against fire, having few joints and no plaster
 ing to require repair.
              I have the honour to be, sir, your obedient servant,

     My dear    Sir, — In reply to your letter respecting climbing boys,
  I beg leave to state, that as far as my experience goes, a very
  large portion of the chimneys now constructed may be cleaned
  with machines ; but that it will not be possible to do away en
  tirely the service of climbing boy6.
                      I am, dear sir,
                          Your very obedient and faithful servant,

      Sir, — In compliance with your      desire that I should report to
                                                                         you

          respecting Climbing Boys in sweeping Chimnies.           107
you my opinion upon the question of, How far it is practicable to
supersede the practice of climbing boys, in sweeping chimneys by
the use of machinery, I beg leave to say, that I am not able to
give an opinion founded on much personal observation upon the
subject ; but the result of the very particular inquiries, and of the
numerous experiments which you have caused to be made, prove,
that machines, upon the principle of Smart's, may be employed
with success in all common cases ; but that the ball and brush
let down from the upper part of the chimney flue is the only pro
cess which has answered in every instance.
    I have however learnt, from intelligent workmen in Scotland,
where it has long beeu employed, that much injury is often occa
sioned by this operation at the turning of flues, especially where
they are separated only by a thin wall ; and I do not think it
would be practicable, by any regulation, to provide for the con
struction of chimney flues in such a way as to obviate this im
portant objection.
    I am therefore led to believe, that, although the use of ma
chines may be very generally adopted, there is none hitherto in
vented which is so far free from objection in all cases, as to ren
der it possible wholly to dispense with the use of climbing boys.
                       I have the honour to be, sir,
                          Your obedient and faithful servant,
Lieut. Col. Stephenson.                 (Signed)   Robert Smirke.
                                 Office of Works, 11th January, 1819.
    Sir, — In obedience to the instructions, at various times re
ceived from you, on the subject of superseding climbing boys by
the use of machines, I hereby inclose the result of the experi
ments made in consequence, with some observations and sugges
tions naturally presenting themselves in the detail.
    It appears, that the whole of the flues at present in use, may
be comprised in four classes ; the first and most numerous are
those which are carried up in a perpendicular stack, the only bend
in these flues being just sufficient to clear the opening of the flue
above.     The second, far less numerous, are those in which the
fire-place is in a wall not continued higher than the next floor,
and turning off with one bend (making two angles in the eleva
tion) to a partition wall, in which the shaft is continued to the
top. The third, still less numerous, are those in which the shaft
is at some distance from the fire-place, having at least one angle
on the plan, and which of necessity forms two bends in the ele
vation.     The fourth class, which forms a very small proportion
of the total number already constructed, are those having more
than one angle on the plan, and being, for a part of the length,
entirely horizontal.
                                                                   For

 108               Beport respecting Climbing Boys.
     For the first class, the machines already in use are quite ef
ficient ; they are also competent to sweep part of the second
class ; for the remainder of the second class the ball and brush
is perfectly efficient, unless any error in the construction has given
the only bend in them a dip the contrary way. In the third class,
where the ascent is at all preserved, the ball and brush still acts
effectually ; as it will also do in the fourth class, where there are
no parts entirely level.      The remainder of the fourth class com
prehends    those  flues, which have several bends, and are frequently
horizontal ; and in these cases it is alike necessary to let in re
gisters or doors, whether they are swept by boys or machines,
there being no other security for the safety of the boys than this
measure j which when done, actually presents the means of sweep
ing by a common machine.
     As far as my experience has led me, I consider the proportions
of the different classes nearly as under; out of 1,000 flues, 910
of the first class, 50 of the second, 30 of the third, and 10 of the
fourth.
     For the first and second classes, the machinery has been proved,
at Kensington Palace, the Queen's Palace, the Mint, the Speak

 at the Office of Works : but a case has occurred at the Queen's
Palace, where a flue of the second class could not he swept by the
ball and brush ; and upon examining the external part of the chim
 ney, by going between the timbers of the ceiling and lead flat
 above, that part of the flue was out of a level, the end nearest
 the shaft being lower than that next the fire-place.
     I have not seen a machine that will sweep many flues of the third
 and fourth classes ; but have succeeded with the ball and brush
 at the several palaces and places above enumerated ; and in the
 last week a chimney was swept at the Tower with a ball and
 brush in half an hour, which a boy was five hours sweeping a
 short time since, and in which, I am informed, a boy was once
 confined 28 hours.
     The necessity of putting doors in the remainder of those classes,
 has been proved at the Speaker's house, where, for want of them,
 they are obliged to cut out tiles or take down part of the stone
 work every time the servants' hall chimney is swept by a boy ;
 as well as at Somerset Place, where they have put doors inconse
 quence of accidents occurring.        Much has been stated by the
 parties interested, about the injury done to the pargetting by the
 use of the machinery and the ball and brush ; but so far as the
 closest observation has enabled me to form an opinion, this is en
  tirely without foundation; for in the use of the common machine
 less compression is required than is exerted by the hoys to sustain
  their own weight ; and with the ball and brush, unless there is a
                                                                  level,

level, and the ball is wantonly thrown down instead of beinglowered
 carefully, there can be no injury done. In the course of my own
 experience, I have never met with an instance of the necessity of
 employing a climbing boy to repiiir the pargetting of a chimney;
 and with respect to the coring of new chimneys, it requires only
 a determination on the part of the bricklayers to avoid the ne
cessity of it.
    It will appear, that the result of my experiments           that all   is,
the really difficult flues to clean, are met with in large mansions
or public offices, and that the middling and lower classes of houses
are entirely free from them.       The doors introduced in the flues
can certainly be constructed to answer, by their locality, all the
purposes of convenience, safety, and cleanliness.

XVIII.      New Experiments          on the     Oxygenized Acids and Oxides.

ceptible of being several times oxygenated. As was of importance it
that the quantity of oxygen which they were capable of taking up
should be determined,      have done this with iespect to the muria

 110                      New Experiments on    the
For the first    five  or six times this process is performed without
the evolution of oxygen gas ; especially if the muriatic acid be
not completely saturated, and if the muriate be poured into
the sulphuric acid: beyond this point it is difficult to avoid losing
a little oxygen ; but the greater part of this gas remains united to
the acid. In this way I obtained an acid containing 32 times its
volume of oxygen at the temperature of 6S° of Fahr. under a
pressure of 29-992 inches of mercury ; and only A\ times its
volume of muriatic acid : i. e. the volume of oxygen being 7, that
of the muriatic acid was 1 .
    Though the oxygenized muriatic acid prepared in this manner
contains a large quantity of oxygen, it is still capable of receiving
a new portion.         To make it absorb the gas with facility another
method must be followed ; which consists in putting the oxyge
 nized muriatic acid in contact with sulphate of silver.         Imme
diately there is formed an insoluble chloride of silver, and oxyge
nized sulphuric acid, which is very soluble. The latter being se
parated by the filter, muriatic acid is added, but in smaller quan
tity than it existed in the oxygenized muriatic acid employed at
first.     Barytes, in quantity just sufficient to precipitate the sul
phuric acid, is then added ; when the oxygen, quitting the sul
 phuric acid to unite with the muriatic, instantly brings this acid
to the highest point of oxygenation.          Thus it is evident we can
transfer the whole of the oxygen from one of these acids to the
other ; and, on reflection, it is equally evident that to bring sul
phuric acid to the highest degree of oxygenation, it is only ne
 cessary to pour barytes water into the oxygenized sulphuric acid,
in such quantity as to precipitate only a part of the acid. These
 operations, with a little practice, may all be easily performed.
     By combining the two methods just described, I obtain oxy
 genized muriatic acid containing nearly 1 6 volumes of oxygen for
 1 of muriatic       acid.   It was so weak that I could only extract
 3-63 volumes of oxygen gas from 1 volume of acid, under a pres
 sure of 29-922 inches of mercury, and at a temperature of 65°.3.
     Oxygenized muriatic acid exhibits several phaenomena, new to
 me, and worthy of being stated. — When recently prepared, it does
 not give off any air bubbles when filtered ; but soon after very
 small bubbles make their appearance at the bottom of the vessel,
 ascend, and burst at the surface of the liquid.        This is the case
 even when the acid is only once oxygenized. Suspecting that the
 action of light had something to do with this slow decomposition,
  I filled, almost entirely, a bottle with acid, and, after corking it,
 placed it bottom uppermost in a dark place.           After some hours
 it exploded. This acid contained more than 30 times its volume ;
  and yet when put under the receiver of an air pump, it gave off
  but a small quantity of the gas which it contained.
                                                                    I had

                                                                     i
                    Oxygenized Acids and Oxides.                                  1 1 1
     I had hitherto believed that the whole of the oxygen was se
parable from muriatic acid at a temperature below boiling ; but
after boiling oxygenized muriatic acid for half an hour I still found
oxygen in it ; which is demonstrated by bringing oxide of silver
in contact with     it, when oxygen          suddenly disengaged.
                                            is                             This
oxide enables us, with great ease, to determine the quantity of
oxygen contained in oxygenized muriatic acid            ;   and the analysis
takes only    a few minutes.       Take a graduated glass tube, fill                it
almost wholly with mercnry, pour into             it
                                                   aknown volume of acid,
fill the tube completely with mercury, and then turn               it   upside
down in   a   mercurial trough.      Send- up into the acid an excess of
oxide of silver suspended       in  water   ; and immediately there will
be seen disengaged (which may be read off on the tube) the quan
tity of oxygen which the acid contained.             The quantity of chlo
rine can be estimated     ;  and consequently the muriatic acid,             by
                                                                            de
composing     a  part of  the  acid itself   bymeans    of  nitrate of  silver       :
but as in this experiment      a  portion of the oxygen of the oxide                is
disengaged,     we  must   take an account of this quantity to obtain
an accurate result.
    The separation of oxygen from the oxygenized muriatic acid
is  so rapid that there would be danger in operating with                aweak
acid, containing 26 to 3U volumes of oxygen; as the tube might
escape from the hand of the operator, or might break.                 Nothing
can equal the effervescence which takes place when we immerse a
tube containing oxide of silver, and stir          about in some grammes
                                                  it
of this acid, which       isinstantly destroyed, and the oxygen being
liberated, escapes with violence, driving the liquid before it.
    If the most oxygenized muriatic acid be poured on the sul
phate, the nitrate, or the fluate of silver, no effervescence follows.
The whole of the oxygen unites with the acid of the ^alt, while the
muriatic acid forms with the oxide of silver water and a chloride.
  I    made several attempts. to ascertain whether the oxygenized
acids are capable of taking up so much the more oxygen, the
more real acid they contain        ; or whether the water,      by   its quan
tity,   has not  an influence    on the    greater  or less   oxygenizement
of the acid but my attempts have not yet enabled me to answer
              ;
the questions.
 I     have likewise tried to oxygenate magnesia and alumina, but
without success.     I   succeeded, however, in superqxygenating se
veral other oxides, viz. oxide of zinc, oxide of copper, and oxide
of nickel. We should succeed but very imperfectly,           if   at all, were
we to content ourselves with adding oxygenized acid to the saline
solutions of these three metals, and precipitating the liquid by
potash. The oxides of these metals must be dissolved in oxyge
nized muriatic acid three or four times, and then the oxygenized
muriate must be decomposed             by
                                       potash or soda, taking care to add

 112                       On Fossil Shells.
but a small excess of either of these. The formation of superoxide
of copper requires another precaution : the deutoxide' of copper
must be put to the oxygenated muriatic acid in such portions that
the acid shall be always in excess ; for if the oxide predominate,
the greater part of the oxygen will be disengaged. In every case
the oxide is precipitated in a gelatinous mass, or in the state of
a hydrate: that of zinc is yellowish, — of copper, olive-green, —
of nickel, a dirty-looking dark apple'-green. The two former al
low a portion of their oxygen to be liberated at the common tem
perature.     When boiled in water the liberation of oxygen is still
more abundant ; but they stili retain (especially the superoxide
of zinc) a portion of the oxygen which they had absorbed ; for
if dissolved afterwards in muriatic acid, and heat be applied, a
new quantity of gas is given off.       The oxide of nickel is likewise
decomposed at the boiling temperature ; and even below that
point its decomposition commences. Treated with muriatic acid
it dissolves, like the oxides of zinc and copper, and is deoxvge-
nated by heat without giving off chlorine.       These different oxy
genated   hydrates  recover  the  colours which characterize  the com
mon oxides after they have been boiled in water: thus the hydrate
of zinc passes from yellow to white, — of copper, from olive-green
to dark-brown. It had already been observed by M. Rothoff, a
Swedish chemist, that the deutoxide of nickel is decomposed by
desiccation. — These new hydrates, as we see, resemble those of
barytes, strontian and lime, and form a class analogous to that of
the oxygenized acids. — I expect to discover some more of them.

Sin, — On taking      a review of the many particulars regarding the
Fossil Shells   and  other  organic remains of Britain, which were
published by    Edward   Lhwyd     (or Luid) in 1669, by Dr. Plot in
1686, by Dr. Woodward'Sn 1729, by G. Brander in 1766, by
Da Costa in 1776, and by John fValcolt, Rei'. David Ure, and
others prior to the time when Mr. William Smith began his in
vestigations of the Strata of England, about 1/92 ; it cannot fail
of exciting surprise, that these learned and ingenious Writers, and

                      Writers on Fossil Shells.                  113
the many of our countrymen who wrote on Geology in this pe
riod, should have heen so little aware, of the important aids which
a correct knowledge of Fossil Shells would afford, towards real
and untheoretical investigations of the internal structure of our
Country, and regarding the early history of its Strata.
    Mr. William Martin, in 1794, began the publication of his
"   Petrificata Derbiensia," and completed the first volume thereof
in 1809, (having previously in the same year, published his "Out
lines of the Knowledge of Extraneous Fossils,") yet Mr. M. not
withstanding his industrious search through so many years, for
perfect specimens and new species of Fossil Shells, in one of the
most distinctly and regularly stratified Districts of England, free
from Alluvia, and particularly rich in organic Remains, had but
in a very slight and imperfect degree perceived, the order and re
gularity, with which the different species of Shells are almost
invariably arranged, in the different beds of the Rocks he had exa
mined, such as Mr. Smith was fortunate enough to perceive, else
where, almost from the outset of his investigations.
    The works of Mr. Martin which are mentioned above, and his
Letter in your 39th Volume, bear ample testimony to the justness
of the above remark, which I was particularly enabled to make,
on the occasion of paying Mr. Martin a visit at Macclesfield, in
April 1809, and on showing and explaining to hiin my Map of
the Strata of Derbyshire, and mentioning to him the discoveries
which had been made and communicated to me and many others
by Mr. Smith, relative to the invariableness of the strati graphical
 situations of Fossil Shells, and the important uses w.hich Mr. S.
 had been able to derive from them, in commencing and carrying
 on his novel and extensive investigations of the Strata and sub-
 ficial structure of England and Wales.
    Mr. James Parkinson' s extensive research into the writings
 of the greater part of the previous authors on Extraneous
 Fossils, in our own Country and on the Continent, and his in
dustry and judgement in the formation and description of a large
 Collection of Specimens of such Fossils, are fully shown, in the
 three volumes entitled " Organic Remains," which he published
in 1804, 180S, and 1811 ; which work fully evinces, until ap
proaching the conclusion of its third volume, the truth of the
 foregoing remarks, as to the slight and imperfect knowledge which
 existed of the Fossil Shells, in relation to, and as the means of
 identifying particular Strata, until the discoveries, and the prac
 tical applications of the same to the general surface of England,
 began to be made more generally known, by the communications
 of Mr. Smith and myself : .and in consequence of which, Mr.
 Parkinson was led to review, to question, and at length to abandon
  many positions and opinions which had been formed and advanced,

in the long progress of preparing his work, with the degree of
confidence, which the almost entire concurrence of the numerous
authorities he had consulted, was naturally enough calculated to
inspire ; amongst the most prominent of these changes of opinion,
so honourable to Mr. P's liberality, is that which relates to the
previously alledged formation of the Strata of Coal and those which
i ntervene, (and of course, of all those which overlie the Coal Series)
during the Noachian Deluge. See vol. III. pp. 443 and 441.
    The early Numbers of Mr. James Soweriy's " Mineral Con-
chology" appeared in 1812, and through them, until near the
conclusion of his first volume in 1815, when Mr. Smith's " Map
of the Strata of England and Wales" had just appeared, addi
tional evidence is furnished to the same point, in the conflicting
opinions and doubts which Mr. Sowerby has therein expressed,
as to nearly every inference which follows from the discoveries and
labours of Mr. Smith ; yet, notwithstanding         the almost entire
agreement of authors, in his own previously expressed opinions,
Mr. S. then liberally took Mr. Smith by the hand, and offered
him that assistance, in the bringing out of one of his proposed
works on Fossil Shells and other Organic Remains, which has
enabled three Numbers of " Strata Identified" to appear, in a
state highly conducive to the progress of stratigraphical know
ledge, and a fourth Number to be now nearly ready for delivery.
    In the mean time Mr. Smith persevered, and by the aid of an
ingenious young man his nephew and assistant, Mr. John Phil
lips, (who had made himself enough acquainted with the language
and works of some of the best systematic writers on natural his
tory,) was enabled to bring out, in 1817, the first part of his
"  Stratigraphical System of Organized Fossils :
                                                      " and
                                                              since, to
complete the manuscript (as I have been informed) of the second
and concluding part, of this truly important and nationally credi
table work : if fortunately, his publisher's account of the sale of
No. 1, had hitherto justified the putting of No. 2 to press !
    Itis, Sir, from the sincere desire which  I   feel to remove this
impediment to the more rapid diffusion of the stratigraphical
knowledge    of  Fossil Shells, which, as far as relates to the lower
and most useful part of the British Series, has too long been with
held from great numbers, who, like myself, are anxious to make
a more perfect use of this knowledge, in the mineral investigation
of our Island for the advancement of Science, and in the practical
application of this knowledge to the purposes of mining for the
benefit of its inhabitants, that have to request the favour of your

us would imitate the praise-worthy liberality of the three indivi
duals to whom  I    have particularly adverted, or would follow the

Fossil Shells and their Strata, were created nearly together .'115
 practice of our neighbours on the Continent, who from national
feelings, seem to make a point of forwarding the publications of
their countrymen : I am sorry however to perceive, that this is
not here the case; the article " Conchology," not long published
in that respectable work the " Supplement to the Fifth Edition of
 the Encyclopaedia Britannica," intended to bring down the sub
jects to the time of writing the Supplementary Articles, in the
chapter expressly
                   " on Fossil Shells," not only omits all mention,
of Mr. Martin's works, (whose widow and orphans languish for tha
comforts which the sale of the copies on hand would produce),
but it also totally omits the mention of Mr. Smith or his works ! ;
it would have given      me pleasure to have added, if I could have
 done so, that this omission, by the Rev. Dr. John Fleming the
 writer of the article, might have arisen, from the mention of Mr.
 Martin and Mr. Smith not having come before him, in the works
from which he was quoting at the time : the reverse however is
 the case, see Min. Conch. I. 153, &c.

 of them in groups consisting of several successive Strata, of many

 these accounts pronounced to be "primitive," that     is,

 every part, of the plane which they occupy:   such observers of Or
 ganic Remains in their natural deposits, can hardly fail    I think
 of concluding (as have done many years ago) that every indivi
                 I
 dual Shell or Organic Remain, which appears after each of these
 non-organic Strata or Beds, (or next above such in the Series,
 especially those of considerable thickness) must have then begun
 to exist, or they were created since the deposition of the Stratum,
 which underlies them, and contains no Organic Remains.
    The conclusion of such careful observers, will scarcely  I think
be less certain and undoubted, that Shells of defined species in
                                               a
a particular Bed, which covers a series of Beds containing none
of that defined Species, but other Shells of different species, that
such defined Species, as certainly began to exist, or were created
at that particular era, when the lowest bed in which they are seen,
began to be deposited, (and at which period, the matter of the
Stratum itself imbedding them, also received its first existence
from the Creator, as  I    conclude, see Min. Conch.   I.

whence  it  will follow, that the almost innumerable Species of Or
ganic Beings which existed, prior to the Earth receiving the same

   1 16  FossilShells and theirStraia, were created nearly together!
  •dimensions   and external form, which it now exhibits ; or in other
  words, all those Species which were contemporary with the depo
  sition (and creation) of the Strata, were only of a comparatively
  limited period of existence, and entirely differed from the subse
  quent Organic Creation (on the present surface, of which Moses
  treats), in these remarkable particulars, viz. that very commonly
  only one Species was in existence at the same time; at other times
  two Species existed, but neither the beginning nor the end of their
  existences were cotemporaneous, in many instances; during other
  periods of this series of Creations and vital Extinctions, three,
 four, five, and frequently greater numbers of Species existed at the
  same time (as is evinced by theirltemains occupying the very same
 Bed or lamina of the Strata) but often, with different eras, of be
 ginning and ceasing to exist, for almost every particular Species.
     Whereas on the contrary, the present series of Organic Beings,
 or the present Creation as it is commonly called, is extremely di
 versified, as to the very great number of Species now existing to
 gether ; each one propagating its like ! ; And experience, history
 and tradition, concur witli just reasoning on the subject, in as
 suring us, that this always has unvaryingly been the case, ever
 since Man first began to exist; and that although some few orga
 nic Species may have since become extinct, in the progress of
 bringing whole Districts under the dominion of civilized Man,
-yet in this latter period, no neiv Species have begun to exist, much
 •less has any addition been made to the Matter of the Globe, ex
 cept perhaps the inconsiderable ones arising from the fall of
 Masses (containing Iron and Nickel in probably every instance,)
 which prior to such falls, formed parts of separate and indepen
 dent Salellitula, which from the period of the general Creation
 had continued to revolve around our planet, with the immense
mvelocity requisite for maintaining such small orbits as the shooting
 ¦stars move in*.
      These views on the subject of Organic Remains, which I have
'long, almost in vain attempted to press on the consideration of
  observers and writers on Natural History, are nevertheless capa
 ble of such abundant proofs, that however long we may have been
 in arriving at them, they cannot fail I think, of sooner or later,
  gaining universal assent : but previous to which, a great deal more
  of research, and of precision and care must be bestowed, on the
  discrimination of the extinct organic Species, than they have yet
  received, in doubtful cases, even from Mr. Sowerby, who unques
  tionably takes the lead in this interesting inquiry, in our country,
   wherein the same originated.
      When Naturalists first began to turn their attention to the Or-

  ganicRemains, and while the idea yet almost universally prevailed,
  that they were but those of individuals, from amongst theearly pro
 genitors of the same stock which yet exists alive, it was natural
  enough, that the artificial arrangement of Classes, Genera and
  Species, into which the followers of Linnaeus had divided all the
 known living Organized Beings, would prove alike sufficient, for
 comprehending all such Organic Remains: it is however well ob
 served by Dr. Fleming in his Article to which I have referred,
 that the reluctance felt by the writers who preceded M. Lamarck,,
 to the forming of new Genera, has rendered the descriptions of
 these writers nearly unintelligible, unless when accurate figures
 accompanied their descriptions. I cannot however think, that the
 Doctor has displayed equal sagacity, in censuring Mr. Sowerby,
 in the same paragraph, for a " too great anxiety to constitute
 Species ;
            " unless indeed, he meant to allude to the giving of
                                                                  per
sonal and arbitrary names, rather than local or descriptive ones,
 to those individuals which his comparisons shew, to be distinctly
 different from all the species, already named, and from each other..
    Notwithstanding the realdiffere".::*, which from my experience-
 I believe that there exists, between the Species of the several
successive    and distinct Creations above mentioned,           reason
 teaches us, that we are not to expect these differences to be in all
 cases so great and striking, as at first sight to present themselves;
because if this had been the case, the idea could not so long have
 prevailed, that there were no differences between great numbers
 of the Fossil and the recent Species : and it will I believe turn
 out, that as great a further latitude remains to be taken, beyond
what Mr. Sowerby has. yet done in the constituting and naming
of new fossil Species, as Lamarck has so praiseworthily set the
 example of takitig, wifh regard to the Linnean Genera.
    In order to proceed safely, in thus extending the number of
 Species to an accordance with nature, it will not be right to rely,
in doubtful cases, on a single Specimen, even of the most perfect
fossil kind, for furnishing    the description and selecting the es
sential characters of the Species; but it will be desirable, that as
many Individuals as possible, and from as many and as distant
Places in the range of the individual Bed to which they belong,
should be brought together and compared ; carefully excluding
from such comparison, all Individuals which belong to higher or to
lower Beds, than that particular one, whose organized Remains
are under review.
    In the present state, of the only general Map of the English
Strata which we have published, where, in all instances, a great
number of Beds, and often several hundreds of such, are included
under one coloured strip across the map, indicating the range of
such assemblages of Strata, it may to some seem impracticable,
                                     H 3                            to

 118              On the Modes of identifying the Strata,
to select many individual Shells from the very same Bed, in dif
ferent Places, as I have recommended above: and if reliance could
alone be had on Maps for identifying the Beds, this certainly
would at present be a fatal objection to my proposal ; but the
case is otherwise, because in most instances, the number of or
ganic Species is so considerable, in each of the assemblages of
Strata to which Mr. Smith has given Names and Colours on his
Map, and amongst these numbers of Species, there are mostly,
so many which possess such strikinglv distinct characters, as to
place them beyond all manner of doubt : and these characteristic
 Species, being first songht for, in the Beds of everv Quarry or
 Cliff which is examined for collecting Specimens for descrip
tion, the relative situation above or below, and often both above
 and below the Beds, of some of these characteristic Species, may
be ascertained, and used as the means of identifying the Bed of
•an ambiguous or doubtful Species : first through the whole circuit
or length of the Quarry or Cliff under examination, next of the
•nearest adjacent Quarries or Clifls, wherein the same characte
ristic and doubtful Species can be traced, and then progressively,
 to other more distant Quarries or Cliffs, until at length, the
greatest range of observation is obtained, which our Island admits.
      And besides which, important helps may often be obtained,
from the mineral characters and qualities of the Beds containing
 doubtful Species, or from those characters in other Beds, which
 underlie or overlie them : but until such time as the present fa
 shionable notions of the existence of universal Formations or
 strata composed throughout of the same precise Mineral Species,
 have subsided, I would, from my experience, beg to recommend
 considerable caution, in making these appeals to the Mineral cha
 racters of the Beds, in the consideration of their Organized Remains.
 Because I mean to maintain, that the Mineral characters cannot
 safely be relied on, without the concurrent support, of tracing
 the .same individual Bed or Mass, as has been done in the gross
  by Mr. Smith in his Map of England, as has more perfectly been
  done in my large Manuscript Map of Derbyshire, and in others of
  smaller extent, and as may with ease and certainty be done, through
  the extent of most Quarries or Cliffs *; or by the concurrence of
      * In tlie doing of which, it will often be perceived, that very great and
  complete mineral changes take place, in the same bed or mass, within a
  very small distance : sometimes these changes appear to be abrupt, and at
  others gradual : for instance, I have lately seen in this town, a moderate
   sized cabinet specimen, brought from the SSW. side ot Shap in Westmore
   land, one end of which is Basalt, and the oilier such highly crystalline and
  large grained Granite, as if shown detached, could not fail to be pronounced
   by any Geognost, as part of a primitive mass ; and such, indeed, the mass
   whence this specimen was broken, has often been pronounced, yet without
   this opinion gaining universal assent. See your 50th volume, pp. 361, 362.

the alternations of Beds possessing very different Mineral Qualities
(rather than by those qualities themselves) ; and above all, with
out the concurrence of such characteristic organic Remains, as
great numbers of Beds contain, and a still greater number, have
such in their vicinity, of which pracitcal Geologists and Naturalists
may avail themselves.
    I am not sanguine enough to expect to see in my time carried
into effect, all which I have been speaking of and recommending,
as to the examination and description of the species of Organic
Remains, which at present but doubtfully characterize their Beds,
owing to the number of other Beds in the English Series, in which
very nearly similar Remains are deposited; so nearly similar,
indeed, that no writer has yet attempted the investigation and
mention of their specific differences, in several instances : yet as
Mr. Smith has uniformly been heard to declare, that he always
could, with regard to Specimens of Organic Remains which he
had examined in situ, and brought together, perceive differences
which directed him in arranging them afterwards on his Strati-
graphical Shelves, independent of the name of the Place whence
they were brought,        which was marked        on each ; (he has
spoken to this purpose in several parts of his works ; and I am
myself of the same opinion as Mr. Smith on this point) I have
been anxious to present to your readers, and to those of Mr. Sow-
erby and Mr. Smith, as complete a List as I am able, of all the
Shells which at the time of compiling     it,had been referred to more
than one Stratum in the Engjish Series, in the writings of Mr.
Sowerby and Mr.Smith, as mentioned
                              is               550 (of the lastvolume).

 I    am aware that this List, in all probability, contains errors,
which I   have not had the means of detecting, regarding the         lo
calities of some of the Shells, and regarding the Strata from which
others of them were obtained        byMr. Sowerby, through the me
dium of his Friends and Correspondents          Mr. Sowerby as well as
                                                ;
myself, will be thankful, that all such errors may be pointed out
to Mr. S., in order that they may be corrected        the future Num

 which appear to be of any of the Species enumerated in the List

 be made, and that distinct Names may be given, in the future
 numbers of Mineral Conchology, to all such shells in this List,
 as shew real marks of distinction, however unusual or minute they
 may be, provided only, that they are unvaryingly found in the In

XX.       Extract of a Letter from William Bruce, Esq. Resi
     dent at Bushire, lo William Erskine, Esq. of Bombay,
     dated Bushire, m26 th March 1813, communicating the Dis
     covery    of a Disease in Persia, contracted      by such as milk the
     Cattle and Sheep, which is a Preventive           of the Small-Pox*.
My dear Sir,          -W      H e n I was in Bombay 1 mentioned to you
that     the cow-pox was well known in Persia by the Eliaats, or
wandering tribes.          Since my return here I have made very par
ticular inquiries on this subject, amongst several different tribes
who visit this place in the winter to sell the produce of their
flocks, such as carpets, rugs, butter, cheese, &c.               Their flocks
during     this  time  are spread   over  the low country  to graze.    Every
Eliaat that I have spoken to on this head, of at least six or seven
different tribes, has uniformly told me that the people who are
employed to milk the cattle caught a disease, which after once
having had, they were perfectly safe from the small-pox: That
this disease was prevalent among the cows, and showed itself
particularly on the teats ; but that it was more prevalent among
and more frequently caught from the sheep. Now this is a circum
stance that has never, I believe, before been known ; and of the
truth of it I have not the smallest doubt, as the persons of whom
I inquired, could have no interest in telling me a falsehood; and
it is not likely that every one whom I spoke to should agree in
deceiving, for I have asked at least some forty or fifty persons. To
be more sure on the subject, I made most particular inquiries of
a very respectable farmer who lives about fourteen miles from this,
by name Malilla (whom Mr. Babington knows very well), and
who is under some obligations to me: this man confirmed every
thing that the Eliaats had told me, and further said that the dis
ease was very common all over the country, and that his own
sheep often had it.          There may be one reason for the Eliaats
saying that they caught the infection oftener from the sheep than
 the cow, which is, that most of the butter, ghee-, cheese, &c. is
 made from sheep's milk, and that the black cattle yield very lit
 tle, being more used for draught than any thing else.
XXI. On        the Atomic Philosophy.          By Mr. Joseph Luckcock.
 All matter          has been supposed on this hypothesis to be com
 posed of mathematical points, without length, breadth or thick
 ness ; and that different arrangements of the same identical

points, being but one in species, constitute all the various forms of
 matter in the universe ; and, that the same specific matter should
 compose a guinea or a lock of hair.             A mysterious power was
 supposed    to  reside  in these   atoms,   or essence'of    matter, called
 repulsion ;   in  this state of  the  hypothesis,   a question arose, — In
 an aggregate of these poirits, what was it that filled up the inter
 stices? It was plain it could not be matter; for although the
 essence was solid, that could not be the case with an aggregate
 of these points ; the interstices must be occupied with nothing.
 Therefore it was necessary, in order to complete the hypothesis,
 that this nothing should be personified, and from hence arose the
 invention of a vacuum.          I shall pass over the learned disputes
 whether this nothing was created, or whether it possessed the
 attributes of the Deity, infinite and eternal, or merely a local ap
 pendage to aggregates of matter, and simply remark, that the
 parts of this hypothesis are so interwoven, that if any one of
 them should be removed, the whole must crumble away.
    Unfortunately for this system, it admits of no proof; and what
is singularly remarkable, its advocates have been principally ma
thematicians. It has even been called the mechanical philosophy;
 and yet it is incapable of demonstration.         A mathematical point
 may be imagined; as also the division of a line into an infinite
 number of parts, but practically we all know these to be among
the impossible things.        The doctrine of repulsion was necessary
to the support of the doctrine of matter consisting of mathema
tical points, and the moderns have personified            it,  and say that
caloric      the great repulsive power.
            is                                  It   iseasy to conceive
                                                                              a a
pestle to be      repulsive power, in the operation of pounding
                  a
substance        in  mortar; but not so easy to suppose
                      a                                           a glass of
water to have the repulsive power of grinding             a  lump of sugar
into mathematical points, which should remain suspended in it.
It  appears to me something like arguing in a circle Matter must

pulsive power must exist, because matter consists of mathema
tical points. The ancients considered repulsion to be quality;        a
the moderns,          substance
                      a          ;  calorie they conceive to be balls of
various dimensions, and tangible matter (as opposed to mathe
matical points) to consist        of  these points insinuated into and
occupying the centre of the caloric balls, net unlike the apple in
a dumpling. And here         I cannot help feeling some regret at be
ing compelled to erase from my dictionary,            a word of great pith
and meaning, homogeneous for surely
                                 ;              it never can be said that
there  is any homogeneity in matter thus compounded.
    The personification of nothing, or          avacuum,   is  as necessary
to the moderns as to the ancients. To the ancients,                was ne
                                                                  it
cessary to fill up the interstices of their mathematical points, and
                                                                          to

  to the moderns       it is necessary to fill up the interstices of their
  caloric balls ; and yet a great advocate of this doctrine, in order
  to clear up a perplexing difficulty, runs into the absurdity, merely
  to suit the circumstances of the case, of supposing there must
  have been interstitial caloric, than which a greater inconsistency
 was never heard of : interstitial heat and interstitial vacuums are
 incompatible with each other.              Both ancients and moderns have
 asserted the existence of a vacuum with as much confidence as
 they would assert the existence of water : but it can only be con
 sidered as hypothetical ; for there never has a fact been brought
 forward in favour of the actual existence of a vacuum, tha,t can
 be considered as conclusive.            Mr. Dalton supposes the atoms of
 all gaseous substances, whatever may be the form of the ultimate
 particle or nucleus, to be perfectly globular, and will be arranged
 in horizontal strata like a pile of shot. It is easy to demonstrate
this to be tin error both in number and in form.                     Mr. Dalton 's
 atom of water is globular, and his atom of steam or aqueous va
pour is also globular.          It is well known that when water is con
verted into steam it is increased in bulk 19S6 times; or, in Mr.
Dalton's language, the atom of water is surrounded by 1985
atoms of caloric.           I will exhibit a section of Mr. Dalton's atom
of a gaseous vapour ; the central ball is water, all the rest are ca
loric.      (See Plate I. fig. A.)

    I will leave Mr. Dalton to take the seventh 1680, or the
 eighth 2448, which he pleases ; one is 305 too little, the other
463 too much. He may be surprised that he cannot find the num
 ber 1985 in the table : this number is a multiple of 5, the num
 bers in the atomical table are multiples of 12 : this hypothesis
 ought to lead to the conclusion that water would unite to the
 matter of heat in every proportion found in the fifth column of
 the table, 1 to 12, 1 to 60, to 168, to every number in the table,
 even to infinity: but this inquiry naturally leads to one of two
 results; either the atomical philosophers do not follow nature, or
 nature does not follow the ingenious conceits of the atomical
 philosophers.     I will not attempt to run through all the vagaries
 of the system, but will only state that atoms are described as
 solid, hard, and impenetrable; that water consists of the matter
 of oxygen, of the matter of hydrogen, and of the matter' of heat.
 It is in vain to say that the matter of heat is only an atmosphere
 to the other two: if one species of matter consists of atoms, so
 must all ; and how can it be possible for one atom to get into the
 inside of another ?    If Nature had employed the mechanical phi
 losophers as her journeymen, all gaseous atoms, instead of being
 globular, would be double hexagonal pyramids. Nature's laws are
 too simple for the inventive genius of a mechanical philosopher :
 the chemical combinations in definite proportions, as explained
 by Sir H. Davy, are clear, intelligible and satisfactory; while the
 day dreams of the atomic philosophers are clouds that sully the
 philosophic horizon, which will soon be dispersed and seen no
 more.
    The views which I have developed in my Essay on this subject
 are very extensive, and will unfold the arcana of nature in a way
 that I believe has never yet been considered. I have divided all
 matter which fills all space, into ponderable and imponderable :
 imponderable matter is the only ethereal substance; it is the same
 with caloric, matter of heat, specific heat; fire, or light and heat,
 the electric fluid, the element of fluidity, and which I have called
fiuidium. Instead of being the great repulsive power, it is the
 operating cause of all chemical attractions, all chemical action :
 it unites and is united with all ponderable matter, of which it is
 the life and soul ; for without the aid of fiuidium, all ponderable
 matter would be inert and dead.        The way in which the sun acts
                                                                    in

                        On the Atomic Philosophy.                   137
  in the system, is not by emitting or radiating its own substance
  (a rude unphilosophic. idea), but a change it produces in the elec
  trical relations of all ponderable matter, already united with
  fluidium ; which changes always produce heat and light, in pro
  portion to the intensity of the action. This will also account in
  a satisfactory manner, why the moon should afford us light, but
  not heat. Fluidium, in its passage from one lunar ponderable sub
  stance to another, produces heat and light, the heat is absorbed
  by the receiving body, and as the cause is perpetual, so will be
  the effect : we feel no heat, but the light will be without inter
   mission.

       Since my Essays went to press, I have turned over the Asiatic
   Researches, and had great satisfaction in finding a very remark
  able confirmation of my theory; viz. that the tides are not pro
  duced by the influence of the sun and moon unitedly or separately,
  but by the diurnal motion of the earth : see Observations on the
   Barometer, by Dr. Balfour and Mr. Farquhar, 4th vol. Asiatic
   Researches, Calcutta 1794.
       "  1st. That in the interval between 10 o'clock at night and
   six in the morning, there existed a prevailing tendency in the
   mercury to fall.

   there existed a prevailing tendency in the mercury to rise.

       " The periods  are evidently connected  with the earth's diurnal

    the atmospherical tides caused by the sun. But when we find that
    the   barometer is not in the least observable degree affected by
    the  moon's passage over the meridian, or by the united action of
    the  sun and moon at the syzygies, we have absolute proof that
    this  cannot be the cause : neither can the expansion of the mer
    cury, being directly opposite to the phaenomena, the greatest de
    gree of heat taking place at 3 o'clock, when the mercury is
    lowest.    The observations were taken every half hour during a

              XXII.     On the Purification         of Coal Gas.
                             To    Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, — The           methods recommended by Messrs. Parker and
Lowe,     in  late  Numbers    of your Magazine, for the purification of
coal gas, if they       do  not  fully effect the object proposed, entitle
those gentlemen to every praise by making the subject a matter
of discussion and inquiry.
    It has always appeared to me, that when the various products
derived from the destructive distillation of coal are made to pass
 through an iron tube heated to ignition, the carburetted hydrogen
so obtained principally proceeds from the tar; and that that por
tion of carburetted hydrogen, which had been previously formed
from the coal, undergoes another arrangement of its elements by
traversing the heated medium.                 If, for example, coal gas be
passed through     a    red-hot   tube   after  the  tar has been separated,
it   will be found that the brilliancy of the light from gas so
treated falls far short of what         it   would be, had         received no
                                                                     it
such treatment.
    This being the case (as   is     shown    by experiments) proves clearly
the process      referred to to be   faulty  and  injurious. have, sir, been
                                                               I
induced to offer, these remarks, from recent opportunities                have
                                                                          I
had, whilst travelling through the country, of visiting several gas
establishments, and of witnessing the truly excellent effects of
lime when judiciously applied.               There are various modes in
which lime    is    employed    in  the   purification of coal gas, and the
effect produced    is   in proportion to its causticity, its quantity, and
 the extent of its surface.
     If the lime be not in a state of causticity or thereabouts,              it   is
certain larger quantity must be used than
          a                                          is absolutely necessary;
and whatever proportion be employed,                it    important that as
                                                         is
much surface as possible be exposed in the purifying process.
    In no lime vessel that    I      have had an opportunity of seeing,
are these advantages so completely combined as they are' in the
lime-machine of Mr. Clegg. At the Gas-Works lately erected
in the city of Chester, there      is    one of this gentleman's purifiers;
and   by   the obliging assistance of Mr. Leete               very intelligent
young man and superintendant of the works)
                                                              I (a
                                                              was enabled to
make some experiments on the gas purified                       by
                                                               this machine.
Having     at  other  places submitted     the gas proceeding directly from
the purifier to the action of superacetate of lead dissolved in wa
ter, I   uniformly obtained a result which indicated the presence
of sulphuretted hydrogen,         by   the test being instantly blackened;
but on repeating the experiment at Chester,               Icould not discover
any   trace    whatever   of  this   combination.       Mr. Leete then sug
                                                                          gested,

                     On the Purification    of Coal Gas.             139
gested, that instead of superacetate of lead, an oxide of that me
tal    be used, which, if any were present, would detect sulphuretted
hydrogen with more precision. For this purpose we procured two
large ale-glasses and nearly filled them with water ; in one
some finely-powdered litharge was placed : in the other, dry white
lead (centSi); and these substances were well mixed with the wa
ter : through each of these mixtures we passed for five minutes
large streams of the purified gas; but without changing the
original colour of the oxides in the most trifling degree. A brush
 covered with white paint was then held under the gas tube; but
no alteration could be discovered on the paint.          Lastly, the gas
was passed through lime-water, which was not in any degree
 clouded. These experiments prove to demonstration, that neither
 sulphuretted hydrogen nor carbonic acid gases were mixed with
 the carburetted hydrogen after having passed through this puri
 fier.     The peculiar excellence of Mr. Clegg's lime-machine con
 sists in the exposure of a large surface of lime and gas to the ac
 tion of each other, which is assisted by moderate pressure ap
 plied in the safest and most ingenious manner.
     The accompanying sketch (Plate I. fig. B) may serve to illus
 trate its mode of action : a a represents the vessel containing
 lime mixture ; b b an inner compartment into which the crude
 gas is conveyed bv the pipe c ; d the pipe which conveys the
 purified gas to the gasometer; e an opening through which
 cream of lime is supplied.          When the outer vessel aa is first
 charged     with lime   mixture,  the level will be the same in b b, as
 will appear by the dotted line ; but the moment gas enters by
 the pipe c, the mixture in the inner department is depressed,
 and a column about 14 inches raised and supported in a a, the
 gas at the same time not being able to escape until the lime
 mixture in lib is so far lowered as to expose the narrow divi
 sions, which then present a means of escape ; and by having yet
 to pass through the column of fluid raised in the outer vessel, the
 gas undergoes as complete        a purification as can possibly  be de
 sired or effected.
     I  have here merely endeavoured to describe the mode in which
 coal-gas is purified by the instrument in question. There are se
 veral convenient     appendages attached to it, which make it not
 only an important but a handsome piece of machinery, and
 which I am certain will be found a valuable acquisition to gas
 establishments in general.
                         With much respect I am, sir,

    Dr. Bostock, late of Liverpool, now of London, has published
an account of the Science of Galvanism. He gives a preference to
the chemical hypothesis, and draws the following conclusions: —
    " The chemical differs very essentially from the electrical hy
pothesis with respect to the supposed state of the contiguous me
tals : the electrical supposes that they can have different states
of electricity while they are in contact ; the chemical takes it for
granted, that, while they are in contact, their electrical statesmust
be similar. The chemical hypothesis satisfactorily explains ail the
 facts that have been observed, respecting the necessity of oxygen
for the action of the apparatus; it explains the reason why the me
 tals must differ in their degree of oxidability, and why the fluid
 must be one that will act differently upon the two metals.        The
facts that have been noticed respecting the different effects of the
 interposed fluids may be explained by referring to three circum
                                                              stances,

                     Dr.  Bostock on Galvanism.                  141
stances, which all coincide with the chemical hypothesis, but which
seem to have no relation to any electrical action : 1 . That the
fluid acts only upon one of the metals : 2. That the surface of one
of the metals is oxidated with a certain degree of rapidity: 3. That
the oxide is removed so as to present a fresh surface to the fluid.
If acids be employed, those are the best that dissolve the oxide;
or if neutral salts, those which form triple compounds with the
oxide which is produced. The chemical hypothesis affords a plau
sible method of accounting for the different effects of the appa
ratus, whether we use large or small plates : for it is not unrea
sonable to suppose that the electricity will become more intense
or concentrated at every successive transmission through a new
oxidating surface, while its absolute quantity will depend upon the
amount of oxide that is formed.
    " It will be perceived, that much discordance of opinion still
exists upon the subject, and that some strong objections attach
to every hypothesis which has yet been proposed. The most im
portant points to ascertain are, the difference between electri
city, as excited by the friction of the common machine, and that
modification of it which is strictly called galvanism. For this pur
pose, the nature of electric intensity should be further investi
gated ; for it would appear that, if we were able to attach a more
precise idea to this term, a considerable insight would be gained
into the cause of this difference. Experiments somewhat similar
to those of De Luc should be prosecuted, in which the electrical
and chemical effects of the pile are separated from each other ;
and a more accurate measure of the proper galvanic power should,
if possible, be obtained, than any of which we are now possessed.
The conducting power of the fluids concerned in the galvanic ap
paratus should be carefully examined, and the relation of their
chemical action to their conducting power should be ascer
tained."

    There is now in circulation a Prospectus of a new Work en
titled " The Elements of Radiant and Fixed Matter," (ready for
the press, and to be published by subscription, in one volume,
8vo, with plates, when a sufficient number of subscribers to cover
the required expense shall have been obtained) containing the
Direct Evidences in support of the following Theory of Matter, in
which are described its presumed original basis, with the laws by
which its reciprocal transition to and from the state of radiance
and fixation appears to be governed.
    Theory. — Matter exists in four forms, — the solid, fluid, aeri
form, and radiant. — The three first may be denominated inert or
passive, and to the agency of the last, aided by caloric, are to be
attributed the several changes evinced throughout the universe.
    Light is a material compound, composed of the four simple
elementary principles, or undecompound constituents of matter,
of which all other bodies in nature are formed.
    By a prism, light is divisible iuto four original prismatic coloured
rays, which, by obliquity of position, in the act of extended refrac
tion, exhibit three others, which, not being intimate compounds,
may be termed laminar intermediates, partaking of partial colorific
intensity, as they severallyapproximate that point in the spectrum,
                                                                   where

           The Elements   of Radiant and Fixed Matter.            143
where the original rays of which they are composed, are, as to
vision, evidently homogeneous.
   The first four primary coloured rays possess peculiarly distinct
and countervailing qualities, and on the proportions in which they
are combined in matter, and the nature of the polarity exercised
in their combination, its specific properties are totally depen
dant.
   The red ray, or the first portion of the spectrum, possesses (as
has been already proved, by an authority of great eminence)
oxydating and acidifying powers, and is here termed the oxyge
nating ray.
   The second, or yellow ray, displays qualities which pertain to
the nitrogenous and alkalescent, and is therefore denominated
the azotic ray.
    The third, or blue ray, is distinguished by its analogy to car
bon, and is here considered the carbonic ray.      k
    And the fourth, or violet ray, is admitted to possess the dis
positions of hydrogen, which entitle it to the appellation of the
hydrogenating ray.
    Light combines with inert or fixed matter, not specifically or
 bodily, but partially by absorption of its individual or separate
 rays, electively combined, from certain existing laws of attraction,
 and from the colour of fixed bodies, or that of their solution in
menstrua of known constitution, or of their flame in combustion,
the predominating original or simple elementary rays in their com
position may be defined.
    Caloric influences the combination of refracted light with
fixed or palpable matter, when at a temperature not exceeding
from 800° to 900° of Fahrenheit, but effects the restoration of
matter to the radiant state of light, when elevated to 1000° and
 upwards.
    The repulsive power evinced by the particles, or corpuscular
 atoms of light, towards each other, (when their active poles or
 those they exercise in the aggregate are paralysed,) is influenced
 by the peculiar nature of their individual polarity, being quater
 nary compounds, of a spherical form, combined by one positive
 and three negative poles at their centre, and therefore exhibiting
 on their external surfaces, three positive poles at such angles, as
 to act with repulsion, on liberation from the influence of pres
 sure, or that propelling power which emanates from the radiating
 point on which the visibility of light depends.
    The greater illuminating power of that portion of the spec
 trum, embracing the lighter green and deeper yellow, may de
 pend on the higher specific gravity of those rays, as by multiply
 ing their given relative qualities, by the specific gravity of the
                                                                fixed

  144                 Notices respecting New Books.
 fixed bodies they represent, they afford from analogy the following
 data as their comparative intensity of illumination.
     Red ray 9-364. Yellow 12-789.        Blue 6-593. Violet 1-000.
 Lightorange     or  deep yellow 11-647.   Light green 10-719. The
 mean of   the  entire portion 1 1-076.
     The Galvanic phanomena among others support the conclu
 sion, that the transition of matter to the radiant state of light is
 effected by the combination of one atom of oxygen, by its po
 sitive pole, in contact with the negative poles of one atom each,
 of azote, carbon, and hydrogen, and that the reversion to a fixt
 state, is produced by a combination of the same atoms in a re
 fracted state principally by their opposite poles with bodies of
 fixed matter.
     The existence of an equilibrium as to such gradual transition
 and reversion of matter is not less consistent with its indestruc
 tibility, than that already admitted in the daily formation of
water, and the restoration of that body to its original constituents
 in the gaseous state.
     Light is imperfect in colour and intensity, unless the presence
of its four original constituents is evident, and nearly in the fol
lowing ratio :

    Except one, all solids, with which we are familiar, (the metals
included,) all fluids, and the whole of the gases, (three only ex
cepted,) are compound bodies.
    The colour assumed by bodies in a liquid state, on addition of
new constituents, is dependent on a change of position of the
visible surfaces of their compound atoms, arising either from an
extension of their spheres by the new acquisition, or a diminution
in magnitude from abstraction of some portion of their original
constituents, by which in either case a direct change as to po
larity is effected. This may be elucidated by demonstrating the
nature of the action of an acid, or an alkali, on the blue colour
of vegetable juices.
    The health and vigour of vegetative bodies, as well as the co
lours by which they are adorned, is principally attributable to the
transition of radiant matter to a fixed state.
    As the crystalline forms assumed by bodies are governed by
the number and position of the original constituents in their com
                                                                      '

position, and as no homogeneous body can consistently exhibit
such diversity in its atomical arrangement, the assumption of
such forms by the metals is one of the many presumptive evi
dences in support of their compound nature.
    As all bodies, whether of the animal, vegetable, or mineral
kingdom, (as here presumed) are compounds, formed of nearly
the same constituents, their peculiar properties and qualities are
not to be considered as innate, but are to be attributed, in ad
dition to variation in proportion, to a modification in arrange
ment, inducing a polar influence by which their passage to other
stages of fixity is facilitated or impeded, and they are rendered
applicable to appropriate changes.
    Thus matter is deleterious alone from an arrangement con
trary to that consistent with animal organization, and not from
qualities or properties peculiar to its constituents.
    The order of polarity observed in the transition of matter from
a fixed to a radiant state, is absolute and invariable, while that
of its reversion from the latter to the former by combination with
bodies of fixed matter is subject to a diversity governed by the na
ture of those bodies, which are endowed with certain proportionate
degrees of fixation, or resistance to resolution, as their poles alone,
 appropriate to connection in the radiant state, are more or less
protected from the influence of caloric in producing a separation
of their elements.

 Jan.    14. —  A. Paper by Sir E. Home on the Corpora Lutea was
 read.     The ovarium is previous to puberty loose and open, in its
 texture ; afterwards the Corpora Lutea make their appearance,
 forming in the cow a mass of convolutions which the author com
 pares to those of the brain. The ova are then formed in the lutea
 before and independently of sexual intercourse ; but, in the au
 thor's opinion, impregnation is necessary to their expulsion, on
 which the Corpora Lutea are burst by extravasated blood, their
 cavities after the escape of the ova being always found distended
 with coagulated blood.

     Feb. 4. A paper was read, communicated by the President from

the Magnetic Needle on board ship. Mr. Scoresby states, as the          re
sult of a long series of personal observations, what when the comr -
pass is placed in one particular part of a ship, there is no varia
 tion, as between north and south ; and that when placed in an
 other position, there is no variation, as between east and west. He
 accordingly suggests, that a medium point between these two
 lines may probably be found, where the compass will act free from
 all variation, either as to north or south, or as to east and west.
     A paper by Mr. Bain on the same subject was also read at

 of the variations of reckoning occasioned by the local attraction
 of ships.

     At the sitting of 5th of October last, was read by M. Thenard
 a Series of observations on the Oxygenized Acids and Oxides *,
which, the author observed, embrace facts so singular that they
 will excite some surprise.        They are as follows :
     " I. The oxygenized nitric and muriatic acids dissolve the
                                                                        hy
 drate of the deutoxide of mercury without effervescence ; but if
 an excess of alkali be afterwards poured into the solution, a con
siderable disengagement of oxygen ensues, and the oxide of mer
 cury, which at first re-appears of a yellow colour, is quickly re
 duced.
     " II. When this hydrate is brought in contact with the
                                                                      oxy
genized nitrate or muriate of potash, it is reduced with equal fa
cility. It passes from yellow to gray, giving off at the same time
much oxygen.
     " IIInc. Oxide of gold, obtained from the muriate
                                                               by means of
barytes, and containing such a small portion of the base as gave
it a greenish hue, being put, while in a gelatinous state, into oxy
genized muriatic acid, a strong effervescence instantly followed,
occasioned by a disengagement of oxygen.                The oxide assumed
a purple tint, and was, soon after, completely reduced.
     " IV. Oxygenized sulphuric, nitric and phosphoric acids, like

  the oxygenized muriatic acid, cause the oxide of gold to assume
  at first a purple hue; but instead of assuming afterwards the
                                                                   ap
  pearance of gold that has been precipitated by sulphate of iron,
 it becomes dark-brown. These experiments have a tendency to
 prove the existence of a purple oxide of this metal.
     "  V. If oxygenized nitric acid be poured on oxide of silver,
 a strong effervescence ensues, occasioned, as in the preceding
 cases, by a liberation of oxygen. One portion of the oxide is dis
 solved.     The other is first reduced, and afterwards is dissolved,
 if a sufficiency of acid be present. If potash be gradually added
 to the solution, when completed, a fresh effervescence follows, and
 a dark violet-coloured precipitate is thrown down (such, at least,
is always the colour of the first deposit), which is insoluble in
-ammonia, and, to all appearance, a protoxide of silver, similar to
what was observed by an English chemist while examining the
 action of ammonia on the oxide of silver.
    " VI. Oxygenized sulphuric and phosphoric acids likewise
reduce partially the oxide of silver, with a strong effervescence.
    f' VII. Having already noticed that the oxide of silver and oxy
genized muriatic acid, by their mutual action, produce water,
disengaging oxygen gas and chloride of silver, I now remark that
this chloride is of a violet colour : but violet chloride, however
obtained, .always leaves a metallic residue when treated*" with am
monia. This phenomenon was observed by M. Gay-Lussac, re
 specting white chloride turned to violet by the action of light.
From this it follows, that when oxygenized muriatic acid is treated
with oxide of silver, a small portion of the liberated oxygen is
furnished by the oxide itself : therefore, to determine by the pro
 cess pointed out in my last paper, by means of this oxide, the
quantity of oxygen in muriatic acid, we must take into the ac
count the oxygen furnished by the oxide: in order to which a se
cond experiment must be made, in which the chloride of silver,
produced and mixed with oxide of silver, must be collected. This
mixture being treated with ammonia gives, as a residuum, the por
tion of the metal that had beeu reduced ; the quantity of which
informs us respecting the quantity of oxygen we are in quest of. —
With respect to the chloride of silver, it probably corresponds
with the protoxide of silver.
    "VIII.    When a tube containing oxide of silver is dipped into
a solution   of oxygenized nitrate of potash, a violent effervescence
ensues ; the oxide is reduced, the silver is precipitated, all the
oxygen of the oxygenized nitrate is liberated along with that of
the oxide ; and the solution, containing merely common nitrate
of potash, remains neutral, if it was in that state at first.
    " IX. Oxide of silver produces the same effects on oxygenized
»uriate of potash as on the oxygenized nitrate.
                                                          « X. When

                          Academy   of  Sciences, Paris.                149
      "  X. When silver in      a state of minute division is put into oxy-
, genized     nitrate   or muriate  of potash, all the oxygen of the salt
  is instantly liberated.      The silver is not affected, and the salt re
  mains neutral as before. The action is much less lively when the
  silver is in a less divided state : and the action is always less vio
  lent with the muriate than with the nitrate.
      " XI. Iron, zinc, copper, bismuth, lead and platinum, possess,
  like silver, the property of separating the oxygen •of the oxy
  genized nitrate and muriate of potash.           Iron and zinc are oxi
  dized, while1 oxvgen is evolved : the others are not sensibly oxi
  dized. — They were all used in the state of filings.
      "  The action of gold and of tin was likewise tried.      They pro
  duced no sensible action on the neutral solutions ; or, at most,
  onlv a few bubbles were liberated, and these at intervals.
      "XII.      The peroxide of manganese and that of lead are also
  capable of decomposing the oxygenized nitrate and muriate of
  potash.       Only a small quantity of these oxides is required to ex
  pel   the  whole    of the oxygen from the solution. The effervescence;
  is brisk. I believe that the peroxide of manganese undergoes no
  alteration.       It is not impossible that the peroxide of lead may
  be reduced to a lower degree of oxidation.
      " XIII. Though nitric acid, as is known, has no action on the
  peroxide of manganese and of lead, the oxygenized nitric acid
  dissolves both of them with facility, accompanied by a great dis
  engagement of oxygen gas.            Potash produces in the manganese
  solution a black flocky precipitate ; and in that of lead, a brick-
  coloured precipitate.         The latter is less oxidized than peroxide
  of lead ; for, treated with nitric acid, it yields nitrate of lead and
  a flea-coloured residuum. On adding the potash there is instantly
  a strong effervescence.
      " XIV. The oxygenized sulphates, phosphates, and fluates,
  exhibit with the oxide of silver, with silver, and probably with
  other bodies, the same phaenomena as the oxygenized nitrate and
  muriate of potash ; and the greater number of the oxygenized
  alkaline salts possess the same properties as the oxygenized salts
  of potash. — The cause of the phaenomena we shall hereafter at
  tempt to resolve.
      " With this view, let us recollect the phaenomena exhibited by
  oxide of silver, and silver, with the neutral oxygenized nitrate of
  potash. Silver in fine powder rapidly liberates the oxygen of this
  salt.     It undergoes, itself, no alteration; while the oxygenized
  nitrate is reduced to the state of simple nitrate. — The oxide of
  silver liberates the oxygen of the oxygenized nitrate still more
  rapidly than does the silver ; is itself decomposed, reduced, and
  the silver entirely precipitated : and in the liquid only common
  neutral nitrate of potash is found.         In these decompositions the

chemical action is evidently null.       We must therefore ascribe
them to a physical cause; but they depend neither on heat nor
light. It follows then, that probably they are owing to electri
city.    1 will endeavour to ascertain this — likewise   whether the
cause, be it what it may, cannot be produced by bringing into
contact two liquids, or even two gases ; from which, perhaps, we
shall derive means for explaining a great variety of phenomena."
          XXV. Intelligence     and Miscellaneous Articles.
                       SUBSTITUTE FOR BORAX.
Sulphate of strontian has been lately discovered in consider
able quantity at Carlisle. 34 miles west of Albany, in the State of
New York.       It is found imbedded in clay slate, forming very ex
tensive strata.     A common smith has made a curious discovery
respecting this substance : having tried it as a/substitute for bo
rax, it proves to be the most useful flux that was ever employed in
                          i
brazing and welding.        By employing a very small quantity of it
in powder, instead of clay, he welded with ease the most refrac
 tory steel : in brazing it is found preferable to borax, remaining
more fixed at a high temperature.
                             SAFE COACH.
     In a country in which there is so much travelling as England,
 every improvement calculated to lessen the risks of being overset
 in stage coaches should be patronized by the public. The vehicle
 invented, or so improved as to give it all the characters of a new
 invention, by Mr. H. Matthews of Gretton Place East, Bethnal
 Green, is precisely of this description. We have inserted a wood
 cut, which, with a few words of description, will convey to our
 readers a very correct idea of its advantages.
     In coaches of the common construction a great load of lug
 gage is usually carried on the top, and the wheels approach each
 other so closely, that the towering pillar requires very little incli
 nation to either side, to carry the centre of gravity beyond the
 centre of the base, and overset the coftch. In the new coach the
 wheels are made to cover a wider base, and the luggage is stowed
  at the bottom and under the seats, which are so contrived as to.
  allow 5 cubic feet more luggage than can be stowed in all parts
  of the present coaches : by which means the centre of gravity has
  only a height of 3 feet 6 inches, instead of- 8 feet 9 inches, as in
  the common coaches, and all the luggage is under lock and key
  and impervious to wet.      The wheels are fastened on with lock
  and key. That the safety of passengers will be greatly increased
  by this improvement is quite obvious ; but this is not all : the
                                                                labour

labour of the horses will be lessened; which should always be a
matter of consideration with humane minds. The wheel horses
are relieved, by this plan, from that unequal vibration which is oc
casioned by the weight being placed so high as to swing from
side to side ; sometimes falling to the one horse and sometimes
to the other, subjecting them to an equal pace with a jerking un
equal .pull.   The perch, the body and the boot are much nearer
the horses, and mote at their command, than in coaches of the
common constructmn.
    The Patentee, we understand, means to hire out these vehicles
to coach masters for the same price at which they now hire their
coaches, reserving for himself an additional halfpenny per mile,
which he proposes to charge on the front outside passengers, to
prevent that uncomfortable mixture which is now much com
plained of— those who ride backward. paying the old fare. This
bonus he is. however, willing to farm out to the coach-master for
a reasonable remuneration . The advantage to the coach-master
will be, additional safety to the driver, less wear of cattle, and the
carriage of 5 cubic feet more of luggage, which, calculating each
foot at 24 pounds, will yield, say at one penny per pound for a
distance like that to Brighton, ten shillings.         These coaches too
may avail themselves of the act, which allows twelve passengers
where there is no outside luggage, in place of ten where there is
outside luggage. These two extra passengers at 12s. yield 11. 4s.
more. — That    is,   we calculate
                      if                by
                                         the 100 miles, the extra pro
fit will be 3/. Si. on every 100 miles.        .
    Mr. Matthews has wisely resolved to employ the coach-builders
 which the coach-masters now employ             :this will tend much to
prevent   that opposition  to  the introduction     of this improvement,
which    would  otherwise  arise from   interested individuals.
                                 ANTIQUITIES.
   The, following particulars respecting some discoveries made
upon the estate of EbenezeT Hollick Esq. of Whittlesford, at a
place called Got Moor, between Whittlesford and Triplow, two
miles from Newton, are copied from the Cambridge Chronicle                  :
   Mr. Hollick employed some labourers to level three ancient
tumuli upon Got Moor, called The Chronicle Hills, vith view
to the improvement of his land.      These tumuli stood in     line   a a
nearby  North  and South,  upon  the  North side of   brook asepa
rating the parishes of Triplow and Whittlesford. The old road

,   Which the workmen are now removing.            Its length was 4 rods ;
    its thickness  30   inches,  and  it  had  three  abutments upon its
    eastern side. Beyond this     wall,  at the distance of 12 rods to the
    east, was found an ancient ivell made with chinch, 9 feet in dia
    meter, full of flints and tiles of a curious shape, so formed as to
    lap over each other. Some of these tiles had afiole in the centre ; m
    and, from their general appearance, it was believed that tbeyibatti
    been used in an aqueduct.       In this well were found two bucks'
    or elks' horns, of very large size. Upon opening the tumuli, the
    workmen removed; from the larger one, Jour hurhan skeletons,
    which were found lying upon their backs, about two feet from the
    bottom.     Some broken pieces of terra cotta, with red and with
    black glazing, were found in opening the tumuli, heaped among
    the earth, which, from the nature of the workmanship, seemed.
    to be Roman, but this is uncertain. In opening the northern tu
    mulus, and in removing the wall upon its eastern side, such- atti
    innumerable quantity of the bones of a small quadruped was found,
    that they were actually stratified to the depth of four inches, so
    that the workmen took out whole shovels filled with these bones ;
    and the same were also found near other sepulchres about a
    hundred yards to the north of The Chronicle Hills.             The most
    singular circumstance    is, that there   is no living animal now in
    the country, to which these bones, thus deposited      by  millions, may
    be anatomically referred. The bones of the jaw correspond With
    those of the castor, or beaver, as found in        a fossil state in the
    bogs near Chatteris ;   but the first are incomparably smaller. Like
    those of the beaver they are furnished with two upper and two
    lower incisors, and with four grinders on each side. Nothing like
    these minute bones has, however, been yet known to exist in a
    fossil state. One of the Professors of this University, after a     care
    ful examination of the spot, believing them to have belonged to
    the Lemming, which sometimesdescends in moving myriads from
    the mountains of Lapland, transmitted several of them to London
    to Sir Joseph Banks, and to Sir Everard Home, who have con
    firmed his conjecture. According to these gentlemen, there exists
    at present a  creature of this species called  a Shrew Mouse, which
    is exceedingly destructive to young plantations. About two years
    ago the Commissioners of Forests wrote to Sir Joseph Banks to
    know what could be done to get rid of them.            Acolony of these
    animals may have been hemmed in          by some flood, and, being all
    of. them drowned, were perhaps thus huddled together in one
      Before we conclude this article, we have also to add, that about
    100 yards from the north of The Chronicle Hills, there were found
                                                                   two

two other sepulchres, in which human skeletons were found in
soroi, constructed of flints and pebbles, put together with fine
gravel.     These soroi were surrounded each by a circular wall 2f
feet thick, and about 3 feet high, 22 feet in diameter. The whole
were covered beneath mounds of earth, which rose in hills about
2 feet above the soroi, having been probably diminished in height
by long pressure and the effect of rains. — In the first soros (which
was 5 feet square and 8 feet deep, brought to a point with peb
bles,) were found two skeletons. The uppermost appeared to be
of larger size.       Under the skull was found the blade of a
poignard     or knife. The head of this skeleton rested upon the
body of the other.      The soros was full of dirt ; and patches of a
 white unctuous substance, like spermaceti, adhered to the flints.
 It had an oak bottom, black as ink, but stained with the green
oxide of copper, owing to the decomposition of an ancient bronze
 vessel, very small parts of which have been removed to this Uni
 versity, and analysed; the composition consisting, as usual in an
 cient bronze, of an alloy of copper and tin, in the proportion of 88
 of the former to 12 of the latter. Large iron nails, reduced al
 most to an oxide, were also found here. In the other soros (which
 was 4 feet square within its circular wall, and 8 feet deep,) a
 human skeleton was found ; and another below it in a sitting
 posture, with an erect spear, the point of which was of iron.
 Nails were found here, but no wood, as in the other soros. Here
 the small quadruped bones were found in great abundance. The
 skull of the sitting figure was stolen by one of the labourers, and
 carried to his own cottage at Whittlesford : it had every tooth
 perfect.     The robbery has given rise to a very amusing instance
 of superstition ; for it is maintained at Whittlesford, that the
  headless skeleton of an ancient warrior knocks every night at the
 door of this cottager, demanding the skull sacrilegiously stolen from
  his grave.
     Much more might be added respecting the antiquities of Got
  Moor, and of The Chronicle Hills. Many gentlemen of the Uni
  versity have resorted to the spot to gratify their curiosity.    The
  mode of burial exhibited by those antient sepulchres, added to the
  fact of the bronze reliques found within one of them, and also that
  no Roman coins have ever been discovered among the other ruins,
  plead strongly for the superior antiquity of the people here in
  terred ; and lead to a conclusion, that The Chronicle Hills were
  rather Celtic than Roman tombs.
                             THE RAINBOW.
     According to the Newtonian hypothesis, this phenomenon is
  occasioned by the refraction of the sun's rays by drops of rain in
  the quarter in which the bow is seen.        Dr. Watt, of Glasgow,
                                                                     has

    Magnetizing Power of Violet Rays. — The Mississippi.          155
has suggested a more satisfactory theory, being less at variance
with facts ; for the rainbow is often seen where no rain is falling.
He, like Newton, makes the effect to depend upon refraction :
but he ascribes the refraction to the rays coming through the
lower edge of a cloud posited between the beholder and the sun,
which, acting like the prism, divides the rays of light, and exhi
bits on the dark opposite sky, as on a curtain, a portion of the
solar spectrum.       The cause and effect which he points out are
so closely connected, that, especially after a little practice, the
appearance of the bow may often, from the state of the clouds,
be predicted with great certainty.
               MAGNETIZING     POWER OF VIOLET RAYS.
     The discovery of M. Morichini respecting the power which
was doubted by many, has been confirmed by Professor Playfair;
who gives the following account of an experiment which he wit
nessed : —
     " After having received into my chamber a solar ray, through
a circular opening made in the shutter, the ray was made to fall
upon a prism, such as tfiose which are usually employed in expe
riments upon the primitive colours. The spectrum which resulted
from the refraction was received upon askreen ; all the rays were
 intercepted except the violet, in which was placed a needle for
 the purpose of being magnetized. It was a plate of thin steel, se
 lected from a number of others, and which, upon making the
 trial, was found to possess no polarity, and not to exhibit any at
 traction for iron filings. It was fixed horizontally on the support
 by means of wax, and in such a direction as to cut the magnetic
 meridian nearly at right angles.      By a lens of a sufficient size,
 the whole of the violet ray was collected into a focus, which was
 carried slowly along the needle, proceeding from the centre to
 wards one of the extremities, and always the same extremity ;
 taking care, as is the case in the common operation of magne
 tizing, never to go back in the opposite direction.       After ope
 rating fifty-five minutes, the needle was found to be strongly
 magnetic ; it acted powerfully on the compass, the end of the
 needle which had received the influence of the violet ray repelling
  the north pole, and the whole of it attracting, and keeping sus
 pended, a fringe of iron filings."

 for the purpose of exploring the productions of the numerous ri

                           EARTHQUAKE.
   On the 8th of January several violent shocks of an earthquake
were felt at Genoa. Many of the inhabitants quitted their dwell
ings, and fled into the country.  The direction of the shocks was
from Port Maurice to Saint Romi.       Nothing of the kind was felt
either at Nice or at Alassio. In the two former towns the damage
was very considerable.     From the great agitation of the vessels,
it would appear that the shocks were far more violent in the sea
than even on the land.
                      DIMINUTIVE VOLCANO.
  A   letter from Jamaica of the 12th December states, that a
volcano has been discovered on Prince George's Estate in the
neighbourhood of the Indian River, in the parish of St. John ;
which is represented as one of the greatest curiosities in nature.
Its perpendicular height from the base is 6 feet ; circumference
of the base 49 feet ; and that of the crater 2 feet 2 inches.

   Accounts from the banks of the Mississippi state, that the
mammoth has been discovered actually in existence, in the west

given of it, this colossus of the animal kingdom is not carnivo
rous ; it lives on vegetables, but more particularly on a certain
species of tree, of which it eats the leaves, the bark, and even the
trunk. It never lies down, and sleeps leaning for support against
a tree. It has rather the shape of a wild boar than of an elephant,
and is fifteen feet high. His body is covered by a hairy skin, and
he has no horn.             •

 XXVI.     Account   of Experiments        made on the Strength of Ma
    terials.   By    George Rennie jun. Esq.               In a Letter to
    Thomas Young, M.D. For. Sec. R.S*                      With Notes by
    Mr. T. Tredgold.
                                                    London, June 3. 1817.
                   n presenting you the result of the following ex
 periments, I trust I shall not be considered as deviating from my
subject, in taking a cursory view of the labours of others.             The
knowledge of the properties of bodies which come more imme
diately under our observation, is so instrumental to the progress
of science, that any approximation to it deserves our serious at
 tention.    The passage over a deep and rapid river, the construc
tion of a great and noble edifice, or the combination of a more
complicated piece of mechanism, are arts so peculiarly subser
vient to the application of these principles, that we cannot be
said to proceed with safety and certainty, until we have assigned
 their just limits.    The vague results on which the more refined
 calculations of many of the most eminent writers are founded,
have given rise to such a multiplicity of contradictory conclusions,
 that it is difficult to choose, or distinguish the real from that
which is merely specious.            The connexions are frequently so
distant, that little reliance can be placed on them.             The Roval
 Society appears    to  have   instituted,  at an  early period, some ex
periments on this subject, but they have recorded little to aid us.
Emerson, in his Mechanics, has laid down a number of rules
and approximations.          Professor Robison in his excellent treatise
in the Encyclopedia Brilannica ; Banks on the Power of Ma
chines; Dr Anderson of Glasgow; Colonel Beaufoy, &c. are
those, amongst our countrymen, who have given the result of
their experiments on wood and iron.               The subject, however,
appears to have excited considerable attention on the continent.
A theory was published in the year 1638, by Galileo, on the re
sistance of solids, and subsequently by many other philosophers.
But however plausible these investigations appeared, they were
more theoretical than practical, as will be seen in the sequel.
It is only by deriving a theory from careful and well directed ex
periments, that practical results can be obtained.             It would be
useless to enumerate the labours of those philosophers, who in
following, or varying from the steps of Galileo, have merely
tended to obscure a subject respecting which they had no data
to proceed upon.       It is sufficient to enumerate the names of those
who, in conjunction with our own countrymen, have added their
labours to the little knowledge we possess.           The experiments of

Buffon, recorded in the Annals of the. Academy of Sciences at
Paris, in the years i1 740 ,tnd 1741, were on a scale sufficiently
large to justify every conclusion, had he not omitted to ascertain
the direct and absolute strength of the timber employed.         It
however appeared from his experiments, that the strength of the
ligneous fibre is nearly in proportion to the specific gravity.

might   be deemed     presumption in me, to offer you     communica            a

combination of its parts are more the result of uncertain rules
than sound principle, will soon find how scanty         our knowledge     is
on   asubject  so  highly important.    The desire of  obtaining some
approximation,      which could only be accomplished           repeated            by
trials on the substances themselves, induced me to undertake the
following experiments.
                   Description    of the Apparatus. (Plate II.)
  A   bar of the best English iron, about ten feet long, was se
lected and formed into    lever (whose fulcrum

The hole was accurately bored, and the pin turned, which suf
fered    to move freely.

when Dr. T. Young published his Lectures, there was little on the subject
besides the intricate, and    Imay add unsatisfactory, investigations of Euler
and Lagrange.      As to the resistance to fracture, which with the greater
part of mechanical writers       the only ohject attended to,
                                 is                                  of very in it

ground.    The lever was accurately divided in its lower edge,
which was made straight in a line with the fulcrum. A point,
or division (D), was selected, at five inches from the fulcrum,
at which place was let in a piece of hardened steel.  The lever
was balanced by the balance weight             (E), and in this state it            was
ready for operation.          But in order to keep it    as level as possible,
a hole was drilled through a projection             on the bed plate, large
enough to admit a stout bolt easily through                   it,
                                                            which again was
prevented from turning in the hole             by  means of       tongue
                                                                    a              (t  )
fitting into corresponding groove in the hole.
               a                                              So that, in or
der to preserve the level, we had only to move the nut to elevate
or depress the bolt, according to the size of the specimen.                  But
as an inequality    of   pressure    would   still arise from   the   nature   of
the apparatus, the body to be examined             was   placed  between     two
pieces of steel, the pressure being communicated through the
medium of two pieces of thick leather above aud below the steel
pieces,   by  which means        a more equal contact of surfaces was
attained*. The scale was hung on loop of iron, touching the
                                            a
                                                                                            *
lever in an edge only.          I at first used       arope for the balance
weight, which indicated         a friction of four pounds, but            chain
                                                                              a
diminished the friction one half.              Every moveable centre was
well oiled. Of the resistances opposed to the simple strains which
may disturb the quiescent state of         a   body, the principal are the
repulsive   force, whereby      it resists  compression, and the force of
cohesion, whereby       it  resists   extension.      On the former, with
the exception of the experiments of Gauthey and Roudelet, on
stones, and    a few others, on soft substances, there            scarcely any
                                                                    is
thing on record.       In the memoir of M. Lagrange, on the force
of springs, published in the year 1760, the moment of elasticity
is  represented
                   by
                   a    constant quantity, without indicating the re
lation  of this value to the size of the spring but in the memoir
                                                          :
of the year 1770, on the forms of columns, where he considers a
body whose dimensions and thickness are variable, he makes the
moment of elasticity proportional to the fourth power of the ra
dius, in observing the relations of theory and practice to accord
with each other.       This was admitted         by  Euler in his memoir of
   * This machine must have had           considerable          of friction,
                                      a               degree              and
Mr.  Rennie has not, apparently, attempted to determine the quantity               :   it
must however have been very considerable         inthe high pressures.   The
lever turned upon a pin similar to that used     by
                                                 Gauthey. (Rozier's Journal
dePhysique, torn. iv. p. 403), which Perronet found to have much friction
and to cause much irregularity.      To remedy the defects of this machine
another was contrived    by Rondelet, in which he attempted, and      appearsit
successfully, to obviate the most material defects of the old machine. The
action was more equal on the compressed surface, and          more accurate

  164                      Account      of Experiments         made
  1780, in his elaborate investigation of the forms of columns.
 Mr. Coulomb had however shown before that time, how inap
 plicable all these calculations              were to columns under common
 circumstances        ;  and you, sir, have repeated the observation in
 yourlectures on natural philosophy.                    The results of experiments
 have also been equally discordant ; since it is deduced from those
 of Reynolds, that the power required to crush a cubic quarter of
 an inch of cast iron is 448000 lbs. avoirdupoise, or 200 tons;
 whereas by the average of thirteen experiments made by me on
 cubes of the same size, the amount never exceeded 10392-53 lbs.
 not quite five tons*. This may be seen by referring to the tables.
"There were four kinds of iron used, viz. 1st. Iron taken from the
 Centre of a large block, whose crystals were similar in appear
 ance and magnitude to those evinced in the fracture of what is
 usually termed gun-metal.                 2dly. Iron taken from a small cast
 ing,   close    grained,     and    of  a  dull gray colour. 3dly. Iron cast
 horizontally      in   bars  of  -|th  inches    square, 8 inches long.           4thly.
 Iron cast vertically, same size as last. These castings were re
 duced equally on every side to 5 of an inch square : thus re
 moving the hard external coat usually surrounding metal castings.
 They were all subjected to a gauge. The bars were then pre
 sumed to be tolerably uniform.                  The weights used were of the
 best kind that could be procured, and as the experiment ad
 vanced, smaller weights were used.

   The anomaly between the three first experiments on $ cubes,
and the two second of a different length, can only be accounted
for, on the difficulty of reducing such small specimens to an
equality.    The experiments on § inch prisms of different lengths
give no ratio.      The experiments on \ inch cubes, taking an
average of the three first in each, give a proportion between them
and the three on
                .

                  as 1 i 8-035 in the vertical ditto
in several cases the proportion is as the cubes.
   The vertical cube castings are stronger than the horizontal
cube castings.
   The prisms usually assumed a curve similar to a curve of the
third order, previous to breaking.
   The experiments on the different metals give no satisfactory
such as the position of the specimen, the form of its surfaces, and the in
equality of the different specimens — which were so extremely small that
it would be scarcely possible to obtain any tolerable degree of accuracy.
    Gauthey's experiments exhibit a like irregularity, indicating no relation
between the height of the piece and its resistance (Rozier's Journal, tome iv.
p. 407.) It appears probable that when the fracture is of that kind where
the body decomposes into pyramids, the length does not influence the re
sult, provided that the piece be long enough to admit of the free motion
of the fractured parts.   I imagine that hard cast-iron breaks into pyramids,
but the nature of the fracture Mr. Rennie has not stated. Probably it was
so soft as to break in the manner of flexible bodies, in which, though the
forces must act according to some regular law, it is difficult to trace their
operation in a continuous solid. — T. T.
   * The degree of compression of these bodies having been observed, we
might conclude that the height of the modulus of elasticity might be ob
tained from these experiments. This however is not the case; and so far
proves that the strain is not of that simple kind which it has been supposed
to be.   The reduction of length might he easily measured, even in hard
bodies, by an apparatus for multiplying its extent; and it would throw
much light on the subject, to reduce pieces of the same length, but of dif
ferent areas, to a given length.    Such a set of experiments would be in
finitely more valuable than those on the fracture, and much more easily
made, as the apparatus would be easier to manage.
   The inportance of the laws of stiffness over those of strength has been
ably stated by Dr. Young, (Lectures on Natural Philosophy, vol.     and what
                                                                   i.)
he has stated in favour of stiffness applies equally to the mode of experi
mentingI   now recommend, which could not fail of establishing some im
portant practical rules. — T. T.

                      on the Strength of Materials.                      167
results.     The difficulty consists in assigning a value to the dif
ferent degrees of diminution.         When compressed beyond a cer
tain thickness, the resistance becomes enormous.
                Experiments on the Suspension of Bars.
    The lever was used as in the former case, but the metals were
held by nippers, as indicated in the drawing No. 2.            They were
made of wrought iron, and their ends adapted to receive the
bars, which, by being tapered at both extremities, and increasing
in diameter from the actual section (if I may so express it), and
the jaws of the nippers being confined by a hoop, confined both.
The bare, which were six inches long, and | square, were thus
fairly and firmly' grasped.

sured, it appears to have been greatest at the middle of the length, and to

  168               Account    of Experiments       made
    The experiment made by M. Prony (which asserts, that by
 making a slight incision with the file, the resistance is diminished
 one half,) was tried on a £ inch bar of English iron; the result
 was 2920 lbs.,    not a sixth part less.
    This single   experiment, however, does not sufficiently disprove
 the authority    of that able philosopher, for an incision is but a
 vague term.      The incision I made might be about the 40th part
 of an inch.
               Experiments on the Twist of \ Inch Bars.
    To  effect the operation of twisting off a bar, another appa
ratus was prepared : it consisted of a wrought-iron lever two feet
 long, having an arched head about 1 -6th of a circle, of four feet
diameter, of which the lever represented the radius, the centre
round which it moved had a square hole made to receive the end
of the bar to be twisted.        The lever was balanced as before, and
a scale hung on the arched head ; the other end of the bar being
fixed in a square hole in a piece of iron, and that again in a vice.
The undermentioned weights represent the quantity of weight
put into the scale.

   Dr. Thomson has remarked (Annals of Philosophy, vol. xii. p. 450), that
the strengths of Knglish and Swedish iron are not in the same proportion, as
is found by comparing Count sickengen's with that described in the Annals
for April 1816.           I
                  But, if do not mistake, Sickengen's was made on wire,
and consequently would be higher, as the strength is always much increased
by forging, wire-drawing, &c. — T. T.

  been difficult to have. done 90 in the longer pieces.          Some experiments on

     In the horizontal castings of different lengths, the balance is
in favour of the increased lengths ; but in the vertical castings, it
is the reverse.       In neither is there any apparent ratio.            In the
horizontal castings at 6 inches from the bearing, there is a visi
ble increase, but not so great as when close to the bearing.

             experiments on woods are considerably below those of other
writers; and it appears singular that the four-inch specimen should be
stronger than the shorter length.     According to Rondelet's experiments, to
crush a cubic inch of oak it required from 5000 to 6000 lbs. avoirdupoise

      Gauthey tried the stones in different positions in respect to their na
tural beds; but from a general view of his experiments it does not appear
that he was correct in concluding them to be stronger when " pastes en de-
lit" because his comparison is made between means that include sections
of very different forms. (Kozier's Journ. tome iv. p. 406.) — T. T.

   X Mr. Rennie has of course taken the specific gravity in the usual manner,
but certainly not the real specific gravity of the stone in any of the porous
ones, though it may be that of the material the stone is composed of. When
a stone is porous — and many building stones are very much so — it will he
found that the specific gravity as usually obtained, is not the weight of a
cubic foot in ounces avoirdupoise, which it certainly ought to be, and par
ticularly where the information is intended for the use of practical men.
If Mr. Rennie were to try any of his specimens, he would find the weight
of a cubic foot much below the numbers he has given in the case of brick,
oolite, and sandstones.     The specific gravity of a minute concretion of
Portland stone may he 2.432, or as Kirwail has it 2.461, but that of the
stone itself is much lower.
   Were the real specific gravity of porous stones taken, their comparative
heaviness   would become a more decisive mineral character than it is ac
cording to the present method, and the correction presents no difficulty. —
                                                                        T. T.

172                   Account       of Experiments     made
                                    Remarks.
    In observing the results presented by the preceding table, it will
be seen that little dependence can be placed on the specific gra
vities of stones, so far as regards their repulsive powers, although
the increase is certainly in favour of their specific gravities.  But
there would appear to be some undefined law in the connexion
of bodies, with which the specific gravity has little to do. Thus,
statuary marble has a specific gravity above Aberdeen granite,
yet a repulsive power not much above half the latter.           Again,
hardness is not altogether a characteristic of strength, inasmuch
as the limestones, which yield readily to the scratch, have never
theless a repulsive power approaching to granite itself*.
    It is a curious fact in the rupture of amorphous stones, that
pyramids are formed, having for then- base the upper side of the
cube next the lever, the action of which displaces the sides of
the cubes, precisely as if a wedge had operated between them.
I have preserved a number of the specimens, the sides of which,
if continued, might cut the cubes in the direction of their dia
gonals.

   * A curious circumstance was observed
                                               by Rondelet in his experiments ;
viz. that the blocks from the middle of a stratum of stone were of a higher
specific gravity than those taken either from the upper or lower part of the
stratum. The stones were from Clmtillon, Bagneux,&c.           He also observed,
that m the same kind of stone the strength was as the cube of the specific
gravity. (L'Art de Bdtir, tome iii. p 83, et stth.) That any relation should
exist between the specific travity and strength of stones of different kinds
was not to be expected, as the strength depends on other properties. — T.T.
   t It is in tliese experiments that we have most to regret the want of obser
vations, and those of a nature that would have added little to the labour which
all who make such experiments must undergo.          It is however a labour that
is to a mind eifgaged in the search of knowledge, more pleasing than those
unaccustomed to such feelings can conceive.        But too often it is a pleasure
that cannot be pursued, except at an expense and encroachment on the
hours of business which a professional man can ill afford to indulge in.
The defect of these experiments consists in the want, of observations on the
flexure produced by given weights, particularly in the first degrees of de
flexion; and it is the more to be regretted, because we have very few ex
periments on cast-iron where such observations have been made. Banks
states that his specimens bent about an inch at the time of fracture; and
Dr. Young has calculated the height of the modulus of elasticity from this
statement, (Nat. Phil. vol.   it. art. 320); but it   iswell known that the de
flexion   is not regular when the piece  is nearly broken.    In Banks's experi

   N. B. All these bars contained the same area, though dif
ferently distributed as to their forms.
merits on curved bars the deflexion is given, but the thickness of the bars
is not stated. It is true ftondelet has made some experiments on cast-iron
where the successive deflexions were registered, but these experiments are
not very regular; besides, it would be desirable to have experiments on
British iron.
  As   I have two experiments by me,       I
                                           shall take this opportunity of laying
them   before your readers. A bar of cast-iron, from a Welsh foundry,
which did not yield easily to the file, was laid upon supports exactly three
feet apart; the bar was an inch square, and when 308 lbs. were put into a
scale suspended from the middle of its length the deflexion was found to
be 3-16ths of an inch; whence the height of the modulus of elasticity is
6,386,688 feet. The experiment was made by Mr. It. Ebbels, at Gamons,
near Hereford.      A joist of cast-iron 9 inches deep, resembling in form the
letter I, was laid upon supports 19 feet apart, first on its edge, when the
deflexion from its own weight was 3-40ths of an inch.           It was then laid
flatwise, and the di flexion from its own weight was ?i inches. The castings
were from Messrs. Dowson's foundry, Edgware-road.              The iron yielded
easily to the file. The height of the modulus of elasticity according to the
experiment on the joist flatwise is         5,100,000 feet
                            on the edge is 5,700,000       .  —
The deflexion being very small when the joist was on its edge, perhaps it
was not measured with the necessary degree of accuracy, as a very small
error would cause the difference in the result. The following tablet con

.taken. out of it.      The parabolic bar came near it.
     The bar made fast at both ends, I suspect must have yielded,
 although the ends were made fast by iron straps. The experi
 ments from Emerson, on solids of different forms, might be made ;
 but the time and trouble these experiments have already cost,
 have compelled me to relinquish further pursuits for the present.
 If, however, in the absence of better, they are worthy of the in
 dulgence of the Royal Society, it will not only be a consolation
 to me that my labours merit their attention, but a further in
 ducement to prosecute the investigation of useful facts, which,
 even in the present advanced state of knowledge, will yet admit

 have been undertaken by Mr. Peter Barlow, of the Royal Mili

  to have been made before the Royal Society; and there can be no doubt
  that a favourable reception will be given to any others that will tend to
  elucidate a subject, which is likely to lorm one of the principal branches
  of an engineer's education ; as he must either proceed on the principle

 XXVII.     Dissertation on the Origin and the uniform Distribu
    tion of minimal Heat.        By Professor Van Mons, of Lou-
    vain *.
That      union of functions which constitutes animal life can only
have effect at a certain degree of temperature.      These functions
consist in a succession of compositions and decompositions, which
take place according to laws modified by the vital influence, whose
foundation is in caloric.
    Persons have occasionally remarked, that the temperature of
their bodies was different from that of the medium in which they
lived, and they have sought to discover the cause of this differ
 ence.
    The philosophers of antiquity touched pretty nearly upon this
cause, when they admitted " that by the identification of the air
with the blood, this liquid becomes improved, and assumes aspi-
ritous nature, from which result heat and pulsation." These are
their own words.
    More recent speculators, either losing sight of these opinions
of the ancients or interpreting them very badly, have wandered
much further from the truth, and given themselves up to systems
more or less absurd ; one of the most in vogue of which has been,
that which attributes the development of animal heat to the fric
tion of the blood against the sides of the sanguiferous vessels. —
These systems having no longer any partisans, do not stand in
need of refutation.
    It was necessary that modern chemistry should shed its light
upon the secrets of physiology, in order to give a just idea of the
mechanism of respiration, and to deduce from it the true origin
of animal heat.
    Mayo and other chemists had perceived a strong analogy be
tween the process of combustion and that of respiration ; but it
was reserved for French chemistry to place the phaenomena of this
last process in its full light.
    The authors of the new theory of respiration believed for a long
time, that there takes place in the lungs a direct and complete
combustion of carbon and of the hydrogen of the blood by the
oxygen gas inspired ; and that the caloric disengaged by that com
bustion, after having gasified the carbonic acid, and evaporated
the water, unites itself to the blood in order to be transferred into
the circulation and furnish the animal heat.
    But on the supposition that matters were thus arranged, the
cavity of the thorax would have a temperature much superior to
that of other parts of the body, and would serve in some sort as a

heating stove.     It was easy to make sure of the real state of the
fact, hy introducing a thermometer into the thorax of a living ani
mal. The experiment was made, and scarcely any greater degree
of heat was observed.
    It was at first endeavoured to explain this contradiction by
supposing that all the caloric which is separated from the air is
absorbed in order to gasify the carbonic acid and evaporate the
water, a supposition which many foreign physiologists still ad
mit, although it is known that carbonic gas becomes condensed
with scarcely any elevation of temperature, and may also be gasi
fied without absorbing almost any heat, and that the ordinary
temperature of bodies with the aid of the suspending affinity of
the air is more than sufficient for the evaporation of water, as is
proved by cutaneous transpiration, and other evaporations which
are produced by natural heat alone.
   Abandoning therefore this theory, which did not besides furnish
any reason for the uniform distribution of animal heat, nor ex
plain, any more than the experiments opposed to                   it,

of that heat, another was had recourse to, but equally unsatisfac
tory — allude to the theory of changed capacities.
        I
      should have passed over this theory also without observation,
 it I
if    had not been in our own days revived         all its original purity
                                                        in
 by  men  of  merit,  and   ifphysiologists   of the   first rank had not
united  it with the theory of combustion.
   This theory supposes between the venous and arterial bloods a
great difference of capacity, in virtue of which the latter takes up
and combines, without any rise of temperature, the whole quan
tity of caloric which      set free
                           is          the combustion of carbon and
                                              by
the hydrogen of venous blood, and           founds this supposition on
                                                   it
the medium of the caloric contained in the two bloods, and of the
air inspired and inhaled.
   As this difference of capacity depends on the different nature
of the two bloods,    itought to change in proportion as                by
                                                                   the ef
fect of circulation the arterial blood approaches to the nature of
the venous blood, and        ought to resolve itself in the same de
                                it
gree with the caloric which spreads itself uniformly through all
parts of bodies.
   This theory, which seems to remove the two great difficulties
of the theory of direct combustion, the permanence of the tem
perature of the cavity of the thorax, and the equal distribution
of heat,     however contradicted
            is                                 by
                                         many facts, as we shall now
proceed to prove.
    In the first place, nothing establishes this change of capacity
which the venous blood         supposed to undergo
                                 is                          in

  178                Dissertation on the Origin and the
 in the physical nature of blood should lead to a change so consi
  derable in respect of its capacity for caloric.
     The measure of this capacity has been taken after a change re
  sulting from a chemical action, while the true capacity is the re
  presentation of the quantities of caloric which bodies of different
  natures require in order to attain an equal temperature without
  any change of form.         The same erroneous sort of estimation has
  been followed with respect to air inspired and exhaled.
       In every change of the capacity of a body, the caloric ought to
  set itself free at least for some instants ; but no such thing oc
  curs in the case of which we are now treating.
       We might further object to the supporters of this theory, that
  that development of caloric which they suppose to result from
  the adhesion of assimilating principles, is amply compensated by
  the cold which is produced, as well by the solids which become
  liquefied as by those liquids which assume the state of vapour, so
  that, in their final result, these operations ought to be rather a
'
  source of cold than heat to animals. Besides, the little heat de
  veloped in cold-blooded animals, among whom this solidification
  of liquids also takes place, proves how little this ought to be con
  sidered as an active mean in the production of animal heat.
      It is still necessary, then, to return to the theory of combustion,
  in order to explain the theory of animal heat; but to this theory
  considered in a point of view different from what has been hi
   therto done.       The oxygen gas condensed in the lungs forms un
  doubtedly all the caloric which maintains the body at its habitual
   temperature, and famishes besides, to the liquids of cutaneous
   perspiration and other exhalations, the heat which evaporates
   them ; but this condensation takes place by means of a particular
   mechanism which we shall now explain.
       Oxygen gas is the only body of a nature amply provided with
   caloric chemically combined, and which does not lose by any pres
  sure or diminution of temperature ; it does not yield this prin
   ciple but to the strongest attraction exercised on its base by some
   other body, and it yields it only by degrees, and on account of the
   force of that attraction.       It becomes therefore decomposed by
   retaining different portions of caloric, so as to form ternary com
   pounds of combustible substance, of oxygen, and of caloric.
   It is only by having neglected this property of oxygen gas, so par
   ticular and so fertile in its results, that philosophers have not hi
   therto been able to give a satisfactory explanation of the produc
   tion and uniform distribution of animal heat.
        The venous blood is distinct from the arterial blood in this, that
   the latter is provided with principles constituted in such a man
   ner as to be able to serve far the nutrition of organs, while the
                                                                   former

 former is in some manner a vehicle or exhausted residuum of the
 same principles.       It may, in this respect, be compared to a soil'
 which vegetation has deprived of all its nourishing juice.
     In fact, the portion of carbon and of hydrogen put into play
 by the effect of respiration, appears in the venous blood to be re
 duced nearly to its last state of composition, at least to a state
 very near to it. This state         in respect of these two principles,
                                       is,
 their combination saturated with oxygen, the first in carbonic acid
 and the second in water, which forms at the same time the result
 of their greatest affinity.      These principles thus enchained can
 no longer enter into new combinations.                                           1
     The arterial blood, on the contrary,        rich in principles slightly

 with a    triple base, which, owing      its existence     to equibalancing
 affinities, can at every instant    be  broken in     its  combination     by  a
 slight affinity, and such as can exercise upon              all the power of
                                                                  it

     But as soil exhausted of its juices only requires to receive the
 materials proper for the formation of these juices, and to be
 brought at the same time into contact .with the air, in order to-
resume all its nutritious properties so           ;like manner the venous

blood charged with chyle and lymph, only requires to receive the
 same contact in the lungs, in order to become again able to fur

                                                                       I
if,  except in the case of disease, this blood might not even be con

                                                                       ;

decomposition of these liquids.
    However this last supposition may be, still              appears certain
                                                                  it
that the venous blood only presents to the air determined quan   a
tity of nutritive juice that this juice, before entering into the

lungs, forms   a   compound of carbon, hydrogen and azote, which
the contact of the air oxidizes, and which, in virtue of its compli
cated composition, possesses the property of attaching itself to
the oxygen gas, while        ithardly disturbs its union with caloric.
The latter effect takes place in virtue of affinities which counter
balance each other, and which on the one hand have carbon for
their agent, and on the other hydrogen united to azote. The
effect of this counterbalancing        to prevent the oxygen from com
                                         is

   The fact of this equi- balanced attraction may        be easily com
prehended in spite of the intervention of a substance, such as car
bon, which exhibits in itself so powerful an attraction for oxygen.
 It is sufficient to reflect that this substance is here destitute of
the degree of heat necessary for acting with efficacy on the base
of oxygen gas, and that the union of two combustibles, especially
when they are both disposed to assume the gaseous state, in
creases considerably their affinity with that base. I believe even
that in this case the carbon requires to be united to a small por
tion of hydrogen, in order to be assisted in its attraction for the
oxygen, and that the azoto-hydrogenous compound requires, on
the same principle, a little carbon in order to retain its identity.
    It is easy to perceive what ought to be the effect of the circu
lation of a compound thus constituted, and in which the oxygen
remains charged with nearly the»whole of its immense provision
of caloric.     It is unnecessary to state, that the affinity of the as
similating power for one or other, or for the whole of these prin
ciples, must very soon destroy that combination, and that the oxy
gen disengaged from those channels which prevented it from en-
teringinto a moresolid combination, must either contract a similar
union, partly with the hydrogen which only decomposes it par
tially, and partly with the carbon which extracts from it the greatest
possible quantity of caloric, or that it must be itself assimilated ;
and that in either of these cases it must lose by little and little
that caloric which a slighter affinity had permitted it to preserve.
This decomposition occurs principally in the extremities of the
arterial vessels, and is perhaps continued, though with less energy,
and by ways as yet little known, after the arteries are reunited
 with the veins, and until the return of the blood to the heart.
    We may conclude then, that in all those functions which de
pend on decompositions and compositions by chemical affinity,
(and there are few which are not in this situation,) the undecom-
posed oxygen continues to consume, more or less completely, one
or other of the combustible substances which form the base of
animal composition. It must be necessary accordingly that there
should be a disengagement of caloric every where, or a similar ac-.
tion takes place, either by the oxygen of the oxidized blood, or
by that which is separated from the water when that action passes
beyond the sphere of circulation.
    The action of vegetable life differs from that of animal life in
this respect ; that in the first the assimilation is effected by the
condensation of the carbon and hydrogen with a disengagement
of oxygen ; and that in the latter every thing is effected by the
intervention, and by a more solid condensation, of this principle.

  XXVIII.     On the Proteus      (Proteus anguinus).    By M. Ru
                               dolphi *.
Xt    has been for a long time supposed that this singular animal
is only to be found in the lake of     Sittich in Carniola, and that
it only issues from it in the case     of inundations ; but M. Ru-
 dolphi some time ago discovered it in the grotto of St. Madeleine,
 about a league from Adelsberg ; and it may be also now found in
 some lakes and ponds, in sufficient numbers to make it a matter
 of no difficulty to procure specimens.
    The manners and the habits of the Proteus have a great affi
 nity with those of the Salamander ; and hence has arisen the
 same prejudice with respect to it ; namely, that it announces
 changes in the atmosphere. When the weather is fine, it is gay
 and lively, and sometimes protrudes its snout out of the water;
 while in bad weather it remains tranquil at the bottom of any
 vase of water in which it may be kept.
    Although the eyes of the Proteus are very small, and covered
 with thick enough eyelids, they are extremely sensible to the light,
 a strong suffusion of which renders the animal extremely lively in
its movements.       The veins which present themselves in such
numbers to the naked eye, and still more abundantly to a mag
nifying glass, under the transparent skin of the animal, and
whence that secretion of viscous plaster with which they are so
profusely covered probably proceeds, seem to be expanded by
the action of the light.      It may, however, be so accustomed to
the light as to become less sensible in this respect.     M. Rudol-
phi mentions the case of a Proteus which had at the time of his
writing been kept for six months in a glass vase placed in the
window of a house, though partially in the shade..
    Although the Proteus will live for several years in water with
out any supply of food, there have been sometimes found in its
stomach, on dissection, the remains of periwinkles and other small
animals.
    The irritability of the Proteus is not great. M. Rudolphi has
in many instances cut off the tail from the trunk, and instantly
all motion ceased, even when galvanism was applied to excite               it,
while the dissevered parts of Salamanders ordinarily preserve their
irritability for some hours.
    M. Rudolphi   is led from this to hope that he may yet be able,
as he has still ten specimens of the animal alive, to establish some
important results on the reproductive power with respect to
which he has already made numerous experiments.

      The muscles of the Proteus are also very weak, nor is there
   any animal whose blood presents such large globules.     The lungs
   have a great resemblance to the nataloire bladder offish; whence
   M. Rudolphi infers that they probably contribute very little to
   the decarbonization of the blood ; and as the globules of the
  blood, from their large size, and consequently small number, offer
  necessarily less surface, he is further inclined to think that
  branches are indispensable.
      On dissecting four individuals recently caught, he found in one
 of them large ovaries communicating with the rectum ; and in
  another of twenty inches eight lilies in length, testicles of con
 siderable size with small epididymee.
     M. Rudolphi concludes from all these facts, that these animals
 are not of the species of bull-heads, but perfect animals.
 XXIX.      New experimental Researches on some of the leading
     Doctrines of Caloric ; particularly on the Relation between the
     Elasticity, Temperature, and latent Heat of different Va

-t)n thermometric Admeasurement, and the Doctrine        of Capacity.
 Before inquiring into the relative quantities of heat contained
 ib different vapours at the same tension, it will be proper to de
termine the primary and fundamental proposition concerning the
 measure of temperature.        It is singular, that not one experi
 mental fact has been advanced, capable of settling this ques
 tion, amid the contending opinions of chemical philosophers.
 Mr. Dalton has, in particular, exerted all the resources of his
 genius and science to destroy our confidence in the thermome
 tric scale ; our sole guide in the vast and intricate province of
 caloric. While I hope to be able to fix this now indeterminate'
 point, by a new train of investigations, and consequently to prove
 the entire fallacy of his doctrine of temperature, the key-stone of
 his system of heat, I do not mean to affirm the absolute unifor
 mity of expansion in bodies, by equal increments of that power.
  I think it indeed highly probable, that every species of matter,
 both solid and liquid, follows an increasing rate in its enlarge
 ment by caloric.       Each portion that enters into a body must
 weaken the antagonist force, cohesion ; and must therefore ren
 der more efficacious the operation of the next portion that is in
 troduced. Let 1000 represent the cohesive attraction at the com
                                                         mencement ;

         on some    of       the leading Doctrines    of Caloric, &c.           183
mencement ; then, after receiving one increment of caloric, it
will be become 1000— I =999.          Since the next unit of that di-
vellent agent will have to combat only this diminished cohesive
force, it will produce an effect greater than the first, in the
proportion of 1000 to 999 ; and so on in continued progression.
That the increasing ratio        however, greatly less than Mr. Dal-
                                       is,
ton maintains, may,       think, be clearly demonstrated.

    According to his table of equal increments of temperature,
vol.i.   p. 14, New System, we have the following intervals, cor
responding to the five successive intervals of 90° on our scale.

 Mr. Dalton's law, that " all pure homegeneous liquids, as water
and mercury, expand from the point of their congelation, or
greatest density,      quantity always as the square of the tempera
                        a
 ture from that point."     He regards the law as resulting from the
constitution of liquids, and therefore not applicable to solid
bodies.      This    indeed implied
                    is                   its enunciation.
                                                 in           In p. 43,
 after assigning reasons, he states, " that for all practical purposes
 we may adopt the notion of the equable expansion of solids."
     Now am prepared to prove, either, that the expansion of
         I
solids partakes of the above inequability of liquids, which nobody
 imagines, and for which no reason, even hypothetical, can be
 assigned  ;  or, which      the only alternative, that homogeneous
                                is
 solids, and mercury, proceed almost exactly, pari passu, in their
 rates of expansion bv heat.
    The ex periments which justify this assertion were made            me  by
 about five years ago, and were then exhibited to many of my
 chemical friends, as also in my public lectures          but ;   wish to
                                                                       a
 render the series more complete, has induced ine to withhold
 them from the public eye, till requisite leisure could be afforded
 for this purpose.      Thev were performed with a pyrometer of
  peculiar construction,       an oblong trough filled with melting
                                  in
  ice:
     a    strong bar of Swedish iron was placed, from which pro
 jected at right angles four inflexible iron arms, attachable by
  powerful screws to any part of the bar.       The arms nearest the
  extremities of the bar carried each a fine micrometer micro
 scope, made       that admirable artist Mr. Troughton.
                   by                                         The other
  two arms were incurvated downwards at their extremities, which
  supported a metallic or other rod.         This was fixed           two  by
  pinching screws at one end, but lay loose on       friction roller at
                                                          a
  the other. The loose end bore an elevated index. The curvature
  of these two arms was such as to allow their extremities, with
  the attached rod, to be plunged beneath the surface       oil or water,
                                                                  of

  184                   New experimental      Researches
  about an inch, contained in a copper trough.          This was placed
 parallel to the large trough, and a few inches distant from it.
     The copper vessel was slowly and equably heated, by a series
 of Argand lamps placed beneath. One micrometer watched a
 point projecting from the arm that held the fixed extremity of
 the rod.    The oil was carefully agitated during the application
 of the heat; and the bulbs of three thermometers, mutually com
 parable, were immersed into it at regular distances.           The mi
 crometers were screened from the influence of the heat.            They
 rendered the -j-irJ-irB- of an inch discernible, and even a smaller
 quantity, by an experienced eye.
    A rod of pure Swedish iron, or of such pure copper as jewel
 lers use for alloying gold, being adjusted to the apparatus, the
 point on the micrometer scale, that appeared a tangent to the
 small luminous aperture in the thin index plate of steel, was
 noted down, when the liquid in the trough was at 32°.               The
 value and truth of the micrometrical indications had been pre
 viously ascertained, by viewing through the microscopes a given
 surface or aperture, moved laterally, so as to make its image suc
 cessively coincide with the different points of the interior notched
 scale.                        /
     Heat being now applied, the progressive inarch of the index
 across the field of view of the micrometer microscope was closely
 observed, and its position written down at intervals of 10° or 20s
 of the Fahr. thermometer.         But as the pyrometrical details will
 appear in a separate memoir on the expansions of bodies, I shall
 state here merely what concerns the present subject.
    If we denominate the absolute elongation of the heated me
 tallic rod from 32° to 122°- 10, then its elongation from 122° to
 212°; from 212° to 302°; from 302° to 392°; from 392° to
-482°, was in each successive interval of 90° F. as nearly as pos
 sible 10 also.     The slight irregularities incident to all delicate
 experimental investigations being often in opposite directions,
in different repetitions of the same experiment, or those which
manifested themselves in the ascending or elongating range, were
 neutralized, so to speak, by others of an inverse nature, which
 appeared in the cooling retrocession.          Here, the movements of
 the liquid mercury and of the solid rod by heat proceeded, pari
passu, through a very great extent of temperature.           Let us now
 recollect that these five increments,which on our thermometer are
equivalent to 5 x 90° = 450°, and which altogether produce five
 times the elongation that the first interval occasions, constitute,
 on Mr. Dalton's scale, only 350°.          If we call the first interval
given by   this philosopher   1  -00, then the four succeeding intervals
 contain a range of temperature, on his scheme, of only two and
 a half times the first; and therefore only two and a half times
                                                               additional

         on some   of the leading Doctrines of Caloric, &c.           185
 additional elongation should have been produced, instead of four
 times as found by experiment.      " Since for all practical purposes
 uniform increments of bulk, or expansions of solids by heat, cor
 respond to uniform increments of this power;" then each of our
 old successive intervals of 90° may, for all practical purposes, be
 held to correspond to equal increments of temperature.
    Mr. Dalton's intervals from 32° to 482° Fahr. areas before
given, 102° -4 ; 77°-6; 63°-9 ; 55°7 ; 50°-5=350°-l.                Now,
 if we call the first quantity 1-00, it will produce on a metallic
 rod a corresponding effect in expansion = 1 .00.        The next in
 terval of Mr. Dalton's scale (equal always to 90° Fahr.) can pro
 duce only   |  of the effect of the first, or as 75 to 100. The
third, fourth, and fifth intervals will give the fractional expan
sions in reference to the first, of -ftfc, yW> al,d about tVVi or
merely a half.                                                            ¦
    No such diminution of effect was observed in the experiments ;
 from 392° to 482° F., the rod elongated as much as from 32° to
 122°, or double the quantity compatible with the Daltonian hy
pothesis.     Thus, therefore we have a rigid, and 1 think unan
swerable demonstration of the general correctness of the com
 mon scale of temperature, and of the extreme inaccuracy and
inapplicability of Mr. Dalton's geometrical substitute. Should
 the preceding statement leave any doubt or obscurity concerning
 the legitimacy of the inference now drawn, I trust it will be en
tirely removed, when the details of the experiments are published,
with drawings of the apparatus, in my treatise on pyrometry.
    Yet though the mercury in the thermometer tube move, pari
passu, with a metallic rod, deemed uniform in its expansion, it
does not prove perfectly equal uniformity of expansion to belong
to the mercury.      It will seem, no doubt, a paradoxical assertion,
that of two bodies marching together, hand in hand, one of them
may have an equable pace, while that of the other is regularly,
but very slowly accelerated.      Yet I think the position just.        It
proceeds    from  a  circumstance   in  the thermometer      sufficiently
obvious, but which seems to have escaped our systematic writers.
 I do not rest the proposition on any imperfection of workman
ship, or supposed irregularity in the expansions of the glass.
    Let us take a thermometer, the calibre of whose stem is per
fectly uniform, and whose scale is exactly divided.         Let it have
a range from zero to the 656th degree, at which mercury boils,
by the accurate experiments of Creighton.        At 32°, let the mer
cury sland at the bottom of the ivory scale, where of course the
graduations commence. The bare part of the instrument is con
sequently the plunging limit, in most chemical researches on the
temperature of liquids.      Immerse the bulb in common oil, or

 186                 New experimental      Researches
oil of vitriol heated to 212° ; -^y* part of the whole included
mercury will now ascend above that part of the stem plunged in
the liquid.      The part actually exposed to the heat, and by whose
expansion      the column on the scale is supported, is only           of the
initial mass.      Augment    the heat of the oil till the instrument in
dicate 392° ; we know that there remains now, under the imme
diate influence of the heat,           nearly of the original weight of
mercury; and fmally, at 572°, only about -§-§- rest in the im
mersed -part of the stem and bulb.
    ^ij. or -x'T parts may be considered as no longer subjected to
the power of caloric. If the themometer stem were recurved near
the bulb, the mercury in the stem placed horizontally would be
cold    ;  and this proposition   would be almost exactly true.
    Now, since the calibre and divisions are uniform, the capacity
of the tube from the point marked 212° to that marked 392°,
and again from this to that opposite to 572°, is in each equal to
its capacity from 32° to 212°.          Hence these three equal capa
cities are filled by the expansions of the three unequal quantities
of mercury 62, 61, 60. At the highest station, the column of
quicksilver equal on the stem to 3 x i80°, is sustained by the
expansion of 60 parts; at the middle point, 2x 180° is sup
 ported by that of 61 ; and at 212° there are 62 parts of mer
 cury to sustain 180° in the tube.        Or, to put it in another form,
these three successive spaces on the scale are equal ; the first
 portion of mercury is protruded into it by the expansion of 62
 parts in the bulb ; the second portion by the expansion of 61 ;
 and the third by that of 60.
     Therefore, if these three thermometric intervals of ISO0, each
 of which holds an equal measure of mercury, contain also equal
 increments of temperature, as denoted by the equal increments
 of a metallic rod; then, these three equal effects are produced
 from the unequal quantities of mercury 62, 61, 60.            This liquid,
 then, must have an increasing rate        of expansion, the inverse of
 these numbers, for every 180° of the scale, or              -^V, •515-. That
 is to to sav, 60 parts at 572° do the same work by the same
 power of "caloric, as 61 at 392°, and 62 at 212°.
      I believe this to be the real nature of mercurial expansion,
  and the true condition of the thermometer; which is an equable
  measurer of heat, because the mercury possesses the above in
 creasing rate of expansion.        Were the mercury, on the contrary,
  absolutely uniform in its augmentations of volume by equal in
  crements of heat, then for an instrument whose bulb alone in
  practice can be immersed, the three above ranges should have
     * A minute fraction less; but we need not                 the statement
                                                  complicate
  with it.
                                                                           the

 the corresponding parts of the scale shortened in the successive
 proportions of 62 to 63; 61 to 63 ; and 60 to 6o ; quantities
 taken together nearly equal to 9°, or =3 x-^ X 1 80 =                     .
 .   Whatever reception these speculations may experience, they
 must not be confounded with the experiments on the expansions
of metallic rods, and the corollaries which have a distinct and
independent existence.
   §  II.  On  the Doctrines       of Capacity,     as connected    with the
                          preceding Investigation.
     Dr. Crawford     and   De Luc tried to verify the justness of the
thermometric indications, by mixing together water at 212° and
32° ; when the former found 122°, and the latter 119°, to be
the resulting temperature.            De Luc's number is 3° below the
mean ; Dr. Crawford's            is exact.     This ingenious philosopher
afterwards sought to confirm the evidence thus given to the ac
curacy of the scale, by other experiments, which were however
of rather an equivocal import.            Both of the above results have
been condemned and rejected by Mr. Dalton : he states the true
mean temperature to be not 122°, nor even 119°, but 110°.
For this deviation, the reasons which he assigns appear, inde
pendently of all arguments derived from other quarters, to be in
themselves inconclusive.            He says, " the temperature of the
above mixture ought to be found above the mean 122°." " Wa
ter of these two temperatures (32° and 212°) being mixed,
loses about     ^    of its hulk.      This condensation of its volume *
must expel a quantity of heat, and raise the temperature above
the mean." p. 7.         Again, p. 50, " that water increases in its ca
pacity for heat with the increase of temperature, I consider de
monstrable from the following arguments.                    1st. A measure of
water at any one temperature mixed with a measure at any other
temperature, the mixture is less than two measures.                     Now, a
condensatioa of volume is a certain mark of diminution of ca
pacity and increase of temperature            f,  as in the mixture of sul
phuric    acid  and   water  ;  or  the effects  of  mechanical pressure, as
with elastic fluids. Second, when the same body suddenly changes
its capacity by a change of form, it is always from a less to a
greater as the temperature ascends ; for instance, ice, water and
vapour.      Third, Dr. Crawford acknowledges from his own ex
perience, that dilute sulphuric acid, and most other liquids he
tried, he found to increase in their capacity for heat with the in-
    * That condensation of volume in a
                                            liquid, is no proof of die expulsion
of heat, is shown in iny Essay on Sulphuric Acid.
   t Tor tiie entire fallacy of this reasoning, see my Essay just quoted ; ex
pansion of volume should by Mr. D. increase capacity and diminish tem
perature. The very reverse is shown in that paper.
                                                                         crease

   1SS                New experimental      Researches
  crease   of temperature.    Admitting the force of    these arguments,
  it follows that when water of 32° and 212°         are mixed, and give
  a temperature     denoted by 119° of the common thermometer, we
  must conclude that the true mean temperature is somewhere be
  low that degree. I have already assigned the reason why I place
  the mean at 1 10."       Now the only reason I can elsewhere find,
   is derived from his general law, " that all homogeneous liquids
  expand, as the square of the temperature, from the point of
  greatest density or congelation."       In p. 7, he ventures to assert
  nothing more than, " that it is not improbable that the true mean
  temperature between 32° and 212°, may be as low as 110°
  Fahrenheit."
      Satisfied from my pyrometrical experiments, that his general
  hypothesis of the expansion of liquids being as the square of their
  temperature, is totally inapplicable to mercury, the inference re
  lative to the thermometric mean between 32° and 212° cannot
  be allowed.      But let us examine, on their own merits, the pre
  ceding arguments against Dr. Crawford and De Luc's verifica
  tion of the mean temperature between that of freezing and boil
  ing water.
      The reasoning derives its sole force from the assumption, that
 the capacity of water for heat, increases as its temperature is
 raised.     There is adduced, however, no fact in the least decisive
 on this main point.       What analogy is there between the entire
 change     of form  and  constitution suffered by *n incondensible li
quid, on becoming an elastic vapour, and the progressive heating
 of the liquid itself? Or, although dilute sulphuric acid and other
 liquids should increase in their specific caloric on being heated,
which however has not been satisfactorily demonstrated, are we
to assert that water must do so too? It is a matter of surprise to
me, that a philosopher of Mr. Dalton's judgement and acuteness
should have pressed such inconclusive analogies into his service.
He knew well that water is endowed with some curious peculia
rities, when compared with other liquids, or anomalies, as we
idly style them ; for they constitute no anomaly in nature, but
wisely fit water for performing the important functions assigned
to it in the ceconomy of our globe.
     In a series of experiments, carefully conducted on the relative
capacities for heat, of water, sulphuric acid, oil of turpentine,
and spermaceti oil, published in my Essay on hydrochloric           acid
and the chlorides ; it seems to be directly demonstrated that
the specific heat of water does not increase, but actually dimi
nishes, and that very conspicuously, as its temperature rises.         It
is there proved, that from 210° to 150° Fahr. the specific heat
of oil is to that of water as 597 to 1000; and from 150° to 90°
as .5 13 to 1000.     The same proportional difference of relation is

exhibited by the other two liquids.           Now, were the phenomenon
occasioned by the oil of vitriol, common oil, and oil of turpen
tine, increasing in their capacities for heat in a still more rapid
ratio than water, we should undoubtedly expect, from the innate
differences between the specific heats of these three substances,
to find that they would move independentlyon each other, or at
different rates.        But their uniform advance together, while
water alone varies in this respect, shows distinctly, that in the
water resides the cause of the variation.             This reasoning may
be illustrated in many ways, but by nothing more clearly than
the exploded astronomical system of the diurnal and annual move
ments of the sun and fixed stars ; in support of which, very ex
travagant hypotheses had to be contrived.
   The single fact of the motion of the earth once admitted, re
duced the Ptolemaic chaos to order.                        If,   in
                                                           like manner, we
should suppose an increasing ratio in the specific heat of water,
then we must also suppose a much more rapid increase in the
ratios of the above three substances, although their individual
specific heats are greatly inferior to that of water.              Ought not
that body, which has of all others the most decided relation to
heat, or highest specific heat, to have also its ratio most decidedly
or rapidly augmented           In adopting the increasing specific heat
                                   ?
of water, we must further assume, that, however different the
initial specific heats of the above three liquids may be, yet, while
they possess all the same rate of increase, water alone has a dif
ferent one; an inadmissible supposition.              All these difficulties
and contradictions are removed at once                     by
                                                    the experimental fact,
that water        endowed with a decreasing ratio

 at our ordinary atmospherical heats, it possesses the greatest ca
pacity for caloric, small variations in its temperature give it.u
 great modifying power over the circumambient air. Although
 the doctrine of final causes be no safe guide to the discovery of
 unknown truths, yet when it concurs with experiment, we may
 deem it an agreeable confirmation. This is finely illustrated by
 Count Rumford's speculations on the maximum density of water
 being placed several degrees above its point of congelation ; a.
 fact which does not hold with regard to any other homogeneous
 liquid.
    If the specific heat of water, then, diminish as its temperature
 advances from the freezing to the boiling point, an interval of
  10° near 32° will contain more caloric than ten degrees near
  122°, and still more than the same intervals near 212°. On this
principle we can readily account for the results obtained by Mr.
 Dalton, in mixing with water at different temperatures a known.
proportion of ice ; though it is remarkable that this able chemist
 did not see in them any thing inconsistent with his own opposite
views upon specific heat.
    " 17()°.5 expresses the number of degrees of temperature, such
 as are found between 200° and 212° of the old or common
 scale, entering into ice of 32°/to convert it into water of 32° ;
  150° of the same scale suffice, he savs, for the same effect, be
tween 122° and 130°: and between 45° and 50°, 125° are
'' adequate to the conversion of the same ice into water. These
three resulting numbers (12S, 150, 1 76-5 ) are nearly as 5,6, 7.
 Hence it follows, that as much heat is necessary to raise water
                                                                    *
5° in the lower part of the old scale, as is required to raise it 7
in the higher, and 6° in the middle*."
    Mr. Dalton, instead of adopting the obvious conclusion, that
the capacity of water for heat is greater at lower than it is at
higher temperatures, and that therefore a smaller number of de
grees of the former should melt as much ice as a greater nnmber
of the latter, ascribes the deviation denoted by these numbers, or
their differences, to the gross errors of our thermometric gradua
tion ; which he considers so excessive, as not only to equal, but
greatly to overbalance the real increase in the specific heat of
water ; which left to its own operation, would have produced
opposite experimental results.
    That our thermometric scale has no such prodigious deviation
from truth, or uniformity of indication, I conceive to be fully
established ; and therefore the only legitimate inference from these
very experiments of Mr. Dalton, is the decreasing capacity of
water with the increase of its temperature.

597 to 1000; and from 150° to 90°, that of 513 to 1000. Now,
at his highest and middle temperatures of 200° and 120°, which
come nearest to mine of 180° and 120°, we have bv him the

coincidence, and affords the happiest confirmation of the accu
racy of both sets of experiments, as well as of the justness of the
principles on which they were conducted, and on which, parti
cularly, my reductions were founded.         We now see the reason
why, when equal weights of water at 32° and 212° are mixed,
the temperature may be below the mean, as was found                 De  by
Luc. The capacity at the middle temperature              greater than

mixed, ice, cold and boiling water,) and therefore the thermo-
metric tension will be lessened, and its mercury will descend on
the scale*.     This diminution of temperature will cause a cor
responding diminution of bulk, which affords        complete answer

to Mr. Dalton's first and only plausible argument, formerly
quoted against Dr. Crawford's deductions, and the opinions of
De Luc. With regard, however, to these experiments, of mixing
hot and cold water to find mean temperature, there are sufficient
                              a
difficulties to render the result uncertain to two or three degrees.
Hence, nothing of moment can safely be inferred from them.

   192                  New experimental       Researches
     On this subject I am not acquainted with any preceding in
  quiries, though a question of such interest has probably not
  escaped examination.
      In this research 1 employed a very simple apparatus ; and with
  proper management, I believe it capable of giving the absolute
  quantities of latent heat in different vapours, as exactly as more
  refined and complicated mechanisms.           At any rate, it will afford
  comparative    results with   great precision.
     It consisted of a glass retort of very small dimensions, with a
  short neck inserted into a globular receiver of very thin glass,
  and about three inches in diameter.         The globe was surrounded
  with a certain quantity of water at a known temperature, con
  tained in a glass basin.       200 grains of the liquid, whose vapour
  was to be examined,     were    introduced into the retort, and rapidly
  distilled into the globe by the heat of an Argand lamp. The tem
  perature of the air was 45°, that of the water in the basin from
, 42° to 43°, and the rise of temperature, occasioned by the con
  densation of the vapour, never exceeded that of the atmosphere
  by four degrees.     By these means, as the communication of heat
  is very slow between bodies which differ little in temperature, I
  found, that the air could exercise no perceptible influence on the
  water in the basin during the experiment, which was always com
  pleted in five or six minutes.        A thermometer of great delicacy
  was continually    moved    through the water ; and its indications
  were read off, by the aid of a lens, to small fractions of a degree.
     In all the early experiments of Dr. Black on the latent heat of
  common steam, the neglect of the above precautions introduced
  material errors into the estimate. Hence that distinguished phi
  losopher found the latent heat of steam to be no more than 800°
  or 810°.     Mr. Watt afterwards determined it more nearly from
  900u to 950°: and Lavoisier and La Place have made it 1000".
      It is evident that whenever the water, into which the latent
  heat is evolved by condensation of the vapour, becomes much
  hotter than the surrounding air, it will be impossible to ascertain
  how much of the caloric is dissipated ; and consequently, the true
  quantity contained in the vapour must remain uncertain.
     The sources of error in operating with the calorimeter of La
  voisier and La Place were first pointed out by Mr. Wedgwood,
  and have been since commented on by Dr. Thomson, and other
  good systematists.      It is said to be difficult to obtain precisely
  uniform quantities of liquefied ice in the repetition of the same
  experiments, with that celebrated apparatus.
     From the smallness of the retort in my mode of proceeding,
  the shortness of the neck, and its thorough insertion into the
  globe, we prevent condensation by the air in transitu; while the
  surface of the globe and the mass of water being great, relative
                                                                          to

to the quantity of vapour employed, the heat is entirely trans
ferred to the refrigeratory, where it is allowed to remain, without
apparent diminution, for a few minutes.                In numerous repeti
tions of the same experiment, the accordances were excellent.
 The following table contains the mean results. The water in the
basin weighed in each case 32340 grains.               The globe was held
steadily in the centre of the water by a slender ring fixed round
its neck.    The distillation was rapidly performed, so that all the
condensation took place in the globe.

    From the phenomena exhibited in the mechanical condensa
tion and rarefaction of gases and vapours, as well as from their
general constitution,     it may be inferred, that an intimate and
necessary    connexion   subsists  between their latent heat, elastic
force, and specific weight or density.
    Hence, when their tension is the same, it appears reasonable
to suppose that the product of their densities into their quantities
of latent heat will also be the same. Repulsive energy will be
proportional to the quantity of heat, the repulsive power con
 densed or contained in a given space.       Thus if the space left for
its interposition or lodgment be in one vapour a half or a third of
the amount of the space in another, we ought to find equal ten
sion produced in the former case, by a half or a third of the la
tent heat required for the latter.
    As the principle, I have reason to suppose, is somewhat new^
let us illustrate it by an application to the three vapours in the
 above list which are most homogeneous, or at any rate best un
derstood ; those of alcohol, ether and water.
    Aqueous vapour of an elastic force balancing the atmospheric
pressure has a specific gravity, compared to air, by the accurate
experiments of Gay Lussac, of 10 to 16.
    For facility of comparison let "us call the steam of water unity;,
or 1-00 ; then the specific gravity of the vapour of pure ether is
4-00, while the specific gravity of the vapour of absolute alcohol
is 2-60.
    But the vapour of ether, whose boiling point is not 100°, but
 112°, like the above ether, contains some alcohol ; hence, we
must accordingly diminish a little the specific gravity of its va
                                                                      -

    It will then become instead of 4-00            ..      ..     3-55

   A small modification will no doubt be introduced         the dif--,       by
ference of the thermometric tensions,  or sensible heats, under the
same elastic force.   Common steam, for example, may        be con
sidered as deriving its total elastic energy from the latent heat .
multiplied into the specific gravity + the thermometric tension.

   Neither the specific heats nor specific gravities of the other
vapours are ascertained with sufficient precision to enable us to-
subject them to calculation.

sustain   double pressure, their interstices are proportionally di

vapours possessed of greater specific gravities.      Hence, the se

need not be equal to the first, in order to produce the double
tension.   This view now given accords with the experiments of
Mr. Watt, alluded to hi the beginning of this memoir. He found

 It certainly agrees with that unaccountable fact. Whatever be
 the fate of the investigation of the general law now respectfully
 offered, the statement of Mr. Watt may be implicitly received
 under the sanction of his acknowledged sagacity and candour.
     Conclusion. — To the theory of latent heat, which, like the hy
 drostatic paradox of Archimedes, might have remained for ages
 a barren, though beautiful proposition, the fertile genius of that
 philosopher gave all at once its noblest application, and most be
 neficial influence on human life, by his new steam-engine.        After
Jlim, many minds of the first order for science and ingenuity have
-offered schemes of further improvement ; but all either frivolous
 or abortive; with such prophetic judgement had Mr. Watt anti
 cipated the happiest form and structure of which it was suscep
 tible.
     Under this conviction, it is with much deference that I draw
 the following practical inferences from the last train of experi
 ments.
     Since the vapour of alcohol, having the same elastic force as
 the atmosphere, contains         of the latent heat of ordinary steam,
 and since its elastic force is doubled at the 206th degree (6° be
 low the boiling heat of water), with perhaps £ of additional ca
 loric ; might we not, in particular circumstances, employ this
 vapour for impelling the piston of a steam engine ? The con
 densing apparatus could, I imagine, be so constructed, as to pre
 vent any material loss of the liquid, while more than a quadruple
 power would be obtained from the same size of cylinder at 212°,
 with an expenditure of fuel not amounting to one half of what
  aqueous vapour consumes ; or the power and fuel would be as
 3 to 1, calling their relation in ordinary steam 1 to 1. A con
  siderable engine could thus also be brought within a very mo
 derate compass.      Possibly, after a few operations of the air-
 pump, the incondensable gas may be so effectually withdrawn,
 that we might be permitted to detach this mechanism, which,
 though essential to common engines, takes away one-fourth of
 their power. In a distillery in this country, or on a sugar estate
 in the colonies, a trial of this plan might perhaps be made with
 advantage.      While exercising its mechanical functions of grind
 ing, mashing or squeezing the canes, it would be converting or
  dinary into strong spirit for rectification, or for the convenience
  of carriage.    Might not such an engine be executed on a small
  scale,  for many purposes of domestic drudgery ?        It would un
  questionably furnish a beautiful illustration in philosophy, to
  make one small portion of liquid, by the agency of fire, imitate
 the ceaseless circulation and restless activity of life.

                                To Mr. Tilloch.

    Sir, — J. here       are some circumstances affecting friction and
    several mechanical movements, that seem as yet to have been
    rather overlooked : and as the diminution of friction and of every
    unnecessary waste of moving power is undoubtedly of great im--
    portance, I shall venture to give my opinion in some cases,,,
    hoping that it may excite the notice of others who consider thenv--
    stlves better qualified for the task.
        It is now pretty generally understood, that friction remains
-   constant although the velocity varies ; and indeed, many experi
    ments are favourable to this notion — but there are certainly some
    exceptions.     Most people, it is presumed, will be ready to ad--
    mit,   that where  the greater wear        there will also, cceteris pari
                                                 is,
    bus, be the greater friction.       But      have often observed, that
                                                  I
    where one surface passed over another with great velocity and
    under strong pressure, there was always           tendency to generate
                                                         a
    heat, which was also followed            by wearing of the parts consi
                                                  a
    derably greater than        the velocity had been small.
                                    if                                Indeed             I
     cannot help regarding heat as having             powerful
                                                        a        influence   on
    friction.     It certainly softens   the   wearing parts consisting of
     metal — tends rapidly to dry up the unctuous substances applied
             it
    to lessen friction —      probably promotes the tremulous or vibra
                               it
    tory motion of the parts of bodies           and besides,
                                                   ;                alters even
                                                                         it
     their size and shape.
        Such being some of the more obvious effects of heat, we need
    not be surprised that theories of friction which do not condescend
    to take notice of such circumstance, should often be at variance
    with observation       ;and probably       theory including every ano
                                                 a
    maly would, from its intricacy, be scarcely intelligible to the
    framer.of  it  himself.
        Another circumstance affecting friction, and often attended
    with an immediate loss of power,         the application of the moving
                                             is
    power in     direction oblique to that in which the body            moved.is
    This, as  is awell known, takes place on many occasion^; often
    needlessly too     ;and      particularly observable
                                    is                            the case of
                                                                        in
    wheels acting on one another with teeth that are much tapered
    towards their extremities.      The consequence               is,
                                                              that the mutual

 is at present much in vogue, is not less remarkable for possessing
   the fault alluded to in the highest perfection.   A person who is at
   all acquainted with the principles on which such teeth are formed,
   will readily perceive that wheels of this construction can only
   work smoothly, when their centres are exactly at a certain di
   stance from each other ; and, that if this distance be any how
   altered, although in a small degree, they must act with great dis
   advantage.     Now there are many causes which may conspire to
   change this distance ; such as the bending of the several parts of
   the machine — the expansion and contraction of metals by change
   of temperature.     But the grand and fertile source of this mis
   fortune, I presume, is contained in the sudden tapering figure of
   the teeth themselves, by which an almost irresistible repulsion is
   introduced between the wheels, in consequence of their mutual
   action being in a great measure directed to their centres.      It is
. likewise plain, that if the distance of their centres is a very little
   augmented, the repulsion will be prodigiously increased, and have
   a tendency to go on increasing sine limile, especially when the
  wheels contain a small number of teeth.          It may no doubt be
  alleged that all wheels have a tendency to repel each other; but
  certainly the more this is avoided, so much the better; and of
  course wheels are the nearer to perfection, according as the di
  rection of their mutual action approaches to a coincidence with
  the perpendicular to a straight line joining their centres, pro
  vided the teeth are formed on strict mathematical principles : for
  it might easily be shown, that such wheels are not so prone to
  change their distance ; nor yet is the smoothness of their motion
  so soon disturbed, on the event of such a change taking place, as
 those of the tapering form are.
      In fine machinery, this unfortunate repulsion is seldom want
  ing; for, though often in clock-work the teeth are quite of a
  superfluous lengthy yet as two wheels commonly little more than
  touch with the rounded ends of their teeth, we may rest assured
  they have their own share of repulsion.
      It is a common notion, (though only with the vulgar), that fric
  tion is lessened by diminishing the rubbing surface ; but the sur
  face may often be augmented with manifest advantage: because
  ordinarily where the pressure is confined to a small space, it soon
  creates heat sufficiently intense both to increase friction and also
  to dry up any unctuous application.
      Another vulgar notion   is,
                                that    machine moves easier after the
                                        a
  wearing parts   become  heated  — ;for immediately after the machine
  has been stopped, it   ismore easily set in motion thanif it  had re
  mained at rest for a considerable time.      But this seems only to
  be in conformity with the well known fact, that friction requires
  time at rest to attain its maximum.
                                                                    It

    It has been frequently alleged, that the attraction of cohesion
contributes to increase friction. But when both surfaces are of
the same sort of metal, it is highly probable that particles or
crystals of the one body may often come into that particular po
sition relatively to those of the other body, as to enable them
firmly to lay hold of each other ; and on the event of the surfaces
being again separated by moving along, there may possibly be
found some particles which have deserted the surface to which
they originally belonged, and gone over as it were to the enemy's
standard.      The rapidity with which two pieces of iron mutually
wear or rather grind each other, particularly after getting hot and
free of grease, furnishes a strong presumption in favour of this
hypothesis : possibly, even magnetism may claim some little share
in the case referred to. The little cohesion which subsists be
tween the surfaces of different metals, is undoubtedly one reason
for their having less friction than if the metals were of one sort.
    It is truly surprising, after all that has been said against the
unfortunate and unscientific contrivance of binding down the ex
tremities of the axles of carriages, that this lamentable practice,
 so destructive of human lives, should still be continued, even in
an age boasting so much of perfection.                  If,
                                                       as some suppose,        •

the same time ; and of course, while one side alone could roll
over ten miles, the other would roll over eleven : from which it
is clear, that while one part actually rolls, another must slide.
Not satisfied, however, with this degree of absurdity, recourse is
had to a most distinguished contrivance — that of fixing nails with
gigantic heads projecting beyond the sliding surface; as if there
were really a possibility of preventing the sliding altogether.
Such a contrivance offers an affront to common sense and an in
sult to sober reason. Even in the case of narrow-edged wheels,
these horrid nail-heads must be viewed as a great incumbrance.
They might well be denominated an invention as a universal sub
stitute for rough roads.
    It has been justly observed by Mr. Wingrove, that there is no
need for continuing in force the act limiting the under distance of
wheels. But although this desideratum were denied, wheels need
not be spread above, as long as carriages and roads are not li
mited in length. Granting, however, that the legislature were to
repeal this unnecessary restriction, it is not probable that any re
formation would soon take place in the construction of carriages;
for it is firmly believed with the great bulk of the people, that
carriages, but especially the wheels, are at present formed on the
most improved and learned principles.
    We may therefore reasonably despair of success, in using any
remonstrance with the public, so long as the legislature does not
again interfere.      I do not pretend to dictate in this case ; but
perhaps something like double toll-duty, when the wheels are
more than an inch closer below than above, might in time have
its effect.    This would be a considerable advantage, not only to
the road, but even to the owner of the carriage himself, though
against his will ; for it has been concluded from experiment, that
four horses would do as much with straight axles, as five can
with those in common use. I would, however, still approve of
having an axle bent just so much that the weight of the load might
bring it to the straight.    A similar allowance should also be made
for the axle bending backward at the extremities, in consequence
of the resistance the wheels encounter on the road. For a like
reason, it is probable that the wheels of a heavy carriage, whose
axle turns with them, are a little wider below than above, and
before than behind.       But this is certainly nothing worse than the
tottering of wheels that turn loosely on a fixed axle.
    It has been sometimes thought best to make the axle fast to
the carriage, without turning round ; as the force to turn the
axle is thereby saved.      But it should also be recollected, that the
weight   of  a  fixed axle adds  to the friction at the axle ; whereas
the weight of an axle turning round does not affect this friction at
all. Besides, the force to turn the axle is only needed when the
                                                               carriage

   carriage begins to move ; but in the other case, the increased
   friction continues during the whole motion.         Some have alleged
   that the improvement of roads, by cutting hills and raising hol
  lows, has sometimes been carried to excess: because, say they, a
   horse is sooner worn out by constant pulling, though lightly, than
   if he had now and then to exert himself going up hill, and after
  ward rested his shoulder going down.           But if there is any force
  in this allegation, it is certainly not of general application ; for
  where two or more animals work together, they might draw and
  rest by turns : — even a single horse could move rather quicker for
  a few minutes, and then stand alternately.           However, I rather
  think the main fault of a very level road, is its retaining the water
  longer in its ruts, so as seldom to be clean and smooth like a
  hilly one.
       Many vulgar notions containing their own refutation might be
  mentioned. But it deserves also to be noticed, that from the sub
 ject's often appearing much simpler than it really              is,

                                              :   It                   by

  authority, that the use of wheels        only to overcome the inequa
                                          is
 lities of the road  ;  and, that    the bare axle were to slide on two
                                    if
  polished railings of metal, the carriage would be as easily drawn
  along as if   with wheels    in the usual way (abstracting from the
  inequalities  of  the  road).    Now were this really the case, even
 friction-wheels themselves      would  be altogether useless, or rather
 a pompous incumbrance.            Admitting, however, that friction          is
 not affected   by   varying the velocity,       would obviously follow,
                                                   it
 that the friction on the axle        the same in both cases. But still
                                     is
it    should never be forgotten that friction and the momentum of
friction are very different things. In the case of the bare axle
 sliding along, we have the whole friction to contend with              ;but
 when wheels are added, we have only to overcome its momentum;
 which evidently     isto the friction, as the radius of the axle to that
 of the wheel. This being agreeable to what            contained in most

202       Plan for  establishing a Company for the Cultivation
ture of shooting stars is correct.         Perhaps the following consi
deration may tend to remove such an impression, without enter
ing into a more laboured investigation of this interesting phseno-
menon, or it may give Mr.F. an opportunity of giving a brief and
clear exposition of his notions on the subject, and of the obser
vations on which they are founded.
     It is well known that when a body moves with more than a
certain degree of velocity it cannot be observed by the human
eye: the motion of wheels, of bodies in a sling, the whirling of a
 fire-brand, and the rapid movements of a dexterous professor of
 legerdemain, may be cited as instances : but the motion of a
 body revolving round the earth must be much more rapid, and
consequently the body itself must be invisible.           Mr. F. states the
 necessary    degree   of  velocity to be   "  immense  :"   and it may be
 shown that it will require the sateUitala to move at the rate of
 about 20,000 feet per second ; but it cannot be said of these
 salellilula, as Newton has of the planets, that their "motions may
subsist an exceedingly long time *." Therefore Mr. F. must cer
 tainly be wrong in assuming them to have been moving within
our atmosphere since the creation.            Perhaps it may be said their
 brightness renders them visible, notwithstanding their immense
 velocity. In that case I should be glad to see the outlines of a hy
 pothesis for heating those bodies, or to explain how they became
 luminous.      Till these points be settled I shall not meddle further
 with the subject.        I am, sir, yours,

  Theke      are no circumstances connected with the ex;sting state
  of this country, which      are so peculiarly disgraceful to its internal
  policy, or so hostile to its most essential interests, as the vast ex
  tent of waste lands every where to be met with, and the multi
  tudes of poor who are destitute of employment, and a burden on
  the community. — That many of these wastes will require much
  labour and expense to cultivate them, must be admitted ; and
  that many of these unfortunate individuals now unemployed, are

incapable of doing much work, more especially in labour out of
doors, must likewise be acknowledged : but when the subject is
thoroughly investigated, it will not probably be denied by the
candid and impartial inquirer, that if a portion of the poor, who
are now in a state of perfect idleness, were employed in culti
vating portions of our waste lands, now in a barren and useless
slate, much public benefit might be expected.
    To explain how that can best be accomplished, is the object of
the following hints :
    Several years have elapsed since the author of this paper was
first led to discuss this most interesting subject*. His attention,
however, has of late been more particularly called to         con    it,   in
sequence of an application from the church- wardens and ovei seers
of one of the most populous parishes in London (St. Martin in
the Fields), requesting his opinion " on the practicability, and
the probable advantage of directing the labour of the poor to the
cultivation of the waste lands throughout the country; and whether
a  considerable number of the able poor might not be profitably
employed in carrying on some great agricultural objeet, so as to
render us independent of foreign supplies for subsistence." — (See
Appendix.)
  In answer to that application,            was briefly stated, that no
                                               it
doubt could be entertained, as           general maxim, that the best
                                           a
source of occupation, for the greater proportion of the idle poor,
is the soil. That      the poor are employed in manufactures, or in
                       if
making up     manufactured   articles, as shoes and clothes, with which
the market    is already supplied, they must interfere with the in
dustry of other workmen, who would soon be reduced to poverty,
and that consequently mischief rather than good would arise from
such  a   system. — Whereas, while there are such extensive tracts
of waste land, all over the kingdom, and more especially in the
neighbourhood of the metropolis, and while we are under the ne
cessity of importing food from other countries, our agriculture
cannot be too much extended.
   The author then added, " know that great prejudices are en
                                    I
tertained against the employment of the poor            husbandry; but
                                                             in
that is  altogether owing   to the   want  of information  and of expe
rience.     Those who have examined the husbandry             Flanders,

must have seen how much manual labour                there employed in
                                                        is

our fields were cultivated in the garden style, the increased pro
duce would amply defray the additional expense."
    That in agricultural parishes the poor may be advantageously
employed in the cultivation of the soil, seems now to be generally
recognised f; but the plan which I propose submitting to the con
sideration of the public, is of a more extensive nature.            The po
sition I wish to establish is this,    "  that as the poor in the metro
polis and in large towns, cannot be advantageously employed in
              .
trades and other manual occupations, without injury to others
whose subsistence depends upon their labour; henee, it has he-
come a matter of absolute necessity, either to maintain them
without employment, or to send the able-bodied to work in the
fields, both for raising food, and for producing materials for ma
nufacture (as flax), more likely to interfere with foreign than do
mestic industry, and in which the more iufirm poor might be em
ployed in work-houses,        and that by the adoption of such a sy
stem, the burde-ri'ofi maintaining the poor will be materially di
minished."                  flWv.
    In discussing this subject,"rlls. proposed to consider the follow
ing points : — 1. To what extent is manual labour applicable to
the cultivation of the soil ? — 2. Wha^is^he probable number of
persons maintained by the poor-rates in UBhdou and its imme
diate vicinity, who could be usefully employed in carrying on
some great agricultural improvement? — and 3. Wtyat would be
the best plan for carrying such a measure into effect?13,.

vation of the soil ?
    This is a subject that has frequently been discussed in works tillwo
agriculture    J ; but understanding       that Mr. Falla, an eminent
nurseryman      at Gateshead,  near   Newcastle,    had recently paid par
ticular attention to the cultivation of land by manual labour, I
applied to him for the result of his experience, which he com
municated with the greatest readiness.              He states, that on an
   * Seethe Report of the Select Committee on the Poor Laws, an. 1817,
Appendix, G, No. 2, p. 164.
   + " In country parishes, agriculture furnishes the most obvious and use
ful source of employment; for, though the whole stock of subsistence be
thereby increased, yet the cultivator ot. the land would be more than com
pensated for any diminution in the value of his produce, by the correspond
ing diminution of the expense of maintaining his family and labourers, and
the more important reduction of the poor-rate." — See the valuable Report
on the Poor Laws, an. 1817, p. 19.

section on Trenching Land; also, the Code of Agriculture, p. 151 and p.2i;2,
note.
                                                                    average,

                        of the Wasle Lands of the Kingdom.      205
average, it has been ascertained, that three men and two women
or girls, (being about the proportion of the two sexes employed
in nursery ground,) taking the year round, will work about ten
statute acres, in the proportion of about 2f acres for a man, and
\\  acre for a woman.    But a nursery, in all its operations, takes
a great deal more work than ground for agricultural purposes, in
which, he thinks, a man may be able to cultivate five acres in a
year.
  At the rate for digging in the neighbourhood of Newcastle, a man
may earn two shillings per day, and the five acres may be done
in 82f days. The same period of time will be required for ma
nuring, sowing and planting his crops, and 148 days may be em
ployed in hoeing, weeding, and other operations, making in all
313 working days in the year.      The whole may be done, without
any improper degree of exertion, by a man of medium strength.
   The profits derived from spade- husbandry are certainly very
considerable.    By transplanting wheat, there is a great saving of
seed,  and the  ground being in perfect order, from the superior
culture it has received, the increase is great.    The average pro
duce of wheat, in England, is only at the rate of twenty bushels
per acre, — whereas Mr. Falla finds, that trenched land will yield
more than double.      But, supposing the produce to be only forty
bushels, at 10i. per bushel, that would amount to 20/. per acre,
and after amply indemnifying every possible expense, would pro
duce a large profit.    The crops of potatoes, carrots, flax, hemp,
Swetrish turnips, and other articles raised by spade-husbandry,
would likewise be very great.     The use of the plough was cerr
tainly an immense improvement when first introduced ; and it
must always be applicable to a very large proportion of a country,
owing to the scarcity of hands. The advantages derived from        it,
however, were formerly more considerable, when horses were
bought for trifle, and when their provender was cheap; but since
                    a
their price has become so great, and their maintenance so very
high,      evident that the expense of horse and of manual labour
          it   is
more, nearly approach each other.      To bring land into a state for
cultivation, trenching will require perhaps 5/. and even upwards
per acre but to carry on its cultivation afterwards may be done,
           ;
even in the neighbourhood of the metropolis, ht from 50i. to 60*.
per acre; the ploughing of which would cost from 155. to 20i.;
but once digging        considered to be equal to two ploughing?,
                             is
 consequently the difference of expense       not so material, while
                                                is
the produce     double, and in some cases, more than one crop may
                    is
be obtained in the same year.                                    ..
   There can be no doubt, therefore, that the manual labour may
be advantageously employed         the cultivation of the soil.

206     Plan for eslallishing a Company for     the Cultivation
poor-rates in London and its immediate vicinity, who could be
employed in carrying on some great agricultural improvements ?
   This is a question that is not easily solved, and which would
require a good deal of investigation accurately to ascertain ; but
the number must be very great: and when it is considered, that
besides able-bodied men, a large proportion of women, and even
some children might be employed, there would be no difficulty in
finding in London and its vicinity, from fifteen to perhaps twenty
thousand persons, who might be employed in various departments
connected with the cultivation of the soil, and preparing its pro
 ductions for use.
    Besides mere digging, a variety of operations might be exe
cuted by manual labour; as collecting manure, transporting it in
barges up the river, conveying it to the fields on portable iron
rail-ways, transplanting the crops, hoeing and weeding them,
cutting down or reaping them, thrashing by hand-mills, and
grinding the wheat by the flour-mills, so strongly recommended
by
     " The Society of Arts." In short, the employments which
agriculture furnishes are numerous and unceasing.
   In Order to employ a greater number of people, if the climate
and the soil of the land brought into cultivation were suitable,
hops might be raised, which in favourable seasons would be highly
productive.
   Another material object would be, the culture of flax, in the
manufacture of which, the old and the infirm might be employed
in work-houses.     This plan is successfully carried into effect in
the work-house at St. Martin in the Fields, and six or seven others j
and if the raw material could be procured in sufficient quantities,
the importation of foreign flax or linen would be no longer neces
sary. Considerable quantities of hemp might likewise be raised.
   3. What would be the best plan for carrying such a measure
into effect ?
   There is no doubt, that in so opulent a city as that of London,
a large sum might be raised, to carry on such a plan, without
any thought of profit or interest.   But there is not the least oc
casion for any individual losing any sum he may be inclined to
Subscribe for so useful a purpose.    On the contrary, if properly
managed, it must prove a very beneficial concern.         No money
can be laid out with more profit than in the improvement of the
Soil.   The author of this paper purchased an estate for 8,500/.,
and improved so much its value, that it sold for 40,000/.         Hfe
let a farm about twenty years ago for 182/. per annum, which
was likewise so much improved, under his directions, that it sold
lately for 18,200/. These are facts which are within his own
knowledge, and cannot be controverted.        If such beneficial im
provements could be effected 700 miles distant from the metro
                                                                polis,

                of the Waste Lands    of the Kingdom.             207
polis, what mav not be accomplished in its immediate vicinity ?
Any idea, therefore, that the proposed concern may prove a losing
one, ought not to be entertained for a moment.             »
    The following heads on the whole are suggested, as a founda
tion for the proposed institution :
     1. That the Society shall be called "The Royal Agricultural
Company, for the Improvement of the Waste Lands of the King
dom, and promoting domestic Colonization;" of which His Royal
Highness the Prince Regent be requested to be the patron.
    2. That under the authority of parliament, the sum of one
million (or any other sum adequate to the purpose) be raised by
a joint stock company, in shares of 5(M. each, or twenty thou
sand shares in all, for promoting so beneficial an object.
    3. That the management of the concern be confided to a pre
 sident, four vice-presidents, fifteen directors, five trustees, three
auditors, a treasurer, an accountant, and such other officers as
may be judged necessary.                                ,
    4. That the sum to be raised, shall be paid by regular instal
ments, ten pounds at the time of subscribing, and ten pounds
every six months afterwards, as the same may be required.
    5. That land shall be rented or purchased, either from the
 crown, or from private individuals, to such an extent as the ca
pital of the company will enable it effectually to cultivate.
    6. That convenient accommodation shall be provided in the
neighbourhood of the land brought into cultivation, where the
 directors, and other members of the company may reside when
 they are desirous of examining the progress of the undertaking.
     7. That a regular account of the improvements carried on,
 shall be drawn up, and submitted to the consideration of His
 Royal Highness the patron, and of both Houses of Parliamentj
 and likewise printed for the information of the members of the
 company, and of the public at large.
     8. That the accounts of the company shall be annually audited,
 and open to the inspection of all concerned ; and that after the
 first year of actual cultivation, a dividend of 5 per cent, or what
 ever other sum the profits of the concern may yield, shall be paid
 to the subscribers.
     9. That a negotiation be entered into with the church-war
 dens and overseers of the several parishes of London and its vi
 cinity, respecting the number of poor they can respectively fur
 nish, and the various articles they will purchase froni' the com
 pany; and that those parishes be preferred, who offer the most
 advantageous terms to the company.
     10. That a meeting shall be called for taking the above plan
 into consideration, and for presenting a petition to parliament,
 for erecting the proposed company into a corporate body.
                                                                     It

 208    Plan for establishing a Company for the Cultivation
    It cannot be too much inculcated in favour of any plan for em
ploying the poor in husbandry, that there is this essentia] distinc
tion between it and every other mode of occupying them; that by
cultivating the soil, food, the great object of human labour, is
directly obtained ; while, by industry of any other kind, it can
only be procured indirectly, and by means of exchange.
   In regard to the minutiae of the plan; — the district where the
land is to be rented or purchased ; — the buildings necessary to
accommodate the labourers ; — the manner in which they are to
be paid or maintained ; — the nature of the crops to be cultivated;
— the manner in which the produce is to be disposed of, — and
other minute particulars, it would be in vain to attempt to en
large upon them at this time, as they must depend on such a va
riety of circumstances, and can be safely confided to those who'
are placed in the direction.                                       • • t
   Conclusion.  — There never   was   a period when such an institu
tion was so loudly called for, nor when there was so favourable
an opportunity for carrying it into effect.       In fact, unless some
great measure be undertaken, to furnish the unemployed poor with
a means of subsistence, by their own labour, the other classes of
the community will not long be able to maintain them, and some
fatal convulsion must be the necessary consequence : whereas, if
this plan were adopted, an example of successful improvement
would be exhibited, which would soon be imitated in every other
part of the kingdom, and it would probably spread with a ra
pidity of which there is no example in history. Its success, how
ever, depends on the skilful application of a large capital; for,
in many cases, if only 51. per acre is expended, the money may
be lost; whereas, by laying out 15^. per acre, the whole expense
may be repaid in the course of one year.
   On the whole, there is every reason to hope, if no other ad
vantage were to result from the proposed plan, this object, at
least, might be obtained ; that the poor would soon be enabled to
raise provisions for their own sustenance, and no importation of
foreign grain would in future be necessary; — even that would be
 an inestimable advantage.      But, if the plan does succeed to the
extent that may be expected, a foundation will be laid for improv
ing every acre in the kingdom, capable of yielding any valuable
production ; and all that floating capital which might otherwise
remain either unemployed at home, or might be sent to foreign
 countries, from the difficulty of placing it out to advantage, might
thus be laid out in promoting the cultivation of our own country,
and in ameliorating the condition of its inhabitants.

          —
    Sir, The great attention you have so long pair! to the agri
 culture of the United Kingdoms, induces the overseers of the pa
 rish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields to request the favour of your opi
 nion on the practicability, and the probable advantage, of direct
 ing the labour of the poor to the cultivation of the waste lands
 throughout the country. — To find beneficial employment for the
parish poor, without interfering, directly or remotely, with esta
blished branches of trade and manufacture, is at present exceed
ingly difficult, and it is impossible to discover any effectual re
medy without having recourse to land.            Might not a consider
able number of the able poor be profitably employed in carrying
on some great agricultural object throughout the country, so as
to render us independent of foreign supplies for subsistence ? Will
you have the kindness to communicate to the public your views
on this most important and interesting subject ?
                  Your very obedient humble servant,
       To  the Right Hon.                    William Toone,

 General View of the Profit to be derived from the Culture               of
    Waste Lands, wider a proper System. By Sir John Sinclair           .
    It cannot   be  doubted, that 10,000 acres of lands, lying en
tirely waste, may be purchased at a moderate rate.               The ex
penses of bringing them into a state of cultivation may be cal
culated as follows:             First Year.

    The produce, per acre, where the spade-husbandry is adopted,
may be stated at 20/. per acre, or, on 10,000 acres, af 400, 000/.
in two years ; but if even considerably less, it would produce a
surplus sufficient to pay a considerable dividend on the capital ex
pended.

    Under skilful mangement, therefore, the profit would be great;
but the whole depends on the expenditure of a large capital, in
bringing the land at once into a state of thorough cultivation, and
of great fertility . The latter can easily be effected in the neigh
bourhood of London, where an offer has already been made of
 urnishing manure for an extensive tract of country at a very
 moderate expense.
    If any thing like this plan is practicable, why should there be
 a single acre of waste land in the vicinity of the metropolis, or
 any able-bodied labourer near it unemployed ?
    This year (1819) must be employed in making an application
 to parliament; — in purchasing land ; — in various necessary pre
parations ; — and in trying useful experiments; — but the next year
will exhibit a scene of industry which has probably never been
exceeded in any age or country.                                      J. S.

the subject, hy a letter addressed to the Right Hon. Sir John Sinclair, bai t.

  XXXIII.       Some Particulars       of M. Belzoni's Discoveries        in
                                    Egypt.
In    our Number for April of last year (p. 241 of vol. li.) we in
serted a letter from M. Belzoni to M. Viseonti, dated Cairo,
January 9, 1818, mentioning his return from Upper Egypt, and
being then engaged in preparing for a third journey to Nubia ;
and that in his first journey he had succeeded in removing to
Alexandria the head known by the name of the Memnon's head,
a colossal bust ten feet ii? height, formed out of a single block of
granite, and about twelve tons in weight.            This head, which the
French were unable to remove even after bio Hug off with gun
powder a portion of the back part, M. Belzoni, by the assistance
solely of the native peasantry', without the aid of any machine,
succeeded in removing from Thebes to Alexandria.                  The chief
difficulty lay in transporting it from Thebes to the Nile, to get it
on board a vessel for Alexandria.            This labour required a degree
of patience and perseverance whieh few men possess : it took
him six months, though the distance to the Nile was only about
two miles.
   This colossal bust, which reached England last summer, has
been recently placed, most judiciously as to light, on a pedestal
in the Egyptian room in the British Museum, under the able di
rection of Mr. Combe.
   From Thebes M. Belzoni proceeded to Nubia to examine the
                                                                        great

  great Temple of Ybsambul [Ibsambul, Ebsambul, or Absimbul],
  which lies buried more than twice its height in the sands near
  the second cataract. On this occasion, however, he was unable to
  effect any thing, and therefore returned to Thebes, where he em
 ployed himself in new researches at the temple of Karnack. Here,
  several feet under ground, he found surrounded by a wall a range of
  sphynxes, about forty in number, with heads of lions on busta
  of women, of black granite, and for the greater part beautifully
  executed.     While absent on his second visit to Ybsambul, Mrs.
  Belzoni succeeded in digging up at the same place a statue of
  Jupiter Amnion holding a ram's head on his knees. And on his
  second journey to Thebes in 1 S 1 7, M- Belzoni discovered a co
  lossal head of Orus, of fine granite, larger than the Memnon,
  measuring ten feet from the neck to the top of the mitre with
  which it is crowned, exquisitely finished and in fine preservation.
  He carried with him to Cairo one of the arms belonging to this
  statue. As he succeeded so well in removing the Memnon, may
  we not hope that he will be encouraged also to attempt the re
  moval of this head, and that we may ere long see it placed be
  side its colossal brother in the British Museum ?
     After this, M. Belzoni proceeded again to Nubia, and, in spite
  of many hindrances and much inhospitality which he experienced,
 succeeded in opening the celebrated temple of Ybsambul, which
 no European had ever before entered. In this temple (the largest
  and most wonderful excavation in Egypt or in f^ubia) he found
 fourteen chambers and a great hall, and in the lattery standing,
 eight colossal figures, each thirty feet high.     The walls and pi
 lasters are covered with hieroglyphics beautifully cut, and               •
                                                                 g.."oll#s
 of large figures in fine preservation.    At the end of the sanctua..**
 he found four sitting figures about twelve feet
                                                      high, cut out of
 the natural rock and well preserved.        Belzoni's labour may be
 conceived, when we state that on commencing his operations
 the bed of loose sand which he had to clear away was
                                                            upwards of
fifty feet deep.    He carried hence two lions with the heads of
vultures, and a small statue of Jupiter Amnion. From the superior
 style of sculpture found in this temple to any thing yet met with
in Egypt, Mr. Salt infers that the arts descended hither
                                                                    from
 Ethiopia.
    M. Belzoni, by   a kind of tact which seems to be peculiarly
his own, discovered, on his return to Thebes, six tombs in
                                                                      the
valley of Biban El Moluck, or the Tombs [or rather                of  the
                                                          Gates]
Kings, (in a part of the mountainswhere ordinary observers would
hardly have sought for such excavations,) all in a perfect state, not
having been viewed by previous intruders, and giving a wonder
ful display of Egyptian magnificence and posthumous
                                                            splendour.

 the length    of passage, cut through the solid rock, is 309 feet : the
ijW1^)         which are numerous, cut in a pure white rock, are co
 vered Wutn paintings al fresco, well executed, and with hiero
 glyphics quite perfect and the colours as fresh as if newly laid on.
 In one of these chambers he found the exquisitely beautiful sar-
 cophagus of alabaster, mentioned in our fifty-first volume, nine
 feet five inches long, three feet nine inches wide, and two feet
 ope inch high, covered within and without with hieroglyphics in
intaglio, sounding like a bell and as transparent as glass — sup
 posed by M. Belzoni to have been the depository of the remains
 of Apis. In the innermost room he found the carcase of a bull em-
 balmed with asphaltum, which seems to give some confirmation*
 to his idea. /We are happy to learn that this matchless produc
 tion is now on its way to England, to be placed by the side
 of the sarcophagus supposed to have contained the remains of
 Alexander.      Mr,. Salt, assisted by Mr. Beechey (son of the well-
 known artist of the same name), has, with much labour and care,
  copied several of the paintings within this tomb, which will by
 and by be given to the public. These paintings are quite fresh
  and perfect.     The colours employed are " vermilion, ochres and
 indigo;" and yet they are not gaudy, owing to the judicious ba
  lance of colours and the artful management of the blacks.            It
 is quite obvious [says Mr. Salt] that they worked on a regular
 system, which had for its basis, as Mr. West would say, the co
  lours of the rainbow ; as there is not an ornament throughout
  their dresses where the red, yellow and blue are not alternately
 mingled, which produces a harmony that in some of the designs
 is really delicious.
     It is a curious fact, that in one of the Theban tombs two sta
  tues of wood, a little larger than life, were found as perfect as if
 newly carved, excepting in the sockets of the eyes, which had
 been of metal, probably copper.
     We have yet to mention another successful labour of M. Bel
 zoni, perhaps the most singular, because,- to all appearance, the
 most hopeless and unpromising — the opening of the second py
 ramid of Ghiza, known by the name of Cephrenes.             According
 to Herodotus, (whose information has generally been found cor
 rect,) this pyramid was constructed without any internal cham
 bers. M. Belzoni, however, believed the fact might be otherwise;
  and having reasons of his own for commencing his operations at
  a certain point, he began his labours, and with so much foresight
  as actually to dig directly down upon a forced entrance.          But
  even after this success, none but a Belzoni would have had the
  perseverance to pursue the labour required to perfect the disco
  very.    It was by attending to the same kind'of indications which
  had led him so successfullv to explore the six tombs of the kings in
                                                                Thebes,

  Thebes, that he was induced to commence his operations on the
  north side.    He set out from Cairo on the 6th of February 1818,
  pretending (as he did not wish to be interrupted by visitors') that
  he was going to a neighbouring village.       He then repairedanto the
  Kaia Bey, and gained permission ; the Bey having first satisfied
  himself that there was no tilled ground within a considerable
  distance of Ghiza. On the 10th of February he began with six
  labourers in a vertical section, at right angles to the north side
  of the base, cutting through a mass of stones and lime which
  had fallen from the upper part of the pyramid, but were so com
  pletely aggregated together as to spoil the mattocks, &c. em
  ployed in the operation.      He persevered in making an opening
  fifteen feet wide, working downwards and uncovering the face of
  the pyramid.      During the first week there was but little prospect
  of meeting with any thing interesting; but on the 17th, one of
  the Arabs employed called out with great vociferation that he
  had found the entrance.       He had in fact come.upon a hole into
  which he could thrust his arm and a djerid six feet long;          Be
  fore night they ascertained that an aperture was there about
  three feet square, which had been closed irregularly with a hewn
  stone : this being removed, they reached a larger opening, but
  filled with rubbish and sand.      M. Belzoni was now satisfied that
  this was not the real but a forced passage.        Next day they had
  penetrated fifteen feet, where stones and sand began to fall from
  above : this was removed; but still they continued to fall in large
  quantities, when after some more days labour he discovered an
  upper forced entrance, communicating with the outside from
  above.     Having cleared this, he found another opening running
  inward, which proved on further search to be a continuation of
  the lower horizontal forced passage, nearly all choked up with
  rubbish : this being removed, he discovered about half way from
  the outside a descending forced passage which terminated at the
  distance of forty feet.     He now continued to work in the hori
  zontal passage, in hope that it might lead to the centre, but it
  terminated at the depth of ninety feet; and he found it prudent
  not to force it further, as the stones were very loose over head, and
  one actually fell and had nearly killed one of the people, j He
  therefore now began clearing away the aggregated stones and lime
  to the eastward of the forced entrance ; but by this time his re-
. treat had been discovered, and he found himself much interrupted
  by visitors.
      On the 28th of Februrary he discovered at the surface of the
  pyramid a block of granite having the same direction as that of
  the passage of that of the first pyramid, or that of Cheops ; and
  he now hoped that he was not far from the true entrance. Next
  day he removed some large blocks, and on the 2d of March he
                                  O 3                            entered

214         Some Particulars         of Discoveries in Egypt.
entered the true passage, an opening four feet high and three
feet and a half wide, formed by four blocks of granite, and
continued descending at an angle of about 26° to the length of
 i04 feet five inches, lined all the length with granite. From this
passage he had to remove the stones with which it was filled ; and
 at its bottom was a door or portcullis of granite (fitted into a
niche also made of granite) supported at the height of eight inches
by small stones placed under it.         Two days were occupied in
raising it high enough to admit of entrance.           This door is one
foot three inches thick, and with the granite niche occupies seven
feet of the passage, where the granite work ends, and a short pas
sage, gradually ascending twenty-two feet seven inches towards the
centre descending commences ; at the end of which is a perpen
dicular of fifteen feet. On the left is a small forced passage cut in
the rock, and above on the right a forced passage running upward
and turning to the north thirty feet, just over the portcullis. At
the bottom of the perpendicular, after removing some rubbish, he
found the entrance of another passage which inclined northward.
But quitting this for the present, he followed his prime passage,
which now took a horizontal direction, and at the end of             158it,
feet eight inches from the above-mentioned            perpendicular, he
entered a chamber forty-six feet three inches long, sixteen feet
three inches wide, and twenty -three feet six inches in height, for
the greater part cut out of the rock       ;and in the middle of this
room he found       asarcophagus of granite, eight feet long, three
feet six inches wide, and two feet three, inches deep inside, sur
rounded    by  large blocks of granite, as      to prevent its being re
                                               if
moved.      The lid had been opened, and he found in the interior
a few bones which he supposed to be human             but some of them
                                                      :
having been since brought to England            Capt.FitzcIarence, who
                                                 by
was afterwards in this pyramid, and one of them             thigh bone)

having on examination      by   Sir Everard Home been found to have
belonged to     a cow, we may doubt whether any of them ever be

better fitted for the reception of a cow than of         man.

    He now returned to the descending passage at the bottom of
 the above-mentioned perpendicular.          Its angle    about 26°: at

 the west twenty feet, which descends into a chamber thirty-two
 feet long, nine feet nine inches wide, and eight and a half high.
  In this room were only a few small square blocks of stone, and
 on the walls some unknown inscriptions.         He now returned to
 the horizontal part and advanced north, ascending at an angle of
 60°; and in this, at a short distance from the horizontal part, he
 met with another niche, which had been formerly furnished with
 a granite door, the fragments of which were still there : at forty-
 seven feet and a half from this niche the passage filled with large
 stones to close the entrance, which issues out precisely at the base
 of the pyramid. All the works below the base are cut in the rock,
 as well as part of the passages and chambers.
     Ry clearing away the earth to the eastward of the pyramid, he
 found the foundation and part of the walls of an extensive tem
 ple, which stood before it at the distance of forty feet ; and laid
 bare a pavement composed of fine blocks of calcareous stone,
 some of them beautifully cut and in fine preservation.          This
 platform probably goes round the whole pyramid.          The  stones
 composing the foundation of the temple are very large — one which
 he measured was 21. feet long, iO high, and 8 in breadth.
    M. Belzoni, to whom the world is indebted for so many dis
 coveries, is a native of the Papal States.    About nine years ago
 he was in Edinburgh, where he exhibited feats of strength, and
 experiments in hydraulics, musical glasses and phantasmagoria,
 which he afterwards repeated in Ireland and the Isle of Man,
 whence he proceeded to Lisbon, where he was engaged by the
 manager of the theatre of San Carlos to appear in Valentine and
Orson, and afterwards in the sacred drama of Sampson. For such
 characters he was admirably adapted, being in his 25th year, six:
 feet seven inches high, remarkably strong, and having an ani
 mated prepossessing countenance.       He afterwards performed he-
fore the Court at Madrid, whence he proceeded to Malta, where
 he was persuaded by the agent of the Pashaw of Egypt to visit
 Cairo.     Here he built a machine worked on the principle of the
walking-crane, to irrigate the gardens of the Pashaw by raising
water from the Nile.       Three Arabs with M. Belzoni's servant
 (an  Irish lad whom  he had  taken with him from Edinburgh) were
put in to walk the wheel; but on the second or third turn the
Arabs being either frightened or giddy jumped out, and the Irish
man had his thigh broken; which put an end to this undertaking.
On this failure happening, and while meditating upon trying his
fortune in search of antiquities in Upper Egypt, Mr. Salt arrived
in Cairo ; and on the representation of Sheik Ibrahim, who had
witnessed his extraordinary powers, conceived him to be a most
promising person to bring the head of the young Memnon to
                               O 4                       Alexandria.

Alexandria. They came to terms ; and how well he succeeded in
this first work has been proved by the head being now in the
 Museum.
    As an instance of the confidence which his determined perse
verance inspires in others, we need only mention, that in his se
cond journey to Nubia Mr. Beechey accompanied him.            Having
engaged a party of natives, he set about uncovering the temple
where its colossal statues showed their heads above the sand.
They worked tardily for a few days and then ceased, alleging that
the feast of Rhamadan had commenced ; nor could any argu
ment persuade them to resume their labour.        In this emergency
Belzoni, Beechey and the Irishman set to work themselves; but
they soon found that by order of the Aga they could not, for
monev or by entreaties, procure a supply of provisions.      The ob
ject  was  to compel  them to return  the following  season  to spend
more money.       Having, however, in their boat a bag of millet,
the party pursued their labour, living on this fare and the Nile
water; and after twenty-one days severe labour, effected their
object, in uncovering and gaining access to the interior of the
temple.
    We consider Mr. Salt, who has been indefatigable in his own
researches, and unsparing in encouraging those of others, as
most fortunate in having secured the assistance of so able an ex
plorer as M. Belzoni.     By their exertions and those of M. Ca-
viglia, the British Museum is likely soon to become the richest de
pository in the world, of Egyptian antiquities.     Mr. Salt has pos
sessed himself of many gems in this line.      Among others he has
got down to Cairo the famous stone discovered by the French,
with eight sculptured figures ; another beautiful head of granite,
as perfect and with a finer polish than that named the young
Memnon, not quite so large, but perfect ; a sitting figure, ex
quisitely wrought and as large as life ; several statues of basalt ;
thirty rolls of papyrus, and an immense number of smaller ar
ticles.
    Some time ago, to the great grief of every lover of antiquities
or of enterprise, it was reported that M. Belzoni was dead ; but
we are happy to say that a letter from Naples falsifies this state
ment. Lord Belmore, who has resided for some time at Naples,
where he arrived after a long and interesting tour through Egypt,
Palestine, Syria, and to Troy, has received letters from M. Bel
zoni, dated from Thebes in Upper Egypt, of the 27th of October.
 He continues his researches in Egypt with the greatest activity,
and has lately made many important discoveries.        Lord Belmore
himself had advanced to 150 leagues beyond the Cataracts into
Nubia ; he passed six weeks at Thebes, where he every day made
some researches with the assistance of a hundred Arabs.           His
                                                          discoveries

discoveries there are very valuable. His tour will be of great ad
vantage to geographers ; for he has accurately determined the
longitude and latitude of the greater part of the places through
which he passed, having been accompanied by his brother Capt.
Corry of the Navy, who had with him an excellent sextant. On
his Lordship's return to England he will publish his travels.
               XXXIV. On         the Nautical Almanac.
                            To   Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, —   I have
 manac for 181
                   just   seen the second edition     of the Nautical Al
                     which the editors of that work have at length
 thought proper to publish without the stamp.       The former price
 of the almanac was six shillings; but the stamp (which. was
fifteen pence) being deducted, it ought now to be sold (or four
 shillings and ninepence. The price however charged to the public
 is five shillings, being an addition of three-pence to the original
 charge of the work : and, as such, must be considered as an ad
 ditional tax on the public. If the profits of this publication were
 to go towards increasing the salaries of the computers, and there
 by hold out an inducement towards the more perfect conducting
 of that work, the public need not complain ; but it is much to
 be feared that this additional charge only goes to enrich the in
 dolent bookseller, and not the laborious calculator : and conse
 quently ought to be resisted, as being contrary to the spirit of the
 new act of parliament.
     By that statute it is moreover declared, that all the clauses in
 former acts relative to rewards for discovering the longitude at sea
 are repealed: and a new scale of rewards is ordered to be made
 out and advertised in the London Gazette, in lieu of the former           -
 ones.    Yet in defiance of this injunction, and with six additional
 labourers appointed by the act, for the more perfect conducting
 of this work, the second edition of the Nautical Almanac above
 mentioned, has just been published, containing (as usual) the
 clauses in the aforesaid acts of parliament; which, being repealed,
 consequently hold out a false hope of reward to such as are now
 disposed to attempt the difficult problem above alluded to.        If
 the new scale of rewards is actually made out, and has received
 the approbation of the Prince Regent in council, (as provided by
 the act,) it ought to have been published in this second edition:
 but on no account ought the obsolete clauses of the former acts
 to have disgraced its pages, published, as it  is,
                                                  under the authority
 of the new Board of Longitude.
 I     say that this second edition must be considered as published
 under the direction, and         the authority of the new Board of
                                 by
                          f                                  Longitude ;

 Longitude ; for, by the recent act of parliament, it could not
otherwise be exempted from the stamp duty : the editor there
 fore must have the authority of this vew Board for its publication,
otherwise he would be liable to a penalty for selling it without
 a stamp.    But how are we to reconcile this with the two formal
 instruments inserted in the beginning of the work, dated the one
 as far back as June 1815, authorizing Messrs. Bensley to print,
 and the other as far back as July 1811, authorizing Mr. Murray
 to sell the present almanac ? 1 mention these facts merely to
 show how carelessly the new labourers have entered on their ar
 duous duty,; and how little improvement is to be expected in the
 body of the work, if we thus stumble at the very threshold.
    Indeed upon a cursory view of the work, it appears to me to be
 merely a reprint of the first edition, except as to the correction
 of the numerous errors which existed therein. I observe that the
 time of the conjunction of /3 Tauri with the moon, is now more
 accurately given in all the different months: — but will these mo
 dern Sidrophels be good enough to inform the public why the
 conjunction of Pollux is so carefully noted through all the luna
 tions, since that star cannot in any part of the globe, ever un
 dergo an occultation by the moon.
    When this new incorporated body shall think fit to publish the
Nautical Almanac under their own avowed authority and direction,
it is to be hoped that they will revise and improve the whole work,
 so as to render it at least equal to the productions of a similar
 kind published by the other states of Europe, and worthy of the
 learned names appointed by law for the purpose of conducting it.
At present it is smuggled into the world like an illegitimate child,
 and every one seems ashamed of owning it.            First comes the
garhled preface of Dr. Maskelyne, to make it appear as if ushered
in under his auspices : but the only passage which could con
firm that fact, and which indeed is the only passage material to
be known in any current year, is entirely omitted       Then we meet
with the apologetical advertisement of Mr. Pond, shifting the re
sponsibility from his own shoulders, and endeavouring to make
the reader believe that there are but few errors, and those of no
moment : which however      is,   by
                                   a strange fatality, opposed, at the
end of the Almanac for the present year,     by four pages of errata;
some of which are not of trifling nature, and
                          a                       by   no means errors
only of the press.    Lastly, we have now the equivocal authority
of the old and the new Board of Longitude for its publication       :
 and each may thus shift upon the other, with apparently equal
justice and as  it  suits their purpose, any attack which may be
 made on their ambiguous and ill-favoured offspring.

             Corrections     of I he Nautical Almanac for           1819.        219
    Postscript. — March 22. I             have just seen the Gazette of last
Saturday night,     wherein       is contained   a scale of rewards, approved
by the Prince Regent, for such ships as may arrive at certain
points of longitude and latitude therein mentioned ; and which
I presume is intended as an additional bounty to the officers and
sailors about to be employed in a new expedition towards the
North Pole.       But in that scale I see no reward, or expectation
of reward, held out to such persons as may be induced to attempt
any improvement in the method of discovering the longitude at
sea, the sole object for which this body of Commissioners was
formed ; and which ought certainly to have first engaged their
serious attention.        The new Board of Commissioners has existed
now about a twelvemonth ; a sufficient time, one would suppose,
to have matured a plan for the encouragement of this object: but
alas ! this important subject must yield to the fashionable im
pulse of the times ; and, when the mania for arctic discoveries has
ceased, the learned Commissioners may perhaps find leisure to at
tend to their duty.

  G. St. Hilaire, &c.
 [  For the following review we are indebted to the pen of M. Cuvier.]
To generalize,    to abstract, to reason well or    — such the ex                          ill              is
clusive prerogative of man     such also    the source of his power
                                            ;                               is
and of his weakness, of his intelligence and of his errors.                                                            It   is
the principle of these high qualities which      equally the basis of                is
judicial astrology and of astronomy       of the natural systems of     ;
ancientphilosophers, and of the modern experimental philosophy;
of the morals of Socrates, the politics of Machiavel, and the phi-
losophism of Voltaire. To this principle         owing that we have          it      is
wandered from experience in the study of the sciences of obser
vation, that we have returned to         and that we are perhaps   it,
wandering   from     again.
                      it
   In these variations there     otherwise nothing which ought to
                                                is
surprise us.    They have their origin      the very nature of the          in
sciences, in which observation and reasoning predominate alter
                                                                                                                 nately     ;

 nately ; observations always precise, exact, important, and which
 have only for their object, facts and their immediate relations ;
 reasoning often uncertain or hazardous, and to which there are
 no limits ; the one a sure guide, which constantly leads to true
 but confined results ; the other, which is faithful to genius alone,
and from whieh spring the highest virtues anetthe greatest errors.
     It is the submission of reasoning.to observation which forms
 the characteristic of modern science.     A law is regarded as no
 further obligatory than when it is supported not only by facts
 but by an assemblage of facts, the analogy between which may
 be positive, and which no prejudice can have misinterpreted.
  Here, however, arises a difficulty. — In what does this resem
 blance consist ? Nature, infinite in its powers, is equally infinite
 in its productions.; it varies them without measure: while obser
 vation only comprehends individuals; and hence results the de
 mand for generalization, for principle, and for system. It is thus
 that all sciences are under the necessity of mixing reasoning with
 observation, though in different degrees ; and it is in the use
 which each is allowed to make of these two modes of investiga
 tion, that their philosophy truly consists.
     The objects with which the sciences of observation are occu
 pied, which are possessed of qualities the most various, and whose
 relations are most extended, are animals; and of all the divisions
 into which the study of animals divides itself, comparative ana
                                   ....
  tomy is beyond all doubt that in which reasoning is most indis
  pensable.                                                 ...
     Until the present day, this important branch of natural science
Jiad only admitted a very small number of general laws. Its pru
 dent inductions were never established but upon facts, whose evi
 dent analogy does not leave any thing to doubt or uncertainty;
 and new observations have still been the principal object of its
 researches — a conduct doubtless most wise in a science so favour
 able to the love of hypothesis, and where errors are so easy and so
  seducing.
     It is thus that, with the aid of those inductions, physiologists
 have been led to unite all the animals provided with an osseous
 frame or skeleton under the name, of Vertebral; and according
 to the agreement of their different systems of organs to establish
 the subordination of their characters, and to class each in respect
 to the others in a methodical* and natural manner ; to see an fen-
 tire analogy between the hand of man, the foot of the horse, the
 wing of the bird} the pectoral fin of fish, &c. From these facts
 joined to many others, they have ventured to conjecture, that in
  the creation of all vertebral animals nature has followed a general
 plan, which she has only modified in some points, in order to
 make a distinction of species ; and that she has only passed from
                                                                  one

               St. Hilaire's Anatomical Philosophy.                        225
one form to another in the same organs by insensible gradations ;
— bold conjectures, which, confirmed by a sufficient number of
observations, open to the human mind a most extended career.
    It is from this elevated point that M. Geoffroy St. Hilaire has
descended to new osteological researches.             The simple compari
son of bones with the view         of  determining their resemblance        iij
respect of form and attributes, was not, however, alone sufficient
to conduct him into the vast career upon which he has entered.
Without reasoning he could have ventured but             a  few steps  ; and
it was necessary that he should make         a    survey of the whole field
of science. What resemblance, for example, could be discovered
by the mere comparison of forms and relations between the great
est part of those pieces which compose the skeleton of fishes and:
those which constitute that of mammiferous animals            ?    Certainly
none. — Have not also many of these pieces received the same
names  ;    so that vertebral animals which might in one respect be
supposed to be formed upon the same model, are. in another
constituted of parts essentially different       ?
   Professor Geoffroy supposes, with good reason, that this contra
diction originates in the influence of human anatomy on compa
rative anatomy.         The study of our species being of all studies
the most important, the anatomy of man was first known, and
all other anatomical researches became subordinate to             it
                                                                   :   it be
came thereby a sort of type, to which the organization of all.
other animals was compared, in order to characterize and name
their different parts — for this comparison was one which related
principally to forms.         Such a dependence, necessary at first. for
preventing     the  anatomist   from losing himself in the immense de
tails with which he was surrounded,         is    no longer necessary now
that these details are classed methodically, and every system of
organization can be examined in         a    manner altogether indepen
dent of any other.
   This just and fertile idea left him at liberty to take for the type
of each organ that in which the development had arrived at a
fixed point, and to make        it  thus the true ideal of organization.
M. Geoffroy has chosen medium term which constitutes for him
                            a
a normal state, beyond or within which there             is either excess or
privation.     As   this  mean   term,  however,    can only   be arbitrarily
fixed, and as each organ may be regarded as perfect when               it has
accomplished      its  end,  we are of opinion   that the  point  of greatest
development ought to be       a    point of comparison somewhat bet
ter established, and which would lead to relations more extended.
    Let this however be as   it   may, these ideas have led M. Geoffroy
not only to trace resemblance in identity of forms, and of the re
lations of bones to one another, but further, and especially           in the
identity   of their   relations with  other  systems   of organs.

     Considering, accordingly, osteology in this new point of view,
ihe proceeds to establish, that every time that two organs are in
 the same position, in 'the same relations, and under the same de
pendencies) they are similar^ In this rests his principle of con
 nexions ; and in btder to confirm this principle in many cases,
 considering the different parts of which these organs are composed,
 he shows that they display themselves in every organ of the same
 number, at least the rudiments of them. It is this sort of demon
 stration which he designates by the name of Theory of Analo
 gies.
    Disembarrassed in this manner of the principal obstacles which
 would have otherwise arrested the          course of his inquiry,
 M. Geoffroy, comprehending in his survey the whole tribe of ani
mals with osseous frames, distinguished that the variable parts
 of these animals, which he names abdominal parts, are di
rected to the anterior extremity of the vertebral column in fish,
 to the opposite extremity in birds ; that they rest in an interme
 diate situation in mammiferous animals ; and participate of both
 these systems of organization in reptiles.      Hence he possesses,
in a great measure, the explanation of all those anomalies which
these four groups of animals present when compared to each
other, and consequently the means of resolving the problem which
he proposed to himself to solve— namely, to restore the organi
 zation of vertebral animals to an uniform type.

                          ASIATIC SOCIETY.
 On     Monday evening, August 10, 1818, a Meeting of the Asiatic
Society was held at Chouringhee, The most noble The Marquis of
 Hastings, President, in the chair.
     On this occasion, the journal of a survey to the heads of the
rivers Ganges and Jumna, by Captain Hodgson 10th regiment
native infantry was presented by the President.              Captain
Webb's Survey, in 1808, having extended from the Doon valley
to Cajane near Reital, Captain Hodgson commences his scien
tific and interesting labours from the latter place, which by a se
 ries of observations he found to be in latitude 30 48 28 n.
The village of Reital consists of 35 houses which are built of
wood, and are two or three stories high.       He left Reital on the
21st of May 1817.        On the 31st he descended to the bed of
the river, and saw the Ganges issue from under a very low arch,
at the foot of the grand snow bed.        The river was bounded on
the right and left by high rocks and snow, but in front over the
debouchee the mass of snow was perpendicular, and from the bed
of the stream to the summit the thickness was estimated at little
less than 300 feet of solid frozen snow, probably the accumula
tion of ages, as it was in layers of several feet thick, each seem
ingly the remains of a fall of a separate year. From the brow of
this curious wall of snow, and immediately above the' outlet of
the stream, large and hoary icicles depended.        The Gaghoutri
Brahmin, who accompanied Captain Hodgson, and who was an
illiterate mountaineer, observed, that he thought these icicles
must be Mahadeo's hair, from whence, he understood, it is writ
ten in the Schaster, the Ganges flows. Captain Hodgson thinks
that the appellation of the Cow's mouth is aptly given to this ex
traordinary debouchee. The height of the arch of snow is only
sufficient to let the stream flow under it. — Blocks of snow were
falling on all sides, and there was little time to do more than to
measure the size of the stream ; the main breadth was 27 feet,
the greatest depth about 1 8 inches, and the shallowest part nine
or ten inches. Captain Hodgson believes this to be the first ap
pearance in day -light of the celebrated Ganges ! Zealous in the
prosecution of his inquiries, he attempted to proceed forward,
but was obliged to return, having frequently sunk in the snow,
one time up to his neck, and there being evident marks of hol
lows beneath.
     The height of the halting place, near which the Ganges issues
from under the great snow bed, is calculated to be 12,914 feet
above the sea ; and the height of a peak of the Himalaya, called
                                                                 St.

St. George by Captain Hodgson, is estimated to be 22,240 feet
above the surface of the sea.
   Captain Hodgson, in his account of the course of the river
Jumna, observes, that at Jumnoutri the snow which covers and
conceals the stream is about 60 yards wide, and is bounded on
the right and left by precipices of granite ; it is 40 £ feet thick,
and has fallen from the precipices above.      He was able to mea
sure the thickness of the bed of snow over the stream very accu
rately by means of a plumb-line let down through one of the holes
in it, which are caused       by
                             the steam of great number of boil
                                                  a

inches.   The head of the Jumna        on the s.w. side of the grand

   The employment of iron in a malleable state or converted into
steel, in machines which are not regularly worked, occasions a
rust which renders them frequently unfit for use after a lapse of
time, sometimes very short, according to the nature of the iron
or the vicinity of marine vapours.       This effect is chiefly felt in
the case of machines for mashing fruit and cutting esculent roots.
However, these instruments are daily multiplying throughout the
country, and it is much to be feared that the rust which affects
the quality of the substances on which they are employed, at the
same time that it destroys the instruments themselves, may bring
them into general disrepute, the result of which would be ruin
ous to the progress of agriculture and the arts.
   The Society of Encouragement         invite men of science and
artists to remedy this imperfection, either by employing, pro
cesses already known or to be yet discovered for preserving iron
and steel, or by substituting in their place other metallic sub
stances.
   Among the metals which may be so employed, it may perhaps
excite surprise tu find platina mentioned.       It is to be regretted
that this metal, invaluable for such a purpose from its firmness
and unalterability, should be so very dear ; but there is reason to
hope that ere long it will become more common, and it is not
 mpossible that it may then be employed with ceconomy, at least
for the exposed parts.     Besides, instead of subjecting it to long
and expensive operations in order to render it malleable, may it
not be employed when less pure and ductile, by taking it in a
crude state, such as it is found in commerce, and uniting it with
other metals which it may protect from oxidation ? It is certain
that tin can greatly increase its fusibility, and produce combi
nations perhaps less malleable but yet harder than iron, sound,
and sensibly less liable to oxidation.     As much may be said of
iron united to tin and platinum ; and there is reason to hope that
these compounds, already from five to six times at least more
marketable, than malleable platinum, may be very usefully em
ployed.    The very hard compound of copper, tin and platinum,
employed by M. Rochon in the manufacture of telescopes, has
been long known.
   The other metals which combine chemically — the binary, ter
nary, quaternary compounds, &c. may they not in varied pro
portions afford favourable results, which have not hitherto been
obtained, only because they have not been examined I            Let us
instance a few combinations.
   A mixture of tin with iron, without any portion of copper, pro
duces a hard, innocent, malleable, and very resisting compound,
which is by no means made use of to the extent it might be, and
                                                                which

    M. Dussaussoy *, who has made known that a mixture of cop
per, tin and iron, produces a compound of great tenacity, much
hardness, easily wrought, and excellent for cannon, indicates
 many other compositions, which, according to the proportion of
the metals and the thickness of the pieces cast, lose or gain,
 sometimes in tenacity, at others in hardness, qualities which may
often be augmented by tempering and hammering.                 Such com
positions have not been adopted into modern use, but may how
ever be of great utility to the arts.        It may be sufficient to cite
that compound of the ancients, consisting of 14 parts of tin to
 100 of copper, which cold-beaten and sharpened produced blades
harder than iron, and even preferable to those fabricated with
certain varieties of steel.
    If the irons and steels employed are further examined one by
one, it will be found that the steels are generally less oxidizable;
but that there are among them some more so than others, which
renders it of consequence that we should be select in our choice —
that the parts not exposed to friction may be greatly protected
from Tust, by smoking them, by giving them a strong varnish, by
tinning, or by oxidizing the surface before hand with acids, as is
often done with fire-arms; or by a method still better than any
of these, by keeping them under water for a certain time, from
which they will come out with a sort of varnish less injurable by
humidity, and similar to that which the fowling- piece of a game
keeper acquires after long use.
    Iron is in anotherstate naturally much less oxidizable, namely,
when fused. From the facility with which it may be then moulded,
and from its hardness, it appears capable of being beneficially
employed for all the friction parts of instruments, by fabricating
with it surfaces covered with sharp points — asperities artfully
disposed — so as to form excellent rasps for the grating of fruit and
esculent roots.      Cast-iron may also be used for the other parts
of such instruments, by moulding them with such precision that
the file shall not be necessary to adjust them, and the surface of
the moulding be thus preserved, which is always harder and much
less oxidizable than the interior. When machines of this descrip
tion are not in use they ought to be deposited in dry places,
being first covered with a sort of soap formed of oil mixed with
quick lime, and then powdered over with lime, which will serve
to absorb the humidity and the acids.
   It is to be hoped that by such means advantageously combined,
and by others known to or which may be discovered by men of

  Sir, —        W hen    at Florence I had some conversation with the
  Marquis Ridolfi, on the results of the action of the compressed
  gases on the earths.       I cannot doubt from his assurance, that he
  has repeated Dr. Clarke's experiments with success.             The me
  tallic grains were almost microscopic, yet exhibited an action
  sufficiently determined for their metallic character, such as effer
  vescence in contact with water, &c.
       The Marquis was good enough to show me an improvement
  he has made in this instrument.           I submit a sketch of the ap
  pendage to you (Fig. B, Plate II.)           The united gases, prior to
  ignition, pass through mercury contained in a small cistern (of
  iron) exterior to the reservoir.       With this arrangement he has
  never experienced accident, though he has had explosion within
  the safety cell, even when supplied with folds of wire-gauze and
  with water.
       Numerous experiments have convinced me that the gases be
  fore their issue, have in consequence of humidity (from traversing
- the water in the safety cistern) their intensity attenuated. Allow
  me therefore to suggest that they should pass a jointed ball sup
  plied with dry muriate of lime before they escape from the ori
  fice.       I have the honour to be, sir,
                            Your very humble servant,

       Sir,—By inserting the following in your valuable Philosophical
   periodical publication, you will much oblige

       About three months since, a Mr. Henry Jephson called on me
   and requested to know if I would sell him, for a friend, a large
   quantity of bleacher's refuse which was in my possession.               (It
                                                                          was

was wanted, I believe, to decompose for £he manufacture of car
bonate of soda.)
    On showing him some that had lain many months in a large
old wrought-iron boiler (which formerly belonged to a steam-
engine) he was delighted with a beautiful white effloresence which
appeared on the sides of the boiler nearest in contact with the
refuse, and which he ascertained afterwards to be a carbonate of
soda combined with a very small portion of iron.
    Last week I was much pleased to hear from him that he had
succeeded in obtaining this carbonate, by placing some scraps of
iron in contact with crystals of sulphate of soda for six weeks.
" It is well known that the bleacher's refuse is principally a sul
phate of soda and manganese."
    I hear with very considerable pleasure that Mr. Jephson is pre
paring for publication a work entitled
                                            " The Elements of Che
mical Analysis ;" and if my expectations are realized, it will do
him, much credit.

             ACID OF INDIGO.        BY PROFESSOR VAN      MONS.
    It has been hitherto believed that in the blue tub the indigo
loses its colour by becoming deoxidized, and resumes it on ex
posure to the air by being reoxidized.       M. Doebereiner has as
certained that it experiences this effect by becoming hydroge-
nated in the tub, by the combined reaction of oxidulate of iron,
lime and water, and by being dehydrogenized on exposure to
the air, and more rapidly by a weak solution of chlorine. Indigo,
which has the same constituents as animal charcoal, viz. thirty-
six parts of carbon with three parts and a half of azote, forms in
becoming hydrogenized a colourless acid soluble in water. This
acid combines in the tub with the lime, and separates itself
 anew under its ordinary form of indigo, when by the oxygen of
 the air, or that of the chlorine,its hydrogen is resolved into water.
 M. Doebereiner has named the acid of indigo isatanic, and its
 combination with lime isatinate.
     M. Holt has subsequently observed that the filings of iron or
 of zinc, being put into a solution of indigo in sulphuric acid, dis
 colour that solution ; and he thinks that this effect is caused by
 the hydrogen which these metals detach from the water.           It is
 already known that sulphurated acid, also prussiarated hydrogen,
 effects a similar discoloration.    The indigo here manifests with
 the hydrogen a stronger affinity than with the sulphuric acid ;
 and this affinity cannot be weak, since it counterbalances that
 which at the degree of heat which excites it the hydrogen never
 fails to exercise upon the oxygen of sulphuric acid.
                                                                  NEW

 NEW SALTS CRYSTALLIZED WITHOUT WATER.                          BY THE SAME.
 -
     It was formerly believed that the water of crystallization was
 essential to the crystalline form of salts ; and it was even thought
 that all salts were provided with it : now, however, it is known
 that those salts which in their ordinary crystallization take the
 most of that water, can be crystallized independently of                 and it,
 crystallized   even   better.
     If we dissolve fire in its water of crystallization some Glau
                       by
 ber salt, and add as much of the same salt effloresced as the so
 lution will take, crystals will make their appearance of               form  a
 different from that of the Glauber salt, and that even when the
 solution      still at temperature of 45° Reaumur. These cry
              is       a
 stals consist of the Glauber salt totally deprived of water, of
 which that species of salt contains about one half of its weight.
 Let little water then be added, and the whole allowed to cool,
      a

 minate proportions of salt without water and ordinary salt.
     Following the same operation with salt of soda,the refrigeration
 will produce in the mixture some large crystals, which will neither
 effloresce in the air nor imbibe any water, and which consist of
 subcarbonate of soda wholly free from this liquid, being formed
 of 29£ parts of soda and 21 parts of carbonic acid and having'      ;
 thus, in the same weight, more than double the real matter,
for the crystallized soda ordinarily incloses a third more than the
equal of its weight of water. The soda from the coasts of Africa,
which are washed        by   seas holding this alkali in solution, seems to
be in the same situation, since               does not effloresce,
                                                it                    change

which never fails to take place            contains water.

attended with      a  profit     ofmore than one half to purchase this
salt in preference to the other, when              can be had at the same

after having dissolved       it   in water.       will take for 51£ of this

its weight.
     Many other salts crystallize without water and among others,

marine salt, saltpetre, and sulphate of potash.               Water cannot
therefore be considered         as  essential to this operation, nor ought
it  to be termed water of crystallization.                It new body com

given to these compounds, and which has been extended to com
binations of water with the alkalies, the insoluble oxides and acids,
is  improper, inasmuch as              presupposes that in these different
                                      it

proportion of water with a proportion of barytes, of potash, of
 soda, of sulphuric acid, of nitric acid, &c, cannot be disunited

bodies under that form, as oxygen and a combustible are to their
 composition without water.
                    STEAM FISH-CONVEYING VESSELS.
    The application of the power of the steam-engine to naviga
 tion is now proposed to be extended to the important object of
furnishing the metropolis with a regular and constant supply of
freh fish at a cheap price. The variable manner in which the Lon
don market is supplied with this valuable article of food — its.
scarcity at one time, its over-abundance at another, and its dear-
ness at all  times— have long been matters of public complaint ;
and   are undoubtedly more the result of those detentions to which
the fishing packets are necessarily exposed from their depen
dence on the winds and tides, than of any combination or arti
fice (as is vulgarly supposed) among the dealers in the article.
A fishing company has accordingly been formed, for the convey
ance of fish from the coasts to the metropolis, whose vessels are
to be strongly built, sea-worthy, and fast-sailing sloops, with the
additional power of proceeding at option by sails or steam se
parately or united.       They are to be fitted up with wells and
suitable valves, so that the fish will be brought to Billingsgate
alive in pure sea-water, at all seasons of the year, and London
thus enjoy a luxury to which it has been hitherto a stranger.
The construction of the vessels and engines has been intrusted
to Mr. George Dodd, author of a work on Steam-Packets and
Steam-Engines.
                   IMPROVEMENT IN STEAM -VESSELS.
    Dr. Jeffray, Professor of Anatomy in the University of Glas
gow, is reported to have made an important discovery of a new
mode of propelling vessels of any description by steam. The prin
ciple of the invention has not as yet been made public ; but its
results, if we may give credit to the anticipations in the Glasgow     .
Courier, in which it has been announced, are altogether mar
velous.

have not access to the bulky and expensive works and Encyclo
paedias in which it appears such rules and observations are only
to be found, and without which the instrument in question is

       -          DISCOVERY OF AN ANCIENT CITY.
   One of the Paris journals announces that a French traveller,
now in Egypt, has discovered, at the distance of nine hours jour
ney from the Red sea, an ancient city built in the mountains
between the 24th and 25th degrees of latitude.        There are still
about 800 houses in existence ; and among the ruins, temples de
dicated to various divinities.     There are eleven statues, besides
fragments of others.      He has also discovered the ancient stations
that were appointed on the route through the Desert, going from
the Red sea to the valley of the Nile        They are at regular di
stances of nine hours between each. This route was undoubtedly
one of those traversed by the commerce of India which flourished
at the time of the Lagides, and under the first emperors.
                         CELTIC  ANTIQUITIES.
   A Prussian officer who lately spent some time at Wisbaden,
occupied himself in causing excavations to be made, in the hope
of rendering his visit to the country of the ancient Celts profita
ble to science.      In the course of his search he discovered a
Drutdical altar which had been overthrown, and was at first taken
for an ordinary tumulus ; a vase and a patera for sacrifices, and
various arms and rings, all of bronze; a glass vase with a cover ;
several coloured glass rings ; carnelians of various forms ; swords
and spear-heads of exquisite workmanship ; various edge tools
of stone, and among them a saw of flint.          A vaulted cave was
also discovered, containing ashes, calcined bones, and, what is
still more curious, several perfect skeletons in Roman dresses :
nearone of the skeletons was a concha veneris entirely petrified.
                            EARTHQUAKES.
   On the 2d day of October, about half past one P.M. a very
smart shock of an earthquake was felt at Brutenzorg, Batavia.
The houses were violently shaken, the windows rattled, the mor
tar fell from the walls, and the bells rung; people who were
standing up became giddy by the motion of the ground.           Some
houses had the walls rent open.      The shock lasted only a few se
conds.    It was felt in the mountains as well as in Batavia.
    It was lately reported that Messina had been entirely destroyed
by an earthquake, accompanied with the loss of some thousand
lives ; but letters of a later date than that mentioned for the ca
tastrophe have been received from that city.
   A letter from Palermo of 4th of March announces, that during
the fourteen preceding days the weather had been dreadful, du
ring which they had three shocks of an earthquake which had
done much mischief on the south-east part of the island (Sicily),
throwing down churches and destroying whole villages.           Much
damage was also done among the shipping.           No mischief was
done at Palermo.                                            Mvtemo-

      N. B. Though the very early part of this spring was forward,
  the season at present is not far advanced ; on the contrary, it is
  rather backward.     By a reference to journals for upwards of forty
  years back, I find that mild winters have generally been followed
'
  by rather late springs.

XXXVIII.         On the Question "Whether Music is necessary to the
     Orator, — /o what Extent, and how most readily attainable?"
    By Henry Upington, Esq.
                              [Continued from p. 86.]
                                 To  Mr. Tilloch.
           I  N your late
                                             Blair's Hill, Cork, March 11, 1819.
                              Journals for January and February I stated
at considerable length the method which, at my suggestion, was
adopted by the Speaker for the subversion of his original habits,
and the substitution of superior habits in their stead.                    I also
stated in that paper, the very simple operations by which any
gentleman may almost instantly acquire a sufficiency of music for
oratorical purposes : it now therefore remains that I circumstan
tially relate what subsequent exercises — whether of actual reci
tation, of intervals, of time or forte — were deemed expedient for
the Speaker, as the ground-work of his elocutionary proceeding.
     The passages with which I began this novel undertaking were,
as already mentioned, the Exordiums of Virgil's first Eclogue, of
the iEneid, and of the Iliad.           In these, as well as in the exordium
of Ovid's Metamorphoses which succeeded, both accent* and
quantity were attempted in the prescribed manner; and the re
sult was highly beneficial.            Passages from the Epithalamium on
                                                    f
Helen, by Theocritus, then followed ; and in this hexameter
    * The
           circumflex was omitted by me in the Latin. My general method
of classically accentuating this language will appear from the Eclogue. The
short and long quantity is known to every scholar,
              Tityre, tu patulse recuhans sub t^gmine fagi,
              Sylvestreni idnui musam nieditaris avena;
              Nos patriae fines et dulcia linquimus arva,
              Nos patriam fugitnus — tu, Tityre, lentus in umbra
               Formosam resonare doces Ainaiyllida >ylvas.
    This accentuation, even when really executed, has no modern peculiarity.
It is the universal language of the superior gentleman, not the local dialect
of either English, Scotch or Irishman.         I  notice this circumstance for the
guidance of those gentlemen whose opinions may unhcedingly have been
 influenced by the " Elements of Elocution" or" Rhetorical Grammar" of
Mr. Walker. Indeed from the whole tenor of these works which 1 have
 perused much more cnrefnlly than they deserve, I feel persunded that if he
(Mr. W.) had been taken to an instrument, his car must have been found
incapable of distinguishing the higher from the lower of any two contiguous
or nearly contiguous notes, as C from C .harp, or even from D, or perhaps
 from E minor.      It would certainly be well if all oratorical empirics were
 tried by some such test.       Their capability of distinguishing slides should
 also be ascertained by the pitch-pipe — the stopper of which should, in such
essay, be moved up and down very gradually.

242            "   Whether Music is necessary to the Orator, —
more licenses than usual were taken with the quantity — such li
censes indeed as the now newly -formed ear did at any time sug
gest, — the accurate observance of the Dactylic and Spondaic pro
portions sometimes appearing rather too heavy for the subject.
Regulated in this manner, it may safely be affirmed that this
Epithalamium, when judiciously modulated, exhibits more grace,
more elegance and melody than in all probability were ever yet
presented to our countrymen.      It possesses (in modern estima
tion) an  almost intermediate character  between poetry and prose,
partaking however much more of the former than of the latter ;
and is admirably calculated for the improvement of either the
genteel comedian or the orator.
   The Orations of Demosthenes were now taken up : and with
out over-nice attention to the sense, the exordium of his first
Philippic was practised, merely as a lesson of prosaic melody ; the
etas, omegas, diphthongs and circumflexed syllables obtaining all
warrantable extension of their quantities. Appropriate emphasis*
(or expression as we term     was afterwards delicately introduced,

violence to which some unfortunate syllable must by all means be devoted                ;
whereas this species of emphasis should,        all practicable cases, be avoided.

this sentence (ill constructed as    it  for the purpose) be delivered, so as to

    IfMr. Sheridan      his "Art of Reading" had thus investigated the general
                        in
character of his subject. Instead of partiality searching out some little points,
and barbarously degrading to the rank ot enclitics an infinity of important
words — much reason had been found (in the present state of intelligent
opinion) to approve rather than condemn our clerical delivery of theChurch
service — so shamefully misrepresented         by
                                                this uncandid writer.
   Neither, in my mind,       the stage modulation at all suited to the solemnity
                              is
of the temple. Every thing has its own *proper place. Hence                 appears
                                                                            it

the seat of justice or the pulpit. As for my own part, whenever discover   I

tion to my best intentions — to the Play.
                                                                                      gree

gree modernized.          Its ultimate character was peculiar: sweet
gravity     was  its main    constituent.
    Our native composition was next essayed.               Improvement was
striking and decided, although certain vestiges of original asso
ciations were still perceptibje.          For the perfect obliteration then
of all these, a finishing exercise appeared desirable — and for this
purpose the accentual or muscular signs were evidently the most
effectual.
    Some eighty or a hundred lines from "Leland's Demosthenes"
and " The Spirit of Patriotism," together with the " Apostles'
Creed*" were therefore accented; not regularly indeed and ac
cording to ancient method, but rather in an arbitrary manner —
these English exercises having but two objects in view; namely,
the changing of original associations, and accustoming theSpeaker
to unusual attempts at elevation, depression and repetition, even
with temporary rant, which imperfection the judicious practi
tioner should however, as much as possible, avoid. The exordium
of the first Philippic will serve for an example.
                              Philippic the first.
    [For the definite application of the accentual signs, see Ma
gazine for January.]
    "  Had we been convened Athenians up6n some new subject
of debate, I had waited until most of the lisualf persons had de
clared their opinions.          If I Md approved of any thing proposed
by' them, I should have continued silent : if ndt, I had then at
tempted to express my' sentiments.             But since those ve"ry points
upon which th^se speakers have oftentimes been heard already,
are at this time to be considered; tho I hdve arisen first, I
presume I may expect your pardon ; for if thfey, on former oc
casions had advised the necessary measures, you would not have
found it needful to cdnsult at present."
    During the prosecution of these latter exercises, Music was
once more introduced.             The Speaker, as I have elsewhere ob
served, was, notwithstanding his almost incredible improvement,
still too unchaste and even too monotonous in his modulation to
satisfy the discriminating judges by whom he was occasionally
   * This Creed was chosen for its

wards the conclusion of the period, were also intended as preventives of

    Such are the very simple lessons beyond which (unless some

most esiregiously ignorant of intervals.
   In this solfay, every semitone of the octave is comprehended by the
words Dopare Homifa Tusolde Lanosi; the syllables of which should, in
my opinion, be disposed not merely in the Venetian manner, but in a man
ner significant of immediate distance, so that the practitioner shall sing the
interval itself by the agency of its name.          I shall exemplify the Diapente
by the first eight syllables Dopare Bomifa Tusol: let the remaining four
be added by the musician.

 246         " Whether Music        is necessary to the Orator, —
Inends whether the orator could with any prospect of utility, pro
 ceed.      All the songs within the'ir recollection, or to which re
 course could in any way be had, were decidedly rejected — with
the exception of those two so frequently mentioned, " God save
 the King
               " and "                             Even these were consi

 dered by no means faultless ; and yet, as examples of extremely
 chaste modulation, and containing the sub-semitone of their re
 spective keys, they were nevertheless hazarded — and fortunately
 with advantage.          The time too, which is the simplest of our
 i,  and most analogous to the imperfect Cretic — ° S" so com
 mon in our language, was an additional inducement.                   For the
 prevention, however, of inarticulate or ranting habits, these songs
 were in some degree modified : and, for accustoming the Speaker
 to an elevated command towards the closing of his periods, the
 triplet or grace or^the penultimate bar of " God save the King,"
 though objectionable in every other sense, was reluctantly intro
 duced.
     These two pieces being composed in triple time and in the
 major mode, a minor exercise* in common time was also sug
 gested.       Of this nature not an eligible song could be procured.
  Our sacred melodies were therefore examined; and one which
 the Speaker had frequently heard sung in one of our churches
  (and most sublimely indeed) was chosen for the purpose.                  The
  time and intervals of these three pieces, in their original form,
  ran thus,
                              God save the King.

     Inexplicable as it may seem, why our early habits, when con
nected with certain associations, should with extreme difficulty
be removed — the fact is nevertheless incontrovertible.          Never did
there appear a stronger instance of this truth than was exhibited
by the Speaker.       His periods, during recitation, were originally
ili-sustained ; and notwithstanding all the subsequent advantages
of muscular and musical exercise, his primary associations were
so deeply imprinted that all the efforts of art seemed ineffectual,
on certain occasions, for their obliteration. Success was almost
despaired of — when, fortunately, a most simple and I believe
novel expedient was suggested by an ingenious friend — an expe
dient equally applicable to any intermediate part as well as to the
conclusion of a sentence ; viz. practising for a few moments the
terminating portion as though it were the commencement, and
adding some auxiliary words to assist the imagination.              As thus
with the period "for all are ready to confederate with those
whom they see prepared and resolved to exert themselves as they
ought."      Let the reciter suppose himself beginning a sentence
in the following manner, annexing the imaginary part which is
printed in small capitals ; To exert themselves as they ought is
THE ONLY METHOD OF ENSURING OUR OBJECT, BECAUSE, &C.
&c. : and after having practised this reading for three or four
times, let him return to the original.
     Now simple as this contrivance may appear, it was always, even
in the most cumbrous sentence, found eminently efficacious: nay,
it produces even in the most untutored reciter an instantaneous
change; and compels him, in defiance of himself, to an exceed
ingly close approximation towards that species of level of which I
treated in this Journal for last September. In short, this operation
may be considered by the orator, of more practical advantage
with regard to periods than all the individual or collective rules
with which our modern writers upon elocution have swelled their
pages.
     Our attention, which was hitherto chiefly occupied by the va
rious lessons that were judged necessary for improving the Speaker
in the sustentation of his voice and the command of intervals —
 must for a short time be turned to the subject of time and forte.
The command of these, under all circumstances even the most
difficult, was by no means lightly appreciated; nor did the result
voice on the higher keys, yet this Psalm tias perhaps been set rather too
 high. Should the orator employ for his improvement those keys which carry
him beyond his speaking compass?     I  think not.
                                                                          in

         to what Extent, and how most readily attainable ?"                  249
 in any manner disappoint our expectation.              Uncommon energy,
 ease, distinctness     and  expression,     not merely in the delivery of
 emphatic words or emphatic syllables, but throughout all the in
 dividual parts of the most complicated sentences, were acquired;
 and by a method equally prompt as efficacious; viz. " the mere
 practice of an arranged table, with diversified forte of the simpler
feet; to the greater part of which so arranged, extensive exercises
 in the Greek or Latin — but which the Speaker was too impatient
 10 encounter — must of themselves have habituated his ear and
 enunciative organs.
     These feet, as the reader will discover, are inclosed or barred
 in the natural or truly classical, not in our artificial or musical
            "                             The latter, or musical manner,
  [called      classical"] manner.
 which rejects in many instances the Acre- prescribed order of
 forte; and unduly lengthens, beyond the written duration, the
 commencing or emphatical note of its respective bars, while it
 shortens the succeeding one* — is contrary to the intention of this
 lesson, whose object is relative proportion : wherefore, for ex
 ample, although our second and third tribrachs [see table, for the
 cause of numbering them] may appear to the musician as equi
 valent to the first, when those tribrachs shall be thus barred

 do    |
         do do do | or do do | do do do ; yet nothing can be further
 from the fact — nor should they be so practised by the orator.
 On the contrary, he must aim at the equalization of the length
 of everv such syllable, no matter in what situation it shall be
 found; while the three syllables, in aggregate, within the written
 boundary, though completely united with each other as a word of
 three syllables, shall be nevertheless detached both from the last
 syllable of the preceding and from the first syllable of the suc
 ceeding measure, as thus | do — do — do | do — do — do | do — do
 — do | ; even approaching in some slight degree, by the agency
 of the almost imperceptible boundary-pauses, to what the un
 skilful musician will possibly set down as common time.
      Pei haps, above all other exercises, this excellent one of the
 tribrach, as regulated in the table, is the best calculated for
 enabling the orator to annihilate at pleasure that despicable
jigging quality of our triplet — with which, from the musical ha
  bits of our country, our very language itself would appear almost
     * This
             (accompanied by more or less forte) is tlie true definition of the
  term " musical accent" which lias been ingeniously introduced by our writers
  on music, in the mysterious garb of " pressure .'" Call it acceJit, pressure,
  forte, or what we please, it is certainly subversive of all relative proportion,
  and constitutes one of the essential differences betw een the Grecian music
  and our own: and from such practice results the general incapacity of our
  musical world for the mensuration of relative time.

them as constituting several separate genera.         Under the general
description of a small head, a slender bill beset with bristles, small
and depressed nostrils ; and an outer toe joined to the middle one
by a membrane, &fc. naturalists have imperfectly depicted the
character, and have overlooked the less obvious but not less es
sential differences to be found in the forms of the brain, the
mode of feeding, and other habits and manners of the several
genera and species of Warblers. I have endeavoured by observa
tion to found a division of genera on these differences, and sub
mit them in the following pages.
                          Genus    FICEDULA.
    I have adopted for the division (Muscivorce) of some conti
nental writers this term from Aldrovandus, and have used it here
to designate the three species of Willow Wren known in this
island, in preference to Irochilus (which 1 have formerly used),
as this latter term is already (though I believe erroneously) ap
plied to the Humming Bird.
    The great confusion which has prevailed among ornithologists
with respect to the Willow Wrens, has induced me to be very mi
nute in the description of them, in order to convey clear ideas of
the characteristic marks of distinction which each species may
possess.     Their great resemblance in many particulars has led
to the abovementioned confusion in the description of them.
    The description of Sylvia Trochilus, or the Willow Wren, by
Latham, seems to answer to that of the Sylvia Hippolais, or Least
Willow Wren, of Montagu's Ornith. Diet. — Temminck                has re
cently fallen into a similar mistake.         Bewick has mistaken the
names ; and, in short, almost all writers have mixed part of the
description of one species with that of another.          The infinity of
names also used by various writers renders necessary a copious
table of reference, in order to identify species by their descrip
tions.

    Some German writers call this bird Gruner Sanger; and Beck-
 stein has called it Lambrolchen and Laubvolchen,
    This bird is apparently figured in Nillson's Ornitkologia Sue-
 cica, vol. i.
    Description. — Length about five inches: bill dusky: irides
 hazel. The upper part of the head, back, scapulars and coverts
 are dusky yellowish green.      Over each eye there is a bright brim
 stone-coloured streak.      The cheeks, throat and breast are yellow,
 palest on the breast and inclining to white ; the lower part of
 the breast, belly and under-tail coverts white.
    The plumage of the female is like that of the male ; but she
 appears somewhat larger, and weighs three drachms.
    This bird has been confounded with the species next described
 (5. Trochilus).       But it may be easily distinguished by its colour
 and habit.    The upper parts are of a brighter greenish colour ;
 and it is found in more wooded situations than the Sylvia Tro
 chilus.
    This species is migrative like the other two       : it arrives very
 early in May, and departs in September.
                  Species 2.    Ficedula Salicum.

    This is the Yellow Wren of Edwards ; the Middle Willow
 Wren of White in Hist. Selborne ; the Scotch Wren of Pennant
and Latham ; and the Willow Wren of Bewick.
    The provincial names for it are Ground Wren, or Ground
Huckmuck.
   This bird weighs two drachms and almost three quarters, and is
five inches in length, being somewhat smaller than the last.          It
is to be distinguished from that bird by the upper parts of the
plumage being more of a greenish yellow olive, the under parts
being whitish tinged with yellow; quills dusky edged with yellow;
over the eye a yellow line; legs light brown: eggs spotted with
dark rust colour. This species is more frequently found about
willows and osiers than the other two are.

    This is called Chifchaf, or Lesser Pettichaps; it is the Least
  Willow Wren of White         and Bewick.
     Its length  is four inches and a half, and   it weighs two drachms.
 it  is to be distinguished from the last species by its smaller size,
  bythe under parts being lesstinged with yellowand the upper parts
 rather browner, by its legs being dusky instead of brown, and by
 its song.     The eggs are white speckled with purplish red.
    The Chifchaf is frequent in gardens and orchards, particularly
 where larch and fir trees abound : it arrives in March and departs
 in November.        This bird as well as the last may be easiest found
 in still rainy days, when they may be seen running nimbly about
 the boughs and hedges. It is generally to be found flitting about
 the branches of the pine trees in pursuit of its prey, and where
 trees of this genus abound, we are rarely disappointed in finding
 it during summer.
    The head of this kind is somewhat more depressed than the
 last.

 the species are occasionally noticed in the journals of the weather,

XL.      Discoveries made in Egypt by Mr. Caviglia ; with Re
    marks on the probable Reason for the principal Entrances into
    the Pyramids having been constructed descending in an Angle
    of 26° or 27° to the Horizon.
In     our Number for February 1817 (see our fifty-first vol.) we
announced that some important discoveries respecting the sphynx
and the principal pyramid had been made by a Captain C. and
Mr. Salt ; that by excavating round the sphynx they had ascer
tained that it is cut out of the solid rock ; that they had entered
the chamber immediately over that containing the sarcophagus,
and which had been discovered by Mr. Davison in 1765, as de
scribed in his Journal published in Walpole's Memoirs, the ex
istence of which had since been doubted; and that they found that
the descending passage at the entrance of the pyramid, instead
of term to a ting where there is an ascent to the two chambers,
continues in a straight line, till it joins the bottom of what has
been hitherto called the well, but does not there terminate, but
proceeds onward to a well, or rather, as we now find, another
chamber exactly under the apex of the pyramid.              The Capt. C.
                                                                    there

254                     Discoveries   made in   Egypt.
there alluded to, and to whom Mr. Salt ascribes the entire merit
of these and other important discoveries which we shall briefly
notice, is Mr.Caviglia, the owner and master of a Mediterranean
trader, enthusiastically fond of such pursuits.
    Mr. Caviglia's first object was to examine the well in the
chamber of the great pyramid, neither he nor Mr. Salt being then
aware that Mr. Davison had been at the bottom of it forty years
before. With a rope round his body, his friends remaining above
to secure the other end, he descended the shaft twenty-two feet
in depth: from this a passage of about eight feet, led to a second
shaft of only five feet in depth ; and four feet ten inches from this
was another well somewhat tortuous twenty-nine feet deep, where
there is a grotto about fourteen feet long and five wide, and about
 the height of a man : here a new shaft, somewhat inclined, com
mences of ninety-nine feet in depth, where all further progress was
prevented by dirt and rubbish.          He found but little difficulty in
reaching    the  bottom,   but the   heat  was excessive and the air very ;
impure.      Dissatisfied  with  this first attempt, he afterwards hired
some Arabs, and absolutely set to work to clear away the rub
bish from the bottom of the well ; but which he was obliged to
abandon, the air being so bad that a candle would not burn in it.
Disappointed in this object, he next proceeded to clear out the
principal entrance of the pyramid ; and now he discovered that
this passage, instead of terminating where it had hitherto been
supposed, continues in the same inclination downward, of the
same dimensions, and having its sides worked with the same
care as the entrance, though filled nearly to the top with earth
and stones.      At the length of 150 feet the foul air became again
very troublesome : however, he persevered; and having penetrated
200 feet, he found a door-way on the right, from which having
cleared the rubbish, he found himself in the bottom of the well,
and there his baskets and implements which had been left on his
recent attempt to clear it out.         The opening of this passage to
the well had the effect to produce a free circulation of air, and en
abled him to pursue his researches without any further hindrance
from that cause.         The new passage did not terminate at the
opening into the well : twenty-three feet beyond this, in the same
angle of inclination, it became narrower, and then proceeded ho
rizontally about twenty- eight feet further, where it opened into a
chamber sixty-six feet long and twenty-seven broad, but of un
equal height — the floor which is cut out of the rock, having never
been levelled.     The half of the length from the east or entrance
end is fifteen feet between floor and ceiling : in the middle it is
five feet lower, presenting the appearance of the commencement
of another well ; and from this it rises towards the west end,
                                                                  where

                     Discoveries  made in   Egypt.              25 5
where it is hardly the height of a man. No sarcophagus was found
in this apartment.    On its south side is a horizontal passage just
wide enough for a man to creep in, which terminates abruptly at
the end of fifty-five feet.    Another passage commences, with a
kind of arch,  at the  east end  of the chamber, which runs about
forty feet into the solid body of the pyramid.
   The next enterprise of Mr. Caviglia was that of entering the
upper chamber, to which we have already alluded. The sides and
roof are of red granite highly polished; the floor is composed of
the large stones which form the roof of the sarcophagus room.
No antiquities were found to reward all this labour.
   In another undertaking Mr. Caviglia met with a rich harvest,
in the suecess which followed his exertions to explore the con
tents of several of the ruined edifices and tumuli which, when
viewed from the top of the great pyramid, appear in countless num
bers scattered among the pyramids, extending on the left bank of
the Nile north and south as far as the eye can reach.     They have
been mentioned by travellers, but never examined before with the
attention they merit.     The stone buildings to which he gained
access, by freeing   them    from the sand and rubbish with which
they were choked,     and   which  Mr. Salt supposes to be mauso
leums, are generally oblong, with their walls slightly inclined in
ward from the perpendicular, flat-roofed, with a parapet rounded
at top and rising about a foot above the terrace. Their walls are
constructed of large masses made nearly to fit with each other,
though rarely rectangular.       Some have door-ways ornamented
above with a volute, covered with hieroglyphics ; others only of
square apertures, gradually narrowing inward.        The doors and
windows are all on the north sides —perhaps, because least ex
posed to the wind-carried sands from the Libyan desert.         The
inside of the walls of the first he examined, was stuccoed and
                                                                     "
embellished with rude paintings, one of which represented the
sacred boat, another a procession ; and in the southern extremity
were found several mouldering mummies laid one over the other
in a recumbent position. Many of the bones were entire, and
on one skull was part of its cloth covering inscribed with hiero
glyphics. The second which he examined had no paintings, but
contained several fragments of statues — two of which, composing
the entire body of a walking figure, almost the size of life, with
the arms hanging down and resting on the thighs. Mr. Salt thinks
this was intended as a portrait, the several parts of which were
marked with a strict attention to nature, and coloured after life,
having glass eyes or transparent stones to improve the resem
blance. A head was also discovered which Mr. Salt describes as
a respectable specimen of art.     Many of the fragments of granite
and alabaster sculptures give a higher idea of Egyptian art than

256                 Discoveries    made in     Egypt.
has usually prevailed, much attention being shown to the mark
ing of the joints and muscles. In another of these buildings was
a sculptured boat of a large size with a square sail, different from
any now in use on the Nile.          In the first chamber were bas-re
liefs of men, deer and birds, painted to resemble nature ; — the
men engaged in different mechanical occupations. In the second
apartment there were similar productions — a quarrel between
some boat-men, executed with great spirit' — men engaged in agri
cultural pursuits, ploughing, hoeing, stowing the corn in ma
gazines, &c. — vases painted in vivid colours — musicians with a
group of dancing women : another chamber was without embel
lishment : a fourth had figures and hieroglyphics ; and in a fifth
were hieroglyphics executed on white plaster, as it would ap
pear, by means of stamps.           In all the mausoleums which were
opened, fragments     of  mummy cloth, bitumen and human bones
were found ; but what is perhaps most singular of all, in one
apartment or other of all of them was a deep shaft or well. One
that was cleared out by Mr.Caviglia was sixty feet deep; and in a
subterranean chamber a little to the south, at the bottom of the
well, was found without a lid, a plain but highly- finished sarco
phagus; and from this it may be inferred, that in each mauso
leum such a chamber and sarcophagus may be found at the bot
tom of the well. Mr. Salt mentions that all the mausoleums con
sisted of different apartments, some more some less in number,
variously disposed and similarly decorated, and that the objects
in which the artists have best succeeded are animals and birds :
the human figures are in general out of proportion, but the ac
tion in which they are engaged is intelligibly, and, in some in
stances, energetically expressed.          In many of the chambers the
colours retain all their original freshness.           The bas-reliefs and
colouring   after nature,  in  these early efforts of art, serve, he says,
to embody the forms, and to present a species of reality that
mere painting can with difficulty produce.
    Mr. Salt considers these edifices as anterior to the pyramids.
The Quarterly Reviewer, with more reason, we think, concludes
on the contrary, that they were constructed from the dilapidated
casing of the pyramids, which had on them an immense number
of hieroglyphics; and a fact mentioned by Mr. Salt, namely,
that one of the stones bearing an inscription and figures was built
into the wall in which he saw       it, upside down, furnishes evidence
that  it had previously   formed  a   part of some other edifice.
    But the most brilliant of Mr. Caviglia's labours was that of un
covering the great Andro-sphynx           in  front of the pyramid of Ce-
phrenes,   which  we  noticed    in our  fifty-first volume. The labour,
which was immense,            described pretty fully in the Quarterly
Review, No. xxxviii.     It is

 with the assistance of from 60 to 100 persons every day to lay
 open the whole figure to its base, and expose a clear area ex
 tending 100 feet from its front — a labour in which they were
 greatly impeded by the moveable nature of the sand, which by
 the slightest wind or concussion was apt to run down like a cas
 cade of water and fill up the excavation.        This colossal figure is
 cut out of the rock, the paws, and        some projecting lines where
 perhaps the rock was deficient, or which may have been repaired
'since its first construction, being composed of masonry.
     On the stone platform in front, and centrally between the
 paws of the sphynx, which stretch out fifty feet in advance of the
 body, was found a large block of granite two feet thick, fourteen
 high, and seven broad.         It fronts the east, as does the face of
 the sphynx, is highly embellished with sculptures in bas-relief,
 representing two sphynxes on pedestals and priests presenting
 offerings, with a well executed hieroglyphical inscription beneath:
 the whole covered at top, and protected as it were with the sa
 cred globe, the serpent and the wings.        Two other tablets of cal
 careous stone, similarly ornamented, were conjectured, with the
 former, to have constituted part of a temple, by being placed
 one on each side of the latter at right angles to it. One of them
 was in its place, the other thrown down and broken, the frag
 ments of which are now in the British Museum.             A small lion
 conchant, with its eyes directed towards the sphynx, was in front
 of this edifice.   Several fragments of other lions and the fore
 part of a sphynx were likewise found, all of which, as well as the
 sphynx, the tablets, walls and platform' on which the little
 temple stood, were covered with red paint, which would seem
 here, as in India, to have been appropriated to sacred purposes
 — perhaps as being the colour of fire. A granite altar stands in
 front of the temple, one of the four horns being still in its place,
 and the effects of fire visible on the top of the altar.   On the side
 of the paw of the great sphynx and on the digits of the paws are
 Greek inscriptions, as also on some small edifices in front of the
 sphynx, inscribed to the Sphynx, to Harpocrates, Mars, Hermes,
 to Claudius, (on an erasure in which can be traced a former
 name, that of Nero,) to Septimius Severus (over an erasure of
 Geta), &c. Several of these inscriptions are given in the Quar
 terly Review.
    We are concerned to add, that in consequence of Mr.Caviglia's
 great exposure to the sun during ten months which he occupied
 in these researches, he had an attack of ophthalmia, which com
 pelled him at length to desist, and to return to Alexandria.         By
 these operations an expense was incurred of about 1 S,000 piastres,
 of which Mr. Salt contributed a share, as did also two or three

other English gentlemen, who liberally engaged that whatever
might be discovered should be left to the disposal of Mr. Caviglia ;
and he on his part generously requested lC that every thing might
be sent to the British Museum,ch as a testimony of his attachment
to that country, under the protection of whose flag he had for
many years navigated the ocean."
   An incidental remark of Caviglia, that "one ceases to see the
pole-star at the spot where the main passage ceases to continue
in the same inclination, and where one begins to mount," has
suggested to the Quarterly Reviewer the idea that possibly these
passages were intended to answer some purpose in astronomy,
whatever might be their other purposes ; and we think the idea
is deserving of consideration.  In the six pyramids that have been
opened at Gizeh and Saccara, the entrance has been found at
or near the centre, on the northern face, and the passage in all
inclined downward.       Greaves makes that of Cheops 26°, and
Caviglia 27°, which he says is common to all the sloping passages
in this pyramid.   He found the same angle on opening the small
pyramids to the south of that of Mycerinus, at the end of the
passage of which were two chambers leading one out of the other,
which were both empty.      Belzoni     [see our last number] estimates
the angle of the sloping   passages    in the pyramid of Cephrenes at
26°.    " Now," savs the Reviewer, " it is quite impossible that
this coincidence could have been accidental ; it must have been
the work of design, executed for some special purpose
All the learning of the Egyptians was vested in their priests.
Their knowledge of astronomy is not merely hypothetical
When we find that all the learning of Thales, by which he was
enabled to calculate eclipses and determine the solstitial and
equinoctial points, was acquired from the Egyptians, 600 years
before the Christian era ; that, at a later period, Eratosthenes,
under the sanction of the Ptolemies, was enabled to measure the
length of a degree of the meridian, and from it to deduce that of
the circumference of the earth, to an extraordinary degree of ac
curacy, by the unerring principles of geometry; and that the
mday of the summer solstice was then, and probably much earlier,so
nicely observed by means of a well dug at Syene, from whose sur
face (on that day) the sun's disc was reflected entire, — we are com
pelled to concede to the ancient Egyptians a very high degree of
astronomical knowledge." To this we may add, that there had been
a period when with them Apis          e. Taurus] was the leader of
                                      \i.
the heavenly host, though, at the period when the Greeks first be
came acquainted with their astronomy, Amman [The Ram] per
formed that office;   and from this    appears they must have been
                                       it
acquainted with the precession of the equinoxes, and, when the

vernal equinox passed into the latter sign, had then adopted the
practice of counting the signs from Aries.      Had more modern
astronomers adopted the same procedure, the nominal commence
ment of this equinox would have been transferred to Pisces when
the equinox passed from the stellar Ram into that of the Fishes.
    Astronomical utility, the Reviewer conceives, might have been
in contemplation when the main passages leading from the
northern faces were constructed.      They" are invariably inclined
downwards, in an angle    of  about 27°, more or less, with the ho
rizon, which gives a line of direction not far removed from that
point in the heavens where the north pole-star now crosses the
meridian below the pole. The observation of the passaga of this,
or some other star, across this part of the meridian, would give
them an accurate measure of sidereal time — a point of the first
importance in an age when no other instruments than rude solar
gnomons, or something still more imperfect, were in use. Indeed
 (continues the Reviewer) we know net of any method that could
more effectually be adopted for observing the transit of a star
with the naked eye, than that of watching its progress across the
mouth of this long tube; and some one or more of these lumi
naries, when on the meridian below the pole, must have been
seen in the direction of the angular adits."   From Mr. Caviglia's
statement it is to be inferred that he actually saw the pole-star
when at the bottom of the main passage : " and if so, we have
not yet got the true measure of the angle which these passages
form with the horizon. This would be very desirable, as it might
lead to most important results; especially if it should be found
that the difference in the angles of the adits of the pyramids of
Gizeh, Saccara, and Dashow corresponded with the difference
of the latitudes of those places; for we might then be almost
certain that they were intended to observe the passage over the
meridian, of some particular star, whose altitude, when below the
pole, was equal to the angle of the adit.     If this suggestion be
well founded, it would not be difficult, by calculation, to deter
mine which of the stars (in Ursa Major most probably) might he
seen to pass across the.wiouth of the shafts about the supposed
time of building the pyramids, and thereby fix with more pre
cision the period at which these stupendous edifices were erected."
That the pyramids were intended in some way for astronomical
purposes has long been suspected; but we have never before met
with the rational suggestion offered in the Quarterly Review, to
account for the inclination given to the principal passages.

             he nature of heat, like that of light, is still in dark
ness ; for although many of its effects are pretty familiar to us,
yet the nature of the cause is wholly unknown.     Our ignorance
in this respect does not arise from want of diversity of opinion
on the subject, since almost every author entertains his own fa
vourite notions.  But to enumerate all the wild speculations that
 have from first to last been let loose on the public, would be an
 endless as well as an useless task.   Suffice it to say, that what
 ever discordance apparently prevails among the different hypo
 theses, it is some consolation, that they generally agree in the
main point — their grand common tendency being only to fortify
more strongly the impenetrable barrier that has hitherto defended
the nature of heat.     Indeed it may be fairly questioned, if even
the most capacious and enlightened human mind be in any de
gree adequate to comprehend the nature of heat, although it
were fully unfolded to view.       The same may be said of many
other things.     Like the unlettered child fondly handling the my
sterious page, he would gape, and gaze, and wonder, in vain. Be
-this as it may, the little success that has uniformly attended the
numerous attempts to explain this hidden principle, indisputably
proves they were premature.        For the present it is surely of in
finitely more use, carefully to register the observed effects.
    No simple hypothesis has ever been framed satisfactorily to
 explain all the different phaenomena.     The more common one —
                                                         it,
 that heat is a substance and cold the absence of        does not quite
 account for every appearance.       The  difficulty of giving      suffi

 cient reason, on this hypothesis, for the apparent        reflection   of
cold, has even induced some to create a system of frigorific rays
to operate as    deserved check on the capricious anomalies of
                   a
heat, which have so wantonly derided every honest effort to ex
plain them.

cold upon the thermometer by means of the conical reflector ; be
cause it was readily concluded, that were cold merely the priva
tion of heat, the result ought to be just the reverse ; for in that
case it was supposed, that when the thermometer was placed at
the wider end, mostly all the heat which flowed from the one-half
of its ball, behoved to be collected to the narrow end by reflec
tion ; whereas, in the other position, a much less portion of heat
would be conducted to the cold body. To a superficial inquirer,
this afforded a very excellent demonstration of the existence of
frigorific rays.
      However, upon a more careful examination of the subject,
 founded upon principles generally received, it may easily be
 shown, that a conical reflector can only collect rays which are
 but little inclined to its axis ; and consequently, that most of the
 rays of heat flowing from the thermometer when placed at the-
 wide end, are either thrown out at that end or fall again upon:
 the thermometer.
     For let the cold body E, five inches in diameter, be now placed
 at the narrow end of the cone, whereof the diameter is one inch
  (see fig. 4), and let F, the ball of the thermometer of two inches
 diameter, be stationed at the wide end, of which the diameter is
 five inches; the inclination of A B to C D being 16°: we shall
 also suppose at first, that the heat issues from the ball of the
 thermometer in lines perpendicular to its surface:
     Then a ray F G falling upon the reflector so as to make the
 angle FGA=30, will be reflected to H, making 1GH also =
30°; but angle G H C will evidently be 30" together with 16°
the inclination of A B to CD, in all 46°.        For a like reason, an
gle H I G =62*, I K H = 78°, and K L I = 94° : always in-                       ,
creasing by 16°.       Further than this it cannot go; for at the next
reflection the ray will fall back between K and H, and finally
return to the wide end.       This will obviously be the fate of the
greater part of the radiation ; much of         no doubt, falling again
                                                 it,
upon the thermometer.
     Nowit    isevident, by  thus tracing out the true paths of the
rays, that all the radiation that   ismore inclined to the axis of the
cone than about 12°, will return again to the wide end,         ifnot to
the thermometer     ;  and therefore, the radiation of the surface of
a   spheric segment 24° in breadth, which          only -46th of the

dent that that end embraces     a   space of  the ball's surface 60°   in
breadth, which     is about 2-15ths ofthe hemisphere        and that all

the cold body placed at the wide end, will be six" times as great
as in the reverse position.     This, it is true, much exceeds what
is wanted for our purpose ; but we must make some allowance for
rays which are lost by reflection, or which do not emanate perpen
dicularly from the surface of the ball ; and besides, it is a current
though doubtful notion, that in the reflection of heat, the angle of
incidence is less than that of reflection.   At all events, it is hoped
that by means of the foregoing explanation the paradox may be
solved without the sorry aid of frigorific rays, which certainly
deserve no encouragement in our northern climate.            How soon
they might be followed by a kindred system of tenebrific rays, it
is not easy to say.    I am, &c.                   Henry Meikle.

XL1I. On the Purification of Coal Gas ; on the ammoniacal
  Liquor of Coal Gas; and on some singular Products obtained
 from the ammoniacal Liquor. By Mr. George Lowe, of
   Derby.
                            To   Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, — Having      just read in your truly scientific and interesting
Magazine for last month, Mr. Bolton's communication on the
popular subject of coal-gas, in which he honours me with the
meed of praise in connexion with Mr. Parker for our humble en
deavours at perfecting this national source of light — thus far I
can have no objection that Mr. Bolton should unite us ; and for
myself, I beg to return him many thanks for a communication
which evinces laborious research, judgement, and liberality.
But when at one fell swoop he condemns the practice of passing
gas through heated surfaces as
                                  " faulty and injurious," the credit
due to my former communication, and to your pages of last De
cember which record       it,
                           demands that       Ishould set Mr. B. right
respecting   the strange  error  he  has  fallen  into, when he thus
identifies my plan with Mr. Parker's.       If he  will have the good
ness to refer to   it,
                     he will find that the chief view with which           it
was written, was to show in what we agreed and in what we dif
fered  ;  and that the modus operandi of mine was the very re
verse of his inasmuch as Mr. Parker applies the mediam of heat
             !
to his gas after    ithas passed the condenser; but in mine be
fore   !
   This difference, which Mr. B. has unfortunately overlooked, he
will find, constitutes the sole cause why the former method de
teriorates the illuminating power of the gas, whilst the latter
materially increases it.  After this process of hyper-carbonizing
                                                                         the

I   can with pleasure proceed hand-in-hand with Mr. Bolton in the
flowery path of experiment.           We all have, or are likely to have,
our hobbies.     Chemistry     has  been the one which from early youth
has filled up and rendered both pleasant and profitable the hours
of relaxation from more weighty concerns.                  Like Mr. Bolton,                              I
have visited many gas concerns, both great and small, and can
bear witness with him to their often total want of skill, and to
the consequent impurity of their gas; to say nothing of the im
mense expense of outfit, and wear and tear. In some establish
ments     have seen retorts worn out in three days; some
          I                                                                 three               in
months; and others, though in constant work, (as at friend's in                          a
Birmingham,) not in three years               This speaks volumes as to the

    I am fully convinced with Mr. B. that there                       nothing so        is
cheap,   so simple,  and   so effectual,   as  lime   for purifying. The lights

lime-washer should be furnished with an agitator to stir up the
thickest and most serviceable part of the lime, which otherwise
will form a stiff inert mass at the bottom. This appendage seems
to be wanting in the sketch of Mr. Clegg's washer. The washer
we have adopted, you will, trust, consider as combining in some

or cotter to the iron rod of the agitator, which passes through the
copper tube c, which acts both as a water joint to prevent the
escape of gas, and as a safety-tube (supposing any stoppage to
take place between the washer and gasometer) ; d is an inverted
copper dish, made fast to the iron rod and pierced (except in the
centre for the diameter of about six inches) with holes an eighth
of an inch in diameter, and at intervals of about an inch.
This divides the gas into streams of small bubbles, thereby ex
posing a greater surface to the caustic lime, as well as keeping a
quantity of gas under the dish, or shelf, equal to its diameter.
e is a strap of iron likewise made fast to the perpendicular rod,
which acts as an agitator when the handle       I is turned round or
forced up and down ;     f is a brass plug and socket of an inch and
quarter internal diameter, to which is soldered the inch and
quarter copper pipe g, which conveys the gas under the shelf d.
The brass plugs which convey the gas in and out of the washer,
as well as the pipe c, are fastened into the cask-head with resin
cement.
   The condenser will, I trust, explain itself; it is also a cask
having a head and bottom, and also an interposed disc a lit(le
above the latter, forming a tar chamber, to the bottom of which
the tube of safety a descends within half an inch.        The top of
this cask or refrigerator is open to introduce water, except a staff
across the middle, just to steady the brass sockets and safety-tube.
The communication pipes are of light inch-lead pipe, to which
the plugs are soldered. I have never found them leak when well
pushed down, and they are well adapted to facilitate the putting
any part of the apparatus in or out of connexion in a moment.
   You will perhaps be inclined to smile, and say " This smells
of the brewery." I am happy however to say, The brewery never
smells of it; which is more than some gas concerns can boast.
   The peculiar construction of our retort, and the improved plan
of setting it up, will shortly come before the public, through the
medium of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufac
tures and Commerce, should they think it worth their notice.
    I have read in a late number of the Journal of Science and the.
Arts, a short notice that Professor Stromeyer has obtained from
coal a new acid, a new gum, and a gum resin, which have the
properties of dyeing various colours.        But as the method by
which he obtains them is not even hinted at, perhaps the follow
ing experiments which I have been making, may not be unac
ceptable to some of your readers.

rated some of the clear ummoniacal liquor from the tar-tub to
dryness, I was surprised to find so little crystallizable salt, and
that enveloped in a black mass of carbonaceous and oily matter,
highly impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen. This not being
at all satisfactory, I next proceeded to rid it of its sulphuretted
hydrogen by oxidizing the sulphur.        To this end I poured gently
into some ummoniacal liquor some muriatic acid, which caused
a blackish precipitate, and kept stirring the liquor as I added the
acid : at length a strong effervescence took place, and sulphuretted
hydrogen was liberated. I kept adding acid till it caused to effer
vesce. This I presumed would at the same time neutralize the
ammonia and form a muriate of                      it,

brown dye. The evaporation of the remaining portion of liquor
was going on, when       was still more surprised to observe amongst
                                I
the crystals forming at the edge of the evaporating basin, mi
nute globules of      beautiful red, or rather lake colour, floating

all deliquesced, and the beautiful colouring matter was floating
on the top like oil. This        also collected.

of the essential oils; and if chewed, it sticks to the teeth like resin.
Whether this is the new resin, and the other the gum resin, which
M. Stromeyer has mentioned, it is impossible for me to say, or
-whether his experiments were made with the coal-tar which con
tains them.      Whether essential oil may be obtained in sufficient
quantity   to  render it worth extracting, I am not prepared to sav.
But that    the  ammoniacal   liquor will yield sal ammoniac so as to
pay for the labour and expense, I have no doubt : — but more of
this on some future occasion.       Suffice it for the present to say,
that if any of the foregoing hints shall in the least help, or stir
up others who may have more ability and opportunity for deeper
research than myself, I shall rest satisfied that I have neither
wasted my own time, nor your pages.

    P. S. Having read the discovery of      a new combination of oxy
gen, hydrogen and carbon, called lampic acid, have any of your
correspondents observed the peculiar ethereal smell arising from
the slow combustion of coal gas when issuing from an Argand, the
cock of which is turned on so little as only to give a Hue flame
 about a quarter of an inch high ; will the cause of one account
 for the other ?
    %* We beg to add, for the information of our correspondent,
 that the principal consumption of the ammoniacal liquor at pre
 sent is by the sal ammoniac makers. Mr. Lowe put on the mar
gin of the communication he sent to us, several pencil dashes of
 the two colours described in the foregoing paper : they appear to
 be pretty solid, and may possibly possess other properties which
 may add to their value. The suggestion in his P.S. is ingenious,
 and we doubt not will soon be put to the test of experience.

    As little dependance can be placed on any theorem for calcu
lating the force of steam much beyond the range of experiment,
it is only an object of curiosity to examine what pressure would
confine red hot water : suppose the heat 1000° F. and calcu
lating as before, gives 7 1 ,000 inches of mercury, or above 2300
atmospheres, approaching to six miles of granite, which may
perhaps be two or three miles too much.          Steam of 2300 atmo
spheres    would  be more   dense than   water.

.  XL1V. On ^phlogistic Phcenomena and the Magnetism of
                 Violet Light.    By Mr. J. Murray.
                             To  Mr. Tilloch.
           I >.
                                                 Paris, March 24, 1819.
                my Elements of Chemical Science, second edition
(published by Messrs. Underwood of Fleet-street), I have, in com
mon with others, considered the aphlogistic phanomena dis
covered by Sir Humphry Davy, peculiar to the metals platinum
and palladium ; and assigned their relations to caloric as the
cause, though I had early observed and pointed out the feeble
phosphorescent flame which accompanied other metals, char
coal, glass, &c. when heated, and plunged into inflammable me
dia in contact with air.      The opinion there given, I beg now to
revoke.
   When at Naples, Professor Sementini informed me that silver
and copper manifested the phanomena in question, and he was
so good as to repeat these experiments, among others, before
me. The light exhibited by the copper is less brilliant than that

                    and the Magnetism        of Violet Light.             269
of platinum, while the silver yields            a bright light, sufficiently
 intense to read by.            The diameter of the wires employed is
  1 -100th, and that of the ring about l-4th of an inch.          The wick
of the spirit-lamp is spread out and flattened, and the spiral con-
 taning say twelve rings is supported upright by a pin. The
 lamp is then ignited, and carefully extinguished by the momen
tary application of the cap. The light emanating from the silver
is more beautiful than that from platinum ; and moreover, the
experiment is less difficultly performed.
     I beg to add, that I have succeeded in obtaining aphlogistic
phaenomena by using silver wire and camphor.              For this purpose
 I use a slice of camphor a little larger than the diameter of the
wire cylinder.         The metal is then fixed by a pin passing through
the camphor into a bit of cork, so that the pin may not fall when
the camphor fuses.            By this light I could distinctly see to read
a letter.
     In every experiment it is necessary to have the wire incandes
cent prior to extinction of the flame, which in consequence of
the hollowness of flame (already pointed out in one of my former
papers) can only be obtained when the wires come in contact with
the outer fringe of the cone.
     There is another very interesting discovery on which I have
expressed a degree of surprise, since amply removed.               I advert
to the communication of magnetic powers to a steel bar bv vio
let light, announced by Dr. Morrichini of Rome.               On my return
from Naples, I had the pleasure          of seeing the Professor.    He has
succeeded in magnetizing no less than seventy-four steel bars,
and was so good as to present ine with one so treated.              It is at
tractive of iron filings, and possesses a high polarity. The fol
lowing is recorded on the wrapper, descriptive of the circum
stances which accompanied the experiment. — "Adi 1 7hre
 1812. Num. 3, Essendo il tempo nuvolo ed umido non e seguita
l'esperienza, anzi l'ago perdette quella piccola virtu magnetica
che avea acquistata il giorno precedente. Avendolo posto alle
solite prove il giorno dopo, si e calamitato al solito."
     It is by no means necessary (as Professor Playfair has stated)
that the needle rest in the magnetic plane; for Professor Morri
chini assured me that he had succeeded with the needle in various
positions on the horizontal level, and even vertical and more or
less inclined.        The bright, solar beam admitted by a convenient
aperture      is  received    by the prism. The prism is then turned
upon     its axis  so  as to insulate the violet light, and the ray is then
projected on the needle by means of a lens possessing conside
rable convexity, and about three inches diameter.              For the rest
I beg to give you a few abridged extracts from Professor Morri-
chini's memoir, entitled "Secondo Memoria sopra la forza rnag-

netizante del lemlo estremo del raggio violet to," &c. &c. not
published. The red ray of the spectrum does not magnetize,
nor the light of combustible bodies, inflamed.       The violet light
of the lunar beam   has given in twelve hours magnetic properties
more decisive than the solar red'm seven hours and a half.       The
duration of the experiments in December 1812, and February,
March and April 1813, with violet light, varied from 23 to 120
minutes, nor seemed to have any relation to the range of the ba
rometer, thermometer, or hygrometer; for on 1st of March 1813,
when the duration was only 23', Reaumur's thermometer was7"25,
barometer 28-2,20, and the hygrometer of Retz 41-6.1 ; and on
4th of April 1813, when 120' were required to produce the mag
netic effect, the thermometer was 11-70, barometer 28-0,50,
and hygrometer df Retz 28-90, but this last was in a cloudy sky
and moist at intervals ; though on 23d of March while the ther
mometer was 10-15, barometer 28-2,15, and hygrometer of R.
31-25, the duration of the experiment was 30', and the mag
netism most intense. For the three preceding days the sky had
been very variable.
    Experiments were made on the chemical rays of the spec
trum on the 15th, 16th, and 18th of April 1 S 13*. On the 15th,
with a cloudy sky, and hygrometer of R. at 32-25, weak mag
netic signs were manifested in 30'. On the 16th of April, a cloudv
sky, hygrometer 28-85, the magnetism was intense in 70 mi
nutes, and on the 18th, hygrometer 29-10, also intense, in 60'.
On the 27th, 28th and 29th of March and 1st of April 1813, ex
periments were made on the red light of the spectrum, but no
magnetic signs were exhibited.      On the 2d of April a feeble and
equivocal repulsion was shown. None were manifested with two
experiments on green light : in one however slight signs were
given, but the magnetism was feeble and incomplete.           On the
14th of April with undecomposed light a little magnetism was
acquired in 120'.    In the first experiment with lunar violet light
no magnetic effect was produced ; in the second, there was an
indecisive tendeney to the magnetic meridian : the same was
shown in the third, fourth and fifth experiments which succeeded ;
and in the two last a superior attraction.      On the loth, 16th,
and 1 9th of April, with the red ray there was no effect produced
iu 60 minutes; but with red light on the 21st of April and 16th
and 20th of May, an indecisive tendency to the magnetic plane
was discovered in 90', 30', and 90'.      Experiments made on the
 10th, 1 1th and 12th of May with the violet light of the flame of
olive oil gave no magnetic signs in 240', 120', and 120'. — Dr. M.
told me he did not use a reflector for the lamp in this experiment.
    We cannot therefore withhold what the Professor claims as
confirmed, page 31, " le nuove sperienze che ho avuto 1'onore di

esporvi in questa memoria confermano sempre piu l'esistenza
di un potere magnetizante nella luce, principalmente nel lembo
estremo del raggio violetto, e la probabilita che questo potere
appartenga piutlosto ai raggi chimici o disossidanti, che alio
stesso raggio violetto." — Dr. Morrichini thus concludes, page 32,
his interesing memoir: " The chemical and violet rays are never
separated, and the intensity of the violet rays may proportionally
announce those of the chemical.         Terrestrial bodies may absorb
from the solar rays the magnetic fluid as they absorb light and
caloric, which two fluids are concerned in their decomposition and
recomposition.       Iron then may be with regard to the magnetic
fluid what pyrophorus is with regard to caloric, and natural
phosphori with respect to light."         This beautiful discovery may
be said to throw a new light upon light.            I* regret that from
previous arrangements       I had  to leave Rome, before I could wit
ness the repetition of the experiment, on the first favourable day,
and to which Professor Morrichini was so good as to invite me.
Dr. Morrichini informed me, as the result of a series of very de
licate experiments, that he had constantly found the violet ray
positive, and the red ray negative, with respect to electricity.
    From a series of experiments now in progress by the Professor
of Botany at Rome, it would seem that violet light possesses a
considerable influence in vegetation.

   gard to the bubble by which the line BC was ascertained ; and
   then the instrument is fit for use.      For the visual ray at four
  chains distance points four feet higher on the staff, by the an
   gular bubble being brought level, than it does by the horizontal
   one being brought so : consequently the variation of the obser
   vations taken upon the staff, will be always more or less at any
  further or intermediate distance, as may be seen on reference to
   the figure.
      Operation. — If at any distance or station from the instrument
  the horizontal ray points to (say) 3-754 on the staff ; elevate the
   telescope as before until the angular bubble stands horizontal ;
  then if the visual ray points to (say) 9.568, the difference is 5-814,
  or five chains, 81 links and 4-10ths in distance, according to
  this adjustment, wnich 1 have preferred, because unity, or 1-000
  feet variation of the rays upon the staff, gives one chain in di
  stance, and therefore l-i00dth of a foot gives one link, — and so
  on vice versa.
      Remarks. — It is necessary here to observe, that the staff F G
  has a sight or sliding vein with a nonius upon             by means of
                                                               it,
  which every foot     isdivided into 1-000 equal parts.       But other
  staffs may be divided into feet and inches, or any other equal parts,
  and the angular bubble may be adjusted so that any number of
  inches or other parts on the staff shall be made to answer for any
  desired distance, at the convenience or discretion of the engineer.
I    presume     will be readily admitted by all engineers, that a di
                 it
 stance of twenty miles may be levelled to within three inches, or
 less, of truth   ;and   it   even possible
                              is                may be performed cor

                                                                      a
 the greatest probable error to take place, viz. three inches        then   :
 as this mode of ascertaining distances has only the same chance
 of varying from truth, as the operation of taking levels has, the
 greatest probable error that may occur, will only amount to one
 pole or five yards and       half in twenty miles.
                              a                        But           if,
                                                                as befofe
 stated, the art of levelling can be performed true (of which no
 reasonable doubt does exist), the distance can           this means be

  XLVI.    On the Respiration of Oxygen Gas, in an Affection       of
             the Thorax.      By Professor Silliman*.
It   is not extraordinary that when oxygen gas was first disco-,
vered, and found to be the principle of life to the whole animal
creation, extravagant expectations should have been formed as
to its medicinal application.    Disappointment followed of course,
and naturally led to a neglect of the subject; and, in fact, for
some years pneumatic, medicine has gone into discredit,            and
public opinion has vibrated to the extreme        of incredulity. Par
taking in a degree in this feeling, we listened with reluctance to
a very pressing application on this subject during the last sum
mer.     A young lady, apparently in the last stajje of decline, and
supposed to be affected with hydrothorax, was pronounced be
yond the reach of ordinary medical aid.        As she was in a remote
town in Connecticut, where no facilities existed towards the at
tainment of the object, we felt no confidence that, even if oxygen
gas were possessed of any efficacvin such cases, it would actuallybe
applied,in this case, in such a manner as to do any good. Yielding,
however, to the anxious wishes of friends, we furnished drawings
for such an apparatus as might be presumed attainable, and also
written and minute directions for preparing, trying, and admi
nistering the gas.     It was obtained from nitrate of potash (salt
petre), not because this was the best process, but because the
substance could be obtained in the place, and because a com
mon fire would serve for its extrication. The gas obtained had,
of course, a variable mixture of nitrogen or azote ; and, probably,
on an average, might not be purer than nearly the reversed pro
portions of the atmosphere — that is, 70 to SO per cent, of oxy
gen to 20 or 30 nitrogen ; and it is worthy of observation,
whether this circumstance might not have influenced the result.
   Contrary to our expectations, the gas (as we have since been
informed on good authority) was skilfully prepared and perseve-
ringly used. From the first, difficulty of breathing and other op
pressive affections were relieved ; the young lady grew rapidly
better, and in a few weeks entirely recovered her health.         A re
spectable phvsiciim, conversant with the case, states in a letter
now before us, " that the inhaling of the oxygen gas relieved the
difficulty of breathing, increased the operation of diuretics, and
 has effected her cure. Whether her disease was hydrothora'x, or
an anasarcous affection of the lungs, is a matter, I believe, not
settled."
    Should the revival of the experiments on the respiration of
oxygen gas appear to be desired, it would not be difficult to sim-

     This interesting class of experiments ought to be resumed,
not with the spirit of quackery nor of extravagant expectation,
but with the sobriety of philosophical research ; and it is more
than probable that the nitrous oxide, which is now little more
than the subject of merriment and wonder, if properly diluted
and discreetly applied, would be productive of valuable effects.
 XL VI I.     Description of the American Tar and Water Burner
      invented by   Mr. Samuel Morey of the United States *.
  X HE inventor, not unskilled in chemistry, and aware of the at
 traction of oxygen for carbon, conceived it practicable to convert
 the constituents of water into fuel, by means of this affinity.
     Whatever may be the fact, chemically considered, the opera
 tion in various experiments promises to afford a convenient me
 thod of applying to use several of the most combustible substances
not hitherto employed as fuel. By tlie process which I shall
 briefly describe, all carbonaceous fluids may be conveniently burnt,
 and derive great force from their combination with the oxygen
 and hydrogen gases of water or steam, before or at the moment
 of ignition.
     " A tight vessel, cylindrieally shaped, and placed horizontally,
was first employed, containing resin, connected with a small
boiler by    a pipe which entered one of its ends near the lower side,
and extended nearlv its length, having small apertures, over which
were two inverted gutters one over the other ; the upper one
longer than the other, intended to detain the steam in the resin
in its way to the surface.        The resin being heated, carburelted
hydrogen      gas   issued  from    the outlet or pipe inserted near the
upper part     of the  vessel, and,  being ignited, afforded a small blaze
about as large as that of a candle ; but when the steam was al
lowed to flow, this blaze instantly shot out many hundred times
its former bulk to the distance of two or three feet.            It is pre
sumed the steam was decomposed, and that carburetted hydro
gen and carbonic oxide or carbonic acid were produced as the
steam passed, very near the hot bottom of the vessel.
    " Anosher apparatus was constructed, consisting of two vessels
one within the other having a cover common to both ; the inner
one to contain tar (as a more convenient substance than resin),
    * In our  247th Number (vol. Hi.) wp gave a brief notice of this inven
 tion.   The present account is copied from Professor Silliman's American
Journal of Science, No. I.

  the outer vessel to contain water, which surrounds the other and
  lies under its bottom; or, in other words, this part of the ap
  paratus consisted of a vessel of tar set into a vessel of boiling
  water.     The tar vessel being riveted to the cover, holes are made
, through its sides near to the cover, to allow the steam to pass in
  and to act on its surface.     The cover being secured on, a safety-
  valve is provided for the steam vessel ; and two cocks, one over
  the tar, the other over the water (but both having communica
  tion with the eduction pipe), are fixed contiguously; the first has
  a tube, or is elongated to reach nearly to the bottom of the tar,
  which ascends this pipe when pressed on by the steain, and is
  driven forward into the eduction pipe, when the cock over the
  tar vessel is opened for its escape. When both cocks are opened,
  both tar and steam are emitted at once, and in mixture, through
  the eduction pipe.      In this tube (which is for convenience fur
  nished with two joints) is placed a large wire or metallic rod,
  which about fills the tube, and is perforated obliquely or zigzag,
  to increase the length of the passage, and to mingle the tar and
  steam more intimately.      The gases or vapours issue from a small
  orifice at the end of the pipe ; and being ignited by a little fire
  into which it is directed, an intense and voluminous blaze is pro
  duced, and continues as long as the materials remain unexhausted.
  A hot brick instead of the fire answers the same purpose.
      " The apparams contained but about one quart of tar
                                                                     (which
  must always be nicely strained), and it lasted an hour and a half;
  and the flame was sufficient to fill a common fire-place, if not al-
  lowetLto escape by its violence up the chimney.             Its force will
  be according to the elasticity of the steam. Probably a form of
  stove may be devised wherein it may be used for the purposes of
  warmth, light, and cooking ; and another apparatus to light
  streets. But this invention will be of more special use as fuelfor
  steam engines applied to navigatiofi."

                    some interest, from there being a Committee
House  of Commons    now  sitting, to inquire into the state of  the
Highways, and to report on any matters which may conduce to
their improvement and better management,            am induced to
                                                            I
notice some points in the Letter of Mr. Henry Meikle            your       in
last Number.   Mr. M. in pages 199 and 200 (as well as Mr.
Wingrove in p. 14) mention, that the Legislature have restricted
it to  uniform distance, at which the Wheels of Carriages should
       a
                                                                 run

                 to sustain      the IVear    of very   heavy Loads.               277
  run on a Road, and recommend the repeal of this law; without
  seeming to be aware, that very soon after this most absurd Law
  was enacted        (in
                    1773),     was repealed: but that deep Ruts on all
                                 it
  the Parish Roads (and on too many of the Turnpike Roads, also)
  had, in the interval, become so universal, and the difficulty of
  drawing Carriages, but in these Ruts, so great, that the custom
  thus fatally introduced, of making all Axletrees of similar lengths,
  has scarcely ever since been deviated from       nor will this be done
                                                         ;
 to any extent,      believe, until
                     I               inducements   have for some years
 been held out, to the making of new Carriages, or applying new
 Axletrees, such, that the Wheels of different Carriages may run
  in divers tracks, as have mentioned in p. 103 until at length,
                            I                                     ;
 the Legislature can go the full length, of enacting the very op
 posite of what they did in 1773!
   It   was (as   Ihave fully shown           in
                                          my Derbyshire Report)       not      a
 less absurd mistake in legislating for the public Roads (in 1773,
 or earlier) than that to which have above alluded, which encour
                                 I
 aged the introduction of wheels of. greater breadth           rim, than  of
 about six inches,         by
                          granting great and mischievous indulgences,
 in weights and numbers of Horses and in easy Tolls, to the Wag
 gons with Wheels          12, and 16 inches broad, and at the same
                            9,
 time, so loosely and improperly denning these broad Wheels,
 that the exemptions might, and have to the present day been
 claimed,    by the owners of Waggons, which          no degree comply
                                                             in
 with the mistaken intentions of the framers of the act alluded to:
 while the excessive weights which these "stone-crushing ma
chines" carry (to use the words of Sir Joseph Banks, regarding the
Waggons on the Hounslow Road), contribute more than any
other circumstance, to the great expense and bad state of the
main Roads       :particularly where brittle gravel or soft stone are
the Road Materials.
   It   is the rounded or barreled form        the rims of these broad
                                                    of
Wheels, and the use of thick streak of Tire in the middle (with
                                 a
the addition mostly of projecting Nail-heads) occasioning them
to run on surfaces considerably narrower than           inches, in most
                                                                  6
instances, which causes them,now,to be so very mischievous: and
were these gross evasions to be restrained, and flat horizontally-
rolling rims, of          12 and 16 inches, to be really enforced,
                           9,
(whether as cones or cylinders,) even the impolitic indulgences
granted to these Broad Wheels, or greater ones, as to Horses and
Tolls, would not be able to keep them for many weeks upon the
Roads so true
        :             is   it,
                         that Road- Rollers, and Carriages for trans
porting    Loads,   are  altogether different things.      cannot avoid
                                                                      I
adding my      conviction,    that the late Mr. Cummings, from to
tally over-looking the brittle and crushable nature of Road Ma
terials,    (aproperty not confined to these, but extending to all

Materials,    even to Iron, as the experiments of Mr. George
Rennie in the beginning of your present Number amply testify)
did a great deal of mischief 1 2 years ago, by his experiments and
writings, having the tendency, to mislead thousands into the very
same errors, which were acted on in 1773, in supposing that
great weights could pass, on any wheels (however truly cylindri
cal) without crushing brittle Stones, such as those undoubtedly
are which alone are procurable, on nine-tenths of the lengths of
all the main British Roads.
   The sooner Men of science cease to notice the absurd objections
raised against adopting, in most instances, the least possible de
grees of ascent in the laying out new Roads ; however much this
may occasion the lengthening of the ascents, it will be the better
I think : let' the objectors be referred to the example of a well-
contrived Rail-way, as the only argument likely to prevail with
such Persons.     I beg to call the attention of my friend Mr.Tred-
gold (the author of the first Paper of the present volume) to the
beginning and concluding parts of Mr. Meikle's ingenious Letter,

A   Voyage    of   Discovery made under the Orders         of   the   Admimlty,

    exploring Baffin' s- Bay and inquiring into the Probability of

    a North-west Passage.     By John Ross, K.S. Capt. R.N. 4to.
    With 32 coloured Plates, Maps, &c.
Our      readers have already been made acquainted with severai
particulars respecting this voyage, in our preceding numbers and
through the medium of the daily newspapers            they will not,
                                                           :
however, be displeased that a few of the most prominent parti
culars should yet have     place in our pages. On the voyage, ge
                               a
nerally, we may observe that      serves to confirm, in all the lead
                                        it
ing features, the accuracy of the observations of the voyager frgm
whom the sea explored              by
                              Capt. Ross has its name but which     ;
had     bymany been consigned to       place among the records of

fiction.   So far this voyage has been useful      and we have only
                                                       ;
                                                                    to

                  Capt. Ross's  Voyage   of Discovery.           2/9
 to regret the haste, from whatever cause       this may have arisen,
 with which the exploration was abandoned.
    The most prominent novelty recorded by Captain Ross, is the
discovery of a race of men in Baffin's Bay, never before visited
 by civilized Europeans, and so totally unacquainted with the rest
 of the world, as to believe that to the southward of their place of
 residence there was nothing but eternal frost! — no country in
 which it would be possible for human creatures to exist ! On
 this occasion Sacheuse, the Esquimaux who accompanied the
expedition, was found very useful as an interpreter. — We shall
give the account in Captain Ross's words :
    " Aug. 10, ISIS.— Lat. 75 deg. 55 min. N., Ions. 65 deg.
32 min. W.— About 10 o'clock this day we were rejoiced to see
eight sledges, driven by the natives, advancing by a circuitous
 route towards the place where we lay. They halted about a mile
from us, and the people alighting, ascended a small iceberg, as if
to reconnoitre.     After remaining apparently in consultation for
nearly   half an hour, four of them descended, and came towards
the flagstaff, which, however, they did not venture to approach.
 In the mean time, a white flag was hoisted at the main in each
ship, and John Sacheuse dispatched, bearing a small white flag,
with some presents, that he might endeavour, if possible, to bring
them to a parley. This was a service in which he had most
cheerfully volunteered, requesting leave to go unattended and un
armed — a request to which no objection could be made, as the
place chosen for the meeting was within half a mile of the Isa
bella.     It was equally advantageous to the natives, a canal or
small chasm in the ice, not passable without a plank, separating
the parties from each other, and preventing any possibility of an
attack from these people, unless by darts.
    " In executing this service, Sacheuse displayed no less address
than courage.      Having placed his flag at some distance from the
canal, he advanced to the edge, and taking off his hat, made
friendly signs for those opposite to approach, as he did; this they
partly complied with, halting at a distance of 300 yards, where
they got out of their sledges, and set up a loud simultaneous
halloo, which Sacheuse answered by imitating it. They ventured
to approach nearer, having nothing in their hands but the whips
with which they guide their dogs; and after satisfying themselves
that the canal was impassable, one of them in particular seemed
to acquire confidence.      Shouts, words, and gestures were ex
changed for some time    to no purpose, though each party seemed in
some degree to recognise each other.s language. Sacheuse, after
a time, thought he could discover that they spoke the Humook
dialect, drawling out their words, however, to an unusual lengths
He immediately adopted that dialect, and holding up the pre-
                                  S 4                          sents,

sents, called out to them Kahkeite, ' Come on !' to which they
answered, Naakrie, naakrieai-plaile, ' No, no ; go away            and
other words, which he made out to mean that they hoped we
were not come to destroy them.        The boldest then approached
to the edge of the canal, and drawing from his boot a knife, (re
presented in an engraving,) repeated, 'Go away;'           'I  can kill
you.'     Sacheuse not intimidated, told them that he was also a
man and a friend, and at the same time threw across the canal
some strings of beads, and a checked shirt; but these they be
held with great distrust and apprehension, still calling ' Go away,
don't kill us.' Sacheuse now threw them an English knife, say
ing, ' Take that.'    On this they approached with caution, picked
up   the knife, then shouted  and pulled their noses. These actions
were imitated by Sacheuse, who in return called out, ' Heigh,
yaw V pulling his nose with the same gesture.      They now pointed
to the shirt, demanding what it was; and when told it was an
article of clothing, asked of what skin it was made.          Sacheuse
replied it was made of the hair of an animal which they had ne
ver seen : on which they picked it up with expressions of sur
prise. They now began to ask many questions : for by this time
they found the language spoken by themselves and Sacheuse had
sufficient resemblance to enable them to hold some communica
tion.
     "                                                   '
       They first pointed to the ships, eagerly asking What great
                         '
 creatures those were ?' Do they come from the sun or the moon?'
 ' Do they give us light by night or by day ?' Sacheuse told them
 that he was a man, that he had a father and mother, like them
 selves ; and, pointing to the south, said that he came from a di
stant country in that direction.     To this they answered, ' That
 cannot be, there is nothing but ice there.'       They again asked,
' What creatures these were?' pointing to the ships: to which
 Sacheuse replied, that ' they were houses made of wood.' This
                                             ' No,
 they seemed still to discredit, answering,         they are alive, we
 have seen them move their wings.'        Sacheuse now inquired of
 them what they themselves were ; to which they replied, they
 were men, and lived in that direction, pointing to the north; that
 there was much water there ; and that they had come here to
fish for sea unicorns.     It was then agreed that Sacheuse should
pass the chasm to them, and he accordingly returned to the ship
 to make his report, and to. ask for a plank.
     " During the whole of this conversation, I had been employed
 with a good telescope in observing their motions, and beheld the
 first man approach with every mark of fear and distrust, looking
 frequently behind to the other two, and beckoning to come on,
 as if for support.    They occasionally retreated, then advanced
again, with cautious steps, in the attitude of listening, generally
                                                                keeping

                 Capt.   Ross's Voyage   of Discovery.              281
keeping one hand down by their knees, in readiness to pull out
a knife which they had in their boots; in the other hand they
held their whips with the lash coiled up ; their sledges remained
at a little distance, the fourth man being apparently stationed to
keep them in readiness for escape.       Sometimes they drew back
the covering they had on their heads, as if wishing to catch the
most distant, sounds; at which time I could discern their features,
displaying extreme terror and amazement, while every limb ap
peared to tremble as they moved.       Sacheuse was directed to en
tice them to the ship, and two men were now sent with a plank,
which was accordingly placed across the chasm. They appeared
still much alarmed, and requested that Sacheuse only should
come over: he accordingly passed to the opposite side, on which
they earnestly besought him not to touch them, as if he did they
should certainly die. After he had used many arguments to per
suade them that he was flesh and blood, the native who had
shown most courage ventured to touch his hand, then pulling
himself by the nose, set up a shout, in which he was joined by
Sacheuse, and the other three.        The presents were then distri
buted, consisting of two or three articles of clothing, and a few
strings of beads : after which Sacheuse exchanged a knife for one
of theirs.
    " The hope of getting some important information, as well as
the interest naturally felt for these poor creatures, made me im
patient to communicate with them myself ; and I therefore de
sired Lieut. Parry to accompany me to the place where the party
were assembled, it appearng to me that Sacheuse had failedin
persuading them to come nearer the ships. We accordingly pro
vided ourselves with additional presents, consisting of lookitg-
glasses and knives, together with some caps and shirts, and pro
ceeded towards the spot, where the conference was held with
increased energy.      By the time we reached       it,
                                                     the whole were
assembled those who had originally been left at
           ;                                            distance with
                                                          a
their sledges, having driven up to join their comrades. The pjrty
now therefore consisted of eight natives, with all their sledjes,
and about 50 dogs, two sailors, Sacheuse, Lieut. Parry, and my
self, forming    a group of no small singularity; not        little alsa
                                                              a
increased   by the peculiarity of the situation, on  afield of   ice, far
from the land.     The noise and clamour may easily be conceived
— the whole talking and shouting together, and the dogs fowl
ing, while the natives were flogging them with their long whips,
to preserve order.
    " Our arrival produced visible alarm, causing them to retreat
                             a
a few steps towards their sledges on this Sacheuse called to us
                                     :
to pull our noses, as he had discovered this to be the mode of
friendly salutation with them. This ceremony was accordingly
                                                              performed

282                Notices respecting Neiu Books.
performed by each of us, the natives, during their retreat, making
use  of the same gesture, the nature of which we had not before
understood.     In the same way we imitated their shouts as well
as we could, using the same interjection, heigh, yaw ! which we
afterwards found to be an expression of surprise and pleasure.
We then advanced towards them while thev halted, and presented
the foremost with a looking-glass aud a knife, repeating the same
presents to the whole as they came up in succession. On seeing
their faces in the glasses their astonishment appeared extreme,
and they looked round in sflence for a moment at each other and
at us; immediately afterwards they set up a general shout, suc
ceeded by a loud laugh, expressive of extreme delight, as well as
surprise, in which we joined, partly from inability to avoid    and it,
willing also to show that we were  pleased with our  new  acquaint
ances,
    " Having now at length acquired confidence, they advanced,
offering, in return for our knives, glasses, and beads, their knives,
sea-unicorns' horns, and sea-horse teeth, which were accepted.
They were then instructed       by Sacheuse to uncover their heads,
as  a mark of good will and respect to us        ;  and with this cere
monial, which they performed immediately, and of which they
appeued to comprehend the meaning, our friendship became
established.
,
    " One of them having inquired what was the use of red cap   a
which    Ihad given him, Sacheuse placed         it on his head, to the
great amusement of the rest, each of whom put         it  on in his turn.
The colour of our skins became nest          asubject of much mirth, as
also the ornaments on the frames of the looking-glasses.             The
eldest of them, who was also the one that acted as leader, ad
dressing himself to me, now made         a   long speech, whjch being
ended, he appeared to    wait  for   reply.
                                     a           Imade signs that   I did
not tnderstand him, and called for Sacheuse to interpret.             He
thus perceived that we used different languages, at which his
astonishment appeared extreme, and he expressed            it  by a loud
   Heigh, yaw!' As Sacheuse's attempt to procure the meaning
'
of thk oration seemed likely to fail, and we were anxious to get
them to the ship as soon as possible,        I desired him to persuade
them to accompany us      ;  they accordingly consented, on which
their dogs were unharnessed and fastened to the ice, and two of
the sledges were drawn along the plank to the other side of the
thasm, three of the natives being left in charge of the two dogs
 and the remaining sledges.      The other five followed us, laughing
heartily at seeing  Lieut. Parry and myself drawn towards the ship
on the sledges   by our seamen.      One of them,     by   keeping close
to me, got before his companions         ;  and thus we proceeded till
we arrived within 100 yards of the ship, where he stopped.                I
                                                                attempted

attempted to urge him on, but in vain, liis evident terror pre
venting him from advancing till his companions came up. It
was apparent that he still believed the vessel to be a living crea
ture, as he stopped to contemplate her, looking up at the masts,
and examining every part with marks of the greatest fear and
astonishment.      He then addressed her, crying out in words per
fectly intelligible to Sacheuse, and in a loud tone, 'Who are
you ? what are vou ? where do you come from ? is it from the
sun or the moon ?' pausing between every question, and pulling
his nose with the utmost solemnity.        The rest now came up in
succession, each showing similar surprise, and making use of the
same expressions, accompanied by the same extraordinary cere
mony.     Sacheuse now laboured to assure them that the ship was
only a wooden house, and pointed out the boat, which had been
hauled on the ice to repair ; explaining to them that it was a
smaller one of the same kind.        This immediately arrested their
attention, they advanced to the boat, examined her, as well as the
carpenter's tools, and the oars, very minutely; each object, in its
turn, exciting the most ludicrous ejaculations of surprise. We
then ordered the boat to be launched into the sea, with a man
in  it, and hauled up again, at the sight of which they set no
bounds to their clamour. The ice-anchor, a heavy piece of iron,
shaped like the letter    S,  and the cable, excited much interest;
the former they tried    invain to remove, and they eagerly inquired
of what skins the latter was made.
   "  By this time the officers of both ships had surrounded them,
while the bow of the Isabella, which was close to the ice, was
crowded with the crew; and certainly         amore ludicrous, yet in
teresting scene, was never beheld, than that which took place
whilst they were viewing the ship nor  :      ispossible to convey to

the imagination anv thing like     a  just representation of the wild
amazement, joy, and fear, which successively pervaded the coun
tenances and governed the gestures of these creatures, who gave
full vent to their feelings.; and am sure
                                 I             was
                                              it     gratifying scene
                                                      a
which never can be forgotten         bythose who witnessed and en
joyed it.
    " Their shouts, halloos, and laughter, were heartily joined in,
 and imitated  byall hands, as well as the ceremony of nose- pulling,
 whic  hcould not fail to increase our mirth on the occasion. That
 which most of all excited their admiration was the circumstance
 of sailor going aloft, and they kept their eyes on him till he
   a
 reached the summit of the mast        ;the sails, which hung loose,
 they naturally supposed were skins.     Their attention being again
 called to the boat, where the carpenter's hammer and nails still
remained, they were shown the use of these articles   and no
                                                           ;
sooner were they aware of their purposes, than they showed         a
                                                       desire

   desire to possess them, and were accordingly presented with some
   nails.   They now accompanied us to that part of the bow from
   which a rope ladder was suspended, and the mode of mounting it
   was shown them; but it was a considerable time ere we could
   prevail on them to ascend it.      At length the senior, who always
   led the way, went up, and was followed by the rest.             The new
   wonders that now surrounded them on every side caused fresh
   astonishment, which after a moment's suspense, always termi
   nated in loud aud hearty laughter.
      "The most frequent ejaculation of surprise was Heigh, yaw!
   and, when particularly excited by any more remarkable object
   than, the rest, they pronounced the first syllable of the interjec
   tion many times with peculiar rapidity and emphasis, extending
   wide their arms, and looking at each other at the end of the ex
   clamation with open mouths, as if in breathless consternation.
      "Their knowledge of wood seemed to be limited to some heath
   of a dwarfish- growth, with stems no thicker than the finger, and
   accordingly they knew not what to think of the timber they saw
   on board.    Not being aware of its weight, two or three of them
   successively seized on the spare top-mast, evidently with the
  view of carrying it off ; and as soon as they became familiar with
   the people around them, they showed that desire of possessing
- what                                                                  The
          they admired, which is so universal among savages.
   only thing they   looked  on  with contempt     was a little terrier dog,
  judging, no doubt, that it was too small for drawing a sledge ;
   but they shrunk back, as if in terror, from a. pig, whose pricked
   ears, and ferocious aspect (being of the Shetland breed) presented
   a somewhat formidable appearance.           This animal happening to
  grunt,    one of  them   was so terrified,  that  he became from that
   moment uneasy, and appeared impatient to get out of the ship.
   In carrying his purpose into effect, however, he did not lose his
  propensity to thieving, as he seized and endeavoured to carry off
  the smith's anvil ; finding that he could not remove          it,  he laid
  hold of the large hammer, threw       it   on the ice, and following      it
  himself, deliberately set  it  on his sledge, and made off.        As this
  was an articleI     could not spare, sent person to recover
                                       I     a                        it,

  followed him, hallooing, and soon got pretty near him.              Seeing
  that he must be overtaken, he artfully sunk        it  in the snow, and
  went on with the sledge,        bywhich we were convinced that he
  knew he was doing wrong. The seaman, on finding .the hammer,
  left off the pursuit, and returned, while he went off, and was seen
  no more that day.        Shortly after, another of them, who had re
  ceived a   present, consisting of a small hammer and some nails,
  left the ship also, and putting his acquisition upon the remaining
  sledge, dragged   it  away with him, and disappeared.

on board, by their trials on the inexperience of the natives, was
the effect produced on them by seeing their faces in a magnifying
mirror.     Their grimaces were highly entertaining, while, like
monkeys, they looked first into it, and then behind, in hopes of
finding the monster which was exaggerating their hideous ges
tures.     A watch was also held to the ear of one, who supposing
it alive, asked if it was good to eat. On being shown the glass
of the skylight and binnacle, they touched     it,and desired to know
what kind of ice     it was.    During this scene, one of them wan
 dered to the main hatchway, and, stooping down, saw the Ser
jeant of marines, whose red coat produced        a  loud exclamation
 of wonder while his own attitude and figure did not less excite
           ;
 the surprise of our tars, who, for the first time, discovered some
 unexpected peculiarities in the dress of the natives.
    " The three men remaining were now handed down to mv ca
 bin, and shown the use of the chairs, which they did not com
 prehend, appearing to have no notion of any other seat than the
 ground.     Being seated, we attempted to take their portraits, in
which Lieut. Hopner, Mr. Skene, Mr. Bushnan, and myself were
 at the same time employed. During this attempt, fearful       itmight
 alarm them, we amused them with questions, collecting from
 them at the same time the information we thought         it  desirable
 to obtain, and directing Sacheuse to ask those questions which
 the hurried nature of this visit permitted us to recollect as most
 essential, and of which the result will appear hereafter. Our dra w
 ings being completed, and interrogatories ended, they bega'.i to
 be very inquisitive, asking the use of every thing in the cabin we ;
 showed them paper, books, drawings, and various mathematical
 instruments, which produced only the usual effect of astonishing
 them  ;  but on being shown the prints, in Cook's. Voyage, of the
 natives of Otaheite, they attempted to grasp them, evidently
 comprehending that they were the representations of human be
 ings. The sight of writing-desk, bureau,.and of other wooden
                     a                a
 furniture, also excited their astonishment, but apparently from
 the nature of the materials only, as they seemed to form no idea
                          an
 of their uses.
     " They were now conducted to the gun-room, and afterwards
 round the ship, but without appearing to -distinguish any thing
 particularly, except the wood in her construction, stamping on
  the deck, as  if in evident surprise at the quantity of this valuable
  material. In hopes of amusing them, the violin was sent for, and
 some tunes played    ;   they, however, paid no attention to this,
 seeming quite unconcerned, either about the sounds or performer
 — sufficient proof that the love of music

  and that it requires experience to distinguish between that and
  other similar noises.   A   flute was afterwards sounded for them,

  resembling more nearly in shape the objects to which they were
  accustomed ; one of them put it to his mouth and blew            it,
                                                                    hut

 salt meat that was afterwards offered produced the same effect.
 We now also ascertained their names, that of the eldest being
  Ervick, and that of the two others, who were his brother's sons,
  Marshuick and Otooniah. Some juggler's tricks were afterwards
  exhibited    byMr. Beverly, which seemed to disconcert them, as
  they became uneasy, and expressed        wish to go on deck.

 ice that were alongside, attempted to discover to what extent they
 could count, for the purpose of ascertaining the numbers of their
 nation. We found, however, they could only reckon to ten and      ;
 on inquiry, therefore,     their country possessed as many inhabi

     " The knives had this time been examined

                                                         by
 who thought they were made from pieces of iron hoop, or from
 flattened nails    ;we therefore asked      any plank or wreck had
                                            if
 formerly been driven on their shore to which they replied, that
                                            ;
a   piece of wood with some nails had come on shore, and been
 picted up.- We therefoie concluded that the knives which they
 had left with us had been formed from this iron, and consequently
 made no further inquiries.
     " They were now loaded with various presents, consisting of
 some articles of clothing, biscuit, and pieces of wood, in addition
 to whieh the plank that had been used in crossing the chasm was
given to them. They then departed, promising to return as soon
 as they had eaten snd slept, as we had no means of explaining
to them what tomorrow meant. The parting was attended with
 the ceremony of pulling of noses on both sides.
     "After they had reached and crossed the chasm, they were
observed        some men who had been sent to accompany them,
               by
throwing away the biscuit, and splitting the plank, which was of
teak, into small pieces, for the purpose of dividing        among the

party. Soon after this, they mounted their sledges, and drove off
in body hallooing, apparently in great glee."

    The ships had subsequently some further intercourse with the
natives, in which      was discovered that the iron of the knives of
                        it
the natives, which were composed of small pieces from three to six
in number, each about the size of         silver groat, inserted in a
                                            a
slit  in a piece of bone, was obtained from two masses at some di

stance ; one of which (the largest) was about the size of the
cabin sky-light.    To obtain this iron seemed to be one of the
objects of their present journey : they contrived by much labour
to detach small pieces which they afterwards extended by beat
ing them between stones, and when sufficiently extended for the
purpose, employed them in the manner just described, riveting
in the piece at the extremity of the knife, but not the others.
These masses are believed to be meteoric.
   Our readers have also been informed that our voyagers had
met with red or rather crimson-coloured snow.        It was on the
face of the cliffs on the shore, and in several parts it was seen at
a distance of at least six miles from the sea, but always on the
face or near the foot of a mountain.   Captain Ross considers the
matter which communicated this colour to be of vegetable ori
gin. Some of it brought home in bottles, has been examined by
chemical gentlemen : the following is Dr. Wollaston's statement
respecting it :
    " With respect to the exact origin of that substance which
gives redness to the snow, I apprehend we may not be able to
give a decided opinion, for want of sufficient knowledge of the
productions of those regions in which it was found ; but from all
the circumstances of its appearance, and of the substances which
accompany     it, I am strongly inclined to think     it to be of vege
table origin.    The red matter itself consists of minute globules
from 1-lOOOth to l-3000th of an inch in diameter;               I believe
their coat to be colourless, and that the redness belongs wholly
to the contents, which seem to be of an oily nature, and not solu
ble in   water, but soluble in rectified spirits of wine    ;   when the
globules   are highly magnified, and  seen with   sufficient  light,  they
appear internally subdivided into about       or 10 cells. They bear
                                              S
to be dried   by  the heat of boiling water, without loss of~colour.
Bv destructive distillation, they yield       fetid oil, accompanied
                                              a
with ammonia, which might lead to the supposition that they are
of animal origin; but since the seeds of various plants also yield
this product, and since the leaves of fuci also yield ammonia            by
distillation, I   do not discover any thing in the globules them
selves which shows distinctly from what source they were derived.
I  find, however, along with them, a small portion of           a cellular
substance, which not only has these globules adherent to its sur
face, but also contained in its interior and this substance, which
                                          ;
I  must therefore consider as of the same origin with them, ap
pears    byits mode of burning to be decidedly vegetable, as know   I
of no animal substance which so< instantly burns away to white      a
ash as soon as      it   heated to redness.
                         is                     The first conception     I
formed as to their nature was, that they might be the spawn of            a
minute species of shrimps, which     isknown to abound in those seas,

288                 Notices respecting  New Boohs.
and which might be devoured by the myriads of water-fowl ob
served there, and voided      with their dung ; but, in that case, they
should undoubtedly be found mixed with the exuviae of those
animals, which is not that fact, but they are found accompanied
solely bv vegetable substances, in one of which they are actually
contained.       If they are from the sea, there seems no limit to the
quantity    that   may be carried to land by a continued and violent
wind ; no limit to the period during which they may have accu
mulated, since they would remain from year to year, undimi
nished by the processes of thawing and evaporation, which remove
the snow with which they are mixed.           I regret that the scanti
ness of our information does not enable us to come to any satis
factory conclusion, and can only hope that future navigators may
have an opportunity of collecting materials to elucidate so curi
ous a phenomenon."

termined by employing a magnet to draw the needle to a hori
zontal position ; which being then removed, the needle was left
to oscillate till the arcs became too small to be observed, and at
every tenth vibration the arc and the time were noted. The ob
servations were generally made upon the ice, to avoid the irregu
larities produced by the iron of the ship.

     A Society   has been established in     London bearing the designa
tion of the " Hunterian Society."            It professes the most friendly
feeling    towards    all similar  existing institutions, and is founded
 principally, but    not  exclusively, for the accommodation and be
nefit of medical men residing in the eastern parts of the metro
 polis.
     Its objects are to concentrate the zeal and experience of a
 large number of respectable practitioners, whose places of resi
 dence are at a distance from professional associations already ex
 isting; and to receive and discuss communications on medical
 and surgical subjects.       It aims particularly at the cultivation of
 a spirit of liberal and friendly intercourse among the members of
 the profession within the sphere of its influence.
     It consists of honorary, corresponding, and ordinary members,
 and already the Society is honoured by the names of a conside
 rable number of men of character and talent.               The Hunterian
  Society holds its meetings every alternate Wednesday evening
  throughout the year, at No. 10, St. Mary-Axe.

   In the public sittings of 22d March, was read a Notice on the
continuation of the labours undertaken to determine the figure
of the Earth, and upon the results of the operations of the Pen
dulum, made in 1817, at the Shetland Islands, by M. Biot.
   The paper commenced by a reference to a notice read last
year before the Institute, detailing the birth and progress of the
great system of astronomical observations, undertaken a century
and a half ago by the Academy of Sciences, and followed up, with
out interruption, since that epoch, in all parts of the world, to
determine the figure of the earth, and, what is perhaps more
surprising, to discover that law of density, according to which,
matter is distributed in the beds which form the interior of the
mass of the earth.
   The author then proceeded to remark that, " if a century and
a half of experiments were necessary to develop and to perfect
all the t means which the solution of this great physical question
required, now that those means have been acquired, our progress
will be more rapid. The short space of a year has been sufficient
to add to the results already obtained new elements, which both
confirm and enlarge them.        These recent acquisitions we now
propose   to submit  to you.
    " The figure of the earth may be determined by two methods,
the results of which will be found to agree, though the processes
are different.   In the first, which is purely geometrical, the ob
server measures in reality the length of an arc of the terrestrial
meridian, — that is to say, let him measure, provided he can do
it immediately on the earth, the whole of that arc, in a straight
line, as was done in Pennsylvania 50 years ago ; but if the con
figuration of the ground, and if the habitations which cover              it,
do not permit him to extend his operations, as       commonly the
                                                       is
case, he measures, first of all, a line of four or five thousand
toises, with the utmost precaution and accuracy          then, upon
                                                             :
                      From the Moniteur of April 5.
                  *
                                                                      this

  this line, as upon a base, he erects, in the direction of the meri
  dian, a series of triangles, whose sides are successively connected,
  so that he can find the whole length of the arc of the meridian
  which crosses them.        Having found the length of this arc, by
  whatever method he chooses to adopt, he then determines, by
  astronomical observations — rnot by a few, but by many thousands,
 the stars, or, to speak with more precision, the points in the hea
 vens, towards which the two verticals produced to .their two ex
  tremes are directed.     But, since the earth is absolutely a mathe
  matical point, when compared to infinite space, the arc of the
 heavens, intersected by the produced parts of the verticals, is the
 same as that which might be observed from their point of con
 course. He thus measures the angle which they include, and the
 instruments give the number of degrees, minutes, seconds, and
 even fractions of seconds, which correspond to it : for it is neces
 sary to observe the most scrupulous precision, when we are mea
 suring an object so immense by means so diminutive.            Similar
 observations, repeated on various points of the same arc of the
 meridian, discover how the verticals produced to these points
 incline mutually in given distances : but the law of these inclina
tions is precisely the geometrical character which specifies the
 curvature, and the degree of curvature of the earth's surface, in
the direction of the meridian, which has been taken. Operations
 analogous to this will also give this curvature in other directions,
— for example, from east to west, by following the course of the
same parallel, as is done at present from Brest to Strasburgh :
and the united results so obtained, in different countries, com
pletely determine the form of the earth.
     "The other method, founded upon observations of the pen
dulum, is more circuitous, and appears, at first view, to have no
connection with the proposed object.           In this method we have
nothing    to  do with   bases, triangles,  or with any geometrical or
actual measurement of the earth's surface, the observer not
having even the necessity to cast his eyes upon the surface at all.
He merely brings with him a small metal ball, quite round, some
metal wire, a clock, an astronomical circle, and a small iron rule.
When arrived at one of the stations which he has chosen, he shuts
himself up in some strong secluded building, where he is free from
any exterior motion or noise.          Then taking his metal ball, he
suspends it to one end of his wire, by means of a small round
leather cap, so exactly fitted to the ball, that contact alone shall
be sufficient to make them adhere.           He attaches the other end
of the wire to a steel fulcrum, like the fulcrum of a balance, which
he sets upon a plane of agate stone, exceedingly smooth, firm,
and made perfectly horizontal ; he then puts the pendulum in
motion, counting the number of vibrations which it makes in any
                                      T3                         given

 given time — a day for instance; or rather he does not count
 them, for it would be an endless task, but ascertains them by his
 clock ; and lest the time-piece should deceive him, he most mi
 nutely compares it with the movements of the heavenly bodies —
 the great invariable clock, infallible at all times and in all places.
 Having determined how his pendulum goes, he measures its
 length with accuracy by his rule. He repeats these trials a great
 number of times, in order to be sure of their exactness.           That
 done, he carefully puts up his ball and his rule and betakes him
self to make the same proofs elsewhere.             These being gone
through, are sufficient to enable him to calculate with the utmost
exactness, and perhaps more exactly than by actual measure
ment, the curvature of the terrestrial meridian, on which there
Tiave been so many observations made.          In effect, the vibrations
of the pendulum are caused by the gravity which tends to make
bodies fall towards the earth.        In the operation which has been
just described, the metal ball, in returning to the vertical point
in each of its vibrations, does no more than fall towards the earth,
 as much as the length of the wire to which it is suspended will
permit. It is then seen, that the rapidity of the vibrations of the
pendulum, or of its fall in any place, according to the given length
 of the wire, must depend on the energy, more or less powerful,
 of its gravity in that particular place : so that the operator may
 compare, by this means, the intensities of gravity in different
 places.    But, according to the theory of universal gravitation,
 this intensity is found connected with the form of the earth's sur
 face, and with the law of density in the inner beds of the earth,
 by mathematical analogies.        Thus, then, we see that it is only
 necessary for the observer to have one of these elements, in order
 to be able to determine analogically with regard to the other. It
 is thus that, by means of impressions left upon trees and upon
 sand, the philosopher Zadig determined the form, height, and
  even the colour of the king of Babylon's beautiful horse.       In our
  case, the method is the same, though the results are only a little
  more serious.     The sciences, indeed, afford innumerable exam
  ples of those  indirect methods, which conduct much further than
  any one could expect to go by means apparently more direct ; a
  sort of stratagem of inquiry which takes by surprise the secret of
  nature, just as the arts of a skilful general discover to him those
  points where the enemy is most assailable.
     " The two methods which we have just explained have been
  almost always used together, in order that their results might re
  ciprocally confirm each other : and as endless perfectibility, how
  ever doubtful in morals, is quite certain in the physical sciences,
  it has naturally happened that the most perfect operations belong
  to the latter.   Thus, at first, it was merely known that the earth
                                                                      was

                         On the Figure        of the Earlh.             295
    was of a round figure, and that was easily ascertained by the cir
    cular form which its shadow presents when projected on the
    moon's disc during an eclipse. Newton discovered afterwards by
    his calculations, that it was not completely round, but was some
    what flattened at the poles and distended at the equator.           The
    methods of observation, yet imperfect, after great difficulty,
    have established this truth. It has been at last obtained by mea
    suring the terrestrial degrees under the most distant latitudes,
    namely, at the equator and at the poles. The flatness of the poles
    was thus put beyond doubt.         The operations undertaken for the
    last fifty years  in France, England, Sweden, America, and India,
    have succeeded in determining its precise quantity.         It has been
    imagined, therefore, that a great idea conceived a long time
    since, might be realized upon these results, — that of forming a
-
    system of national measures adapted for universal use, which
    might have for its base the extent of the earth itself. The mea
    surement of the arc of the meridian comprehended between Dun
    kirk and Barcelona, and accomplished with infinite precision by
    Messrs. Mechain and Delambre, was the principle of all these
    conclusions : better could not be selected.        The desire of com
    municating     to  these results, not  greater precision, for it would
    have been difficult to hope for     it,but new assurance, and a base
                                                   a
     not so peculiar to France, has caused this first arc to be pro
    longed across Spain as far as the Pitkiuse Isles. Contingently,      it
    became   a   part of an immense triangle above the Mediterranean.
     In fine, the same motive has still caused to be seized with ex
    treme anxiety the opportunity which was offered, two years ago,
    of seeing this operation, already so grand, extend itself towards
    the north, to nearly equal extent, in uniting with        portion of the
                                                              a
    same meridian which stretches from the southern coasts of En
    gland as far as the Shetland Isles to higher latitude than St. Pe-
                                               a
    tersburgh —  a    portion which the learned men of England have
    been now twenty years occupied in measuring.           In order to ter
    minate this immense arc, which comprehends almost the fourth
    of the distance from the equator to the pole, and which unites to
    this extension all the exactitude of mental observation, there re
    mained nothing, last year, but to erect some triangles between
    the Shetland Isles and Scotland,          by
                                              the medium of the Orkneys,
    and to connect the operations of the English and the French at
    the point of junction, consequently at Dunkirk,           by
                                                               means of a
    system of combined operations in which instruments of           a   very
    different nature, employed     by   the observers of the two nations,
    would be made to co-operate.          This last labour was executed in
    the preceding autumn.          M. Arago and        went to receive, at
                                                       I

structed by Ramsden, which they had made use of in all their
preceding operations, and we, on our part, brought one of our
repeating circles.     These circles, in themselves, are instruments
of small dimensions, and of a price comparatively moderate ; but
their precision is founded on a principle independent of their
size, and which consists in the angles of observation being re
peated, and replacing each other on the same circular limb, so
that the errors which might embarrass them combat each other,
(if we may be allowed the phrase,) and mutually destroy each
other.     A sector, on the contrary, is an expensive instrument,
and of considerable size ; it        is,
                                       properly speaking,       long tele
                                                                    a
scope, placed vertically,    and  which       capable
                                                is      of deviating some
degrees to the north as well as to the south of the vertical point,
in following   a  circular limb whose divisions .measure its devia
 tion.    Such stars as pass to the meridian near the zenith, may
thus be observed, and also the quantity which are both north and
south of the vertical point may be ascertained. This observation
being repeated on the same stars and on              great number, at the

breadth of the celestial arc, included between the verticals, pro
duced to these two extremities         ;or, what       the same thing,
                                                        is                  it
gives the mutual inclination of these two vertical lines             which

 may be then compared to the length of the terrestrial arc, which
 they confine. We know what art             necessary in the construction
                                           is

 the vertical plane which   it  ought to describe in following its limb.
 But what we cannot conceive without seeing                    the infinite
                                                             it,   is
 multitude of precautions, cares, and we may say atttentions,
 which the English artist has employed to render the observations
 more exact, and, circumstance of more importance than one
                       a
 might imagine more easy.         In the old sectors, — in that, for ex
 ample, which Clairault, Lemonier, and Maupertuis employed                  in
 the operation of Laponie — the observer was obliged to be hori
 zontally above the telescope, his face turned towards the heavens,
 and in this constrained posture had to wait the transit of the star.
  In the sector of Ramsden,      a little mirror, placed at the lower end
 of the telescope, reflects the image of the star in horizontal

strument the artist has avoided this inconvenience also; he has
traced the point of coincidence on a little shell of mother-of-
pearl; a lamp placed behind this shell illuminates it; and a con
cave mirror, receiving the illuminated image from the point and
from the plumb-line, reflects both at the bottom of the instrument,
where the observer beholds them distinctly.       In a word, that
the observations may be made every where, the entire apparatus
is fixed in a great portable tent, which shelters it, and the top of
which admits the light by a kind of window, which opens for the
observations.      At Dunkirk this fme instrument, by the desire
of   the   observers, was placed within the marine arsenal.             The
English brig the Investigator, which had conveyed it thither, was
also to bring it by the docks to the place where it was to be em
ployed, and was to remain there ready to take it back with the
same facility, the same care, and the same respect as they would
have paid to a vessel of our marine. We placed our little repeat
ing circle at a short distance off, in a shed which the Administra
tion of Marine had directed to be constructed for us ; for it may
be conceived, without our mentioning            it,that the French govern
ment had given the necessary orders that the united observers
should find all the assistance which they could desire. There, owing
to continuation of good weather, which proved extremely harass
   a
ing, so little time did   it  leave us for relaxation, all the observations
were completed      in  fifteen days, to which, properly speaking, we
may add as many nights. By a confidence, which would not de
serve to be noticed      ifit   were as common as         itproper and use

   ;    and when we were completely satisfied with our observa
 tions, we made full and entire communication of them to each
                    a

 more fortunate, they were found also to accord perfectly with
 those which M. Delambre had formerly made                     in
                                                             the same place,
 in the commencement of his operations                ; whence results the
 double assurance, that the arcs of France and England are thus
 perfectly connected with each other         ;    and that, moreover, the
 observations mada-on the other points of the two arcs,                by

 cesses similar to those which we had proved together, afford all
 the precision which can be desired.            It  gives one unfeigned sa

     " The operations which had re-united us being thus happily
accomplished, the brig that had conveyed the English observers
set sail, and departed from Dunkirk.      I could not see this vessel
depart with indifference, in which I had been so obligingly re
ceived the preceding year, in passing to the Isles of Shetland,
and the officers of which had afforded me such assistance in my
observations.     The captain, on quitting the port, hoisted the
French flag, saluted us with fifteen pieces of cannon, and, while
he could render himself audible, or we could see him, con
 tinued to testify to us every mark of friendly recollection.   As it
was expedient that the point of junction of the English and
French operations might always be re-ascertained, M. Arago
and I thought proper to erect some lasting monument.             The
city of Dunkirk freed us from this care in a manner too ho
 nourable to them not to call here for our gratitude.         A little
marble column, surmounted with a spire, is to be erected in this
place, and a short inscription will record the object of the ope
 ration, with the names of the observers of the two countries. At
 the Shetland Isles, the extremity of the great arc has been marked
 in like manner, in the garden of Mr. Edmonston, by a little mo
 nument which he has caused to be erected in the place where we
 had made our observations. In Spain, in the Isles called Pithiuse,
 the southern extremity of our arc is consecrated by a cross. Thus,
 in the most distant countries, and under the most opposite forms
 of government, those institutions which are calculated to preserve
 order in society, tend to the same object, whether their benefi
 cent influence be founded on morality, on politics, or on religion.
     "The operations of which. we have spoken refer to the first of
 the methods by which the figure of the earth may be determined.
 The other method, which employs the measure of a pendulum,
 had been practised, together with the preceding, on all the points
  of our arc. We had given an account, last year, of a tour made
 in England, Scotland, and the Shetland Isles, to carry our ap
 paratus of the pendulum over the whole extent of the English arc.
 The English government, which had favoured this operation
 with great kindness, naturally desired that it should be executed,
  in like manner, by an observer of their own nation.         Captain
  Kater, Member of the London Society, an experimentalist singu
  larly exact, and author of an excellent Memoir relative to the
  measure of the pendulum, upon the principle of seconds, has
  been deputed for this purpose. He conveyed, with much precau
  tion, to Edinburgh and the Shetland Islands, a solid pendulum,

                       On the Figure    of the Earth.                   299
of an invariable form, the diurnal motion of which            he had pre
viously determined at London ; and the oscillations of which he
had also observed in these different places. It is the same ope
ration which, among many others, our countryman Capt. Frey-
cinet is executing, at this moment, in his Voyage round the
World, with pendulums constructed by the direction of M. Arago.
Captain Kater was received at the Shetland Islands by the same
Mr. Edmonston who had received me with such obliging hospi
tality two years ago. He has made observations in the same
place where I did, with the same assistance, and the same ac
commodations ; for, after so many services received from this
excellent man, the obligation, in his opinion, is still due by him,
and not by us, for having penetrated into these remote islands,
and connected with the rest of the world, by the permanent ope
rations of science, the obscure and peaceable corner of the earth
in which Providence had placed him.            I have the pleasure of be
ing able to announce, that the observations of Captain Kater are
found to accord almost identically with mine, as he himself has
assured me, in sending me a view of his results in exchange for
mine, which I addressed to him.             Having thus the lengths of
 the pendulum measured by an uniform process upon the same
meridian from Formentara, the most southern of the Pithiuse
islands, to Unst, the most northern of the Shetland Islands, and
 not only in these two islands, but in a great number of interme
 diate points, the flatness of the earth can, by these lengths, be de
 termined with great exactness. But the amount that results from
it is found to be exactly the same that is drawn from the lunar
 inequalities, or from the comparison of terrestrial degrees mea
 sured at very distant latitudes; so that all these methods, so dif
ferent in their progress, so distinct in their processes, definitively
concur, and terminate in this one result — the flatness of the earth;
namely, the excess of the radius of the equator above the radius
 which extends to the pole is between *-            and        of the latter
radius. The difference between these extreme amounts, betwixt
which the truth is now found to be comprised, will produce but one
 hundred toises either more or less on the length of the semi-axis,
 which passes by the poles of the earth ; and after the correctness
 of the observations which established this fact, as well as from
 their number and their different natures, it can be no longer a
 subject of discussion.

  have at present attained a point, in which the successive results
  may still surpass each other in precision, but cannot be opposed
  to each other. Differences are found, and ever will be found in
  them, because there is nothing absolutely perfect in what man
  observes with his senses.        But these differences will be hence-

  the elements of the great physical theories shall no longer ex
  perience but trifling modifications.

                                 TION.
                             To Mr.  Tilloch.
Sir, — In      perusing my paper in your last number, I find I have
inadvertently made a mistake in accusing the epicycloidal teeth
of tapering suddenly.       In so doing, I meant that kind of teeth
which have the form of the involutes of the circles beyond which
they project.     These, there can be no doubt,' have an enormous
friction.    When a certain force applied perpendicularly to the
radius of a wheel, is just sufficient to turn it round, it is clear,
that if the force act in any other direction, the pressure on the
teeth must be augmented in the ratio of radius to the cosecant
of the angle which the direction of this pressure makes with the
radius of the wheel ; and of course, the friction not only on the
teeth, but likewise at the centre of each wheel, must be augment
ed in the same ratio.
    By glancing at Mr. Rennie's experiments, I am disposed to
agree with Mr. Tredgold — that most experimentalists have been
rather remiss in not carefully measuring the degree of flexure;
When a bar resting loosely on two props becomes bent by the ac
tion of a weight on its middle, the strain will be increased in the
ratio of radius to the secant of the angle which the bar makes
with the horizon at the point where it rests on the prop. But the
arm of the lever, between the weight and prop, "will also be
lengthened.      Allowance for these should therefore be made, be
fore any conclusion can be drawn with accuracy.
    This seems to be the reason of what Buffon has remarked in
his experiments — that in beams differing only in length, the va
riation of strength did not exactly follow the inverse ratio of the
lengths ; the real strengths seeming to fall a little short of the
                                                           computed;

   Sir Humphry Davy has turned his attention to this subject,
and seemingly with much promise of success. It occurred to him
that a chemical examination of the nature of the MSS. and of
the changes they have undergone might offer some data as to the
best methods to be attempted for separating their leaves, and
rendering their characters legible. Some fragments having been
submitted to experiment, he was soon convinced that they had
not been carbonized by the operation of fire, but were in a state
analogous to peat or Bovey-coal, the leaves being cemented to
gether by a substance formed during the fermentation and change
of the vegetable matter of which they were composed.         Having
ascertained the nature of this substance, the next desideratum
was to discover means to destroy the cementing substance with
out injury to the characters or destroying the texture of the MSS.;
and in this he happily succeeded. After the chemical operation,
the leaves of most of the fragments perfectly separated from each
other, and the Greek characters were very distinct.        He found
however inv one fragment the leaves easily separated, but the
characters defaced on the exterior and partially so in the interior
folds : in another, though the characters were legible on the
leaves that separated, yet an earthy matter, a species of tufa,
 prevented their separation in some parts — circumstances that
were clearly the results of agencies to which the MSS. had been
exposed, during or after the volcanic eruption by which they had
been covered.    An examination of the excavations that still re
main open at Herculaneum, confirmed the opinion that the MSS.
had not been acted on by fire.      These excavations are in loose
tufa, composed of ashes, sand, and fragments of lava, imperfectly
cemented by ferruginous and calcareous matter ; and from the
manner in which this tufa is deposited in the galleries of the
houses, there can be little doubt that it was the result of torrents
laden with sand and volcanic matter, accompanied with showers
of ashes and stone. From the state of the buildings, it appeared
evident to Sir Humphry that they had never been exposed to
 any degree of heat capable of converting vegetable matter into
charcoal : from the state of the MSS. it is inferred that they
were probably on shelves of wood, which were broken down when
the roofs of the houses gave way to the superincumbent mass ;
and hence many of them were crushed and folded in a moist
state, and some pressed in a perpendicular direction. They must
all have been acted on by water; and as the ink was composed of

                           by Sir H. Davy.                        303
finely divided charcoal suspended     on a solution of gum or glue,
wherever the water percolated continuously the diameters were
more or less destroyed.      Vegetable matter becomes decomposed
by moisture,    first brown, then black ; and by long continued ac
tion of air, the charcoal itself is at last destroyed, leaving no
thing but the earths which entered into the constitution of the
vegetable substance : when not exposed to air or moisture, still
the decomposition goes on, but more slowly, and in the course
of ages the carbonaceous matter only remains.
    Of the MSS. the greater part are brown, and still contain some
of their volatile substance, or extractive matter, which occasions
the coherence of the leaves ; others are almost entirely converted,
into charcoal, and their leaves (when not too much crushed) may
be readily separated by mechanical means. Of a few, little re
mains except the earthy basis, and the charcoal of the characters,
that of some of the leaves being destroyed.
    The number of MSS. and of fragments originally brought to
the Museum at Naples, where Sir Humphry examined what re
 mained, was 1696 ; of these 88 have been unrolled, and found*
in a legible state ; 3 19 more have been operated upon, and found
 not to be legible; and 24 have been presented to foreign poten
 tates.    Among the 1265 that remain, the greater number con
sist  of  small fragments, or of mutilated or crushed MSS., pre
 senting but little hope of being separable in distinct leaves ; from
 80 to 1 20 are in a state much more promising, and to which Sir
 Humphry's chemical process is applicable.         The process he has
 not yet published.
    Of the 88 MSS. that have        been unrolled,  excepting a few
 fragments in which some Latin verses were found, the great body
 consists of works of Greek philosophers, or sophists : 9 are of
 Epicurus, 32 bear the name of Philodemus, 3 of Demetrius, I of
 Colotes, 1 of Polystratus, 1 of Camiades, and 1 of Chrysippus :
 and those whose authors' names are unknown are upon natural
 or on moral philosophy, medicine, criticism, arts, life and man
 ners.
    Sir Humphry suggests that a systematic attempt should be
 made to examine in detail all the MSS. that contain legible cha
 racters.   The name of the author has generally been found in
 the last leaf unrolled ; but two or three columns at the begin
 ning would enable a scholar to judge of the nature of the work,
 and by a single fold it might be ascertained whether it was prose
 or verse, history, physics, or ethics. He thinks that by employ
 ing one enlightened Greek scholar to direct the undertaking, one
 to superintend the chemical part of the operation, and 15 or 20
 persons for the mechanical labour of unrolling and copying, there
 is every probability that in a year, and at an expense of from
                                                               2500/.

2500Z. to 3000/., every thing worth preserving in the collection,
would be known, and the extent of the expectation that ought
to be formed be fully ascertained. — At all events, an acquaint
ance with the contents of the remaining rolls would afford much
curious and even useful information, respecting the state of so
ciety, literature, science, and the arts, among the ancients ; par
ticularly in the Greek colonies of Magna Grecia and Sicily.
                          GALLIC   ACID.
    M. Braconnot has published the following improved processes
for obtaining this acid. Eight ounces of pounded gall-nuts were
infused for four days in a little more than two pints of water, and
agitated occasionally, at the end of which time they were thrown
on a cloth and the residue was strongly pressed : the liquid thus
separated was filtered, and set aside in a glass bottle covered with
paper for two months, during which time it deposited much
gallic acid in crystals.    The mould was removed from the sur
face, and the fluid being then passed through a cloth subjected
to pressure, the mass left in the cloth was found to be principally
gallic acid.    The liquid was then evaporated to the consistence
 of a syrup, and in twenty-four hours more crystals were depo
sited, which were again separated by a cloth and pressure. The
solid refuse of the first infusion, which, having been moistened,
had been left to ferment during the two months that the infusion
had been set aside, also yielded, by the action of boiling water,
a portion of crystallized acid.     The whole quantity of crystals
 obtained by these means was nearly two ounces, but mixed with
 an insoluble powder.     To get rid of this they were boiled in 18
 cubic inches of water : the liquid being filtered, 1544 grains of a
 peculiar substance remained on the filter, and fawn-coloured
 crystals were deposited on cooling, which when pressed and dried
 weighed 617 grains : 154{ grains more were got by evaporating
 and crystallizing the mother liquor.
    M. Braconnot's second process is still better. He exposed
 moistened gall-nuts for a month to a temperature of from 68° to

 They swelled, became mouldy, and formed . a whitish paste. A
 coloured liquid which it contained being separated by pressure,
 the mass was treated with boiling water to dissolve the acid : the
 fluid when separated by pressure and cooled gave a crystalline
 magma of gallic acid.
    To purify his gallic acid M. B. employed animal charcoal
  (common ivory black) washed in muriatic acid : 100 parts of the
 coloured acid, 800 parts of water, and 18 parts of the charcoal
 (moistened before mixture with the acid and water) were put into
 a bottle, which was then kept for 15 minutes in boiling water;

The filtered liquid left to cool, but now and then shaken, became
 a mass of white gallic acid, from which the redundant fluid was
separated by pressure.       The acid thus obtained was as pure and
white as other crystallizable vegetable acids : its solution does not
affect a solution of gelatine ; and it crystallizes from hot water
in needles as white as snow. Annates de Ckim.
                         PYROMUCOUS ACID.
    This name is given by M. Hauton Labillardiere to a new acid
which he has procured, by distilling mucous acid till nothing re
mained in the retort but charcoal.       A brown liquid came over,
 and a few crystals attached themselves to the upper part of the
retort: these were put together, and about four times as much
water was added: the solution was then filtered, and evaporated to
a pellicle ; the crystals were separated, and the mother liquor was
again evaporated to obtain the rest of the acid.          The crystals
thus obtained are yellow and impure, and must therefore be di
stilled in a small retort at a temperature of 266° of Fahrenheit ;
then melted, and again distilled. A slight portion of charcoal is
left in the retort, and the distilled acid still appears yellow ; but
when crystallized it becomes white and pure.        It is inodorous, of
a strong acid taste, melts at 266° of Fahr., volatilizes above that
heat, and condenses into a liquid which on cooling becomes solid.
It reddens vegetable blues, is not deliquescent, is more soluble
in alcohol than in water, and in hot water than in cold. Ana
lysed by oxide of copper, its constituents appear to be carbon
52-1 IS, oxygen 45-806, hydrogen 2-111.             It combines with
 the various metallic oxides, yielding neutral salts, the greater
part of which    are crystallizable.
                    STARCH-SUGAR FERMENTED.
     Our readers know that sugar has been made artificially by the
 action of sulphuric acid on starch.     Sugar thus made is found to
be fermentable like any vegetable saccharine matter.          Dissolved
in water, boiled with hops, and treated like     malt   worts, it yields
a light, brisk, pleasant beverage, and of a strength proportioned
to the solution employed.
                           POTATO E  SUGAR.
    Late accounts from Sweden state, that in many parts of that
kingdom " they now extract sugar from potatoe starch.               It is
 calculated that 240 pounds yield forty of moscovado sugar."

Hungary      : it was considered as an ore  of cobalt, but was found to
be composed of sulphur, arsenic, iron, nickel, and 20 per cent,
of this metal.        Its colour is bronze yellow; specific gravity
 1 1 -470 ; it is malleable, has a hackly fracture ; is as hard as fluor
spar ; is strongly attracted by the magnet ; does not tarnish in
the common temperature, but does when heated, forming a black
oxide.      It yields colourless solutions, but its oxide hydrated by
ammonia is deep blue.          Neither alkaline arseniates, nor phos
phates, nor infusion of galls, produce any precipitate in its solu
tions.     Prussiate of potash gives a pearl-gray precipitate, and a
plate   of  zinc a black metallic one from its muriatic solution.
                             NATIVE COPPER.
    A remarkable piece of native copper        was recently found near
the town of Wallingford, and twelve miles from Newhaven, United
States.      It was turned up in ploughing.      The country is of the
secondary trap formation, and the rocks at the place where it was
found are of the old red sandstone of Werner,which here occupies
the plains and runs under the trap.          The piece weighs almost
six pounds; it is beautiful virgin copper with rudiments of large
octohedral crystals of native copper upon its surface, which is
more or less incrusted with green carbonate of copper and ruby
oxide very much resembling that of Cornwall ; the ruby oxide is
particularly remarkable in the cavities of the piece. Another
piece of nearly ninety pounds weight was found in the same neigh
bourhood several years ago. — See Bruce's Mineralogical Journal,

        SUBTERRANEAN      GARDEN   AND NATURAL       HOT-BED.
    A  curious account of a subterranean garden formed at the
bottom of the Percy Main Pit, Newcastle, by the Furnace
Keeper, was communicated to the last General Quarterly Meeting
of the Caledonian Horticultural Society, in a letter from Mr.
Bald, Coal Engineer of Alloa. The plants are formed in the
bottom of the mine by the light and radiant heat of an open fire
constantly maintained for the sake of ventilation. — The same
letter contained an account of an extensive natural hot- bed near
Dudley in Staffordshire, which is heated by means of the slow
combustion of the coal at some depth below the surface.         From
this natural hot-bed a gardener raises annually crops of different
kinds of culinary vegetables, which are earlier by some weeks
than those in the surrounding gardens where the subterranean
heat does not operate.         •         -
               TAME SEALS. — CARNIVOROUS HORSE.
    A gentleman in the neighbourhood of Burntisland has com
pletely succeeded in taming a, seal: its singularities daily continue
to attract the curiosity of strangers. It appears to possess all the
sagacity of the dog, lives in its master's house, and eats from
his hand : he usually takes it with him in his fishing excur
sions, upon which occasion it affords no small entertainment.
When thrown into the water, it will follow for miles the track of
the boat ; and, although thrust back by the oars, it never relin
 quishes its purpose.     Indeed it struggles so hard to regain its
seat, that one would imagine its fondness for its master had en
tirely overcome the natural predilection for its native element. —
 Edinburgh Weekly Journal.
    The above paragraph corroborates the account of a Newfound
land dog having suckled two young seals, which fact (from a gen
tleman of the strictest veracity, the owner of the dog,) was sent
t6 the Editor of the Monthly Magazine by the writer. When
mentioned to some persons, who seem to consider animals as
mere machines incapable of imbibing new habits, an incredulous
expression of countenance has mortified the relater ; and another
instance was so questioned, that it was quite suppressed, till cor
roborated by a similar case so notorious as to enforce b< lief.
    Five-and-thirty years asio the writer frequently saw a young
 horse which preferred roasted or boiled meat to grass and corn.
 His dam was killed by an unfortunate accident, when the foal was
 five weeks old : he was fed by the dairy- maid with cow's milk,
 and soon familiarly followed her to the kitchen.       He began to

gnaw bones in mere playfulness : but his carnivorous taste was not
 suspected, till the remains of a piece of roast-beef set to cool in
 the pantry-window wss carried away. Nobody imputed the theft
 to the colt ; and the housekeeper, determined to convict the pil
 ferer, watched while another bit of meat was left in the same spot
 from whence the beef was taken. She soon saw the colt stretch
his fore feet up, till they rested on the outside of the window,
 take out the fragment, and gallop to a wood at some distance.
 She afterwards offered him slices of beef, mutton, veal, or lamb,
 which he accepted like a dog: he did not like pork, but all kinds
 of fowl or game were highly agreeable to him.
    To confirm this statement by parallel evidence, permit me to
 remind your readers, that in different parts of India the horses in
 an encampment are served with boiled sheep's heads, as a mess
 more nutritive than grain, when they have any extraordinary fa
 tigue to undergo. May not the whole account admit of practical
 application ? When grain and fodder are scarce, the worst cattle
 might be killed, and boiled into strong soup, cutting the flesh
 small, among straw, hay, or other vegetable provender ? During
 scareity the cattle of Iceland go to the shores, and feed on fish.

                        • INTERIOR OF AFRICA.
    Advices have been received of Major Gray's having succeeded
 in penetrating into the interior of Africa to a considerable di
 stance. When parted with, the gentleman, a French naval officer,
who brought these advices, says, he had advanced 300 leagues.
 Major Gray left the River Gambia in the month of April 1818.
 On the following 1st of November he was at Bondou, a Negro
country, situated near the river Senegal, where he was detained,
by the evil disposition of the inhabitants and from the want of
trading articles, till the 15th of the same month, when he pro
ceeded with his expedition to the village of Bakel in the Serra-
colet country.      He there put himself under the protection of the
French Government hrig Argus, which vessel was to stop a year
in that country. At this period Major Gray received no news for
a whole month from the Surgeon-major of the expedition, whom
he had sent to Sego to solicit the protection of the king of Bam-
barras. Mr. Adrian Partarieux, a man of colour, and interpreter
to Major Gray, who had gone to St. Louis, Senegal, for trading
articles, left it the beginning of last month to join the expedition.
On the 18th of Nov. last Major Gray was in very good health,
though he had unfortunately lost the greater part of his white
men, and all the animals of burden ; but he had not abandoned
all hopes of succeeding in his mission.
    The subjoined paragraphs are from a private letter dated St.
Louis (Senegal) Jan.lUth, received by a gentleman at Caen, and

 what course things will take.         It is hoped that the projects of
 Government will open fresh resources to trade.           Some millions
 of pounds of cotton have been shipped for exportation. It is very
 fine, and from its amelioration by the care of its cultivation, it
 perhaps cannot be excelled.         It is worth 45 sols a pound when
shredded ; but this new branch of industry wants encouragement,
 and I do not perceive that any thing has been done to promote
 it. We find here cotton of a nankeen colour, which grows, like
 the other, without cultivation, and which may be advantageously
 used in our manufactures.
     " Our Galam expedition has not been attended with all the
success which we anticipated.          It left this on the 17th August
 181S, to the number of nine vessels, under convoy of three Royal
brigs of war ; they were three months in proceeding up the river
about 300 leagues.          The navigation is dangerous, because it
must be attempted during the hottest and worst part of the sea
son.      This flotilla, with the exception of the Argus Royal brig,
 and a merchant vessel, destined to pass the year at Galam, re
 turned about the middle of December. — They effected nothing,
except bringing away some grain.           The most grievous part is,
that all the Europeans, to the number of 30, were taken sick, and
 15 of them died.       Fears are entertained for those who remain.

However this may be, it is now united to ours, which is not esta

the river Faleme. — Major Gray dispatched Adrian Partarieux, a

 given by Amadi Fatouma, who was dispatched in quest of Mr.
 Park from the Gambia, some years since, but is at variance with
 the circumstances attending it.     Mr. Bowditch, who conducted
 a successful mission from Cape Coast Castle to the King of the
 Ashantees, obtained, while at Coomassie, the summer before last,
 the following account during one of his visits to Baba, the Chief
 of the Moors. A Moor, who had just come from Timbuc-
 too, wiis sent for the purpose of seeing Mr. Bowditch : he did
 not express the surprise that was anticipated on seeing a white.
 man, and accounted for it from having before seen three white
 men at Boussa. This naturally created a desire of being informed
 of the particulars, and Baba interpreted to Mr. Bowditch the fol
 lowing relation which the Moor gave : — " That some years ago,
 a vessel with masts suddenly appeared on the Quolla, or Niger,
 near Boussa, with three white men, and some black.         The na
 tives, encouraged by these strange men, took off provisions for
 sale, were well paid, and received presents besides: it seems the.
 vessels had anchored.    The next day, perceiving the vessel going
 on, the natives hurried after her (the Moor protesting, from their
 anxiety to save her from sunken rocks with which the Quolla
 abounds); but the white men mistaking, and thinking they pur
 sued for a bad purpose, deterred them.       The vessel soon after
 struck; the men jumped into the water and tried to swim, but
 could not for the current, and were drowned.      He thought some
 of their clothes were now at Wanwaw, but he did not believe
 there were any books or papers."      This story was afterwards re
 peated to Mr. Bowditch by another Moor, but who was not, like
 the former, an eye-witness of the transaction.    An Arabic manu
 script was also obtained by this gentleman, which corroborates
 the fate of Mr. Park and his companion Lieutenant Martyn,'and
acids, that one of the bodies had been found and buried.      Theie.
is,  however, reason to hope that some further information may
he obtained.      Mr. Hutchison, who was left as Resident Agent at
 Coomassie, learning from Baba, the person before mentioned, .
that  a Moor was about to depart for Jenne, sent a letter to two
Europeans who resided there, and who he supposed were some
belonging to Park's expedition, as seven of the soldiers are yet
unaccounted for, who were in good health when separated from
their commander.       There were also, it  seems, two white men
at Timbuctoo, who have been there for several years. The Moors
assured Mr. Hutchison that there was no doubt of the letter
reaching its destination, and that gentleman accompanied

   edifice which is supposed to have been built by Nero.            He has

  other wrecks of antiquity which it is supposed are deposited there,

  almost completed.        This sum is deposited in the hands of the
  Papal banker, the Duke of Torlonia.          All the objects which it is
  hoped will be drawn from the bed of the river, by means of a
 machine invented for the purpose, will be formed into one mass,
  and valued by connoisseurs.        The Pope's chamber will receive a
 sixth, and will also have the right of priority to purchase the rest.
 A Papal commissioner is appointed to superintend the enterprise.
  The operation will last two months, and will be terminated be
 fore the beginning of September.         Should it succeed, the director
 of the enterprise, M. Varo, promises to each shareholder a pre

I mean the works of the celebrated German astronomer Schroeter

" Selenotopogropkiscke Fragmente, 4to, Gottingen, 1791 ;" and
the editors of the Monthly Review f, in giving an account of that
work, say, " The present volume contains the result of the au

  the zenith exhibited the blue tint peculiar to tropical climates.
  At half past 2 A.M. on the 12th, thousands of bolides (fire-balls)
i and falling stars succeeded each other during four hours.   Their
  direction was very regular from north to south ; and they filled
  a space of 60u in the sky, from 30° N. to 30° S. of the true E.
  The meteors rose above the horizon at E.N.E. and at E. de
scribing arcs more or less extended, and were never seen to fall to
  wards the S. after having followed the direction of the meridian.

Some attained an elevation of 40°, and all above 25° or 30°.
The wind was fromE., but little was moving in the lower regions
of the atmosphere.       No clouds were visible.     The observer, from
the beginning of the phenomena, could not perceive a space in
the firmament equal in extent to three diameters of the moon.,
that was not at every instant filled with fire-balls and falling-
stars — the latter in greatest number.         All left luminous traces,
from 5° to 10° in length, as often happens in equinoctial regions,
visible for seven or eight seconds; and many of the falling-stars
exhibited a distinct nucleus, as large as the disc of Jupiter, darting
out vivid sparks of light.       The bodies seemed to explode; but
the largest, which were from 1° to   If   0
                                            in diameter, vanished with
out scintillation. The light was white, not reddish, owing pro
bably to the transparency of the air.
     In their journey from Caraccas to Rio Negro, the travellers
made inquiry at every place, whether the meteors of the 1 2th of
 November had been seen there. They had been seen at Fer
 nando de Apuva in lat. 7° 53' 12", long. 79° 20'; and at Marao
 in lat. 2" 42', distant 174 leagues from Cumana.          The observers
 compared     the phenomenon     to a beautiful  fire-work, which lasted
 from 3   to 6 A.M. At the southern extremity of Spanish Guiana,
 Portuguese missionaries assured M. de Humboldt that the phe
 nomenon had been seen in the Brazils, as far as the equator, or
 over a line of 230°: " but what was my astonishment," he says,
 <c
     when, on my return to Europe, I learnt that it had been seen
 on an extent of the globe of 64° of latitude, and 91° of longi
 tude — at the equator, in S. America, at Labrador, and in Ger
  many?" They were not seen south of the equator. Mr. Ellicot,
  astronomer to the United States, saw them in the Gulf of Flo
  rida in lat. 25°, long. 81° 3f/.      To him they appeared to move
  in all directions in every part of the sky, some seeming to fall
  perpendicularly,    so that it was expected they would drop into
  the vessel. The same phenomenon was seen in America, in lat.
  30° 42'; in Labrador at Nain, lat. 56° 55'; at Hoffenthal, lat.
                                                   0
  58° A' ; in Greenland at Lichtenau, lat. 61 5'; and at New Her-
   renhut, lat. 64° 14', long. 52° 20'.         "The Esquimaux were
  frightened at the enormous quantity of bolides that fell during
  twilight, towards all parts of the firmament, some of which were
  a foot broad.        It was also seen in Europe at Weimar, lat.
   50° 59', long. 9°  1',  between six and seven in the morning, when
it    was half past two at Cumana."
      M. de Humboldt observes, that some meteors have not more
   than five leagues of elevation, and the highest do not appear to
   exceed thirty. They have often more than 100 feet diameter;
   and their velocityis   such, that in
                                      a   few seconds they dart over    a.
   space of two leagues.       Some have been seen to rise upwards,
                                                               forming

  forming    an angle of 50° with the vertical line.       "This remark--
  able  circumstance   has  led  to the   conclusion, that falling -stars are
  not aerolites, which, after having hovered a long time in space,
  take fire on entering accidentally into our atmosphere, and fall
  towards the earth."
                                     COMET.
     A comet was lately discovered at the Observatory of Konigs-
  berg, in the Swan.      It is not visible without the aid of thi! tele
  scope.
                               EARTHQUAKES.
     On the night of the 29th of January two shocks of an earth
  quake were felt at Teflis in Georgia.          They were preceded by a
  tempest   and  a subterraneous    rumbling. At ten o'clock the shocks
  grew so violent, that even the inhabitants, though such pheno-
  mena.are familiar to them, were struck with terror.             They were
  the more terrified, as every shock was followed by tremendous
  rendings, as if the earth were opening her bowels.             Several old
  buildings   were  destroyed.
     On the 26th of February an earthquake was felt at Rome, Fres-
 cato and Albano. Its direction was from S. E. to N. E.
                                 STEAM BOAT.
     A trial was made at Milan on        the 19th of February, with a boat
 on a new construction, which moves either with or against the
 stream, by means of machinery, without the aid of oars or steam,
 moved by the power of six men, carrying a load of one and a half
 its own weight, which is stated to have answered every expecta
 tion. We cannot, for want of sufficient data, make any proper
estimate of the supposed advantages gained by this construction,
 being neither informed of the load moved nor of the velocity,
 but of the power applied — six men.
                              LIGHT-HOUSES.
    New light-houses     have   recently been erected : one at the point
of Avre, at the northern extremity of the Isle of Man ; and two
others at the southern extremity of the same island.             They were
lighted for the first time on the 1st of February, and are to be
kept burning from evening till morning.
                       VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY.
    The Russian Government           is fitting out two expeditions for
«cientific researches in remote seas.           Each will consist of two
ships ; one of them is designed to make discoveries towards the
North Pole. Above sixty officers of the Imperial Navy have ap
plied to the Minister of the Marine requesting to be employed on
this service.
                                                                    STATIS

                              STATISTICS.
   Bv the latest estimate,   the  population of the Danish States is-
now 1,862,000 souls, viz. in Denmark 1,100,000; in the Duchies
of Sleswick and Holstein 6S0,000} in Lauenburg 30,000 ; in
Iceland and the Faroe Islands 52,000.
   ON  THE WEATHER-COCK        OF  VARRO,     BEING THE FIRST ON
                               RECORD.
    So many important phaenomena are connected with the direc
tion and changes of the wind, that philosophers have in all ages
paid particular attention to this branch of meteorology, as well
as to the making of instruments to indicate it.
    The earliest instance, however, which we have on record of a
regularly formed wind-vane appears to be that of Varro, which
he caused to be made and put up in his garden.           The fan and
point  turned   on a pivot, and  seem  to  have  been constructed  like
our modern weather-cocks ; but it had the addition of a moving
index, which went round a circle divided into eight equal divi
sions answering to the eight winds.         This circle seems to have
been placed horizontally on the post whereon the vane was
fixed.    Though it is highly probable, from the interest which,
wind and weather must always have excited, that there were
more simple vanes before the time of Varro; yet we have no ac
curate account of them. Leaves of trees and afterwards flags may
have suggested the first weather- cocks.

LIII.    Memoirs   of the Life o/Lkwis Brugnatelli, M.D. Pro
   fessor of Chemistry in the University of Pavia, Member of
    the Imperial-royal Institute of Science, Literature and Arts
    of Milan, &c. &c.
^MLjdern Italy       has produced few men whose lives have been
more useful to society, or more interesting not merely to their
own country but to the civilized world, than that of Dr. Lewis
Brugnatelli, who presents an illustrious example of talents and
industry attaining eminence in science, although unsupported
either by personal wealth or powerful patronage.        In any other
country   than  Italy, the number and immense sale of his literary
works on science would have procured him additional means of
making chemical researches ; but unfortunately for writers in the
Italian language, a work of merit is no sooner published in any
of the principal cities, than it is reprinted in all the adjoining
states, and (in the commercial phrase) the market is often sup
plied with editions so shamefully incorrect, as to injure not merely
the interest but also the honour of the original author.    It is ne
cessary to consider well the fatal consequences of this state of
things, in order to appreciate more adequately the zeal and in
defatigable exertions of the late chemical professor.
    Dr. Lewis Brugnatelli was born in Pavia in 1761 ; his parents,
not being in very affluent circumstances, had destined him for a
mercantile life before he had received the rudiments of a literary
education : observing, however, the strong bent of his mind, they
afterwards thought of making him an engineer; but this study,
although scientific, was little congenial to his feelings, and he
immediately applied himself with the most indefatigable zeal to
the study of medicine and chemistry, in which his progress was
so rapid, notwithstanding      the extreme scantiness of his means,
that he not only obtained the degree of Doctor of Medicine in
Pavia, 1784, but was shortly after elected repeater of chemistry
in the same university.       Bv the death of Professor Leopoli he
became pensioned repeater in the College of Ghislieri, and in
 1787 he was elected assistant to the chemical chair of Professor
Leopoli, and afterwards to that also of Professor Brusati. During
this interesting period he had given the most unequivocal evi
dence of his talents and skill both in chemistry and medicine.
The science of analytical chemistry had just, come into existence;
curiosity and enthusiasm were awakened towards every thing that
could be subjected to chemical action. : a few chemical reagents
had been discovered, and our juvenile professor eagerly availed
himself of their aid to investigate the nature and properties
of the gastric iuice.     His experiments were made and published
    Vol. 53. No. 253. May 1819.                X                  the

322          Memoirs of the  Life of Lewis Brugnalelli.
the very year in which he graduated (1784), when he discovered
that the gastric juice had invariably an acid character in carni
vorous animals, while in herbivorous it was uniformly alkaline and
putrescent.     He was led to these experiments by the circum
stance of Professor Carminati being engaged in making physio
logical researches on the gastric juice at the same period in the
hospital. It was then ascertained that the gastric juice of carni
vorous animals had great curative powers when applied to foul
ulcers or wounds, but that of herbivorous was destitute of this pro
perty. Professor Brugnatelli continued his researches ; and com
bining the effects of the different kinds of gastric juice with that
acid which he had also discovered in the stomach of all carni
vorous birds, he succeeded in determining their solvent powers in
the corrosion not only of metals but calcareous stones ; and even
pieces of rock-crystal and agate introduced into the stomach
exhibited signs of its consumptive powers. These experiments were
followed by an examination of the action of nitric acid on cork,
in which the -Professor discovered that a new and peculiar acid
was developed, and which has since been called the suberic acid.
At the same time he discovered a method of preparing fulminat
ing, silver, which he improved and extended to other substances ;
and which is esteemed preferable to the process of Howard, being
that now generally used for making fulminating balls, &c. The
consequence of these discoveries led him to make new experi
ments on the salts (particularly uitrats) which had the property
of detonating when mixed with a combustible body, and exposed
to friction or a blow of a hammer, in order to demonstrate the
quantity of caloric which might exist in bodies even in the solid
state.    He extended his ideas to the various kinds of combus
tion, proving the necessity of determining tbe difference between
them ; some being cold and obscure, others accompanied with
the most vivid development of caloric and light, — circumstances
which must have a very great influence on the properties of a
body that was united to oxygen.       In the case of cold and ob
scure combustion,    the  body continues capable of presenting the
detonating phaenomena of caloric and light when brought in con
tact with other combustible bodies ; but it loses entirely this
property if the caloric and light were disengaged previous to its
union with oxygen.       Of these facts and observations Thomson
availed himself in his System of Chemistry, article Combustion,
which is chiefly derived from the luminous researches and in
genious observations of the Pavian Professor.     On these facts was
founded the hypothesis respecting the constitution of oxygen,
modifying the principles of Lavoisier, according to which many
pheenomena of combustion are very plausibly explained,.          m,
    Among the ingenious researches and observations of Professor

             Memoirs   of the Life of Lewis Brugnatelli.        323
Brugnatelli must be noticed his opinion respecting the chemical
action of the electric fluid, which he published so early as 1800, in
his ' Memoir on oxyelectrics,' inserted in his Annali di Cliimica,
vol. xviii. In his ' Galvanic observations' published in the same
work and in the Memoirs of the Italian Institute, he opposed
decidedly the supposed formation of muriatic acid at the expense
of water as observed by Pacchiani, remarking that this acid de
pended on other substances preexisting in the water.        By these
and other observations he made some progress towards those
discoveries which have immortalized the name of Davy, who on
his part did not fail to cite with great care and merited appro
bation the previous experiments of the Pavian chemist.
    Professor Brugnatelli being at Paris in 1801, and in company
with Volta, he mentioned the fact that various substances are
transported by the electric fluid, in presence of the French che
mists and philosophers, all of whom smiled, saying, " The
thing is impossible, that an imponderable bodv should transport
ponderable substances." So far had the Italian chemist, as usual,
anticipated the knowledge of the progress of chemical discovery,
even in the French capital, where his experiments and discoveries
were so novel and singular that they were boldly and thought
lessly disbelieved, instead of being investigated, verified or dis
proved. The Pavian Professor, however, had previously proposed
a modification or a reform of the new chemical nomenclature ;
and as the greater part of the nomenclaturists were then living,
it was the easiest and most effectual mode of avoiding difficulties
by totally disbelieving both the chemical and literary novelties.
In 1806 he read a Memoir in the hall of the University ' On the
decomposition of salts effected by electricity,' which was after
wards printed in the first volume of his Giornale.
   To detail with sufficient accuracy his numerous discoveries in
pneumatic, vegetable and animal chemistry, would greatly exceed
the limits prescribed to this brief memoir : to those pursuing si
milar inquiries, the subjoined list of his original works, copied
from the Giornale di Fisica, (edited by his son Dr. Caspar B.)
maybe useful. It may likewise be proper to notice here that he
discovered uric acid in the excrement of silkworms, free lime in
rhubarb, and carbonate of lime in the urinary calculi of hogs, and
more recently in those of men.      His numerous experiments and
researches appear in a posthumous ' Memoir on urinary calculi,'
which is just published, and which abounds in new facts and ob
servations, the result of great industry and extensive knowledge,
derived from a vast collection of calculi, designs of which accom
pany the work.      Among his researches in vegetable chemistry
should be recorded his Experiments on Coffee-berries, which be
ing steeped some time in a solution of soda, displayed a beautiful

emerald green ; this colour, the same as occurs in ammoniure of
copper, is dissipated in close receivers, but immediately reappears
when brought in contact with atmospheric air.                He also disco
vered several new sympathetic inks, some hygrometric colours,
reagents to detect poisonous substances ; and greatly improved
many pharmaceutical and chemical processes, introduced various
new amalgams and paints, and obtained a very pure gum from the
variegated aloes and various other vegetable products.            His elec
tric and galvanic experiments were equally numerous : and the
curious fact of carbon becoming capable, by means of galvanism,
of being oxygenated and hydrogenated, and when in this state a
powerful electric, may contribute to facilitate further experi
ments of the like nature.            The medical labours of Professor
Brugnatelli would have given him celebrity, had his chemical fame
been less conspicuous.          His experiments with chlorine in the cure
of hydrophobia are too recent to require further notice; but
whatever may be the final effects of this medicine, either in curing
or mitigating a hitherto incurable disease, the merit of Brug
natelli in recommending it to the public must ever remain un
impaired.      In such a calamity, every truly scientific medical prac
titioner will gladly avail himself of a medicine, which presents even
the slightest hope of arresting the hand of Death, and which is
so easily procured as to deprive either indolence or ignorance of
a pretext for not promptly administering it.              The observations
and statements       of  the  Pavian  Professor have been translated into
almost all the European languages ; and should any obstinate or
wilfully incredulous practitioner omit its application, he will ne
cessarily expose himself to the censure of friends.
    Finally, Brugnatelli was appointed professor of general che
mistry applied to the arts in the University of his native city
 (Pavia) in 1796; and he filled this chair with equal honour to
himself and advantage to the numerous students from all parts of
 Italy and the Levant who attended his lectures, till his death on
the 24th of October 1818, in his fifty-eighth year.             The follow

by Italian chemists, and it is perhaps well suited to the genius of
the language.      Although subsequent discoveries have not sanc
tioned the principles which it favours, it has nevertheless been
extremely useful in Italy, in a country where numbers read and
speak of chemistry and chemical subjects without any practical
knowledge ; where there are very few practical, but many theo
retical and critical chemists, who, being amused with literary
subtleties and refinement of terms, have disseminated a taste for
chemical studies which may ultimately lead to practical expe-

 which occasioned some controversy : but his principal exertions

 cular vapours suspended in air at the freezing temperature, on
 the conversion of fixed oils into wax, sensibility of plants, a de

bodies.'    In the Memoirs of the Italian Institute for 1806, ap
 peared his ' Observations on the identity of some new characters
 of carbon with those of the metals,' which have since been so
 amply illustrated.    Many other memoirs and translations of che

men now begin to appreciate more justly his merits as a philo
sopher, when they can no longer enjoy his amiable character as
a man.     Fortunately for them and the friends of science, his son
and successor pursues with success the noble career of his father ;
and Brugnatelli's Journal, almost the only scientific periodical
work at present published in Italy, may continue to be the ve

LIV.    On the Fallacy of the Experiments in which Water is said
    to have been formed by the Decomposition of Chlorine.            By
    Sir H. Davy,      LL.D. F.R.S*
Some experiments have          been lately communicated to the Royal
Society  of Edinburgh,     from  which it has been inferred, that water
is formed during the action of muriatic acid gas on certain me
tals, and consequently, that chlorine is decomposed in this ope
ration.
          * From  the Philosophical Transactions for 1818, Part I.
                                                                      In

    to have been formed by the Decomposition            of Chlorine. 327
    In repeating those experiments, I have ascertained, that the
water is derived from sources not suspected by the authors, and
that their conclusions are unfounded.           To take up the time of
the Society by long experimental details and theoretical specula
tions on such an occasion, will be unnecessary; I shall therefore
only transiently mention the sources of error, and demonstrate
their operation by two or three examples.
    When muriatic acid gas is passed through flint glass tubes
heated to redness, a small quantity of water is formed by the ac
tion of the gas on the oxide of lead in the glass, and a smaller
quantity by its action on the alkali of the glass: the process be
ing one of double affinity, the hydrogen of the muriatic acid
unites to the oxygen of the oxide, and the chlorine combines with
the metals.
    A copious dew was formed by passing muriatic acid gas through
flint glass tubes red hot, and a less copious dew, by passing it
through green glass tubes.       In the first instance, the glass be
came opaque, and gained a pearly lustre, and a combination of
chlorine and lead sublimed from the hotter into the colder part
of the tube. In the second, the surface of the tube became
slightly opaque, but no sublimate was formed.
    When fine clean iron wire was introduced into such tubes, and
made red rot, and muriatic acid gas passed over             it,
                                                            no particular
precautions being taken      to   free  the tubes from common air,
much more water appeared        ; but this excess of water principally
owed its existence to the combination of hydrogen disengaged
from the muriatic acid gas          by
                                     the iron with the oxygen of the
common air.    I  say, principally because an inappreciable quan
                                     ,
tity  must  have been   deposited from the vapour       of hydrated mu
riatic acid in the muriatic acid gas. This was proved             by filling
the whole apparatus with hydrogen in another experiment, and
generating the muriatic acid gas            retort filled witli hydrogen,
                                          in
                                          a
when the water produced was no more than might have been
expected from the action of the muriatic acid gas on the oxide
of lead and alkali in the glass.    I give the details. Above twenty-
one grains of the first combination of chlorine and iron were
formed; the quantity of moisture collected             bybibulous paper,
and which was      a strong acid solution of the proto-muriate of
iron, amounted to less than half          grain, and of this not more
                                          a
than two-thirds could have been water.            Now,       chlorine had
                                                            if
been decomposed in this operation, the quantity of water ought
to have been at least ten times as great.
I    have shown     numerous experiments, that in the action of mu
                   by
riatic acid gas upon metals, hydrogen, equal      in  bulk to half the vo
lume of the gas,   isproduced;      it  therefore
                                         is        evident, that  if water
had been generated bv the action of muriatic acid gas on            metals,

it must have been the chlorine, or the metal, or both, that were
decomposed.       As chlorine can be freed from much of its aqueous
vapour by dry muriate of lime, which is not the case with mu
riatic acid gas, it offers a much more unexceptionable substance
for experiments of this kind.       I passed 23 cubical inches of
chlorine slowly through dry muriate of lime into a flint glass tube
red rot, containing a green glass tube full of iron wire ; the chlo
rine combined with this iron wire with intense heat ; the bright
sublimate formed was passed through more iron wire heated to
redness, so as to form a considerable quantity of the first com
pound of chlorine with iron, which, when examined, was found
exactly the same as that produced by the action of muriatic acid
gas ou iron.      All the products were heated strongly, and the
end of the glass tube kept very cool ; but 720/ the slightest ap
pearance of moisture was perceptible.
    In all these experiments I was assisted by Mr. Faraday of the
Royal Institution.
    Muriate of ammonia is not altered by being        passed through
porcelain or glass tubes heated to redness; but if metals be pre
sent, it offers similar results to muriatic acid gas.    In one expe
riment, in which muriate of ammonia recently sublimed was used,
instead of muriatic acid gas, the appearance of moisture was iess
than in the experiment on muriatic acid gas, which has been just
detailed, and yet there was a considerable action on the oxide of
lead in the glass, not only by the muriatic acid, but likewise by
the free hydrogen of the decomposed ammonia.
LV.    Observations on a Species ofL\mose\\arecently discovered in
    the United States, by Dr.  Eli  Ives, Professor of Materia Me-
    dica and Botany in the Medical Institution of Yale College*.
This     small plant was observed in flower in     July 1816, by Mr.
 Horatio N. Fenn (now of Rochester, state of New- York), in com
pany with Dr. Leavenworth.        The plant and the seeds have been
preserved by me in a flower-pot from that time to the present.
The plant was taken        a few rods south of Mr. Whitney's gun-
manufactory, on the margin of the river, where it was covered by
every tide.    I have since observed the plant in great abundance
on the margin of the Honsatonuc in Derby, and in those small
streams in East Haven, Branford and Guildford,which empty into
 Long Island Sound.
    A specimen of the Limosella (with some specimens of the
 Tilled) was sent to Z. Collins, esq. of Philadelphia, who wrote
me that Mr. Nuttal had found the same plant a few days previous
             * From the American Journal of Science, No. I.
                                                                    to

to the receipt of my letter, and that they had no question on the
subject of the generic character, but that it would probably prove
to be a new spetfies.
    In the Transactions of the Medico-Physical Society of New-
York, p. 440, it is described under the name of Limosella sulu-
lata.    A description of the plant was published about the same
time, by Mr. Nuttal, in the Journal of the Academy of Natural
Sciences of Philadelphia, (see vol. i. No. VI. page 1 15.)    In the
paper written by Mr. Nuttal, is the following query:
                                                         " Does this
plant, with a lateral mode of growth and alternate leaves, ger
minate with two cotyledons ?"
   The following observations were made in answer to this ques
tion.    In the winter of 1816-17, this plant was kept in a situ
ation exposed to severe frost ; yet whenever the weather became
warm for two or three days it became quite green, but for the
last winter there was no appearance of life in the plant.         In
March 1818, the vessel in which the Limosella had been preserved
for two summers preceding, and in which there were a great
quantity of seeds, was exposed in a warm situation to the sun.
There was no appearance of vegetation till the last day of March,
when were observed .several cylindrical leaves ; some of thein evi
dently arose from bulbs, which had formed last summer on ac
count of the dryness of its situation, which frequently occurs
when plants are removed from a moist to a dry situation.          In
other instances single cylindrical leaves arose from the earth
where no bulbs were to be found ; these cylindrical leaves were
thought to arise from seeds ; which, if it was a fact, would prove
that the plant vegetated with but one cotyledon. In a short time
the vessel was crowded with the seeds of the Limosella raised by
the cotyledons.             i
   These were carefully observed, and in every instance when
the coat of the seed was cast off, two linear cotyledons were ob
served ; soon a cylindrical leaf arose from the centre of the co
tyledons ; and when this leaf had grown to the length of half an
inch, a leaf of a similar kind arose laterally to a line made by
the first leaf and the cotyledons.
   From the facts above stated, it is thought to be proved that
the Limosella vegetates with two cotyledons.      This was the fact
in every instance where the husk of the seeds was obviously at
tached to the cotyledons ; and in the few instances where the plant
appeared to vegetate with one cotyledon, it is probable it arose
from a bulb or some portion of the old plant in which life had
not been extinguished during the past winter, which was made
more probable by the fact that several of the leaves arose ob
viously from bulbs.      This Limosella, with its congeners, hence
will take its place in the natural order of Jussieu, Lysimachice.

LVI.    On   the  urinary Organs and Secretions       of some of the Am
   phibia.      By John Davy, M.D. F.R.S. Communicated                     by
    the Society for the Improvement of Animal Chemistry *
                                               Colombo,   March 25, 1817-
 X he urinary organs of the amphibia have been imperfectly                de
scribed by authors ; but I am not aware that any account                  has
hitherto been published of the urinary secretion of any of this
class of animals.
   Since I have been in Ceylon, both subjects have excited my
attention, and on both I have had favourable opportunities of
gratifying my curiosity.         It may not be uninteresting to the So
ciety   to  know    . the  results  of my observations.      I shall briefly
state them, confined as they are at present to a few animals of
four natural families.
         1.  Of the urinary Organs       and Urine    of Serpents.
   The kidneys of the different kinds       of serpents I have examined,
resemble each other generally; though in each kind there are
minute and trifling differences.          In every instance the kidneys
are very large, nearly equal in size to the liver; they are long
and narrow, and very lobulated ; like some of the mammalia with
conglomerate kidneys, they are destitute of a pelvis ; each lo
bule sends a small duct to the ureter, which leaves the kidney
in two branches.          The ureters in general terminate in a single
papilla.    The   papilla is situated in the cloaca between the mouths
of the oviducts ; it is a little elevated above the surface, and its
point is directed towards a receptacle into which the urine en
ters.    The receptacle is a continuation of the intestine, yet it
may be considered distinct both from the rectum and cloaca, with
both of which it communicates only by means of sphincter ori
fices.     This conformation of parts may be seen to advantage in
large species of snakes. I first observed it in the rock-snake and
the rat-snake, two species of coluber, frequently found from eight
to ten feet long.
   The urinary ducts of serpents are frequently of an opaque white
colour, from a white matter which they contain, which is visible
through their transparent coats, and which may be expressed
and collected from the papilla in small quantities for examina
tion.     More or less of a similar white matter is almost constantly
found in the receptacle ; generally it is found in soft lumps, rarely
in hard masses.          In the receptacle, I have always observed it
pure   and   entirely   free from faecal matter.     This solid urine, for
such it is in reality, gradually accumulates in the receptacle, till
it forms the masses just described.           It is a long time thus col-

 leeting,    from three weeks to a month or six weeks.            When the
 bulk of the    masses is so considerable as to distend the part, they
  are expelled by an unusual exertion of the animal, most com
 monly in the act of devouring its food, which it takes periodi
  cally, at intervals of from threenc to six weeks.            The urine is
 voided occasionally, accompanied by, but never mixed with,
 fa?ces.     When expelled, it is commonly in a soft state, of a bu-
 tyraceous consistence, which it loses from exposure to the air,
 and becomes hard and like chalk in appearance.                 This change
 is produced, I believe, merely by the evaporation of moisture.
 The quantity of solid urine secreted by snakes is very great, more
 even than might be expected from the size of their kidneys; it
 is not unusual to see masses weighing three or four ounces,
mvoided by large snakes.
    The chemical nature of this urine was such as I expected to
find it ; I say expected, because before I left England, I was told
 by Dr. Prout, that he had examined the excrement of a serpent
in London, and had ascertained that it was nearly pure uric
acid ; such have I found it here in every instance, in at least
eight that I have tried it ; and the properties of that fresh from
the ureter were precisely the same as of that contained in the
 receptacle, or of that voided.         Before the blow-pipe, it emitted
strong ammouiacal fumes, consumed without flame, and afforded
only a very minute quantity of ash, consisting chiefly of phos
phate of lime and a fixed alkaline phosphate, and a little carbo
nate of lime: in muriatic acid it was insoluble; in warm dilute
nitric acid it was soluble with effervescence ; and the solution
evaporated, afforded the pink residue almost peculiar to uric acid;
m an alkaline ley it was soluble, and the solution was precipi
tated by muriatic acid. These properties sufficiently prove that
the nature of the urine of snakes is as above stated. Besides uric
acid, I have not been able to detect any other ingredient, nor do
I believe that the urine contains any other, with the exception
of a little dilute mucus, with which it is mixed and lubricated.
          2.   Of the urinary Organs       and Urine    of Lizards.
    I  have examined the urinary organs of four different species of
lizard, the gecko iguana,        a large species resembling the iguana,
called by the natives kobbera-guhm*,             and the alligator.      The
shape of the -kidney varies in different instances ; to each ureter
there is a papilla, and the papillae are situated in the receptacle
itself; and in no other respect have 1 been able to discover be
tween the urinary organs of these lizards and of snakes, any
material difference.       Neither does the urinary secretion of these
four species, and of many other species that I have examined,
        * For an account of this animal, see Knoxans History of Ceylon.
                                                                        differ

332                   On the Earthquake   felt   in Sicily
differ from that of snakes in its essential nature ; in every in
stance I have found it nearly pure uric acid.       The uric acid of
the alligator contains a large proportion of carbonate and phos
phate of lime.     Two specimens of this urine from different alli
gators agreed  in this circumstance ; they differed, however, in one
having  no odour,   and  the other a strong one of musk ; the for
mer was from a very young, the other was from an older animal.
3.    Of the   urinary Organs andUrine     of the Turtle and Tortoise.
   The kidneys of the testudo mydas and geometrica, the only
species I have hitherto examined, resemble those of the preced
ing animals in their lobulated structure.    The proportional size
of the kidney of snakes is greatest; that of lizards next; and that
of the animals we are now considering, least.
    In the bladder both of the turtle and tortoise I have found
flakes of pure uric acid, but in no great abundance: it was in a
transparent watery fluid, containing a little mucus and common
salt, but no urea or any other substance that I could detect in
the small quantity on which I operated.
   It is curious to observe the links by which animals, in appear
ance totally dissimilar, are connected together. That there should
be so close an analogy between the urinary organs and secretion
of the serpent, lizard, and testudo, is not surprising, their or
ganic structure and their habits and oeconomy being so similar;
but that an analogy should exist between animals so very different
in general appearance as birds and amphibia, is not a little sin
gular, yet it is true : the urinary organs of one class, as well as
the lungs, prima; viae and genital organs, resemble those of the
other, and both are peculiar in secreting uric acid ; those living
entirely on animal food secreting it pure.
LVIf.     On the Earthquake felt in Sicily in February 1818.
     Extracted from a historical and physical Memoir by Dr.
     Agatino Longo, Prof essor of Experimental Philosophy in the
     University of Catania.
This    memoir is divided into two parts: in the first, which is
purely historical, we find the detail of the facts which preceded
or immediately followed the earthquake of the 20th of February.
In the second, the author attempts to explain the various phas-
nomena observed, and proposes some reflections which this me
morable event suggested to him.
   He begins with some account of the earthquake which took
place in Sicily the 1 1th of January 1693, one of the most terrible
ever experienced in that country ; the city of Catania was totally
destroyed by    it,
                  18,000 inhabitants perished under the ruins, and
                                                               several

                          in February 1818.                     333
several towns and villages of the valley of Noto experienced the
same fate.     Severe shocks were felt at Palermo the 1st of Sep
tember 1726; and the earthquake which took place in Calabria
on the 5th of February 1783 partly destroyed Messina, and spread
terror at Catania and the towns and villages situated in that di
rection. Since that time other shocks, more or less violent, have
taken place in Sicily, but have done no great injury to the build
ings, not even to those of Catania, though that town, by its proxi
mity to Mount Etna, is most exposed to accidents of this kind.
In 1810 a pretty severe shock was felt, accompanied by an un-
dulatory motion, which lasted about half a minute ; to the west
of Catania was seen a flash resembling lightning : the shock was
repeated the following day, but without any damage : another
slight shock was felt in the night of the 18th of October 1817.
But on the 20th of February 1818, at ten minutes past one o'clock,
Italian time, the sky heing serene, the moon shining bright, the
air calm and temperate, not only the city of Catania, but the
whole region which surrounds Etna experienced a most violent
convulsion, which occasioned great devastation in the towns and
villages of that country, and extended to almost all Sicily, to
Calabria, and even to Malta, but diminishing in intensity in pro
portion to the distance from the principal focus.
    Some signs had preceded this formidable phaenomenon.          On
the morning of that day the sea appeared calm ; but from the
erTectof an invisible current, it dashed violently against the shores
and shoals.     The fishermen felt themselves as if repelled by an
unseen force when they attempted to approach the rocks partly
covered by the water, which latter appeared to them to be sensi
bly warm.      In the afternoon the waters of the Darsena were ex
 tremely  low,  and yet the waves approached from time to time
with such violence, that passing the mole and the wall which rises
above     it,
            they broke on the opposite side as in a tempest.       In
lofty houses the bells rang of their own accord, and bodies freely
suspended began to oscillate.
    Ten days before, an abundant rain had fallen, which continued
during several days, without being accompanied        by   thunder or
lightning; and the sea,      which  had  been  previously much agi
 tated, had become perfectly calm.      Etna had been tranquil ever
 since the month of October 1811; in the preceding years there
 was an excessive drought.
    Towards sunset, flames were observed in various parts, running
 along the ancient lavas, and some subterraneous noises were
 heard;  in several places inflamed vapours were seen to issue from
 the ground, and some persons said they had beheld vivid light
 ning upon the mountain while others believed that they saw the
                         ;
 lightning, which is  the precursor of the earthquake, pass rapidly
                                                                 over

 334                  On the Earthquake        felt in Sicily
 over the heads of the inhabitants of Nicolosi.              At Catania, how
 ever, and in the environs, the inhabitants were perfectly easy and
  secure.
     The hour at which the disaster occurred rendered it less fatal
 than if it had happened in the middle of the night.                  All the po
 pulation was then awake and dispersed, except in a village of
 Etna, were the people were at church, as usual on Fridays during
 Lent.
     In Catania, large       masses of stones fell from the tops of build
 ings   and  beat   in  their  roofs, but without killing or even severely
 wounding any person.            Some of the inhabitants were affected by
 the fright, and one lady of advanced age died the same day in an
 apoplectic fit caused by terror.           A large mass of lava, forming a
 natural vault above a rock, tumbled into the sea : a fisherman
 had happily moved from the spot a few moments before, impelled,
 as reported, by a secret instinct, to doubt of the solidity of the
 lava.
     The hour when the shock happened cannot be fixed with pre
 cision ; nor is the height of the thermometer or barometer known,
 or.the quantity of rain which had fallen in the preceding days,
 there being no meteorological or astronomical observatory at
 Catania. It may however be taken for granted that the shock
 took place from the east to the west, or rather from SE. to NW.
 Opinions arfe also at issue respecting the total duration of the
 phaenomenon : some limit it to ten seconds, others make it forty
seconds.       The author, taking a mean between these extremes,
supposes it may have been from 20 to 25 seconds.
     It is thought that the motion began by shocks (susmlto sou-
 Iresaitlls), which changed into undulations that succeeded each
other very rapidly; this was judged to be the case, from observing
that cisterns fall to the brim partly emptied themselves by the
effects of the oscillations. Some statues appearing after the earth
quake to be turned into a rather different direction from what
they were before, it was inferred that the motion was complex
and vortical*.          A considerable mass of Syracusan stone was
turned about 25 degrees from the east towards the south.                     The
colossal statue      of an angel placed on the faQade of a church, lost
both arms, as if they had been lopped off with an axe, whence it
was supposed that a large portion of electric fluid had been dis
engaged from the earth jduring the convulsion.                 This conjecture
is confirmed by other circumstances, such as the bending of iron
    * It is
            very difficult to admit this direction in the motion ; for there must
have resulted a nearly circular disruption in that portion of the ground,
•which would thus have turned on a vortical axis ; and such a disruption
must have left evident traces.
                                                                          crosses

                            in February 1818.         •              335
crosses at the tops of the churches: many persons saw also at
the period of the shock a flash of lightning, and other long streaks
of flame, which descended into the sea.          The inhabitants of the
villages about Catania thought they saw        the city surrounded with
flames. Two very distinct shocks were felt very near together, the
first only vertical, the second vertical and vortical : the latter was
the most violent; it opened the doors and windows of the houses,
and the ground seemed as if it was several times moved from its
level; and it is certain that several walls opened vertically, and
that the light of the moon entered the room through these open
ings, which, however, immediately closed, so as to leave but a
scarcely visible trace of the rupture.
    It mav be easily imagined that the populous city of Catania
was in consternation.        Scarcely had the shocks ceased when all
the bells were set a-ringing; from the ridiculous idea, as the au
thor confesses in a note, that this would prevent the return of
the earthquake.       If the city of Catania had the good fortune to-
escape severe injury, it was not so with other places. Mascalucia
was half overthrown,       and seven persons perished.          Nicolosi,
Trecastagne, Viagrande,        suffered considerably.    At Aci-Catena,
the churches were cast down, and many other buildings injured; a
convent of Monks was destroyed, and some of the Monks were
buried in the ruins.      At Zafarana, a village forty-eight miles di
stant, the roof of the church fell in and crushed thirty persons.
At Catania itself, the following buildings received much injury;
the house of the Minorites, the cupola of the church, the con
vents of the Crociferi, the Agostiniani, the Franciscans, and of
St. Agatha, the hospitals of St. Mark and of St. Martha, the Uni
versity, the Benedictine monastery, the Seminary, and many
private houses.
    In the night of the following day, (21st of February,) another
but slighter shock occurred ; and two other very violent ones,
and of considerable duration, on the 2Sth, which did great injury
in the Valle di Noto.      We shall not follow the author in his mi
nute account of all the damaged edifices, but merely observe,
that in some places enormous masses of ancient lava were rent
asunder, from which there issued, at the moment, a slight flame.
    A rise was observed in the waters about Aci-Catena, and in
the salt waters near Paterno.        In some places, a salt, clayey, and
sulphureous water was observed to issue from the ancient lava ;
and the water in some wells became turbid a few days before the
earthquake, which is a prognostic mentioned by Pliny. At a place
called Paraspolo, five or six minutes before the shock there sud
 denly issued from the ground, with great noise, fourteen large jets
of salt water, which rose to the height of six palms, embraced a
                                                                   space

space of about twenty canne *, and lasted about twenty minutes.
 The openings by which this water issued, were still so. hot, two
days after, that one could not put the hand in without pain. The
plants about some withered, and about others continued to vege
tate; which affords reason to suppose that they did not all emit
salt water.     Near this place there was a loud detonation like
thunder, and fragments of mortar and bricks were found detached
from the walls, and scattered in various directions, which the
author attributes to a sudden inflammation of gas below the
building to which they belonged.      It is said that the river Simeto
ceased to flow at the moment of the shock, and afterwards sud
denly resumed its course.     The sea showed only a trifling undu
lation ; but a bark, which was at anchor not far from the shore,
grounded three times.
   A short time after the shock the air became thick, and the
sky was covered with clouds, which in a few hours dispersed, and
the moon again shone.         No electric meteors were perceived
either before, during, or after the earthquake ; whence the au
thor infers that those philosophers are mistaken who ascribe earth
quakes to subterraneous electrical explosions, and make them
depend exclusively on a rupture of the electrical equilibrium.
    It is almost superfluous to say, that the animals were the first
to announce the approach of the earthquake : many persons also
experienced extraordinary sensations before it commenced, —
some vertigo,some a particular sensation of heat in the legs, others
a kind of stupor ; effects which principally depended on the
greater or less degree of irritability of the nervous system of the
persons who experienced them.
   The author then proceeds to explain the phaenomenon, which
he seems to be convinced was caused by gases disengaged by the
fermentation experienced in the interior of the earth by divers
substances impregnated with certain fluids.       None of his theories
are new, and it is surprising that he has been guilty of two im
portant omissions; the first, that he passes too lightly over the
possible and probable influence of volcanoes upon earthquakes.
"                       "
   Nobody," he says, can think that Etna was the cause of the
late event." The other omission is that of the system which
ascribes these shocks to the most ineoercible force that nature
affords, that of water suddenly converted by fire into steam. The
well known effects applied to mechanics, tend to a more natural
explanation than any of those proposed by the author. — The
number of persons killed or wounded on this occasion was 169.

 The       number of lives annually lost through shipwreck cannot be
  ascertained; but it is well known to amount to several thousands.
     Dr. Wilkinson about the year 1763 (taking the average of six
 years) calculated that 4200 British seamen are lost annually;
  and states that in twenty-seven days only, in the month of De
 cember of that year, the excessive number of 1430 were drowned.
 Another gentleman has stated that in the years 17S1 and 1782
 the numbers lost were upwards of 10,000!
     Very recently an author stated the number lost during the pe
 riod of his present Majesty's reign to amount to 160,000 !
     " Most important to Great Britain in a national view, is the
 preservation of shipwrecked mariners.         The exigencies of our
 country demand a peculiar attention to the soldier and the sailor."
 — Rev. Dr. Gregory.
     "  When we consider that scarcely a year elapses unmarked
 with unhappy events of this kind, by which multitudes of mari
 ners (and others) are precipitated into the same untimely awful
 grave; surely a means of diminishing those misfortunes can need
 no patronage in England, or any other maritime nation."— Dr.

                 accomplishment of this desirable purpose, an en

     " The only certain means of saving the crew of a vessel stranded
 within 200 or 300 fathoms of the shore, is to establish a rope
 communication — but how is this to be done?" — Cleghorn's Essay.
     "  A communication by a rope but once achieved, it is easy to
 send on board by it to the vessel, any thing else that might faci

     " Resolved, That in case of shipwreck, the grand object is to
 form a communication with the shore; and it appears to this
 Committee, that the most probable means of effecting this ob

 nearest land." — Royal Humane Society.
     f' Lieutenant Bell's idea was to project the rope from the
 ship to the shore, which is assuredly the method most to be de

      My residence being near to the shores of Mount's Bay, I have
 had opportunities of witnessing many melancholy shipwrecks;
 among others, that of H.M.S. Anson, when about 100 of her
 officers and men were drowned. The annihilation of this fine ship,
with    so many    of my fellow-creatures, deeply impressed my mind;
 and freshened in my memory the premature destruction of about
:fifty fine fellows at the wreck of the Jane-and-Rebecca transport,
only a few weeks preceding, and also near the same spot. These
 melancholy disasters led me into a train of reflection and reason
 ing, and I was very soon possessed by the idea of devising means
 for preserving lives from shipwreck.          From that period have I
 been pursuing my object ; and, happy for mankind, I have been
 made the honoured instrument in the hand of Providence, in de
 vising such means as possess every probable efficacy to accom-

—and which, from inspection and experiments made, have ob

     Sir, — In   reference   to your communications    dated on the 6th
  and 25th ultimo, I have the honour       to  acquaint you for the Ho
  nourable Board's information, that the Committee of Colonels
  and Field Officers above named, in conjunction with Rear -Ad
  miral Sir Charles Rowley and Captains Gower and Ross of the
  Royal Navy, assembled on the 28th ultimo? for the purpose of
  inspecting an apparatus invented by Mr. Trengrouse, for pre
  serving lives and property in cases of shipwreck, by means of a
  rocket; when Mr. Trengrouse exhibited his apparatus, and made
  the following experiment.
      1st. A small rocket of eight ounces, with a line attached to its
   stick, was fired from a musket to the distance of 180 yards.
      2d. A pound rocket was fired in the same manner, which ranged
  450 yards ; the line broke at 150 yards, owing to a knot in it.
      3d. A pound rocket was fired from a wooden frame at an ele
                                             "
  vation of 50°, and ranged 212 yards.
      The line used with the above three rounds was a mackerel line.
                                                                       4th.

                   Loss  of Lives   through Shipwreck.                     339
     4th. A four-ounce rocket was then fired from the musket to
the distance of 112 yards, with a line called a mackerel snood.
     I have the honour to report that the Committee are of opinion,
that Mr. Trengrouse's appears to them to be the best mode of
gaining a communication with the shore, for the purpose of saving
lives from shipwreck, that has been suggested ; as well as to com
municate between ships in heavy gales of wind ; and that the ex
periment they have witnessed has fully succeeded.
                           I have the honour to be, &c. &c.

      &c. &e.                     Colonel and Lieut.-general Commandant."
     After having received the foregoing report, I was officially made
acquainted that a further Committeeof Naval and ArtilleryOffieers
was about to be convened at Woolwich, for more particularly in
vestigating      my invention, and to witness a new experiment.             Sir
Wm.Congreve         was  not  present  at the former  ; and,   as he so con
                                                                     is
versant with the nature of rockets, probably this second experi
 ment might have been chiefly for him to have the opportunity of
judging on the utility of my plan. While making my experiment,
 the wind was blowing a gale, and I projected two lines, by the
use of only eight-ounce rockets, to the distance of 215 yards —
exceeding my former experiment (with the same size rocket) by
30 or 40 yards.
     A deep sea-line was also projected by one of my larger rockets,
  107 yards, which was a highly satisfactory experiment to all the
spectators, and far exceeded my own most sanguine expectations,
as I never before attempted an experiment with a line near so
 large, it being sufficiently strong to haul six men through the wa
 ter at a time.       But to prove the power of larger and stronger
rockets than those I used, Sir Wm. Congreve was pleased to make
the following experiment.

     Mr. Trengrouse       afterwards produced his apparatus for con

 with an arrow, the stem of which being about nine inches long, penetrated
the ground on falling, to some depth. Therefore, in case a vessel should

 aid, by such rocket acting as a grapnel, (when falling on earth, or other pe
netrable substance,) the crew might materially assist themselves to climb       .

    Sir, — I   have received your letter of the 8th of         May, and the
several papers since placed in my hands, on the subject of your
invention for preserving lives and property in cases of shipwreck;
and having laid the same before the Committee of this Society,
they have considered them with great attention, as also the ap
paratus sent for their inspection ; and I have the pleasure to make
known to you, that the Committee do highly approve of your in
vention, as possessing all the merit which is ascribed to it by the
respectable gentlemen of Falmouth, in their certificate, and alike
creditable to your ingenuity and humanity; and the Committee
will avail themselves of every opportunity of recommending the
adoption of it on board of merchant vessels.
                    I am, sir, your respectful and obedient servant,
Mr. Henry Trengrause.                    (Signed)      S. Cock, Secretary."
Report of the Committee           of the Elder Brethren, to whom was
    referred    the  Invention   of Mr. H. Trengrouse, for saving Sea
    men from shipwrecked Vessels.
    " The several letters, certificates, reports, and observations on
 Mr. Trengrouse's invention for saving seamen from shipwrecked
vessels being read, the Committee took into consideration                   the
utility    of the  apparatus,   and   believe   it to afford  a very probable
 means of saving lives from vessels driven on. shore or stranded,
 in situations where being within reach of communication with the
shore, its adoption would be practicable on board the unfortunate
 vessel that may be wrecked; and from the material of commu
 nication being carried within the vessel itself, they think it highly
 preferable to any other mode yet proposed, as it thus must be al
 ways at hand, ready to be applied the moment when wanted;
 and the projected instrument would be easily and certainly dis
 coverable, even at night, by persons on shore, so as to establish
the wished-for communication of an hawser; and the cost of the
 whole being but trivial, the Brethren do therefore recommend
 that all vessels be furnished and provided with the apparatus of
 the rocket and other articles exhibited.

 The following is copied from a Morning Paper, and is the report
     of a gentleman who witnessed the experiment, — an utter
     stranger to me, and whom I never saw before then ; conse
     quently he could have been only influenced by the merits of
     the apparatus.
     " There are tio calamities that have befallen human beings,

  Englishmen's minds to ponder whether remedies against them
  could not be provided ; and hence may we trace the numberless

eminent amongst nations for its regard to every thing that con
cerns humanity.      As islanders, and as adventurous islanders, we
are compelled to resort to the ocean as affording the means of
sustaining iour greatness; and that spirit of adventure has of
course exposed our countrymen to divers and most afflicting
dangers. Often within gunshot of our own shores, have hundreds
upon hundreds of our brave countrymen perished ; and not be
cause they wanted courage to buffet the waves, but because they
had not any means to make use of on which they could rely to
secure their deliverance. — Various individuals have at different
times suggested measures for the rescue of persons exposed to
destruction in consequence of shipwieck ; and amongst the rest,
Captain Manby has been the most conspicuous. He devised me
thods for opening communications between the shore and the
vessel. This, of course, might accomplish much ; but it will be
readily conceived to how much uncertainty it exposed the crew.
The vessel might be in danger where there was no " station,"
as wind and tide wait for no man — so it still remained to invent
means of communicating with the shore from the ship.              To ef
fect this is to accomplish every thing ; for if a distressed vessel have
an established communication with the shore, by which means
the persons on board can be forwarded to land, the means of
safety are at hand.     This desideratum, an earnest and humanely-
disposed individual, named Henry Trengrouse, of Helston, con
siders himself to have supplied ; and we must own that he has
accomplished much more than we deemed possible to effect by
such simple means.
   "  Yesterday his experiments were tried on the Serpentine River
in Hyde Park, from the Royal Humane Society's Station, in pre
sence of the Duke of Sussex, many members of that laudable In
stitution, and .Mr. Pettigrew, its secretary. The experiments
greatly surpassed expectation ; and the select party present ex
pressed their unqualified; approbation of the leading principle of
the invention.      The first object of the invention is to establish
a communication with the shore from the ship — (the opposite of
what has yet been effected,) and this is done by firing off a rocket
placed at the top of a gun, carrying at its tail a line from the
ship.    This was effected across the Serpentine, 140 or 150 yards
wide, by means of a common musket.             A strong line was then
drawn over by persons on the opposite shore, and by it a hawser
 —previously to the hawser being dragged ashore, a person sup
plied with a convenient cork jacket (or " sailors's life-spencer")
was hauled over with the greatest ease and convenience ; and so
useful was the jacket, that two other persons might proceed by
clinging to it. The hawser having been fixed to the shore, a
species of swing chair, with admirable invented pulleys and rollers
                                                                       at

might be forwarded to the shore in this seat with the greatest
safety; and after the crew had been secured, property might be
taken care of.    The persons present expressed their admiration
of the principle of the invention     and some able sea-faring men
                                         ;
amongst the company were pleased with the cork jacket, and
greatly delighted with the new roller, which prevents the friction
or entangling of the rope.
     "The experiment would have been complete, had the rope
that was conveyed across the Serpentine River been made more
taught, and      the rocket which carried
                  if                          across, and was fired

might not occur again, and had nothing to do with the inven

be thrown from the ship on shore, and the whole apparatus being
confined in a small compass, can be ready in every vessel for im

344               A Letter    to the Farmers and
ble publicity, or if I neglected to use my best endeavours to place
them in that clear point of view which should enable you fully to
understand and appreciate them.
    The expediency of manuring arable and pasture lands with
salt, dnd of administering the same active and wholesome sub
stance to your horses, sheep, and cattle, as a condiment for their
 food, and as an efficacious means of preserving them in health
and vigour, will form the principal objects which I am anxious to
point out for your consideration and future practice.
    After a candid and unprejudiced perusal of this letter, you will,
I trust, carefully examine the body of evidence which will be ad
duced in the Appendix, and then make such experiments upon
your own estates, and with your own cattle, as are most likely to
determine and convince you how far such a course of proceeding
may be applicable in your own management.
   The ever-memorable Sully, who was one of the greatest men
France ever produced, used to say that it ought to be the first
maxim of a good government to advance agriculture before ma
nufactures, and to give to the latter only a secondary rank in the
state — whereas, Colbert, who was also a great minister, assigned
to manufactures the first place in the ceconomical order of his ad
ministration, and gave the utmost encouragement to the arts,
from a persuasion that their prosperity would furnish the only
means of working up the raw materials which his country pro
duced.     It is probable, however, that this eminent statesman
would not have protected the arts at the expense of agriculture,
if he had considered that the principal utility of manufactures in
any country arises from the price which they afford to, and the
market which they procure for, the products of the soil.
    The immortal Sully, in vindication of the opinion which I have
just quoted, used to say that he had ever preferred the products
of the soil, which could not easily be ravished from him, to those
foreign conquests which occupy the attention of most govern
ments, but which always excite resentment and jealousy.
                                                                  "A
large, and an increasing produce of the land," said he,
                                                            " ensures
 the liberty of the people, while it places foreigners in a sort of
 dependence ; whereas the want of corn, the first necessary of life,
gives a dependence upon foreigners, who can either furnish the
 commodity, or refuse it. The produce of the land," continues
 he, " cannot be consumed by strangers but to the profit of the
 inhabitants, that is,   by
                          atraffic more advantageous than the pos
 session of the corn itself — whereas the arts and manufactures
 may possibly be carried off by the artifices of rivals, and pass
 away, together with the artists themselves, into all the countries
 of the world."
  If   these latter sentiments are founded in truth and justice, and
                                                          I   believe

                      Graziers of Great Britain.                        345
I believe they are, then every improvement in the agriculture or
rural ceconomy of these kingdoms may be considered to be an
important national acquisition, and I shall be excused in not of
fering any apology for endeavouring to call your attention to a
practice which is little known in our country, but which in some
foreign states has invariably been attended with decided advan
tages as well as profit.
    The value of common salt for agricultural purposes has been
long known in Germany, in Poland, in Holland, in Flanders, and
in all the provinces of the United States of America; it is there
fore much to be lamented that the existing duties should so long
have deprived the people of this country of the various benefits
which they might have derived from this valuable native pro
duction*.      The mineral substance of which we are speaking is
found in this island in the greatest abundance; yet, by a mistaken
policy, we have hitherto given it to strangers, and have allowed
many thousands of acres of our own lands, which, by the free use
of salt, might have been rendered highly fertile and profitable,
to remain nearly sterile, or at least in a state in which they will
barely pay for the expense of their cultivation.
    However, since the government has so far relaxed as to remit
a great part of the duty on such rock-salt as shall forthwith be
consumed in agriculture, or in feeding cattle, and as so much de
pends upon the manner in which this valuable boon is received
by the country, it is desirable that the greatest extent of publi
city should be given to the act of parliament; and that no agri
culturist, not even the most humble gardener, should remain ig
norant of the terms and conditions upon which he may now ob
tain so rich and useful a commodity as rock-salt.
   Penetrated with the importance of the subject, and contem
plating the variety of advantages which the landed interest must
derive from the accomplishment of the measure, the act had no
sooner passed than I determined to lay all the particulars before
the public, in the hope that these concessions of the legislature,
together wifh the evidence which I should be enabled to offer in
proof of the advantages to be derived from the use of salt, would
be amply sufficient to induce a large majority of the farmers of
Great Britain to acquire such a knowledge of the new regulations
as would enable them, without delay, to avail themselves of all
the benefits which the government has thus offered for their ac
ceptance.
    Having no private     ends to answer, and expecting to derive no
personal   advantage whatever from the general adoption of this
   * The value of common salt as a manure was known some hundred years
ago by certain individuals in this country, but the high duties and other im
pediments have prevented its use becoming general.
                                                                   measure,

  346               A   Letter to the Farmers and
  measure, I shall proceed to give you a simple outline of the ge
  neral view which I have taken of the subject.      It may, however,
  be necessary to premise, that mv opinions thereon have been
  formed in consequence of a careful investigation of a great num
 ber of well-attested experiments, and from the perusal of that
 body of evidence which was delivered in the year 1817 before the
  Lords of His Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council, at the
  Board of Trade ; and again in the spring of the following year,
  before a select committee of the House of Commons ; which
  committee was occupied from dav to day, from the sixteenth of
  March to the fifteenth dav of May, in questioning the witnesses,
  and in recording their respective testimonies upon this most im
 portant proposition.
     From an attentive examination of all these documents, and
 from a dispassionate consideration of every thing which I have
 been able to collect upon this great object, I am decidedly of
 opinion that rock-salt, at the reduced duty of five pounds per
 ton, is by far the cheapest, the most efficacious, and the most
 convenient manure for arable and pasture land, that can possibly
 be obtained.
     More than one hundred and fifty years ago, Sir Hugh Piatt,
 an eminent writer of that day, speaks very decidedly of the be
 nefits which might be derived from the practice of sprinkling
 common salt upon land, and calls it the sweetest, the cheapest,
 and the most philosophical marie of all others.        He relates the
 case of a man, who, in passing over a creek on the sea-shore,
 suffered his sack of seed-corn to fall into the water, and that it
 lay there until it was low tide, when, being unable to buy more
 seed, he sowed that which had lain in the salt-water ; and when
 the harvest time arrived he reaped a crop far superior to any in
 the neighbourhood.      The writer, however, adds, that it was sup
 posed   the corn would  not fructify in that manner unless it actually
 fell into the sea by chance ; and therefore, neither this man nor
 any of his neighbours ever ventured to make any further use of
salt-water.
     The same curious author tells us also of " a man who sowed
 a bushel of salt, long since, upon a small plot of barren ground
on Clapham Common, and that to that day (the time when he
was writing) it remained more fresh and green than any of the
ground round about it."
    The eminent Dr. Brownrigg, who wrote in the year 174S, in
speaking of common salt, says " it is dispersed over all nature ;
it is treasured up in the bowels of the earth ; it impregnates the
ocean; it descends in rains; it fertilizes the soil; it arises in
vegetables ; and from them is conveyed into animals ; so that
it may well be esteemed the universal condiment of nature;

friendly and beneficent to all creatures endowed with life, whether
it be vegetative or animal."
    In some parts of Great Britain, particularly in the neighbour
hood of the salt works, the value of common salt, as a manure,
is well known and acknowledged ; and it has lately been given in
evidence before the select committee of the House of Commons,
by a gentleman of the highest credit, that the farmers in Corn
wall are so convinced of the value of salt as a manure*, that
whenever the waste salt that has been employed in curing fish is
on sale, there is a violent contention among the occupiers of the
land, who shall obtain the largest share. The same gentleman
informed the committee, that where wheat or barley has followed
turnips, on land which had been salted, the ensuing crop has in
variably escaped the mildew, although that disease had affected
all the corn upon the lands immediately adjoining, on which salt
had not been used.
    The efficacy of salt in destroying noxious weeds, grubs, worms,
flies, and insects, is well known in many districts, and those who
are incredulous may very easily satisfy themselves by direct ex
periment.      For instance, if a few common earth worms be taken
out of the ground, and sprinkled with a little salt, they will be
seen to writhe about for a few minutes, and then expire.       Thus
salt does, as it were, perform two operations at once; for, by de
stroying the worms and the weeds, while the land lie.s fallow, it
prepares the ground most effectually for the reception of the corn
or the plants, before it can possibly take any effect upon the crop
itself.  And besides this peculiar advantage, the extreme luxu
riance and verdure which common salt gives to grass lands, when
properly applied, would be so satisfactory to such farmers who
would make use of      it,and so convincing to all the neighbouring
agriculturists  of every description, that   only one or two gentle
                                              if
men in each district were to employ         it  few instances,
                                                 in   a          am   I
certain this mode of top-dressing      fwould very soon engage the
attention of every person in the empire, who had even but       gar  a
den to manage and cultivate.
                                                                       From
   * There is  nlsoa  practice in Cornwall of manuring the lands with sea-
sand for the sake of the salt thatit  contains and so very efficacious
                                             ;                         is this
found to be, that a  writer, ninety years ago, computed the money laid out
in that and the adjoining county for sea-sand to amount to thirty-two thou
sand pounds per annum and so much has this practice increased of late
years, that Dr. Paris considers " the expense of land-carriage for sand used
                         ;
asa  manure in Cornwall alone'as now amounting at least to thirty thousand
pounds annually."
  + 1 think it necessary to remark, that where salt    used as
                                                      is       a top-dressing
for grass land, the quantity employed ought to be much less than     is  com
monly used for ground that   is to be afterwards ploughed fora crop of grain.
Six bushels, or three hundred and thirty-six pounds of rock-salt, ground
                                                                          very

 348                      A  heller    to the   Farmers and
      From the evidence which has already been collected upon this
  subject, it is obvious that a great portion of the land in this king
  dom might, by the proper use of salt, be made to produce nearly
  double the amount of the present crops of grass as well as corn.
  How greatly this would serve the manufacturing, and indeed all
  other interests of the country, I need not attempt to explain to
  you. Moreover, by forcing the land with a sufficient portion of salt,
  our crops would be brought to maturity much sooner than they
. now are*; a matter of considerable              importance in the northern
  parts of this island, where much of the corn is frequently spoiled
  by the autumnal rains before it can be sufficiently dried by the
  sun and wind to stack with safety. And in the hay harvest, should
  the farmer be induced, from the uncertainty of the weather, to
  carry his hay too soon, a small quantity of salt sprinkled upon
  each layer of the rick will prevent the hay from becoming mow-
  burned, as it is called ; and when hay whicfi has been thus treated
  is presented to horses and cattle, it will be preferred by them to
  that which has been put together in a more favourable season,
  and not treated with salt.
      The cleanliness of rock-salt as a manure is likewise another
  considerable advantage.            In many cases this circumstance will
  be found to be very important, particularly in the grazing di
  stricts.     It has repeatedly been observed, that if land be ma
  nured with dung after the hay has been carried off, the neat
„ cattle will refuse to eat the eddish which grows upon such land.
  On the contrary, if a field be dressed with about two bushels of
  fme salt instead of dung, soon after the hay is cut, this inconve
   nience and loss will be avoided, and a large crop of aftergrass
   will be obtained, possessing such peculiar sweetness, that all kinds
  of cattle, as well as horses, will eat it with the utmost avidity.
      The farmers, in some districts, are accustomed to steep thtir
   seed-corn in lime-water, and doubtless the practice is often use
   ful ; but I am decidedly of opinion that a strong brine, made by
   the solution of rock-salt in water, will be infinitely more effica
   cious.      Crops of wheat are often reduced one-half in value by
   a disease to which this kind of grain is very liable, called the
   very fine, and regularly sown upon the grass, would be a proper quantity for
   an acre of pasture-land: whereas sixteen or twenty bushels may be used
   upon fallows for cleaning the ground preparatory to the putting in the grain.
   For meadow-land, two or three bushels of crushed rock-salt may be care
   fully sown upon each acre, immediately after the hay is got in, with great
    advantage, especially in hot and dry summers.
       * The late Dr. Darwin, in treating on salt as a manure, remarks, " that
    as it is a stimulus which excites the vegetable absorbent vessels            into
    greater action than usual, it may, in a certain quantity, increase their growth,
    by enabling them to take up more nourishment in a given time, and perform
    their circulations and secretions with greater energy."
                                                                               smut

                       Graziers of Great Britain.                       349
smut or rusl M; but when the seed has been properly prepared
with salt, this misfortune can never happen.              It has also been
proved by some public-spirited individuals,           who   have made the
necessary experiments, that the scab is never found upon potatoes
which have grown upon land that has had a proper dressing of
common salt.
    In many parts of Flanders, but more particularly at Lisle, it is
the practice to preserve the urine of those cattle that eat com
mon salt with their food.        This is preserved in appropriate re
servoirs ; and when the farmers apply it to a certain description
of land, which experience has taught them to select, the effect,
even without any other manure, is not only advantageous, but it
is truly astonishing.
    Enough, I presume, has now been offered to induce you to
expect a satisfactory result from the application of salt to your
fields and meadows; I shall, therefore, at present content myself
with informing you, that in the Appendix you will fmd a list of
the names of the gentlemen who have borne testimony to the
efficacy of salt as a manure, and likewise the evidence of a gen
tleman who has used common salt upon his own farm for many
years, and has witnessed the use of brine upon the lands in his
neighbourhood for forty years, with the greatest advantage; and
who came from a distant county on purpose to attend the select
committee of the House of Commons, to report to them the sub
stance of his experience for that very long period.          You will also
find there the proposals of the Board of Agriculture in London,
and of the Highland Society of Scotland, both of which institu
tions are fully aware of the value of rock-salt in the cultivation
of land ; for they have offered rewards to such persons as shall
give them an account of the best experiments with this valuable
mineral substance, in the different branches of farming, and ge
neral agriculture.
    We proceed now to the second part of our subject, which re
lates to the application of salt in feeding sheep and horses, and
for assisting in fattening live stock. Here, however, I shall merely
enumerate the several advantages which appear to have resulted
from the practice, and shall then place my chief reliance on the
effect which may be produced by your perusal of the several do
cuments which are contained in the Appendix.
    To ascertain the exact quantity of salt which may be neces
sary for the different kinds of land, and to appreciate the bene-
   *  I am desirou3 of recommending to my readers' perusal a very valuable
paper, which has lately been distributed gratis by the Board of Agriculture,
written by the Right Honourable Sir John Sinclair, bart. " On the means of
preventing the rust in wheat by the use of salt," an object well entitled to
be ascertained by decisive experiments.
                                                                         fits

350                   A        Letter      to the   Farmers and
fits which result from its employment in all the various modes of
culture that are adopted in this country, will require several long
series of experiments, especially as some of the evidence given
before the committee of the House of Commons was unsatisfac
tory and contradictory; but the advantages which have arisen
from giving salt to sheep and cattle are so determinate and self-
evident, that there appears to me to be nothing to prevent every
farmer from immediately adopting the practice.
    The most undeniable evidence has been afforded, that com
mon salt uniformly promotes digestion in horses and cattle, and
that this occasions them to make a rapid progress in fattening.
It has also been found, that in feeding with chaff or cut straw, a
larger quantity of this cheap and ordinary food can be given when
sprinkled with salt than can be administered in any other way ;
and that as the filling the stomachs of cattle while fattening is a
circumstance of the greatest importance, a very large portion of
chaff, if seasoned with salt, may be given with the utmost ad
vantage to the growth and health of the animals.       Thus, every
experimental grazier knows that an abundance of yery ordinary
food, if eaten with relish, will fatten cattle much sooner when
given with a small allowance of substantial provender, than better
food alone in a moderate quantity.    There     indeed, hardly anyis,
food that can be offered to cattle, which,    mixed with salt, will
                                                              if
not be eaten with eagerness. Hence, nothing can be of more
importance to a practical grazier than to know how to obtain
this valuable saline mineral substance, at    cheap rate, and with
                                                              a
little difficulty.
  It   was given     in   evidence last year, before the select committee
of the House of Commons, that in feeding cattle, fourteen pounds
of chaff, such as        produced in winnowing corn, and which of
                          is
itself is  of little or no value, will, when properly moistened and
heated       steam, and mixed with two ounces of salt, save forty-
            by
two pounds of turnips.        Surely this     most important circum
                                                     Is is
                                                        a
stance in the ceconomy of          farm.   a    possible that this fact
                                                             it
should pass unnoticed              in by
                               any agriculturist                  ?
  A    friend of mine,         the year 1812, travelled through the
 United States of America, from the state of Massachuset to the
 River Mississippi. He observed that             was usual, throughout
                                                             it
that extensive district, to put salt within all the stacks of hay,
and likewise to sprinkle        among the hay, in the proportion of
                                     it
about fourteen pounds of salt to one ton of hay.         He says   was      it
also  a common practice in that country to give salt to sheep and
cattle, and that he has frequently seen cattle follow   boy a mile      a
or more, who held      portion of salt in his hand, tempting the
                               a
animals      by
             showing     to them.
                               it   The same individual assures
me also, that since his return to England he has adopted the
                                                                             same

                             Graziers      of Great Britain.                 351
same practice, mixing salt with his own stacks of hay, and with
the mashes to his horses, and constantly with the same benefit.
   That horses, sheep, and cattle, would derive benefit from salt,
might, indeed, be imagined from observing the great desire they
discover for       it,
                   and which manifests itself in every country where
this mineral substance lies within their reach. This            is certainly
the case, and in the Appendix many undeniable examples will
be given to support the opinion.        Several most curious facts, that
were stated        byvery respectable member of the House of Com
                         a
mons, to prove the salubrious effects of salt upon these animals,
may also be seen in the Appendix.
     Itcannot then be doubted that salt, when judiciously admi
nistered to live stock, assists their digestion, preserves them from
disease, and improves their condition          and from the evidence to
                                                  ;
be hereafter adduced,        will appear that the milk and butter pro

abundant, and never acquires that turnip-flavour which                gene
rally so predominant in the milk and butter from those cows
which are kept upon turnips without salt.                has likewise been
                                                          It

                                      is     cure for  the  botts in horses,

materially improved of such sheep as are fed with salt.
     It   impossible,
          is             conceive, to read the great body of evidence
                             I
which was delivered to the Honourable the Board of Trade, and
to the committee of the House of Commons, without being con
vinced that the benefits resulting to the grazier and agriculturist,
from the employment of salt, must be great and important; espe
cially the evidence of John Christian Curwen, esq. the represen
tative in parliament for the city of Carlisle, who             is himself a
large   farmer   and  grazier, and  who   stated  to  the  committee,   that
upon      afarm  of one  thousand   pounds a-year,      he  could  not  esti
mate the annual advantages, that might fairly be expected from
the free use of salt, at less than three hundred pounds.
    If the benefits and profits arising from the unrestrained use
of salt in agriculture be so various and considerable, how comes
it to pass,    itmay be asked, that its employment has not been
universal throughout Great Britain              Various reasons may be
                                                  ?
assigned for this amongst others we may state the unwilling
                         ;
ness which farmers in general evince, especially the lower class,
to walk out of the old beaten path of their forefathers         ;  the want
of directions how to make use of salt for the purposes under con
sideration     ;the enormous duty upon the article itself; and, per
haps,    above  all others, next to the price, the many vexatious re
gulations to be observed before a remission of any part of the
 duty could be obtained.
    Let us take one case as an instance of these troublesome ob
                                                                 structions.

352                  A   Letter    to the   Farmers and
structions.    By an act of parliament passed in the 57th year of
George    the Third, it was enacted that the farmer might receive
salt for the purpose of mixing with the food of sheep or cattle,
at the reduced duty of five shillings per bushel, or ten shillings
per cwt., such salt to be employed only and for no other purpose
than feeding sheep or cattle ; but before any such salt could bp
obtained, it was necessary to give a bond, with sufficient sureties,
to the satisfaction of the Commissioners of His Majesty's Excise,
in the penalty of six times the full duty upon such salt; and no
further quantity of salt could be obtained, however much the
cattle, after being long accustomed to             it,
                                             might require its use,
until the bond given on the delivery of every prior quantity should
be discharged.
   It was also enacted that before such bond could be discharged,
a certificate must be given, declaring the whole of such rock-salt
to have been used and consumed in mixing with the food of sheep
or cattle, and for no other purpose whatever       and that no such
                                                          ;
certificate should discharge any such bond, unless the collector
of excise should, upon inquiry, be satisfied of the truth thereof,
and should underwrite the same upon the said certificate.         The
act declared also, that      such certificate should not be signed
                              if
and delivered to such collector before the expiration of thirteen
months from the time of the bond being given, or should in any
respect be false, or any of the salt should be consumed in any
other manner than in feeding sheep or cattle, the penalty of the
bond should be forfeited.
   Under such penalties and restrictions,           at all surprising
                                                         is
                                                          it
that salt has not been more generally employed for the purposes
above enumerated; especially when            recollected that, even
                                              it   is
under all these disadvantages, the farmer could not use a single
bushel of salt for curing his hay, for steeping his seed-wheat, or
for manuring his land, until he had paid the enormous duty of
thirty pounds per ton, which of itself amounted to prohibition?a
 I    have, however, great pleasure in being able to congratulate
you that an act passed both houses of parliament on the fifth of
June last, to repeal the most vexatious of these restrictions, and
to impose   a low duty upon such rock-salt as should be hereafter
delivered for any purpose of agriculture, as well as for feeding
sheep or cattle.
   Under this act -of parliament, salt may now be had at the re
duced duty of two shillings and sixpence per bushel, or five shil
lings per cwt. * for any of the following purposes, viz> for mixing
                                                                 with
   * Rock-salt  is not worth more than eight or ten shillings per ton at the
pits of North wich, and  itmay be put on board vessel on the canal for about
                                                a

     preserving hay,   or for manuring land ; and no bond is required to
     be given, nor any sureties as heretofore, for the faithful employ-
 .
     ment of the salt so obtained.       And although the farmer must
     give a certificate that he has consumed the salt in the way the
     act directs, it is not necessary that time should be lost, as here
     tofore, while the collector makes inquiries to satisfy himself of
     the truth of the allegations in the certificate, but he is bound to
     accept the same when presented, and the farmer is entitled to
     receive a further supply of salt immediately.
 .
        By this important act of parliament, the farmer is also allowed
    to remove any part of such salt to another farm, or to sell it
                                                                          to a
    neighbouring farmer for the purposes aforesaid; and notwith
    standing the penalty on a fraudulent misapplication of the salt
    is fixed by this act at forty shillings the bushel, or at one
                                                                         hun

    shall sue for the same, still the act contains a proviso,

   penalty may be mitigated by a justice of the peace to one-fourth
   part thereof.
        Such are the alterations which have been made in the
                                                                     laws re

 discover an indifference or disinclination to

circumstance as an argument against the advocates

all their original force and severity.
                                           Whereas, if experiments were
very generally instituted throughout the
                                                country, I doubt not but
the farmers would soon become so
                                         fully convinced of the value of
salt for the various purposes of
                                      husbandry, that a general appli

354                                 A Letter    to the Farmers and
 all the laws relating to salt ; and such a petition as this would
 be irresistible. The agriculturist and manufacturer would then
 be empowered to dig rock-salt with as much freedom as they can
 now dig sand, or raise coal ; and the various national benefits
 which would result therefrom would be more numerous and im
 portant than could easily be enumerated.
    Having addressed you at much greater length than I at first
intended, all that remains for me now        that    should give a     is,    I
few necessary cautions and directions to such of my readers as
«ay determine     to adopt the practice which has been recommended
in the foregoing pages.
    In the first place, am desirous of remarking that no land can
                                    I
be said to be fruitful which       entirely exhausted of carbonaceous
                                               is
matter   ; therefore,       were possible for an estate to be so wont
                                    if
                                     it
      it by
out      successive crops that little or no carbon remained in the
soil,       not likely that salt alone would restore
              is                                               to its origi       it
nal fertility.      consider also that the land which contains mast
                           I
carbon will derive most benefit from the application of salt. But
the safest way for a farmer to proceed            to use his salt sparingly
                                                                  is
at first, and in all cases to leave small portion of the same land
                                                    a
without salt, so that the real effects produced           the salt may be,   by
 by  comparison,               in
                       every instance, self-evident and palpable.
  A    farmer who does not wish his land to lie fallow,' ought, un
doubtedly, to use too little rather than too much salt; because                                   a
very abundant dressing of this saline mineral substance might
render the land, for one year at least, absolutely barren. We read
in Scripture of the " Valley of Salt," where David smote the Sy
rians, which in all probability was an extent of low land that
had been rendered barren                      by
                                   an influx of salt water.        In one of
 the very early numbers of the Philosophical Transactions                   an              is
 account of      valleyaof the  same  kind    near   Aleppo;   and   the  late
 Dr. Browning relates that there             vast desert on the frontiers
                                                        is   a
 of Russia, towards Crim Tartary, which, in consequence of su                               a
 perabundance of salt, has become so absolutely sterile, that for
 the space of many miles neither tree nor herb grows upon it.
     This reminds me of circumstance of primary importance to
                                          a
 all those who obtain salt under the regulations of the late act of
 parliament.     This act enjoins that the salt shall be delivered                               in
 lumps of twenty pounds each or upwards; consequently the whole
 of such salt must be broken before             can be used with any ad
                                                             it
 vantage; for wherever salt        accumulated upon land,
                                              is                    must               it        in
 evitably destroy   all vegetation  that   lies  beneath   it.   Now       has              it
 occurred to ine that there        possibility,
                                              is
                                              a   from  the  carelessness   of
 a labourer, of its being sometimes spread upon the land             without
 being properly broken         and     am decidedly of opinion, that
                                          ;         I

ture land, it must do mischief.        My advice therefore         that the   is,
proprietor   of   farm,
                  a      when   he  receives    parcela  of rock-salt   from
Northwich, should make point of having
                                 a                the  whole  of    ground,   it
or reduced to       powder nearly as fine as common table salt, and
                      a
passed through       sieve of the requisite fineness, before he, allows
                      a
any of  it to be laid upon the ground.          Rock-salt        not    hard
                                                                         is         a
substance  :     may easily
                 it          be   crushed    and   divided  as  much    as               is
necessary for any of these purposes.
   As to the quantity of salt which          will be advisable to use for
                                                 it
the respective crops, and upon the different kinds of land, this
will be best learnt         perusal of the several testimonials and
                            by
                            a
other documents which will be found in the Appendix.                But the
best way of all others for ascertaining this point would be for
every agriculturist to depend upon the results of his own experi
ments.     To this end, would advise him to institute a set of ex
                             I
periments upon every distinct species of grain which he               in the
                                                                                *, is
practice of cultivating, as well as upon his pasture land            and to
keep  a  register of every minute circumstance attending each of
these trials.
  A   large kitchen-garden, wherever there              one attached to a
                                                               is
farm-house, would in some cases be the most appropriate spot
for such experiments; as this would be more under the imme
diate eye of the proprietor, and the experiments being upon a
small scale, would be attended with little or no expense.                The
circumstance of an agriculturist being now empowered to divide
the salt which he shall obtain            by
                                        permit, among as many of the
neighbouring farmers as he may think fit,            extremely favourable
                                                          is
to such circumscribed experiments, and will be very gratifying
to those who may wish to satisfy themselves of the value of com
mon salt, and yet would not like to incur the risk of buying a
large parcel solely for their own use.        And a$ the late act allows
the use of salt in agriculture, as well as for feeding all kinds of
cattle, this affords a large scope for its consumption.
   From the trials which have already been made in feeding the
live stock upon      farm,
                      a        appears that the following quantities
                                 it
may at all times be administered with perfect safety.
   To neat cattle four ounces of salt -per day, mixed up with
steamed chaff or other moistened food; one half to be given in
the morning, and the other half in the latter part of the day.
   To horses four ounces per day, as aforesaid.
   * The right honourable Sir John Sinclair, baronet,
                                                          lately published a
series of sixteen distinct experiments, which he   desirous of having tried
                                                          is

agriculture  ; and he distributed the paper gratis.    This valuable sheet,
which may be obtained at the Board of Agriculture,       well deserving the

  To young heifers two ounces per day, at twice, as aforesaid..
  To calves one ounce per day, divided into two portions.
  To sheep two ounces per head per week. The salt to be
spread very thin upon slates or tiles in the field where the sheep
are fed.
    Few farmers or graziers, I flatter mvself, will read the forer
going pages, and the Appendix, without feeling some desire to
improve their own estates, and increase the value of their live
stock by the use of salt ; but if there are any who are incapable
of feeling a desire for improvement, I trust there are, on the
other hand, many country gentlemen and enlightened agricultu
rists, who rejoice in every opportunity of contributing towards
the national improvement of Great Britain, and who will enter
tain the subject from principles of pure patriotism'.
    It was the opinion of Aristotle, " that the cultivation of the
land is favourable to liberty." And a writer of more modern times
remarks, " that well ordered monarchies are most frequently
found in highly cultivated and fruitful countries."     There was an
adage   formerly  in vogue,  that  "  fields covered with ears of corn
are the sources of victories." "The Sardinians," says the Presi
dent Montesquieu,      " were formerly very rich; and Aristeus, so
famed for his love of agriculture, was their lawgiver.          But the
 Carthaginians becoming their masters, destroyed everything
proper for the nourishment of man, and forbade the cultivation
of the lands upon pain of death." The state consequently fell
into decay, and for ages became the prey of a variety of con
querors.    What is most. remarkable, however,         is,that even to
 this day the greatest part of the island of Sardinia remains an
 uncultivated barren waste.       To this deplorable state of things
the empire of China affords     a striking contrast.
    " The ancient emperors of China," says Montesquieu, " were
not conquerors.      The first thing they did to aggrandize them
selves gave the highest proof of their wisdom.       They raised from
 beneath the waters (or rather, they recovered from the sea) two
of the finest provinces of the empire. These owe their existence
to the labour of man and
                       ;       it    the inexpressible fertility of these
                                    is
 two provinces which has given Europe such ideas of the felicity
of this vast country." And from the united testimony of travel
lers, we have reason to believe that every part of this extensive
 empire  is constantly preserved in the highest possible state of
 cultivation whereas, in England and Wales alone, there are up
              ;
wards of seven millions of acres of waste land, which have been
 for ages, and still continue to be, of little or no benefit to the
community.
  The greatest obstacle to the cultivation of these lands     the is
want of manure, there being at present    great insufficiency for

however, become general hi agriculture, and this deficiency will
in a great measure be supplied.       Every opulent farmer will then
have the means within his reach of putting the whole of his farm
into the most desirable state of improvement ; so much so, that
it would soon be considered disgraceful for any agriculturist to
allow a single rood of larid belonging to his estate to remain un
cultivated.     This would prepare the way for the inclosure of those
vast tracts of common land which we perceive in every quarter
of the united kingdom; and the alteration which this would
make in the face of the country, to say nothing of the increase of
its inhabitants, may be more easily conceived than described.
     Had our ancestors been totally inattentive to the improvement
of agriculture, the greatest part of Great Britain would still have
been covered with wood ; and in like manner, had it not been
for the progress of civilization, and the desire of improvement,
the finest provinces of France and Germany would still have been
overshadowed by the Hercynian forest, which in the time of
Julius Caesar extended from the borders of Alsatia and Switzer
 land, over the greatest part of Germany, Hungary, and Transyl
vania, and was said to be sixty days' journey in length and nine
 in breadth.

 LX.   On Sulphuretted Azote,            " Thermozoophite," and Apklo-
              gistic Phcenomena.         By Mr.   J. Murray.
                               To  Mr. Tilhch.
            .                                     London, 13th May, 1819.
Sir, — At page          165 of my Elements of Chemical Science, there
 is the following passage : *' It is stated that sulphuretted azotic
 gas exists in the mineral waters at Aix-la-Chapelle ; and this
 was first announced by Gimbernat, though all attempts by Ber-
 zelius and Hedenberg to form sulphuretted azote artificially
 have been without success.            It appears probable, that as the
waters in question contain both sulphuretted hydrogen and azote,
the sulphuretted azote of Gimbernat may have been a mixture
of these gases." — During my sojourn at Naples I had the plea
sure to make some geological excursions with Signore Gimber
nat. He wished me to rectify the impression to which the above
refers.    Sig. G. stated the fact, that he had found an intimate
combination of sulphur and azote in these mineral waters, in a
private communication to Mr. Chenevix ; and it afterwards found
its way into the       "  Annates de Chimie et de Physique." — Our
author never once called it sulphuretted azote, nor even gave it
the name of a chemical compound.              The reseaches of Pfaff and
Voight on the same, subsequent to those of Gimbernat, confirm
the existence of this intimate combination; but they hesitate to
call it sulphuretted azote, because chemists have not been able
to form it artificially, though the probabilities are that it is such
a chemical product. Several chemists of late, however, have sup
posed that sulphuretted azote has actually occurred to them in
their manipulations: thus Mr. Miers in his experiments on azote;
and some others since.            Sig. Gimbernat told me he had con
stantly  found    nitrate  of silver  to be a good test for waters con
taining   azote   or  animal  matter    affording a chesmit brown colour,
and also tincture of galls, which changes from a straw to a ches-
nut colour, while that muriate of arsenic was a very sensible
reagent, in discovering the presence of sulphur when associated
mwith azote, and not with hydrogen.
    While on the subject of mineral waters, I may inform you that
Sig. Gimbernat has discovered in the thermae of Baden and
Ischia a singular substance having much the appearance of ani
mal matter ; — indeed I could not discriminate            between it and
raw muscular fibre.         It is formed on the surface of the rocks
constantly humected by the ascending vapours of these thermal
springs, and such vapours he has invariably found to contain
azote.    This gelatinous or albuminous matter in , the process of
decay gives the very foetid odour peculiar to animal matter under
decomposition.         It swells like pelt, and forms adipocire by the
                                                                    action

         Analysts of the Chalybeate Spring at Thetford.               359
action of nitric acid ; affording also by distillation ammonia, em-
pyreumatie oil, &c. This gentleman proposes to give it the name
     "
of thermo-zoophite." On mentioning this circumstance and
describing the phenomenon afterwards to that eminent botanist
Dr. Joakim F. Schouw, (the intimate friend of the late Dr.
Smith of Christiana, who perished in the unfortuate expedition
to the Niger,) he told me that it was his opinion it might be the
oscillatoria thermale discovered by Adanson in some of the
thermae of France, and that he had himself noticed a substance
somewhat similar above the thermal springs of San Filipponear
to Acquapendente.         This strange substance, he added, contains
transverse striae, which present under the lens an oscillatory
movement ; and hence the name.
   i  may add to this, that Dr. S. said he had discovered in the
crater of Mount Etna in a sulphury vapour, at a temperature of
40° Reaumur (90° Fahr.), two plants, one an alga, the other a
hypnum. The first seemed a plant in its simplest form, consisting
of globules which appeared still transparent under the lens.
    I shall in a future number of the Philosophical Magazine con
tinue my observations on aphlogistic phenomena ; meantime I
only add, that I could not obtain the effect with artificial cam
phor (obtained by passing a current of muriatic gas through
spirits of turpentine). A sulphur match does not ignite on con
tact with the platinum aphlogistic lamp, but instantly at that of
silver ; indeed in the first instance it is necessary to attach a
small piece of amadou to the match.           This is curious, — A body
exists  in such   a state  of combustion   as not to ignite a particular
substance, yet imparting to an intermediate one a degree of igni
tion capable of producing the effect. The matches prepared with
oxy muriate of potassa kindle at either of these lamps.            I suc
ceeded most readily with the copper wire when I dissolved a little
camphor in the alcohol.           I have the honour to be, Sir,
                                      Your most humble servant,
                                                        J. Murray.
    P.S. By a typographical error the word surprise           in my last
memoir is made to substitute scepticism.                        J.  M.

spots that are said to be particularly favourable to the curative
effects of medicinal waters.     The land around the town as it re
cedes from the spring consists chiefly of fields richly variegated,
here and there interspersed with gardens and houses, which in point
of taste and elegance may vie with any modern buildings what
ever. The uncommon fertility of the soil and romantic scenery,
which are equalled by few in the kingdom, present a picture dear
to the man of rural taste, as well as to the invalid. The upper strata
surrounding the town of Thetford on the Norfolk side consist of
chalk, and those of the Suffolk side of a dry gravelly mould. The
heaviest rains that fall here cannot prevent the exercises of riding
or walking for any length. of time after they have ceased.        The
river called the Little Ouse sports itself with many turnings and
windings near the spring ; it abounds in fish, and permission of
angling is seldom refused.       The surrounding country abounds
with game.
           Further Particulars concerning this Spring.
   At what period the Thetford chalybeate spring and its virtues
were first discovered cannot now be ascertained.
   From a memoir published in 1818, by the reverend H. C.
Manning, minister of St. Peter's church at Thetford, respecting
this mineral spring, it is evident that this Fountain of Health was
known and analysed by Matthew Manning, physician of Thetford,
in the year 1746. The analysis of Dr. Manning was added as an
Appendix to his large treatise on the application of mineral wa
ters to the cure of chronic diseases*, the first precise dissertation
on that subject   f  which 'having been composed in the language
then common to all scholars, (the Latin,) has not obtained the
publicity due either to the subject, or its own intrinstic merits.
— We shall therefore preface some extracts from this work by
observing, that the spring having obtained a short-lived celebrity
by the Doctor's recommendation of its use, was from no failure
of its own, but from various causes not now worth detailing (and
assuredly not from one — which has been invidiously assigned — that
of medical illiberality) — again closed up ; till a happier spirit
of research seems once more likely to liberate it from obstruc
tion, and to diffuse those benefits it is so well calculated to en
sure.
   To promote this desirable end, it has been deemed expedient
to lay before the public some translated extracts from the above
analysis; prefacing them with some part of the dedication of
the above work to the mayor and body corporate of the borough,
whom the Doctor thus addresses :
     * Aqua; minerales omnibus

          Analysis   of the Chalyleate Spring    at Thetford.      36 1
    "  It was my intention, respected sirs ! in the following ana
lysis, so to investigate the contents of your admirable spring,
and to establish its virtues on the principles of -sound science, that
no one should, henceforth, presume to refuse them his assent.
This analysis has, happily, succeeded beyond my utmost expec
tations ; having most clearly proved these waters to abound in
all those mineral substances required for the cure of chronic
complaints, and consequently to be fully equal to any mineral
waters either in this or any other countrv.
   " I should not therefore think I had fully discharged my duty,
without recommending them to your protecting care, &c.
   "  The bason itself of the spring, as well as the broken pave
ment, and decayed foundations of buildings around it — but co
vered over with soil, and not long since accidentally discovered
by workmen on the premises, — indisputably prove that this              .
spring was in frequent use in times long past.      But if those who
were unacquainted with the specific qualities of these waters,
appear, by these works, to have paid such regard to the preser
vation of their sick ; how much more attentive ought you to be,
to whom these points have, after so long an interval, been as
certained by my labours and expense !
   "  A regard indeed for the general good, as well as of this place,
has been my sole reason for publishing an analysis of these waters;
which, if duly fostered by your protecting care, may assuredly
contribute largely to the future opulence and respectability of the
town of Thetford — to which 1 once more most heartily recom
mend them, and bid you farewell.
                                  " Matthew      Manning, M.D."
   This analysis   is closed by a detail   of some    cases, in which
these waters were eminently successful.
   Dr. M. Manning's analysis displays much chemical knowledge.
He determined the most predominant constituent parts of the
water with accuracy; but the science of chemistry at the time
the analysis was made, was not sufficient to enable him to trace
their true combinations.      For it is particularly in such subjects
as these, that the science of modern chemistry claims a prece
dence over the labours of our predecessors; in giving us a clear
and accurate information as to the nature and quantities of all the
foreign matters, the presence of which constitutes the difference
between a common and a mineral water.
   There is no department of analytical chemistry to which a
greater acquisition, in point of real matter of fact, has been gained
during our own times ; and in proportion to this acquisition of
knowledge, has the chemist been able to throw much light on the
true constitution of mineral springs, — a subject which has always
attracted a very large share of attention, and exercised the abi
                                                                 lities

lities and skill of some of the most eminent men that chemistry
has to boast of.     Hence the records of the older experimenters
must, like all those that have been superseded by a fresh acquisi
tion of knowledge, be consigned to an honourable repose.
                Physical Properties            of the Water.
   The water taken fresh from the basin of the spring is as trans
parent as rock crystal, and perfectly colourless.   Its taste is di
stinctly chalybeate, and by no means unpleasant.        It exhales,
when minutely examined, an odour resembling the smell of iron
when rubbed in contact with moisture.
   The temperature of the water before it reaches the air, is in
variably ten degrees below the temperature of the surrounding
atmosphere.    It is therefore one of those springs which lie so
deep in the bowels of the earth, that it can neither be influenced
by the scorching sun-beams of the summer, nor by frost in
winter.
  A large quantity of air-bubbles          are frequently seen to ascend
from the bottom of the spring, to pass through the water with
out being absorbed by          it,
                             and break as soon as they reach
the surface ;and   thin column of steam generally hovers over
                     a
the surface of the spring during the cool of the morning and
evening.
   The water incrusts the stone reservoir at the part where the air
touches the water, as well as the channel through which        flows,
                                                               it
with yellow brown precipitate.
      a                               The quantity of water afforded
 by  the spring amounts to nineteen gallons in an hour.          The

tate becomes deposited.
    If a bottle be filled with the water at the fountain head, and
immediately well corked and sealed, the water may be kept un
altered for about two or three days, but in four or five days              it
becomes sensibly turbid.

   Exp. i. — To       tumbler full of distilled water was added
                      a
blue tincture of cabbage, to impart to       the slightest blue tint

     Exp. 3.— When the water of the spring had been boiled, it
did not produce this reddening effect with blue tincture of litmus.
     Exp. 4. — Six cubic inches of lime-water added to ten of the
water of the chalybeate spring, produced a white precipitate,
which disappeared by the admixture of muriatic acid.
    Exp. 5. — Crystallized hydrate of barytes produced a copious
precipitate both in the fresh water, andi in such as had been con
centrated by evaporation.      The precipitate was not soluble in
muriatic acid.
    Exp. 6. — Oxalate of ammonia produced much cloudiness both
in the fresh and in the boiled water.
    Exp. 7. — Nitrate, sulphate and acetate of silver produced in
the fresh and in the boiled water much cloudiness — which did
not disappear by the addition of nitric acid.
    Exp. 8. — Two grains of acetate of barytes rendered eight cu
bic inches of the chalybeate water turbid.      The filtered fluid af
forded with acetate of silver a copious precipitate.
    Exp. 9. — Tincture of galls produced with the fresh water a
purple hue.     Water concentrated by boiling was not affected
by this test.
        Examination   of the  gaseous Contents   of the Water.
    Nine hundred and twenty-four cubic inches of the chalybeate
water were introduced at the fountain head into a retort con
nected with a mercurial pneumatic apparatus.          The water was
made to boil, and the gaseous products collected in the usual
manner.
    After the apparatus had again acquired the common tempera
ture, barytes water indicated 4S-28 cubic inches of carbonic acid
gas, of which 12 7 are contained, therefore, in one gallon of the
water.
    The residuary gaseous fluid, on being examined by the test of
phosphorus, was found to be composed of 1-21 of oxygen and
3-04 atmospheric air.
                              Analysis.
    Exp. I. — Four gallons of Thetford chalybeate water being
evaporated in an earthenware vessel, placed in a baker's oven, to
dryness, afforded a brown mass of a slightly saline taste.
    Exp. 2  —  This product was levigated and digested in alcohol
filtered, and the insoluble residue put aside for further exami
nation. The alcoholic solution mingled with a small quantity of
water, became turbid by the addition of sulphate of silver ; and
phosphate of soda in combination with carbonate of ammonia
produced with it much cloudiness.
    Exp.3. — The mass which had been repeatedly acted on by al
cohol was boiled first in eight parts of water, and this solution was
                                                                   put

The insoluble residue was soluble in muriatic acid.
    Exp. 4. — The muriatic solution was mingled with nitric acid
and evaporated to dryness, heated red hot, and again dissolved
in a small portion of muriatic acid. It afforded by liquid ammonia
eight grains of oxide of iron, which indicate 2-75 grains of car
bonate of iron in each gallon of the water.
    Exp. 5.-, — The alcoholic solution (Experiment 2) having been
suffered to stand exposed to the open air for twelve days afforded
a crystalline mass.     The uncrystallizable portion was mixed with
sulphuric acid,     and   heated till the colour of litmus paper em
ployed for covering    the   basin in which the process was conducted,
did not suffer a change of colour.       The solid residue was digested
in a small quantity of water, and the insoluble part separated by
the filter.    The soluble portion was decomposed by subcarbonate
of potash ; — the precipitate afforded with muriatic acid thirteen
grains of muriate of magnesia ; therefore 3.25 grains of this salt
 were contained. in a gallon of the chalybeate water. .
     Exp. 6. — The insoluble residue of Experiment 5, after being
boiled in a solution of subcarbonate of potash, became readily
 soluble in nitric acid.       This solution was decomposed by sub
 carbonate of ammonia, and the product, after being mingled
 with muriatic acid, again evaporated to dryness, and strongly
 heated, gave 2.25 grains of muriate of lime to a gallon of water.
     Exp. 7. — The analysis being thus far conducted, an alcoholic
 solution obtained as before stated, and equal to that operated
 on, was evaporated to dryness — covered with sulphuric acid, and
 again evaporated to perfect dryness.          This mass digested in a
 small quantity of water afforded copious crystals of sulphate of
 magnesia.      The residuary insoluble substance was soluble by
 boiling iu water, and decomposable by nitrate of barytes, — and
 lastly, a similar alcoholic solution was mixed with muriatic acid,
 and decomposed by subcarbonate of potash, and the product
 heated to redness. Thus carbonate of iron and the muriates of
 lime and magnesia were clearly established in the water.

 was not affected by muriate of platina nor oxalate of ammonia. It
 was diluted with alcohol, which occasioned a crystalline precipi
  tate to fall down.     The remaining fluid was evaporated, and at
  tempted   to  be crystallized.    The salt produced being muriate of
  soda, was dissolved in water together with the saline mass obtained
  in process 5, and decomposed by nitrate of silver.         The preci
  pitate produced, taking 235 grains of muriate of silver to be equal
  to 100 of muriate of soda, indicated 2-125 muriate of soda in
  one gallon of the water.

soda, and highly concentrated, was decomposed with subcarbo-
nate of potash.      It yielded a copious white precipitate, which,
after being thoroughly ignited, gave 1-25 grain of sulphate of
magnesia (taking 136-68 of magnesia to be equal to 100 of sul
phate of magnesia) to be present in one gallon of the water.
    Exp. 10. — The dilute fluid obtained in process 3, yielded a pre
cipitate by oxalate of ammonia and nitrate of barytes ; and being
on a further examination found to contain nothing but sulphate
of lime, it was decomposed by barytic water; and taking 100
parts of sulphate of barytes to be produced by 71 of sulphate
of lime, gave three grains of sulphate of lime to one gallon of
water.

LXII.      On the Insulated or Safety Compass lately invented      ly
    Mr. Jennings.      By James Horsburgh, Esq. Hydrographer
    to the  Honourable the East India Company.
                             To Mr. Tillocli.
 Dear sir, — As       the pages of the Philosophical Magazine are
always open      to give publicity to the labours of those who are
gifted with superior talents, I trust you will be able to afford
 room for a few observations on the insulated or safety compass,
 lately invented by Mr. Jennings, which is not yet sufficiently
 known, although it will probably add greatly to the security of
 navigation and commerce, when brought into general use.
    Several men of science have been convinced, by attending to
 experiments made by Mr. Jennings, and his liberal explanation,
 that he has discovered a method of arresting the progress of the
 magnetic fluid, and securing the magnetic needle from being
                                                            disturbed

   366              On the Insulated or Safety Compass.
   disturbed by the contiguity of small pieces of iron, such as have
   been liable to disturb the mariner's compass hitherto, and have
   often led to the loss of much property and many valuable lives.
   This discovery seems capable of further extension; for the needle
   can be protected from the influence of large masses of iron, or
   even from the local attraction of all the iron in a ship : — but this
   cannot be effected without considerable expense, and it would
   not be of general utility ; whereas the protection of the needle
   from the influence of small pieces of iron must be always useful,
   and afford great comfort to those intrusted with lives and pro
   perty when navigating in narrow seas or dangerous situations.
       Capt. Dunbar, an experienced seaman, who was many years a
   master in the royal navy, and now commander of the Brassa,
   lately arrived from Smyrna, had one of the insulated compasses
   in that vessel during the voyage, of which he writes in the highest
   terms in a letter to Mr. Jennings, stating that it was not at
   tracted by iron, although part of the frame, be#ms, bitts, cables,
   and cargo of the Brassa, consisted of iron.      During his stay at
   Malta, Admiral Penrose sent for the compass, and tried it against
   a large magnet which would lift forty-two pounds of iron by its
   attractive power, but it did not influence the compass materially.
   This circumstance induced the Admiral to say, he deemed it the
•  most important invention that he had ever seen.
       His Majesty's ship Isabella had one of the insulated compasses
   on board during the late exploration of Baffin's Bay, which ob
   viated the effects of the local attraction of iron, although the
   needle of that compass was not so perfect as those at present
   constructed by Mr. Jennings, the result of experience and atten
   tive observation.    The ships which have lately sailed again for
   Baffin's Bay have been supplied by him with a great number of
   magnetic needles on a new and peculiar construction, from which
   it will probably be proved, that the needles which unite the figure
   of the horizontal and dipping needle, are those most proper for
   the purposes of navigation ; and by the others, we may expect
   to gain more knowledge of the laws which govern the magnetic
   fluid, because in those regions it appears to act with increased
   energy, as if flowing from the immediate theatre or focus of mag
   netism.     Several of these instruments I have seen ; and the in
  ventor,   in  the most candid and unreserved manner, gave me a
   satisfactory explanation of their principles, — which has convinced
   me of the wonderful fertility and originality of Mr. Jennings's
   mind ; and to several experienced officers of the royal navy,
   and of the East India Company's service, as well as to myself,
   his inventions appear to be highly deserving of public encourage
   ment ; and it is to be hoped that the intrinsic value of the insu
                                                                  lated

  lated compass will soon bring it into general use, as an indis
  pensable aid to the security of navigation.
                                Dear sir,

       *»* We have been informed, but we        know not how correctly,
  that Mr. Jennings effects the insulation of the needle by inclos
   ing it in a double case, having the space between filled with
  clippings of iron, previously heated, or, as it is called, cemented
  with red oxide of iron or hematite.        If Mr. Jennings himself or
   Mr. Horsburgh will furnish us with the necessary particulars, we
  will cheerfully devote a portion of our pages to the making known
   more generally the nature and merits of so useful a discovery and
  application.   — Edit.

   Remarks      on the Account     of the late Voyage   of Discovery  to
       Baffin's Bay, published by Captain J. Ross, R.N. By Cap
       tain Edward Sabine, Royal Artillery. 40 pages, 8vo.
   In    our last we noticed the work referred to in the title of this   .
   small publication, and justice demands that we should also no
   tice the subject of the work before us. The author states the
   object of his pages to be,
                                    " to counteract the erroneous im-
^ pression which a perusal of Captain Ross's recent publication
   might produce concerning the author's employments, services, and
   opinions during the voyage." "As Captain Ross's is not an offi
    cial but a private work, I should," says Captain Sabine, " have
    been unconcerned had the mention of my name or occupation
   been even wholly unnoticed ; but when I perceive that observa
   tions which I was sent to make are therein published as having
   been made or furnished by others, and various information copied
    from my papers is given as his own, whilst I am principally intro
    duced as having held an appointment (that of Naturalist) the
    duties of which I am represented as not having fulfilled, but which
    duties formed no part of my official engagement; I am obliged
    in justice to myself, and in consideration of the respect due to
    the authority by which I had the honour of being recommended?
    to show the true nature of my undertaking, and that I have not
    failed in executing it ; to claim the .observations and information
    which are exclusively my own, and to remark on other points
 '
    with which Captain Ross has connected my name."
        The author shows, by ajetter from Mr. Brande, writen by
     the direction of the President and Council of the Royal Society,
                                                               addressed

368               Notices respecting New Books.
addressed to John Barrow esquire, Secretary to the Admiralty,
and inclosing a list of the instruments which they begged to re
commend for the Northern Expeditions, that he was in the same
letter recommended (not as Naturalist, but) as a proper person
to conduct the experiments (with these instruments) on board
one of the vessels.
    The day after Captain Sabine's arrival in London, (Nov. 19,
 1818) on the return of the Expedition, he was informed by Cap
tain Ross that he (Captain Ross) had been ordered to draw lip
an official account of the voyage. Captain Sabine expressed his
readiness to complete his papers, which were already in a state of
preparation, and also to furnish information on. every subject,
whether connected with his duty or otherwise, which his know
ledge or curiosity had enabled him exclusively to possess ; adding
 that he would accept no share of the emoluments arising from
the sale of the publication.
    Learning a few days afterwards from the Secretary to the Ad
miralty, that the Board had decided that no account should ap
pear under the sanction of their authority, and had resolved to
return the journals and papers to the individuals who had con
tributed them, with liberty to make them public in any way they
might prefer, Captain Sabine wrote a letter on the 7th of De
cember informing Captain Ross of what he had learnt ; and that
he had thoughts, in consequence, of publishing a short narrative
of the voyage.
    It does not appear that any answer was received; but, a few
days after, it came to the author's knowledge, that Captain Ross
was at press, '' and had already printed observations which he
 (Captain S.) knew could only have been his."     " I immediately
wrote to him (says Captain S.), stating what I had heard, and
remarking that, if he had got any papers of mine from the Ad
miralty office, their contents were not complete, nor in a state to
meet the public eye ; but that, if the Admiralty had given him
any of my papers, I had no objection to prepare them for publi
cation and return them."
   Captain Ross sent, him "one paper, and only one — an abstract
of the observations which Captain S. had made on the ship's daily
lat. and long, by each of six chronometers and their mean."
Captain Ross had obtained this document out of the Hydrogra-
phic office. " It had been printed from." The author recalcu
lated the results, making a few alterations, and returned them ;
prefixing an account of the going of the six chronometers, whicji
he had under his charge during the voyage. — The acknowledge
ment of these observations is contained in the following letter :
   " Dear Sir, — Herewith you will receive for correction the
proof sheets of the observations which you sent me for publica

tion, and which I have to beg you will be pleased to return to
 Mr. Murray when corrected. — And I shall.be obliged if you will
send me as soon a3 possible, and in a state for publication, any
other observations you may have made during the late voyage,
relative to the various objects of the Expedition or those branches
of science in which you were employed, viz. the variation and
inclination of the magnetic needle, intensity of magnetic foree,
refraction, aurora borealis, and figure of the earth as determined
by observation on the pendulum, that I may have the pleasure
of giving them a place in my publication, which is now in a for
 ward state.                                I am, &c.,
   " London,  12th February,  1819."                     John Ross.
     The author's answer was in substance,      " that the reports on
these subjects had been sent to the Royal Society at the instance
of the Admiralty; and that any which were deemed worthy of
being recorded would be printed, he presumed, in the Philoso
phical Transactions (in fact, they were at this time under exami
nation of a Committee of the Royal Society) ; that if the Admi
ralty had given the reports to him, and had wished them to form
a part of his publication, he would readily have completed them
for that purpose. On receiving this reply Captain Ross returned
the manuscript which had been sent him, and remarked, that as
he had not the whole of Captain Sabine's observations, he could
not think of publishing any part of them."
    " On the appearance of Captain Ross's publication I perceived
(says the author) that it contained observations which I had ex
clusively made on various subjects, printed not indeed under my
name, but under that of Mr. James Clark Ross, nephew to Cap
tain Ross, a midshipman of the Isabella. I immediately requested
an interview with Mr. James Ross, and in the presence of the
officers commanding the Hecla and Griper, the two ships now
fitting for a new Expedition, and of Mr. Hooper, one of the of
ficers of the Hecla, called on him for the disavowal which follows:
"March      28th 1819. — Questions put by Captain Sabine to Mr.
 .
    James C. Ross in presence of Lieutenants Parry and Liddon
    and Mr. Hooper of the Royal Navy, with Mr. James C. Ross's

by Mr. James Ross.'          These observations being mine, and the
account of them having been copied from my papers, I call on
you to disavow them, and to state how and when you became

magnetic dip and intensity of the magnetic force, furnished by
Mr. James Ross, who with Captain Sabine was employed parti
cularly to make these observations.'   I call on you, as an officer
and as a gentleman, to state whether any of the observations
contained in that table were made by you ; whether you ever
made any observations on the dip or force ; and how and when
                              ' Table' printed
you became possessed of the                     by Captain Ross?

mission during the voyage.
   " Q. Did you not when at or near Shetland, on our return
home, copy my Meteorological register for Captain Ross, at his
request and by my permission ; being the same register that is
engraved in plates in Captain Ross's book, and which was the
only one so kept in the Isabella ?

                   Matthew Liddon, and
                   William Hooper."
  The author        just tribute to Mr. James Ross for his manly
                 pays a
and honourable disavowal of the use which had been made of his
name.   " I have only to add," he continues, " concerning the
magnetic observations, that they are incomplete, imperfect, and
printed incorrectly ; that those on the pendulum are useless in
their present state, as every person who understands the subject
will perceive. 1 have however no reason to be ashamed of the
manner in which even my rough memoranda on the spot were
made; a state in which I little expected they would appear be
fore the public.   I have also to appropriate and to acknowledge
the compliment which Captain Ross has paid to the care andat-
tention with which, the meteorological tables, which have been
published by him, were kept.

on our arrival in England, to be transmitted by him to the Ad
miralty, was one on the language of the Esquimaux who reside
to the north of the latitude of 76°.    When my journal was re

                                 1819.
  *( The
          following Report from the Committee for ascertaining the
     length of the Seconds Pendulum was read.
     " It is the opinion of this Committee, that Captain Sabine
  has shown the greatest possible diligence in making the observa
  tions which were intrusted to his care, and the greatest judge
  ment and regularity in his method of recording them ; and thio
  Committee therefore suggests the propriety of recommending
  Captain Sabine to the Admiralty in the strongest manner, both
  as deserving every professional encouragement, and as a proper
  person to be again appointed to take charge of the observations
  to be made in a new Expedition.
      " At the same time the Committee cannot help expressing
  great regret that the opportunities afforded for Captain Sabine's
  Experiments on the Pendulum were so much limited by, the
  shortness of the time allowed him at the different stations, and
  their wishes that this inconvenience Should be remedied by the
  arrangement to be adopted on any future occasion.
      " Resolved, —That the Council do approve and adopt the above
  Report.
      "Ordered, — That a copy thereof be transmitted to the Ad
  miralty."
      We have felt an uncommon interest in this short but interesting
  statement,   which has induced us to notice almost all its points   ;.
  but we hesitate not to encroach still further on the reader's time,
  to notice one of the principal objeets for which this expedition
  was undertaken, and the precipitation with which it was aban
  doned at the most promising spot that had occurred during the
.
  voyage— we mean in Lancaster's Sound. We shall give this most
  important part in Captain Sabine's own language:
      " In Captain Ross's account of his proceedings in Lancaster's
  Sound my name is twice introduced, and obviously for the pur
  pose of supporting the propriety of his conduct in not prosecuting
  the examination of the inlet ; the inferences which are designed
  to be conveyed being, that he consulted with rne, and that my
  opinion coincided with his, that it was unnecessary to go fur
  ther. — An importance is here attached to my opinion, which did
  not show itself at the time, or during the voyage. Captain Ross
  was accustomed to act solely from his own judgement; he formed
  his plans and executed them without a reference to any person ;
  he certainly at no time placed his confidence in me; he never
  showed me his instructions; consequently I need hardly add
  that he never consulted me as to his conduct under them.

      " But f can do more than assert this — I can appeal to a letter
whieh he wrote to the commander of the Alexander but a very
few days before we arrived off Lancaster Sound, in which he ex
pressly states that     he always acts on his own opinions, being
alone responsible — that he has never been led by any one's else —
nor shall any one else share the blame, should any ever be attached
to his proceedings.'     When he thus professed that hie would not
avail himself of the judgement of his second in command, it is
not probable that he should have consulted with a person whose
employment was quite distinct from the nautical conduct of the
expedition : and in point of fact he did not.
          "
       But although my opinion was not asked whether I thought
the inlet sufficiently explored or not, I should not have noticed
the statement if it were a just one; but as it is not so, and as. I
didnot consider the examination as satisfactory, being even greatly
disappointed by our not proceeding further, I owe it to myself
not to permit the following passages to pass unnoticed.
      "The first occurs in page 171 : ' Captain Sabine, who pro
duced Baffin's account, was of opinion that we were off Lancas
ter's Sound, and that there were no hopes of a passage until we
should arrive at Cumberland Strait ; to use his own words, There
was no indication of a passage — no appearance of a current — no
drift wood — and no swell from the. north-west.' I shall not de
tain the reader by questioning words which can only have had
a foundation in some casual conversation ;, but content myself
with referring to the time at winch such conversation       .stated, to

    " We    had a long run that night, with a' f^ir wind, which took
us far out of the inlet.     Captain Ross states that ' his opinions
were mentioned after he had determined to proceed to the south
          '
ward.'      They were so, but not until long after he had executed
 his determination; for it was not until the 1st of September,
when we were out pf Lancaster's Sound, and on our way down
the coast, that a conversation took place between Captain Ross
and myself on the subject.     The purpose of this conversation was
not to consult about quitting a sound which we had already left ;
->-it was not to inquire whether I thought Captain Ross had done
 right or wrong in leaving it; — it was not to learn whether I
agreed with Captain Ross that a passage could not exist, because
lie well knew that I had not seen the continuity of land, the
only decisive proof; and that as he was the only person who had,
 I could form no opinion until I heard the particulars of what he
had seen, and which I did not do until in that very conversation.
 I could know nothing but from what he should say; I had not
seen anv land in the direction of the inlet; I should have been
 very happy to have been an evidence of its existence, and to have
judged for myself on so important an occasion, in preference to
depending on the account of another person.         But I was not on
deck when the land is stated to have been visible, nor was I in
 formed until nearly four hours afterwards that such an occurrence
 had taken place.      It was not necessary that I should be informed
 of it. It is true, Captain Ross had directed that ' Captain Sa
 bine be called whenever any remarkable object is to be seen in
 the sky or water,' (General orders, Nov. 8.) but I had not been
 called on this occasion, and therefore lost the sight of two very
 remarkable objects, namely, the ice in Lancaster's Sound, and
 the range of lofty mountains at its bottom.
    " The conversation alluded to, was occasioned by my very vi
 sible mortification at having come away from a place which. I
 considered as the most interesting in the world for magnetic ob
 servations, and where my expectations had been raised to the
 highest pitch, without having had an opportunity of making
 them.     Captain Ross explained to me his reasons for not having
 stood on in the inlet, amongst which reasons one was his opinion
 that there was no passage. He said that he was directed to keep
 at a distance from land, and not to entangle himself in sounds
 where he did not find the strong current which his instructions
 pomted out as an indication of a passage.         He said, ' You saw
 there was no appearance of such a current, no drift wood, which
 people at home talked of.'       I assented to the observation inas
 much as it related to facts. He further explained, that scientific
 observations were considered in his instructions as very secon
 dary; and however desirous he might be to stretch a point in my

 favour, he could not act in the face of his orders with such bad
 sailing ships and so late in the season.     Of course I made no re
ply ;   these  were matters  for his judgement, not for mine, and I
 was obliged to content myself under my disappointment.         I took
 the opportunity, however, of asking Captain Ross concerning the
 laud which he had seen the day before, the particulars of which
 he recounted ; but made no inquiry what I thought of them.

when above 30 miles from its entrance, an increased temperature
of the water*, and an open sea, were encouragements to our
progress westward, presenting themselves after we had entered
the inlet, which rendered the absence of what are popularly called
indications of     passage, of less comparative importance even
                      a
than usual.
   " For the particulars of this land, which stands alone to prove
that the expectations so generally excited in Lancaster's Sound
were fallacious,   was necessarily wholly dependent on Captain
                      I
Ross.    Even when he related them to me, did not think them
                                                   I

                                   I
my conviction grew, that Lancaster's Sound, as well as many
parts of the coast which we had passed before, would be revi
sited."
   The remaining part of this little work points out some differ
ences between Captain Ross's printed account and his previous
verbal statements respecting the land seen    him,' and its
                                                       by                      di

lieutenant  and two midshipmen, that the land, according to its
bearing, could not connect the north and south shores of the in
let by more than 30 degrees of the compass.
   Captain Ross, in p. 185, expresses regret that the dip of the
needle was not determined at Possession Bay; and in p. 177
assigns as the cause, that
                            " Captain Sabine thought the weather
too foggyfor the dipping needle." — " This statement," says Capt.
Sabine, " is incorrect.    So far from having said or thought so,
I asked Captain Ross's permission to take the dipping needle on
shore ; and was refused, on the ground that the boats were only
to remain for a few minutes on shore to take possession of the
country, and that he did not wish them to be detained by obser
vations."    We shall make but one quotation more.
   " In page 98, Captain Ross regrets that ' Captain Sabine and
the party who had on the morning of the 9th landed on that which
Mr. Biishnan had determined to be an island, had not proceeded
further, and that they did not examine the mountains where it
now appeared that this iron was found.' Captain Ross has omitted
to state that Captain Sabine and the party who were with him
on this island on the evening of the 8th       was not the morning
                                                        (it
of the 9th, as we were on board and under way before midnight)
returned in consequence        signal of. recall, and were told on
                                      of   a
their return that       being away so long they had detained the
                             by
ships."
  We are happy that     new expedition has been resolved on, to
                                  a
procure more certain information: for we have learnt nothing
certain respecting Lancaster's Sound from Captain Ross's work.

the authority of that navigator, respecting his having seen the
bottom of this inlet, or, as he calls         it,

'sound*,'     itcertainly  has more the  appearance of being the
entrance of the wished-for straits than any place we have yet
seen.   In the first place, the sea   perfectly clear of ice
                                        is                     and, ;
secondly, the water     iswarmer than we have found      since the

7th instant, being 36° at the surface, and 31" at the bottom.
The swell of the sea, the breadth of the opening, and the depth
of the water, are all flattering appearances; independently of
which, we are not at a great distance from where the sea was seen
by  Mr. Hearne, at the mouth of the Coppermine River.
   " On the morning of Sunday, the 30th, the wind being from
the eastward (by compass), we stood into the inlet abovemen-
tioned, and the more we advanced, the more sanguine our hopes
were that we had at last found what has been for ages sought in
vain.   Every thing, indeed, tended to confirm this our belief at        :
noon   we tried for soundings with two hundred and thirty-five
fathoms of line, without finding bottom       and in the evening,
                                                ;
when the sun was getting low, the weather being remarkably
clear, we could see the land on both sides of the inlet for    very  a
great distance, but not any at the bottom of it. The bearings
taken of the extremes of the land at this time are as follow:

    " The land on the south side of the inlet was high, and full of
sharp-pointed hills, which were completely covered with snow,
 having an appearance unusually grand.              In the vallies there were
 several large glaciers.       The coast appeared to trend W.                by
                                                                            S*

                                                  a
notch in it. This headland bore about N. 62 W. (true.)                    The
other extreme of this land bore about N. 32 W. (true.)
       The breadth of the inlet was estimated to be from ten to
 twelve leagues. Our latitude, to-day at noon, was 74° 21' 08"N.
 and longitude,     by chronometer, 79° 01' 46" W.               At night we
saw several stars, for the first time since we crossed the Arctic
 circle. Although we hailed them at first as old friends, bringing
into recollection the happy change of day and night in our na
tive clime, still, on    a little reflection, we could not fail to con
sider them as the harbingers of that dreary season which must,
in a little time, suspend our researches in these regions, unless
 we should be so fortunate as to accomplish the object in view be
fore that period arrives.

                                                                        by
pass) during the whole of the night, we made but little progress;
but on the following morning, the 31st, every thing tended,                       if
possible, to increase our hopes.           Not any ice was to be seen in
any   direction;   and   at  seven  o'clock,   the weather being remark
ably   fine and clear, land    was  not  to be   discerned between N. 21°
W., and N. 44° E. At this time, our distance from the northern
land was estimated at seven or eight leagues, and from the
southern, six or seven leagues; but, alas! the sanguine hopes
 and high expectations excited          by this promising appearance of
things,    were but  of  a  short  duration   ; for, about three o'clock          in
 the afternoon, the Isabella tacked, very much to our surprise in
 deed, as we could not see any thing like land at the bottom of
 the inlet, nor was the weather well calculated at the time for
 seeing any object at a great distance,              being somewhat hazy.

 When she tacked, the Isabella was about three or four miles a-
 head of us, so that, considering the state of the weather, and                   a
 part of this additional distance, for we did not tack immediately
 on her tacking, but stood on towards her, some allowance                   to
                                                                             is

 point in which we were so much interested but we must be con

   The Ashantees are mentioned                by
                                       Bosnian and Barbot as first
heard of     by
              Europeans about the year 1700; the latter calls                 it
Ashantee or Inta, and writes that          west of Mandingo, and

                           :                           wealth and  in
power. Mr. Dalzel heard of the Ashantees at Dahomey, as very
powerful ;  but imagined them, the Intas, and the Tapahs. to be
one and the same nation. Mr. Lucas, when in Mesurata, was                    in
formed that Assentai was the capital of the powerful kingdom of
Tonouwah.      In Mr. Murray's enlarged edition of Dr. Leyden's
Discoveries      Africa, we find, " The northern border of Akim
                  in
extends to Tonouwah, denominated also IntaAssiente or Assientai,
from its capital city of that name, which stands about eighteen
days' journey from the Gold Coast.
   In 1807 an Ashantee army reached the coast for the first time,
and did some injury to        Dutch settlement.
                                    a               The Ashantees
invaded Fantee again in 1811, and       third time in 1816, and on
                                               a
each occasion inflicted the greatest miseries.      The prolonged
blockade of Cape Coast Castle, in consequence of this last inva
sion, led the English governor to represent to the committee of
the African Association, the propriety ofventuring an embassy to
the kingdom of Ashantee, to conciliate the friendship of its so
vereign, and*.establish,       if
                            possible,   commercial alliance.
                                               a               The
suggestion was warmly taken up                by
                                      the African committee     and      ;
in 1817, the store-ship which went out carried liberal and valu
able presents, and every other authority and instruction neces
sary for the proposed mission. Mr. Bowdich was appointed con
ductor to the mission    and on the 22d of April
                           ;                        left Cape Coast

interior.
    The account which Mr. Bowdich has now presented to the
public of the progress and successful result of this mission is not
only extremely satisfactory, but possesses a degree of interest and
novelty not often equalled by books of travels.      We propose in
our subsequent numbers to gratify our readers with some valuable
extracts from it on matters peculiarly within the sphere of this
work ; but at present we shall confine ourselves to a single ex
tract from the chapter on the architecture of the Ashantees, which
serves to show, as much as any other part of their domestic ceco-
nomy, the advanced state of civilization to which they have
reached.
    " The  construction (says the author) of the ornamental archi
tecture   of Coomassie (the capital of Ashantee) reminded me
forcibly of the ingenious essay of Sir James Hall (in the Edin
burgh Philosophical Transactions) tracing the Gothic order to an
architectural imitation of wicker-work.       The character of their
architectural   ornaments is various and uncommon, adopted from
those of interior countries, aud confessedly in no degree origi
nating with themselves.
    " In building a house a mould was made for receiving the swish
or clay by two rows of stakes and wattle-work placed at a di
stance equal to the intended thickness of the wall, as two mud
walls were raised at convenient distances to receive the. plum-
pudding-stone which formed the walls of the vitrified fortresses
in Scotland.     The interval was then filled up with a gravelly clay
mixed with water, with which the outward surface of the frame
or stake-work was also thickly plastered, sx> as to impose the
appearance of an entire thick mud wall.         The houses had all
gable ends, and three thick poles were joined to each; one from
the highest point forming the ridge of the roof, and one on each
side from the base of the triangular part of the gable : these sup
ported a frame-work of bamboo, over which an interwoven thatch
of palm-leaves was laid and tied with the runners of trees, first
 to the large poles running from gable to gable, and afterwards
 (within) to the interlaying of the bamboo frame-work, which was
painted black, and polished so as to look much better than any
rude ceiling would, of which they have no idea.          The pillars
 which assist to support the roof and form the proscenium or open
 fronts (which none but captains are allowed to have to their
 houses) were thick poles afterwards squared with a plastering of
 swish.   The steps and raised floor of these rooms were clay and
 stone, with a thick layer of red earth which abounds in the neigh
 bourhood ; and these were washed and painted daily with an in
 fusion of the same earth in water ; it has all the appearance of

             Mission from Cape Coast Castle       to Ashantee.       383
 red ochre;    and from the abundance of iron ore in the neighbour
 hood,    I do not doubt it is.
     " The walls still soft, they formed moulds or frame-works of
 the patterns in delicate slips of cane connected by grass. The two
 first slips (one end of each being inserted in the soft wall) pro
jected the relief commonly called mezzo: the interstices were then
 filled up with the plaster, and assumed the appearance depicted.
 The poles or pillars were sometimes encircled by twists of cane
 intersecting each other, which being filled up with thin plaster
 resembled the lozenge and cable ornaments of the Anglo-Norman
 order ; — the quatre-foil was very common, and by no means rude
 from the symmetrical bend of the cane which formed it.            I saw
 a few pillars (after they had been squared with the plaster) with
 numerous slips of cane pressed perpendicularly on to the wet sur
 face, which being covered again with a very thin coat of plaster
 closely resembled fluting. When they formed a large arch, they
 inserted one end of a thick piece of cane in the wet clay of the
 floor or base, and bending the other over, inserted it in the same
  manner ; — the entablature was filled up with wattle-work plas
 tered over ; arcades and piazzas were common. A white-wash
 very frequently renewed was made from a clay in the neighbour
  hood.     Of course the plastering is very frail, and in the relief
 frequently discloses the edges of the cane, giving, however a pi
  quant effect auxiliary to the ornament.        The doors were an en
  tire piece  of cotton wood,   cut with great  labour  out of the stems
  or buttresses of that tree ; battens variously cut and painted were'
  afterwards nailed across.      So disproportionate was the price of
  labour to that of provision, that I gave but two tokoos for a slab
  of cotton wood five feet by three. The locks they use are from
  Houssa, and quite original ; — one will be sent to the British
  Museum. Where they raised a first floor, the under room was
  divided into two by an intersecting wall to support the rafters
  for the upper room, which were generally covered with a frame
  work thickly plastered over with red ochre.         I saw but one at
  tempt at flooring with plank ; it was cottoti wood shaped en
  tirely with an adze, and looked like a ship's deck. The windows
  were open wood-work carved in fanciful figures and intricate
  patterns, and painted red ; the frames were frequently cased in
  gold about as thick as cartridge paper.
      " What surprised me most, and is not the least of the many
   circumstances deciding their great superiority over the generality
   of Negroes, was the discovery that every house has its cloacae, be
  sides the common ones for the lower orders without the town.
   They were generally situated under a small archway in the most
   retired angle of the building ; but not ^mfrequently up stairs
                                                                   within

 within a separate room like a small closet, where the large hollow
 pillar also assists to support the upper story. The holes are of
 a small circumference, but dug to a surprising depth, and boiling     nc
 water is daily poured down, which effectually prevents the least
 offence.     The rubbish and offal of each house was burnt every
 morning at the back of the street ; and they were as nice and
 cleanly in their dwellings as in their persons."
     The author proceeds to give a particular description of several
 public and private buildings, which he has accompanied with some
 elegant and beautifully coloured drawings.
 Memoirs     of the  Caledonian Horticultural Society.    2 vols. 8vo,
                         with numerous Engravings.
     The Scotish Horticultural Society was instituted in 1809. One
 of its chief objects was to encourage practical gardeners to com
 municate any new information which their experience might from
 time to time furnish, and to afford facilities for its publication.
 The Society has, therefoie, published its Memoirs periodically, in
 parts or numbers, four numbers forming a volume ; and two vo
lumes have already been completed.          These contain more than
one hundred communications, on subjects so various that almost
every topic connected with horticulture is more or less treated
of.    It is a well known remark, that the comparative coldness
and variableness of the climate has operated as a spur to the in
genuity of Scotish gardeners ; and so high has their character
risen, that at this day, almost all the first-rate gardens of Eng
land are intrusted to the management of gardeners from Scot
land.     As a proof that this high character is probably well de
served, it may be mentioned that, among the authors of the
papers in these two volumes, there are no fewer than fifty-four
practical gardeners, men actively engaged in the superintendence
of the principal gardens in every district of the country.

has been actually ascertained by experiment, is capable of being

 section of the same branch, prepared with the composition, could
 not   be broken by the weight       of 1 12  pounds."

 It    gives us great pleasure to announce the very flourishing state
 of this Institution, which was founded in       1 800, and has ever since
 contributed largely to the advancement of the various branches
 of science. Its real value does not however appear to have been
 appreciated until lately ; for its income (derived from the sub
 scriptions of those who attend the Lectures and Library) has sel
 dom or ever been equal to its necessary expenditure, and conse
 quently it became involved in debt.           At the Annual Meeting in
 May     1818,  it appeared    from   the  Report   of the Visitors to the
 members,     that  the  income   of the  preceding year had for the first
 time exceeded the expenditure by 147^. 18*. 8d., and that the
 debts were reduced below 2200/.             That same Report also men
 tions a circumstance which ought to be universally known and
 recorded; viz. that John Fuller, esq. of Rose Hill, Sussex, had,

  is not taken in to. account in the above statement of accounts.
     The Lectures have never been better attended than in the pre
  sent season; and by the Report that was made to the General
  Meeting on the first of the present month, it appears the last year's
  income exceeded the expenditure by no less than 6S8Z.11*. 1ld.
 and the debt liad been reduced below 1500/. And as this was still
 without taking the munificent present of Mr * Fuller into account,
 there could be no doubt but the whole debt would be paid off
 before the close of the year, and some means adopted for esta
 blishing a permanent fund.
     Several valuable presents have also been received by the Insti
 tution, particularly a large collection of books, the property of
 the late Mrs. S. S. Banks, sister of Sir Joseph Banks, which were
 presented by his lady ; a magnificent brass hydraulic press on
 a iarge scale,, presented by Messrs. Bramah, and many other
 articles, chiefly books, instruments, and minerals. A subscription
 has likewise beeo set on foot for establishing a repository of mo
dels of manufacturing implements, improvements of various kinds,
and useful works of art*
     We must say that no pains have been spared by the Managers. or
Professors of this Institution to render it worthy of the encourage
ment (t now seems to be meeting from the public. We heartily
congratulate them on the success of their endeavours, and hope
 they will continue to persevere with that same zeal and energy
that has brought them into favourable notice.

Salt,— W/-B were too sanguine in our expectations of theresults
of the late expedition to the Arctic circle, and were disappointed.
Nay, the officers engaged in that perilous enterprise have been
by some unjustly criticized, because more had not been done—
because, in fact,: they could not overcome impossibilities.       The
results. of that great attempt were not brilliant— the fault was
not theirs— materials could not be collected where such did not
exist. They could not create; but I have no doubt that they
accomplished all that skilly perseverance and courage could com
mand,      I remember that in discussing the- prospects which we
might reasonably indulge, with that eminent astronomer, geo- •
grapher and hydrographer the Baron de Zach, at Genoa, — he
told me that he considered the expedition as one more hazard
ous than any which characterized the enterprises of Columbus,

then we must not expect great discoveries.          We ought not even
to be astonished (and those who know the difficulties and the
chances of these navigations will not), if we shall one day hear
that these vessels have not gone so far, and have not approached

               VARIATION     OF  THE MAGNETIC NEEDLE.
   The mistake seems to have prevailed, pretty generally, that
thewestern variation of the direction of the magnetic needle from
the meridian or true north, had some time ago reached its maxi
mum, and was now decreasing, and the needle at a very slow
rate approaching again towards the true north. The reverse of
this seems however to be the case, from the recent and delicate
observations of Colonel Mark Beaufoy, made at his seat near
Stanmore in Middlesex; whence it appears that the variation
uniformly increased from the month of April 1817 until January
 1819, and has fluctuated since. The total of increase in two years
to the 31st of March, as deduced from the monthly means of all
the observations, is 2' 25" ; — the mean of all the observations
made in the first quarter of the present year, shows the variation
to have been then 24° 37' 0".

who possess telescopes, and a taste for astronomy, suppose that
after looking at the sun, moon and planets, they have seen alt
that their instruments can show them; while the nebulae, double
stars, and other objects of extreme curiosity are neglected, from
a want of the knowledge of them, and the situations where they
are to be found. — I am persuaded such a table would promote

                      ANCIENT   CITY DISCOVERED.
     In the year 1772 excavations were by order of the French
 Government made in the small hill of Chatelet in Champagne,
 on the site of a Roman town destroyed in the wars of Attila, but
preserved in part by being covered with earth.        Many of the cu
 rious, articles there found are preserved in Paris in the house of
Abbe Tersan, a veteran of fourscore, who is occupied in getting
engravings from them for general.circulation.        An official report
 by M. Grignian presents some interesting details respecting this
 excavation.     The remains of about 90 houses, eight small crypts
 or subterraneous chapels, with a number of cellars, cisterns and
 wellsi were discovered. The streets, which were regularly paved,
 and quite straight, were only from 15 to 20 feet in width: the
                                                             pavement,

pavement, where the stones were uneven, was cemented with
river pebbles, or gravel.     The houses were oblong, and were
founded on a bed of stones bound together with lime. Only the
better houses had crypts, which were all nearly of one form — some
only 7 feet by 8 ; others 9 by 15: the descent to them was by
stone stairs, and the light was admitted by two openings.          The
cisterns were in diameter from 6 to 8 feet; in depth 15 to 18.
Some circular openings resembling wells, but probably drains (as
there are no springs in the hill), were found, in none of which was
water found, except one ; the deepest was 55 feet. Many frag
ments of beautiful pottery were found in them, thrown in, as is
supposed, by the slaves, to conceal their awkwardness from their
masters.      Water-pipes made of wood, some of them bound with
iron, were found ; also medals, fragments of statues, goblets,
spoons of various shapes — some oval, others circular; lamps,
rings, pins, amulets, weighing-scales, surgical instruments, locks
and keys — The keys were some of copper, some iron, the smaller
on rings, and many of them like those now in use. Wheels, nails,
dishes, knives, and scissars,were likewise found ; also many pieces
of iron which had escaped decay by being covered with hard lime ;
likewise pieces of bone, and styli for writing on wax tables, of
from 3 to 4 inches in length. Many fragments of glass were col
lected, and of a quality which showed that the manufacture was
by no means in a state of infancy.
                      ERUPTION   OF A VOLCANO.
                                                Batavia, Nov. 7,1818.
     M. Rienwardt, Director of the Affairs relative to Agriculture,
 Arts and Sciences, was last month in the government of Preang
during a violent eruption of the volcano of Goenoing, and has
 communicated many important particulars respecting it. The
 first effects were perceived on the 21st of October between ten
 and eleven P.M. when the mountain amidst violent shocks, which
were felt at Trogong, began to throw up from the summit red
 hot stones in immense quantities and a great mass of lava. Hap
pily the wind blowing from the south-west, carried all these in
 flamed bodies towards the uninhabited mountains, and the in
 habited districts were spared.     The eruption lasted till noon of
 the 24th.     Besides the principal crater at the summit of the
 mountain, its sides at different heights also emitted fire and
smoke for several days after the eruption.
     On the 28th of October, M. Rienwardt attempted to ascend
 the mountain, which was very troublesome and dangerous, on
 account of its height and steepness, and the heaps of loose and
 sharp stones, as well as the heat of the ground, and the rolling
 down of stones from the summit.         It became more difficult as

they ascended higher. M. Rienwardt had left Trojxong at day
break, and nearly reached thi summit at 2 o'clock m the after
noon! The barometer stood then at 25-35 English inches, and the
 thermometer at 75^ of Fahrenheit.              He now hoped, with an
other effort, to reach the spot where the eruption took pi ace; .but
was obliged to desist, and to leave this dangerous place, by the
coming loose of a large mass of the upper heap of stones.             The
Goerioing-Goenloer is part of a chain of mountains, almost all
situated in a direction north-east to south-west.            The mountain
of Agon to the. N.E. is nearly of the same height as the volcano,
which is near 3,100 English feet above Trogong, and 5,200Eng-
lish feet above the level of the sea.
     MEDICAL PROPERTIES OF HYDROSULPHURATE OF IRON.
    Professor Van Mons has discovered that the hydrosulphurate of
iron, produced by iron, sulphur, and~wafer, possesses when taken
internally the property of making- salivation instantly cease as if
by enchantment j sand when administered. externally, of curing the
worst of scabs and sores.— Journal de la Medecine de la Bel-

                    EXPERIMENTAL DESIDERATA.
                             To Mr. Tilloch.
     Sir, — It has often struck me that many valuable facts might
 he added to science, if occasional series of queries or experiments
 were published, by way of turning the attention of those who
 have leisure and opportunity, to particular points in the ceconomy
 of nature, or the wide held of philosophical research. Many per
 sons have a peculiar turn for certain pursuits, and would feel a
 satisfaction in communicating their results, if invited to do it by
 the method I take the liberty to recommend.          By this means,
 those who were more deeply versed in science might avail them
 selves of the labours of others, who only required a few hints in
 order to regulate their observations and direct their inquiry.       It
 might lead persons of congenial habits to a closer connexion, and
 many a hint might be thrown out calculated to excite a spirit of
 investigation tending to important results.     As an illustration of
 the object I propose,     I  would submit the following queries and
 experiments to be tried in the course of the summer.
     Q. 1. — Let seeds of different sorts be placed at different and
given depths (say a foot asunder) in the earth, in soil of similar
 quality in flower-pots. Required the appearance of each set at
 the expiration of three months.       What degree of vegetation was
 observable, and what increase of weight.       This experiment may
throw considerable light on many singular facts respecting the
sudden appearance of plants and flowers where none had been
known to exist for years before ; and also upon some other points
in the ceconomy of nature which require further attention.
     Q. 2.— Place certain seeds in similar. soils, let them be sup
plied with equal portions of water impregnated with various in
gredients — for instance, the different salts or gases, or nitrations
from dung or other substances in a state of decay. Required their
increase of weight, and appearance as to health and luxuriance,
 at the end of a given time.
     Q. 8. — A similar experiment might be tried, and similar re-
                                  B b 4                            suits

392                              Botany.
suits required, if the seeds were made to vegetate under parti
cular gases, water of the same quality being used in each case.
    Hitherto mueh difficulty and uncertainty has been experienced
in constructing hygrometers. — Query, Have any experiments been
tried to ascertain how far absorbing substances might be used in
forming them?      Might not one be constructed, by exposing a
given portion Of perfectly dried mouldering whin-stone to the
air for a certain time, and observing the increase of weight ?
 Common brick-dust or sulphuric acid are also well known to be
equally absorbent, and might be used with success.          E. S.
    *„*  Experiments   similar to some  of  those recommended   by
our correspondent have been made at different times ; but they
may certainly be varied and extended.         Absorbent substances
have been tried as hygrometers ; none however will answer the
purpose that do not possess also the property of giving off mois
ture, in dry weather, within the usual range of atmospheric tem
perature. Sulphuric acid therefore, and all substances that have
a strong tendency to absorb water, but not to part with       must      it,
necessarily be excluded from hygrometric substances, in the com

                          CYCAS CIRCINALIS.
    In the month of June last year there was exposed for sale in
the flower-market of Paris,      plant rarely met with in northern
                                 a
countries, and which attracted       agreat deal of notice.     It was
the Cycas of the East Indies (Cycas circinalis),     species
                                                       a       of palm
and an evergreen,* the stalk of which rises in its native habitat
to the height of from three to five metres, and then divides into
 a number of very short branches.        It  crowned
                                              is           bycluster of

 viously to their perfect development, but afterwards turned out
wards.     The collets of the male flowers take sometimes an ap
pearance very similar to a large pine-apple. The female flowers
yield an oval nut of the size of     asmall orange.    The Indians
eat the almonds of these fruits, and make sort of sago of thenv
                                                   a
which they prize greatly.     The nuts of the Cycas of Japan (Cy
cas revoluta) are particularly valued on this account. The speci
men then exhibited in the Parisian market had five stalks very
straight, and armed with prickles in manner nearly similar to the
                                         a
 Eglantine.    The Emperor of Austria gave for the fellow of                  it   in
 1814 no less than 5000 francs (208/. 6s. English).

August 1818, it presented the phenomenon so rare to this plant,
of being in flower.    It began to expand between seven and eight
o'clock at night ; it was entirely open at eleven, but at four
o'clock next morning it again collapsed, and was quite closed up
at five o'clock.
   In the Memoires du Museum d'Hisloire Nalurelle, (vol. iii.
p. 190) M. Desfontaines has given an interesting account of a
species of this plant indigenous to Mexico, which flourished in the
course of July 1817 in the Jardin des Plantes at Paris.        The
short-lived flowers of this plant are inodorous, of a blood-red
colour, and of the most sparkling brilliancy.
                             SPHYNX ATROPOS.
        The great dryness of the summer of 1818             has been the cause
 of an unusual multiplication of insects, and of attracting towards
the north some species which seemed confined by nature to south
ern latitudes.     Among this number the Journals of France take
particular  notice    of a species of Lepidoptera, which lias made its
appearance   in   that    country, known by the name of the Sphynx
Death's Head(Sphynx Atropos L.), so called on account of three
black spots in the centre of a yellow spot of its corslet, which
form a pretty exact resemblance of a Death's head. It has proved
extremely destructive to that valuable branch of rural industry —
the Apiary.     In the months of August and September last, nu
merous hives, especially in the department of Lower Charente,
were wholly destroyed by its ravages.         The animal has been ac
cused by the people of not only attacking the bees and devouring
them, but of sucking the honey with the utmost avidity.              The
fact      is,
         however, that the Sphynx Atropos has no organ fit for
devouring bees.        Its mouth consists of      beak not very long,
                                                   a
with which       sucks or may suck the honey from the combs
                it                                                    but
                                                                        ;
     does kill the bees,                    by the action of its wings.
It if

   appears pretty clear, however, that the bees when supposed to
be devoured have only fled out of the way of their enemy.              It
has been observed, that as soon as the low funereal sound, which
the Sphynx Atropos produces           by
                                       sticking its antennae against its
beak,     heard in the neighbourhood of

and in many instances, which have no doubt given rise to the
vulgar idea of their being devoured, the colony have been seen
immediately to abandon their habitation in           body, never to re

in all probability, only when the bees attempt an unavailing de
fence of their treasures, or are too tardy         their flight, that any

   An effectual means of protecting bee-hives from tbe attacks of
this animal, would probably be to shut up all avenues to the hives
but those which are strictly necessary for the entrance and exit
of the bees. It might also he advisable to avoid planting pota
toes, garden beans, or jessamine, in their vicinity. But undoubt
edly: the best thing for an apiary threatened by such an enemy
to do, is to employ persons to beat up his usual: haunts and de
stroy him . The insect may be easily recognised by its large Mze
and yellow coat, with spots of a light or dark green.

    It appears from communication which Captain Call, cele
                     a                                         a
brated apiarian residing at Taplow-hill near Maidenhead, has
lately made to the Secretary of the British Apiarian Society,
meeting at No. 205, Piccadilly, that every reasonable degree of
success and profit attends the mode of extracting       part of the
                                                           a
comb and honey from the hives at successive periods. The weight
of honey and comb in 22 of Captain C.'s hives, after deducting
the weight of these hives, was ascertained on the 7th of Sep
                                                           1
tember last to be 641 lbs.; and from which subsequently, in
September and October, 207 jibs, of honey were extracted, at
two operations  ;  which     at the rate of 324 lbs. of honey and

9 lbs. 7 oz. from each hive, on the average of the whole, or 26 lbs.
for each of the eight hives which were actually deprived of honey.
 Fifteen of the above 22 hives were weighed at five different pe
 riods, the collective weight tof whose honey and comb was found
.to be 438 lbs. ; which last weight increased to 1000 : and the other
four weights being increased in the exact same proportion, they
stand as follows ; viz. In September 1000 lbs., in October 998 lbs.
on December 15th, 751 lbs., on January 25th, 669 lbs., and on
 March 1 1th, 521 lbs. of honey and comb : these weighings being
intended for showing the rate of the bees' winter consumption of
 honey.
                           >om01SONED  EGGS.
    A small farmer in the village of Heath, near Wakefield in York
shire, lately had several of his hens die, owing, as has since ap
peared, to a neighbour into whose garden they had been in tha
habit of straying, having strewed barley impregnated or mixed
with arsenic, in order to destroy them.      One of these poisoned
hens laid an egg about an hour before she died, which the far-
.tner unknowingly ate, fried with a collop, (being then in perfect
health,) but he was soon after seized with violent pains and sick
ness. — An experienced medical man who was called-in two hours
afterwards, instantly pronounced, from the symptoms, that poison
had been taken, and immediately administered an emetic and
castor oil, by which the patient's life was saved : but he continued
ill for several days, and without doubt, it is said, he would have
died if medical aid had not been called in. — This ought to operate
as a cautiou against this not uncommon, yet dangerous mode of
ridding oneself of trespass from our neighbours' poultry.      It has
excited the surprise of many that the egg could become so
strongly infected with the arsenic, before the hen was killed by
it. On the discovery of the cause of the farmer's hens dyings
his wife cut open the crops of two of those which lately had
sickened, and after carefully emptying the crops of all the barley
and other matters and washing them out, sewed them up again ;
and strange to sav, they survive, and seem likely to recover..
                        EUHARMONIC ORGAN.
     Mr. John Alsager the organist, who in May 1817 went out
with one of Mr. Liston's patent organs to Calcutta, (as is men
tioned in vol. xlix. p. 266) safely arrived there in the begiuning
of September following ; and the church of St. Andrew, then
building for the Presbyterian or Scotch congregation, being nearly
finished, the organ was erected under Mr. Alsager's direction,
and tuned by him, and at the opening of the church, on Sunday
 the 8th of March 1 S 18, gave universal satisfaction.      We learn
 that Mr. A. has been commissioned to order a chamber organ to
                                                                   be

now building by Messrs. Flight and Robson in St. Martin's Lane:
and which when finished, will, it is,hoped, be exhibited to pro
fessors and amateurs, as on the former occasions. The four notes
intended to be introduced in this organ, besides those of the St.
Andrew's church organ mentioned in our xlixth volume, p. 26S,
are Ab=4042, A*, = 4872, D'b = 682, andD,*=1292 (which
latter, is not one of the 59 notes of Mr. Liston's " Essay:" and
besides which, it is intended .to omit B'b, and substitute Fb =
2182.      It is intended to use, occasionally, 9 pedals, in changing
the notes when required,       for adapting   the scale to the twelve
 finger-keys in use.

 LXVI.     On   Dr. Murray's Statement respecting the Origin of
    the Doctrine of Definite Proportions, and the Arrangement
    of the Elementary Principles of Chemical Compounds. By
   William Higgins,        Esq.
                             To   Mr. Tillocli.
 Sir, — You     will much oblige me by inserting in your Maga
zine, the following observations on an extract taken from the
first volume of Dr. Murray's System of Chemistry (page 127,
4th edition, 1819).
    "In a work (pays the Doctor) published by Mr. Higgins a
number of years ago (A Comparative View of the Phlogistic and
Anti-phlogistic Theories, with Inductions, 1789) some cases of
 chemical compounds are stated, in which the chemical combina
 tions are held to consist of one particle of the one body, with one
 particle, two particles, three, four, or five of another.    In sul
 phurous acid a single particle of sulphur is supposed to be united
with a single particle of oxvgen, and in sulphuric acid with two
 particles of oxygen (page 36). Water is held to be composed of
 one particle of oxygen with one of hydrogen, and to be incapable
of uniting to a third particle of either (page 37). In sulphu
 retted hydrogen the particles of sulphur are supposed to be to
 those of hydrogen as nine to five* (page 81): and in the nitrous
compounds he supposed one particle of nitrogen to be combined
with two particles of oxygen, forming nitric oxide; one with three,
constituting red nitrous acid ; one with four, constituting the pale
yellow acid; and one with five, forming colourless nitric acid (page
 133-5-)-).   But in these statements there is no trace of any in
duction that this might be a general law of chemical combina
tion ; the opinion was not extended beyond those few cases, nor
was it brought forward with any prominent distinction : it ac
cordingly attracted no attention ; and Mr. Higgins himself ne
ver prosecuted       it,
                     nor announced        further, until he advanced
                                              it
his pretensions subsequent to the publication of Mr. Dalton's
System.     He certainly therefore has little or no claim to the
doctrine."
  The Doctor might    add more important cases to the foregoing
outlines; yet the few he brings forward are sufficient to prove,
although he did not intend        it,
                               that the doctrine of definite pro
portions and the arrangement of the elementary principles of
chemical compounds were clearly developed at that distant pe
riod. Why did not the Doctor give us the outlines of Mr. Dal-
   * Suppositionis out of the question, all these statements are supported
hy accurate experiments.
f    The Doctor omitted the gaseous oxide, which consists of one and one.

402    Mr. Higgins's          Observations on   Dr. Murray's Statement
ton's System, by way of contrast ? — were he to attempt   he could  it,
not produce     single new fact in his favour, except that of ma
                     a
king the particle of hydrogen as the standard weight of those of
other bodies.
   Few as the foregoing cases whjch the Doctor adduces may ap
pear, Lavoisier's anti-phlogistic theory, or the doctrine of Sir
Isaac Newton respecting the laws of gravitation, might be con
fined to still fewer.
   We will now attend to the Doctor's remarks on those cases,
as he calls them.     " But these statements, &c." Nothing can
                                  in
be more glaringly unjust than this assertion, as the following ex
tract taken from my Comparative View will prove. After having
shown      by
            means of diagrams and numbers, that the one particle
of oxygen      united to the one particle of sulphur in the atom of
                is
sulphurous acid, with greater force than the two particles of oxy
gen in the atom of sulphuric acid, in consequence of the force of
attraction of the particle of sulphur being equally divided be
tween the two of oxygen,          I proceeded thus
                                                         " This seems to be
                                                         :
a  general law all bodies unite with greater force to half the
                         :
quantity of those substances to which they have an affinity, than
to the entire — instance, carbonate of potash will part with
                 ;                                                         cer
                                                                           a
tain portion of its carbonic acid in            amoderate degree of heat,
yet   itrequires     very strong heat to expel the whole.
                         a                                              In like
manner crystallized sulphate of potash' will part with most of its
water in    aheat below ignition, but       it requires      strong red heat
                                                             a
to drive away the entire of its water.            Thus we find, in propor
tion as the potash         deprived of one part of its carbonic acid, its
                             is
power    of  retaining    the  remainder    is  increased    : and the same
law holds good as to the expulsion of water from the salts.                     I
shall forbear mentioning several other circumstances of the like
nature*."      Dr. Wollaston had written            paper on this subject
                                                     a                          a
few years ago, without any reference to what                 advanced thirty
                                                             I
years   back   of
                : this     have
                             I   taken  notice   in this  Magazine,    vol. 51,
page   169.    Here   follows   another   extract   on   the  same   laws   ex
tended to metallic oxides          :
                                    " have already shown upon what
                                       I
principle the bases of the acids retain their oxygen with less force
when fully saturated with          than when united to
                                  it                          asmall portion.
 The same law holds good in all other combinations, and                     ex
                                                                           is
plicable on the same principles.          Almost all bodies will unite to
 the different substances to which they have an affinity, in various
 proportions until they arrive at the point of saturation, which
limits their power of chemical attraction.             There are exceptions
 to those laws; — instance, the elementary principles of water will
only unite in one proportion, so that we can never obtain                 in au
                                                                          it

                                                                  intermediate

  on the    Origin of  the  Doctrine   of Definite Proportions, &c.        403
  intermediate state.        The cause of this I have already attempted
  to demonstrate.        Metals will unite to oxygen in various propor-
- tions until they are saturated.         If 100 grains of a metal are only
  capable     of uniting   to fifteen grains of oxygen, they will attract
  and retain five grains      with  greater force than ten, and ten grains
  with greater force than fifteen*."
        In the foregoing example I made use of the numbers 5, 10, 15,
  the two latter of which being multiples of the former, in order
  to the establishment of the principles of definite proportions, and
  it accords with many similar examples in my Comparative View.
       Dr. Murray, in treating on those principles, which originated
  with me, does not take the smallest notice of the source whence
  he derived his information, although in his explanation he makes
  use of nearly the same words, as the following short extract ¦
   taken from his chapter on chemical attraction will show.                " If
   100 parts of a metal combine in one combination with ten of
  oxygen, and in another combination with twenty of oxygen, ten
  parts of oxygen in the latter compound will be easily abstracted,
  while the other ten parts, or that proportion which constitutes
  the first compound, will be retained with a much more powerful
   force.     Sulphur combines with two proportions of oxygen ; the
  larger proportion which exists in one of these is easily abstracted,
   while the entire quantity is abstracted with more difficulty.
   Charcoal and oxygen afford a similar example f." So he goes
   on. Were I to comment on the foregoing circumstances as they
   deserve, it would be too severe ; therefore I leave my readers to
  judge for themselves, and I have not the smallest doubt but they
   will feel as I do at this present moment.                                    t-
        Having demonstrated by        means   of diagrams  and   numbers the
   laws by which certain metals precipitate others in their metallic
   state from solution in acidsj, I next proceeded to the cause of
   some metals precipitating others in the state of oxides.              " Let
   us suppose lOO grains of tin when in perfect solution in acids, to
   be united to 15 grains of oxygen with the force of 5 .5.                 Let
   iron attract oxygen with the force of seven, and let us suppose
   this force of the iron to be reduced to six by the accession of
   7-5 grains of oxygen § taken from the tin, and the attraction of
  the tin to the remaining oxygen to be increased by the abstrac
   tion of this quantity of oxygen : in this case iron cannot preci
   pitate tin in its metallic state, although it may have greater at
  traction to oxygen than the tin has. Hence it is evident that a
                                            f

  tiple of the former ; this cannot be supposed to be mere chance.

404     Mr. Higgins's   Observations on      Dr. Murray's         Statement
metal in order to precipitate another metal in its metallic state,
must not only unite to oxygen in greater quantities, and attract
it more forcibly, but that this superiority of force must be very
 considerable*.
   The reader is to understand that this species of philosophy
was not known before I published my Comparative View.             Let
us now attend to the Doctor's next observation :              "
                                                         The opinion
was not extended, &c."       It was not a fanciful business, or mat
ter of mere opinion ; what I advanced was prominently distin
guished, being supported by experiments and demonstrations ;
it stood the test of subsequent investigations, and is now adopted
by all the philosophers of Europe ; and the opinion was extended
mbeyond the few facts which the Doctor was pleased to bring for
ward, as the foregoing extracts will sufficiently prove.          "It
                                                             accord- *
ingly attracted no attention." The work, it is true, did not attract
that attention which the doctrine it established and elucidated
merited; but this is not to be wondered at, when we consider that
at the time it was written, chemistry had not obtained the rank
of a science, and had not a fixed doctrine to guide it. " And Mr.
Higgins himself never prosecuted       it,
                                         nor announced       further,
                                                                   it
until, &c."
  So far as relates to the development of fundamental principles
it could not be advanced           single step, even at this day, be
                                   a
yond the limits at which     I left off in my Comparative View.               I
have indeed applied       it   little more extensively in my Atomic
                               a
Theory,   and  also  in a   paper   on the connexion of light and ca
loric, published in this Magazine, vol. 51, page 81. There             as is
much originality    in  this paper,   and  perhaps  it   as
                                                         is interesting
as any of the principles developed in my Comparative View and           ;
yet.it has not been noticed, nor should       I myself mention it, had
not the subject in question led me to it. Probably in about twenty
years hence some writer will announce          itas his own, together
with my hypothesis on electrical phanomena.            And to give             it
greater publicity was impossible,      unlessI were to puff    off in the
                                                                   it
daily prints or monthly magazines, which would be             species of
                                                                  a
quackery beneath any man of science besides,  :           Ihad not the
smallest doubt but   it  would sooner or latter make its own way,
asI  predicted in the preface.
     The work  was presented to the public in as simple and con
spicuous    style as the nature of the subject would admit of; and
             a
ifthe period at which      appeared was not sufficiently matured to
                          it
appreciate its merit,   itcould not be the fault of the author. As
to advancing my pretensions subsequent to Mr. Dalton's publi
cation,   am surprised the Doctor should make use of such ex
            I
pressions, having the date and facts of my Comparative View
                    * Comp. View, pages 275, 276.

       on the Origin   of the Doctrine of Definite Proportions, &c. 405
     before him. A man must be very stupid, or timid, who, on find
     ing his property invaded, would not step forward to defend it ;
     and this I did when attacked by Mr. Dalton and his accomplices.
     I was perfectly aware of the importance of the system which              I
     promulgated with so much labour, study and care ; as the dia
     grams, and the various demonstrations that appear throughout
     the work will fully prove.
         Twenty-three years have elapsed since I was appointed Pro
     fessor of Chemistry to the honourable the Dublin Society by the
     act of parliament which established the professorship ; and ever
     since, what is called the. Atomic Theory formed a part of my
     annjjaj, course of lectures.          My learned friend Dr. Haworth,
              "trie ldphysicians of Bartholomew's       hospital, and formerly
  ^- on
    fohe   of  the  Radcliff  travelling  fellows  from  Oxford, with whom I
     had the pleasure of being intimately acquainted at the university,
     before I published, zealously espoused my system soon after it
     appeared. We bo,th, I remember, were not a little amused at the
      reviewers of the day, who scarcely knew what to make of it; but
     most of th.em|fparticularly those of the English and Analytical
     Reviews, allowed* that it upset the phlogistic theory.
         Notwithstanding the confidence I felt as to the importance of
     my system, yet I would have remained silent, and left it to pos
     terity to judge of it when I was no more, had it not been for the
     attempt made to wrest it from me while living and able to de
      fend it.
         " He certainly therefore has little or no claim." To have no
     claim because I was silent until Mr. Dalton published, that              is,
     until Mr. Dalton laid hold of the fruits of my labour — a very is
     strange mode of reasoning.
       I   have made so many replies to attacks similar to that of Dr.
     Murray that  I       consider
                                it      needless to say any thing more    ;I
     therefore refer my reader to vol. 48 of this Magazine, pages 363
     and 408 ;      to vol. 50, page 407   ;     and to vol. 51, pages 81 and
      161;    and also to my Atomic Theory, which may be had of
     Longman, Hurst, and Co.       I       must however make the following
     remarks :
         When wrote the Comparative View in the year 1788, (for
             I                                                                it
.    was published in March 1789,) the attention of the philosophical
     world was entirely engaged       by      the arguments brought forward
 iai pro and con the antagonist doctrines, so that nothing else was
 v jninded: at that time
  .                          I        was the only person in Great Britain
    .that adopted the theory of Lavoisier in France very few of his
                                               ;
     countrymen supported him, and scarcely any on the rest of the
     continent countenanced his theory.
       I   readily perceived from the arguments advanced          by   the dif
     ferent writers on both sides of the question, that nothing deci-
                                     C c

406         Mr. Higgins's        Observations on     Dr. Murray's Statement
sive could be accomplished, and that in order to completely de
tect the errors of the one doctrine, or to confirm the truth of the
other, some new mode of investigation must be adopted. During
this arduous and minute investigation, that system which is now
called the Atomic Theory gradually started up before me at every
step I advanced.      And by these means my object was so far
crowned with success, that the delusion of the phlogistic doctrine
was no longer doubted. Mr. Kirwan, Dr. Black, Mr. Cavendish,
Dr. Higgins, &c. recanted ; and there was nothing heard of this
memorable contest, except a few feeble efforts made by Dr.
Priestley to revive it at its last gasp. During this clashing of
opinions it could not be supposed that the refined mode of in -
vestigation which I invented, should be understood or attended
to, only so far as related to the grand question of the day ; and I
so soon as the controversy ceased, my book, which put an end to
it, ceased to be interesting, and of course to be read because the       ;
public looked for nothing else in the work, from the very title
of     " Comparative View of the Phlogistic and Anti-phlogistic
      it,
Theories."
   Notwithstanding the active part       had taken with so much
                                                  I
success in this memorable controversy, Dr. Murray never men
tioned my name in his historical sketch on the subject, although
he enumerates the few French chemists who joined Lavoisier in
defence of his theory.   Every liberal-minded man must condemn                                N
such conduct; for     shows either determined prejudice or

extract, taken from the Journal de Physique for May 1817, page
392, describes    " Here, even Mr. Higgins has proved himself

a foreigner should do me that justice which my fellow-subjects of
Scotland so shamefully withhold.
    Much of what Dr. Murray advances in his chapter on Chemi
cal Affinities, but particularly what relates to the various modi
fications occasioned by the beautiful laws of definite proportions,
is to be found for the first time in my Comparative View, with
the proportions also in which the gases unite in volumes.
    The modifications of attraction occasioned by the solvent
power of water on saline substances, gums, sugars, &c. together
with the power by which water dissolves gases, and the gases
water, were introduced for the first time in the same work, and
represented as a species of influence intermediate between che
mical attraction and that of aggregation or gravitation, but nearer
the former than the two latter*.
    1 also introduced another modification of attraction with which
chemists were not acquainted at the time ; viz. that dry oxygen
will not unite to dry inflammable bodies in the common tempe
rature of the atmosphere, not even with iron, without the me
diation of water, or a sufficiency of moisture ; and that under
these circumstances it is the oxygen of the water that unites
to the inflammable bodies, while the oxygen of the gas unites to
the hydrogen of the water in its nascent state, so as to repro
duce water; — this fact was proved by experiments f.
   Chemistry derived considerable advantage by calculating the
relative forces of bodies to oxygen one and one and one and two,
&c. : instance, we should not be able to account for the different
phaenomena      produced bv the action of concentrated sulphuric
acid, dilute sulphuric acid, and sulphurous acid on iron and zinc
and other metals, without this knowledge.       It enables us to ac
count upon incontrovertible principles, that during the solution
of iron in dilute sulphuric acid, the atom of acid is completely
decomposed, that        deprived of the whole of its oxygen,
                       is,                                          by

  408    Mr.Higgins's Observations        on  Dr. Murray's    Statement
 united to one particle of oxygen with the force of 6£, they must
 move together with equal pace to meet the metal, and conse
 quently no hydrogen is liberated.         The demonstrations which I
 produced to support those principles will bear the strictest scru
 tiny*.
    I  would advise     Dr. Murray to read over more carefully this
 part of my system, and to correct his explanation on the same
 subject in his chapter on chemical attraction.           He also gives a
 wrong explanation on the cause of the inflammation or combina
 tion of inflammable gases;and oxygen gas by the electric or com
 mon spark.       I refer him on that subject to my Atomic Theory,
 pages 28, 29.       I could point out many more false explanations ;
 but as doI    not   intend to act the part of a reviewer, I will pass
 them over, self-defence being my present object.            All the laws
 resulting from definite proportions derive their origin from my
 Comparative View, as I have repeatedly proved.
    The relative quantity of matter, or relative size of the ultimate
 particles of gases, was also deduced, in the same work, from their
 specific gravities, making an allowance for the size of their re
 spective atmospheres of caloric : thus, although a cubic inch
 of oxygen gas is fourteen times heavier (some make it more)
 than a cubic inch of hydrogen gas; yet, as there are but half the
number of particles in the latter that the former contains, the
particles of oxygen can be no more then seven times heavierf.
 The ultimate atoms of the gaseous oxide of azote are nearly one-
fourth lighter than those of nitrous gases ; yet the latter gas is
lighter in volume than the gaseous oxide, in consequence of the
expansion occasioned by its calorific atmospheres {not tempera-
ture%).
    The ultimate particles of azotic gas are almost twice as heavy
as those of oxygen gas, yet the latter gas is heavier in volume.
This is ascertained by the fact, that one cubic inch of azote con
tains only the same number of particles that half a cubic inch of
oxygen contains ; for this is the proportion of the constituents of
the gaseous oxide, being a compound of one and one.               It bears
the same proportion with those of the constituent principles of
water, and the same inference as to the relative weight of their
respective particles may be fairly deduced §.          Oxygen gas dimi
nishes very little by uniting to sulphur in the proportion of one
and one ; and as the resulting compound (sulphurous acid gas)
is only about twice the weight of oxygen gas, the ultimate parti
cles of both elements must contain nearly the same quantity of
matter, and the siee of the calorific atmospheres of the acid atoms
must also be the same with those of the particles of oxygen gas

 the gas will not increase or diminish on uniting to two portions
 of the latter.
     By the foregoing means have I been enabled to ascertain the
 relative weights of the ultimate particles of matter, and there is
 no other way whatever left to arrive at so desirable and so im
 portant an object. I should presume that the specific gravity of
 the ultimate particles of all bodies is the same, their size con
 stituting the difference of their weights.
     I shall terminate this part of the subject by the following
 extract, taken from my Comparative View (pages 255, 256) :
"   Metals in their simple state are insoluble in water ; but com
bined with acids they are soluble.       Iron and sulphur chemically
united form an insoluble mass ; iron and oxygen form also an
insoluble compound; but iron, oxygen and szdphur will form a
very soluble compound.        Azote in its simple state has no sen
sible affinity  to  metals ; yet when combined with a sufficiency
of oxygen it will unite to them and render them soluble. It is
clear from these facts, although oxygen alone will not render
metals soluble in water, that it is through its mediation a third
body will unite and form a soluble compound.        But which of the'
three substances has the solvent power most inherent in           it,   is
what we cannot pretend to explain."
 I    only produce the foregoing passage in consequence of seeing
something on the same principle adduced by Dr. Murray in his
chapter on Attraction (page 6'4), in which he quotes Berthollet
on the same subject, as explaining the cause of the solubility of
saline substances, &c.    ; yet he takes no notice of the above re
marks made at so early a period of the progress of chemical
science.
    The Doctor, in order to deal fairly, should add some of the
above cases, as he calls them, to the few he has quoted in his note:
but no doubt he was aware, had he done so, that little or none
would have been left for Dalton, Gay-Lussac, Berthollet, and
                                                                             '

   410   Mr.  Higgins's Observations        on  Dr. Murray's      Statement.
   runs through almost the whole of his chapter dh Attraction, he
   never mentions my name ; and the extract which is the object of
   this paper was in a note at the foot of the page, in order to have
  it detached from the body of his compilation.
      In my early days I happened to embark in controversy on a
   philosophical question of the first importance to chemistry. I had
   at that time to contend with philosophers and gentlemen, who
  had no other object in view but the advancement of science. Far
   from being envious, they felt a pride to appreciate the labours and
  talents of others. Of late I have had no philosophers to contend
  with, nor scientific questions to discuss. The question on which
   I have been occasionally engaged the last four years, is simply
  this, whether the ^Atomic System be Mr. Dalton's or mine. From
  the number of evidences on record, nothing could be more readily
   decided than this point, were it not for prejudice and want of re
  spect for truth and justice ; and I believe ignorance also stands
  somewhat in the way, for the most important part of my system
  has been overlooked.
      What can be more glaringly unjust than to bring forward my
  own facts and examples, nearly in the same words, to support
  Mr. Dalton's pretensions, and those of others ? This unparalleled
  ill treatment may be traced through the whole of the publications
  of Drs. Murray and Thomson, particularly so far as relates to the
  Atomic Theory; and I experienced the same shameful treatment
  from those who wrote on the same subject for the Cyclopcedias.
  When those gentlemen despise truth and justice they certainly
  can have no love or respect for science.              To men who are de
  termined to act contrarily to their judgement and integrity facts
  are useless, and arguments can no longer avail *.
      As I have brought forward repeatedly and on various occasions
   (more for the sake of science than for anv selfish views of my
  own) a number of undenied facts to support my claim, I shall
  now take leave of the subject for ever.             I have done my dut\\
  and leave the public to judge for themselves ; being convinced
  that though many have been imposed on, the deception cannot be
  of long duration.       I am, sir,
                             Your very humble servant,
                                                       William Higgins.
     * I cannot pass over the liberality of Mr. Parkes, who hands over my sy
  stem to Mr. Dalton.    He tells us in his Chemical Catechism (8th edition !
  page 483, 1818) that he felt
                                " desirous, in justice to Mr. Dalton, to say that
  we are indebted to him for our first ideas respecting this important doctrine,
  on which he has built his Atomic Theory." Mr. Parkes should first read my
  Comparative   View, and study the theory in its original state, before he ven
  tured to give an opinion on a subject with which he appears to be so slightly
  acquainted. No men speak more loudly of justice and honour than those
  who are in the act of committing an outrage against both.

LXVII.    Description of a new Species of North American Marten
           (Mustela vulpina). liy C. S. Rafinesqub*.
The      regions watered by the Missouri are inhabited by many
animals as yet unknown to the zoologist, although many have
been noticed by travellers.     A species of marten has lately been
presented to the Lyceum of Natural History in New York, which
was brought from that country, and appears to belong to a pe
culiar species, very different from the common martens of Europe,
Asia and America, although it has in common with it the cha
racter of the yellow throat ; but the head, feet and tail afford so
many peculiar characters, that no doubt can be entertained of its
diversity: I have therefore given to it the name of Mustela vul
pina or Fox Marten, owing to its head and tail being somewhat
similar to that of a fox.
                         MUSTELA VULPINA.
   Definition.
               — Brown    ; three large yellowish   spots   underneath
on the throat, breast, and belly: cheeks, inside of the ears, and
a spot on the nape, white : tail tipped with white, one-third 'of
its total length:  feet blackish : toes white.
   Description. — This    animal is of a fine shape ; its size is rather
above mediocrity, being about half a foot high, and the total
length being about twenty-seven inches, whereof nine form the
tail. The general colour of the fur is a drab brown, and it is
neither coarse nor very fine. The head is elongated oblong, about
four inches, long-shaped like that of a fox: the snout is narrow:
the nose is black, notched and granulated, furnished on each side
with black whiskers two inches long: there are three long black
hairs or vibrissa above each eye, and a few shorter ones scattered
behind them on the cheeks, chin and tip of the lower jaw, which
is white: the cheeks are whitish, and there is a white spot on
the nape of the neck : the ears are large, broad, and white inside.
There are three large oblong spots on the throat, breast and
belly; this last is the largest: that on the breast, the smallest.
The fore legs are shorter then the hind ones., and have behind
three very long hairs or vilrissee : the feet and toes of all the legs
are covered with long fur : the former have a dark brown or
blackish ring, and the latter are of a dirty white : there are five
long toes to all the feet, of which the inner one is the shortest :
the nails are white, retractile, and shorter than the fur.          The
teeth are as in the genus Mustela, and white ; those of the lower
jaw are larger and stronger: the grinders are four on each side:
 they are broad, trifid, with the middle lobe sharp and very long:
 the tusks or dog-teeth are very strong, curved, and approxi-

412                 On a new Method        of treating
mated, leaving a very small place for the incisores, which are very
small, very short and flat, the two lateral ones on each side are
situated diagonally; the second behind, and the two middle ones
are only half the size of the others.        The tail is bushy, particu
larly at the top, where there is a white pencil of long hairs j the
brown of the remainder is darker than on the body.
     From the above accurate description it will appear evident
that this animal is very different from the common marten of
North America.        It must be a very feroeious little animal, which
 is indicated by the strength of theteeth.

     Notation. — In a factorial are to be considered the number of
factors, otherwise called the exponent, the first factor, and the
common difference, whether + or — .
    Let m be the first factor, n the number of factors, and c the
common difference ; then every factorial may be thus indicated
mn[c: let n = 4 and        c=l,    then will m"^ =m^x       = m(m +\)
 (to+2) (m + 3).       Again,   if re=5 and c= —     I, then will mn\c=

or negative, according as n      is even or odd.  Thus let p = 3, n=4,

    Proposition. — Any two factorials in which the base of the one
is equal to the sum formed by adding the
                                                  product of the expo

nent and common difference of the other to its exponent, may be
reduced to one.
   For let m"lc and [m + nc]^c be the two factorials, the base
of the latter being formed as announced in the proposition :'then
because c is the common difference, and m is the first factor of
the factorial m" °, the second factor will be m + c, the third
to + 2c, the fourth m-\-3c, and so on. Therefore in n + 1 factors,
the    + l)th factor from the first will be the first factor, together
        (re
with n times the common difference         therefore  c ; the factorial

factor which     not given.

   2.  To the base of the given factorial apply either of the ex
ponents of the two factorial factors, and the common difference,
and the quantity thus formed will be one of the factorial factors.
   3. To the same base add the product of the exponent and
common difference of the factorial factor thus completed, and to
the sum as      base apply the remaining exponent of the two fac
                 a
torial factors, and the common difference, then the quantity thus
formed will be the other factorial factor.

LXIX.      Observations on Larch: together with two Experiments
   of   the   Strength and Resilience of the Timber, and Size of
    largest Tree cut in 1817, or growing in 1819.             By John,
   Duke of Atholl.
Th e     following    remarks on larch were transmitted     by the Duke
of Atholl to the Commissioners of Naval Revision,            May 1807;
and will evince, not only the great importance which in his opi
nion attached to the subject, but also his wish to make the re
sult of his practical knowledge known, for the advantage of his
country.
    Since the period of 1S07, the wishes of the Duke of Atholl,
that the larch might be tried for naval purposes, has been carried
into effect ; and a frigate of 28 guns is now building at the Royal
dock-yard of Woolwich, to be constructed entirely of that species
of timber.
    The introduction of this most valuable tree into Scotland, at
least into the county of Perth, took place in the year 1738 ; when
a Highland gentleman, Mr. Menzies, of Glenlyon (Perthshire),
brought a few small plants from London ; his servant carrying
them on horseback on the top of his portmanteau. Some of these
plants he left at Monzie, near Crieff, some at Dunkeld, and the
remainder he carried home, where some have been cut, within
these few years, of a great size.        The four left at Monzie are in
full vigour(1807) ; the largest nearly twelve feet in circumference,
at three feet and a half above the ground.           Those left at Dun
keld are also in full vigour (1S07) ; some were placed in a green
house, but not thriving, were turned out.          The largest is about
twelve feet in girth, at three feet and a half above the ground, and
is computed to contain four load of solid timber, or two hundred
feet.    Some years elapsed before any more larch were planted at
Dunkeld. A few, however, were planted at Blair in that interval.
But the larch planted between the years 1740 and 1750 were
inconsiderable in point of number.         For the planting of the rocky
mountains round Dunkeld, with a view to their growing wood,
which has since been done, would at that time have been treated
as a chimerical idea.       The plantations on the lower grounds were
necessarily small in extent.
                              Trials of Larch.
    1777. — It    is now  thirty years since I have cut and   used  larch
for different purposes     ;  and as yet I have met with no instance
to induce me to depart from my opinion, that larch is the most
valuable acquisition, in point of useful timber, that has ever been
introduced into Scoland : and I speak from having used and cut
larch of from fifty to sixty years' growth.
                                 D  d 2                               The

 420                       Observations    m Larch.
     The small larch I have used were thinned out of plantations
 for upright paling, rails and hurdles.          Those fit for sawing, were
 sawn through the middle ; the smaller used round, with the bark
  on.    I have found young larch, so used, more durable than oak
 copse wood of twenty-four years' growth.
      179^- — The larger and older larch which I have cut, have been
 used for*a variety of purposes.         Boats built of it have been found
  sound,   when   the ribs, made of oak forty years old, were decayed.
  I have for years built all my ferry and fishing-boats of larch.
     In mill- work, and especially in mill-axles (where oak only used
 formerly to be employed), larch has been substituted with the
 best effect.
     1S06. — Last winter, in cutting up an old decayed mill-wheel,
 those parts of the water-cogs, &c. which had been repaired with
 larch about twenty years before, though black on the surface, on
 the hatchet being applied, were found as sound and fresh as when
 put up.
    There    is not a sufficient quantity of larch of fit growth, to bring
 that wood into general use for country purposes ; but such as has
 been cut and sold, has brought two shillings per foot, in some
 instances more.       About the year 1S0O I received twelve guineas
for a single larch-tree of fifty years' growth. . I was at the same
time offered twenty pounds for another larch, which I declined
 cutting. The tree sold had eighty-nine solid square feet of wood ;
 and the purchaser cut two if not three axles for mills out of it.
     1806. — Last year I cut out twenty larch-trees from a clump
where they stood too thick.           I left the finest trees standing, and
received one hundred guineas for the twenty trees taken out, be
ing at the rate of two shillings per foot.              The largest of the
twenty     trees measured     one hundred     and  five feet in length, five
feet eleven inches in      girth at four feet from the ground, and con
tained ninety-four square feet of timber.            One tree measured one
hundred and six feet ; two, one hundred and seven ; and one, one
hundred and nine feet in length ; but, being drawn up by stand
ing too close, did not contain so much solid wood as the first.
    It is not in the quality only of the wood that I consider the
larch a great acquisition ; but in the nature of the ground, where
it will not only grow luxuriantly, but I am persuaded will arrive
at a size fit for any purpose to which wood can be applied.
    The lower range of the Grampian Hills, which extend to Dun-
keld, are in altitude from one thousand to seventeen hundred
feet above the level of the sea; a range of mountains to the
height of twelve hundred is now in the course of being planted.
They are in general barren and rocky, composed of mountain
schist slate and iron stone.         Up to the height of twelve hundred
feet, larch are planted, and grow luxuriantly, where the Scotch

                         Olservations on Larch.                       421
fir, formerly considered the hardiest tree of the north, cannot rear
its head.    In considerable tracts, where fragments of shivered
rocks are strewed so thick, that vegetation scarcely meBts the
eye, the larch puts out as strong and vigorous shoots as are to be
found in the valleys below, or in the most sheltered situations.
    I have been employed for the last five years in forming a very
extensive plantation of larch, on mountains similar to what I
have described.        The plantation embraces a tract of nearly eigh
teen hundred Scotch acres, nearly one thousand of which I have
already planted ( 1807), mostly with larch, placing Scotch fir
only in the wet grounds where larch will not grow, and mixing
spruce on the highest points, finding from experience that that
tree is next in value to the larch, and thrives in alpine situations
almost equally well.
    In all the larch which I have cut, I have never met with one
instance of decay.         Rut I have seen larch cut in wet situations
and tilly soil on low moors some miles below Dunkeld, which at
forty years of age were decaying at the heart.           The larch is cer
tainly an alpine tree, and does not thrive in wet situations.
    In 1795 a species of blight appeared on the larch, which in
low situations destroyed numbers. The season in which this was
observed to any extent, the frosts were very severe late in the
spring, and the clouds of frost fog, which rested on the larch, in
calm mornings, when just coming into leaf, produced the blight.
I did not find trees above twenty-five or thirty feet in height af
fected by  it,    neither did
                            it     appear at all on the higher grounds,
where  a     slight breeze  of air  could shake the trees.    For eight or
ten years past severe frosts at the end of spring and beginning of
                                          .
summer, have partially brought       a    somewhat similar blight, which,
though not essentially injuring the growth of the wood, except
in a few instances, nearly destroyed the flower of the larch,
which has prevented my having been able to obtain larch seed
in the quantity  I     wished, in order to carry my intention into ef
fect
   ;   —   to cover all the mountainous tract near Dunkeld belong
ing in property to me, with larch, which         I   am persuaded, at the
distance of sixty or seventy years from planting, will be fit for
 most naval purposes.
    The comparative value of larch and Scotch, fir will not bear
 calculation. In the year 1800 sold larch of fifty years old for
                                     I       a
 twelve guineas  ;     while
                          a     fir, of the same age, and in the same
 soil, brought fifteen shillings.    A     fall of snow will destroy in one
 night, and break and tear down sometimes more than one-third
 ofa    fir plantation.      ThisI    have often experienced at all ages.
 High winds also destroy firs in numbers.
     The larch are never broken      by    snow, and very' seldom torn up

422                      Observations on Larch,
 by winds, and then only in single trees.          Scotch firs are bad and
 shabby growers (with me at least), at about eight hundred feet of
 altitude.    Larch grow luxuriantly some hundred feet higher.
     The late Duke of Atholl, my father, was the first who formed
 plantations around Dunkeld or Blair, to any extent (in 1765).
 The quantity of old larch I could at present spare, therefore,
 cannot be considerable ; but should the Board, froni any thing
 I have said of its durability in boats, &c. &c. be inclined to make
 trials for naval purposes, I could perhaps furnish for that pur
 pose forty or fifty load : or, I should be extremely ready and
 happy to carry into effect experiments, if the Board should think
 fit to direct the making of any, to prove the strength, weight,
 durability, &c. &c. of larch wood.
     I would not, Gentlemen, have troubled you with the foregoing
 detail, but from a thorough conviction that larch timber may be
 used, in many instances, as a substitute for oak.
     That this substitute may be had of a prime quality in sixty or
 seventy years from the period of planting.
     And, lastly, that this substitute may be the produce of other
 wise barren and unprofitable mountains.              Whereas oak timber
 will always be found to thrive best in lands either taken from, or
well adapted to, agricultural purposes, and more particularly to
 the growth of wheat.
     The further and various trials made by the Duke of Atholl of
 the quality and endurance of larch ; the extent of plantations of
 that species of tree formed and forming on dry, and of the Pinus
 alba, or Norway spruce, on wet lands ; and the surprising fer
 tilizing quality of the leaves or spines of the larch, which in the
course of between twenty and thirty years convert the most bar
ren and rugged mountains, formerly not worth nine-pence per
acre, into an herbage worth from ten to fifteen shillings per acre;
— it is the intention of the Duke to put together, and make
known, for the general good..
     In the mean time, he confines himself to the observations for
merly transmitted in 1807, to the commissioners for naval re
vision, along with two trials of the strength of larch, made in
 1812 and 1818 *,and the age and dimensions of the largest larch-
tree that has been cut, or is now growing on his estates.
    • The description of the trials in 1818, here referred to, is a quotation
from the Philosophical Magazine for March 1818 (see our fifty-first volume,
page 214), and needs not therefore to be repeated in the present article.

LXX.       Onanew Method of applying the Power of Man to the
     moving of Machinery, with at least six times the Effect thai
     can be produced by mere muscular Exertion.      By the Rev.
     Dr. Edmund Cartwright.
                                      To       Mr. Tilhch.
Dear Sir,                  aving latelv discovered
                                                a method by which a
man's power in giving motion to machinery of any kind, may be
employed with at least six times the effect that maybe obtained by
mere muscular force, I am desirous of giving a discovery, embrac
ing such a variety of purposes, the most extensive publicity : —
and this I cannot do more effectually than through the medium
of your Philosophical Magazine. The power with which a man
can work through the day, and everyday, is commonly calculated
at 28 or 30 lbs.            If,
                        therefore,   way can be pointed out bv which
                                                a
the whole of his absolute gravity can be brought into constant
action, he will increase his power (calculating upon the average)
                                                             a by
as six to one.      Now this     to be done
                                       is        means so simple and
obvious, that       seems nothing less than
                      it                          miracle that the idea
did not occur, even to the common knife-grinder, centuries ago.
It   isnothing more than having two cranks upon the axis to be
moved, standing perpendicularly to each other, and the operator
shifting his weight alternately from the treddle of one crank to
the other.         the diameter of the crank's revolution does not
                  If
exceed seven or eight inches, the muscular exertion will be tri
fling.    To bring tb* whole or such part of the operator's mus
cular force into action as may occasionally be wanted, he might
have straps upon his shoulders, such as are used            chair-men,
                                                                    by
which, being fixed to any convenient part of the machine, would
enable him to add to his weight double the power of his abso
lute gravity     and this additional weight, when not wanted, he
                  ;
could be relieved from          a very slight inclination pf the shoul
                                      by
ders.    These ideas have actually reduced to practice, and have
                             I
had   a four-wheeled carriage made, which has fully ascertained
the principles that are here laid down.          To this carriage at      I
tached    aplough. We had not, however, proceeded above twenty
yards, when being inipatient to try the full power of the machine,            .
I  ordered the men to add their muscular force to that of their
gravity   ;when the, machinery which       had substituted in the place
                                                       I
of treddles gave way, and terminated the business for that day.
On. my return home         shall expect to find the damage repaired.
                                  I
My substitutes for cranks are ratchet-wheels acted upon           tred   by
dles which have pauls upon them, which, when the treddles are
lifted up, fall into a ratchet.       The treddles are lifted up by
means of      strap on the treddle under which the operator passes
              a
his foot.                                                            As

426 Different      " Rates " of Pennington's   Astronomical Clock,
   As there is not a shadow of doubt but that an able-bodied
man can in this way exert the power of a horse, I should not
despair of seeing, were I to live but a few years longer, carriages
of every description travelling the public road without the aid of
horses.    For mill-work of every kind this mode of working will
have a decided advantage over animal power.        In the first place,
it will not require a twentieth part of the space; in the second
place, not a tenth part of the expense of machinery; and lastly,
it will save all the original cost of the horses and their daily
decrease in value : — the space required for four men to work in,
need not be more than four feet square, and the expense of the
machinery will not exceed five pounds.      But the most extensive
application of this principle I look for in navigating vessels.
When we take into consideration the immense expense of a large
steam-engine, the space it occupies, together with the fuel to
work    it,
          and the combined danger of fire and its blowing up, no
prudent man would hesitate which he would adopt.               In the
fisheries    would be particularly useful. The fishing-vessels could
            it
go out and return at pleasure, so as always to bring their fish
fresh to market, to say nothing of the facilities  itwould afford of
dragging    their nets.
                      I am, dear sir, very faithfully yours,

   It will, first, be proper to present a concise description of the
clock itself.     The " movement," as it is technically called, is
such as is usually put to astronomical clocks of the best con
struction, and has " Graham's dead-beat escapement," with the
pallets jewelled — this being all the jewelling which the clock has.
The pendulum is a gridiron compensation, and is suspended by
a spring, through an orifice in which a steel axis passes, upon
the middle of which it is firmly clamped between two pieces of
brass. The ends of this axis rest in Vs upon the top of two short
pieces of brass, which are firmly screwed to the
                                                         " rising-board"

The suspending spring           about one inch and

the upper part of the ball, and proceeds to the gridiron part of
the pendulum.        The " regulating nut" changes the length of the
pendulum in the usual manner,          being
                                              " tapped " upon a screw,
                                                   by
whose threads are about forty to an inch, and upon which one
revolution,         by
                  elevating or depressing the bob, makes difference  a

curve surface of this nut        graduated into thirty equal divisions,
                                        is
and an index screwed upon the bob points downward so as to
show the division or portion of a thread at which the nut stands.
Another index fixed near the top of the bob points horizontally
to equal divisions on the prismatic stem, and shows the actual
thread of the screw upon which the nut rests when                supportsit
the bob at any assumed position.
  It    having been found inconvenient, in moving astronomical
clocks from one place to another, to have the ball of the pendu
lum and the rod inseparably attached to each other; these have
been so constructed as to admit of occasional separation.              To
effect this, "milled heads" have been made to the two lower
cylindric pins, which connect the outer bars of the pendulum with

  28   Different
                  " Rates "  of Pennington's Astronomical    Clock,
the inferior cross piece of brass to which the stem, screw, and
borj are appended.      By these means the said cylindrie pins are
easily  taken  out, and  the bob with its adjusting screws, &c. se
parated from the compensating part of the pendulum, and at
tached to it at pleasure : proper marks upon the pins, screws, &c.
preventing any junction except of corresponding parts, after a
temporary separation has taken place.
    This description will, perhaps, be rendered more perspicuous
by a reference to Plate IV. fig. 1 : op, rs and mn, are the hori
zontal pieces, to which the nine vertical bars of the pendulum
are attached.     The two exterior bars are attached to the cross
piece mn, by the milled-head cylindrie pins, which enter where-
two dots are marked in the figure between m and n : when those
pins are taken out, the cross-piece m n with all that is below it
is. susceptible of complete separation from the upper part of the
pendulum; and each part then packs in a stuffed box, of which
the relative fitting is so nice as to allow of neither shake nor
strain.    A B is the bob or ball of the pendulum, as before re
marked, seven inches across.         It is so perforated as to admit
the prismatic stem x z to enter at z, while the screw passes out
below I'.     The regulating nut a b is 1-4 inch across, and carries
on its rim thirty equal divisions.      Another smaller nut c d c' d,
of which cd is 1-1 inch, and cf d' 0-5 inch, is placed below the
former; and was intended to keep it steady in travelling.         Its
thickness is three-tenths of an inch, and its weight is less than
three-quarters of an ounce.      Its weight and dimensions are given
thus particularly,   for a reason which will appear in the sequel.
The indexes I and I' point to divisions on the upper stem and
lower nut respectively; and when the parts are separated at m n,
the previous divisions at which I and I' stood are carefully re
gistered, that the pendulum may be accurately restored to its
former state with regard to length, before it is again permitted
to vibrate permanently, with reference to an experiment.
    To the vertical back of the mahogany clock-case is screwed a
graduated metallic arch GR, near which the pointed inferior
extremity of the scrtw v tv, swings during the oscillations of the
pendulum ; the arch G R serving by this mean to measure the
extent of those oscillations.      To the bottom of the clock-case
are screwed three strong feet of caat-iron, which project hori
zontally; near their exterior extremities they .are met by three
strong brass bars, which proceed downwards in slanting directions
from the sides and back of the clock-case: the several extre
mities of these bars and of the horizontal feet, being screwed
firmly to each other, and to the clock-case, give to the whole
such a degree of stability as admits of no perceptible effect from
the vibrations of the pendulum.         By means of nuts and screws
                                                                    to

 to this tripod, the clock-case is adjusted to horizontally and ver
 tically, after the manner of portable transit instruments; two
  spirit-levels  which are fixed within the clock-case at right angles
 in the    same  horizontal plane, enabling us to ascertain when the
 adjustment is complete.
     In Balta the three feet on which the clock and its case thus
 rested, were placed upon three separate portions of rock which
 were chamfered down till they were nearly in one horizontal
 plane ; the position of the clock was then easily rectified by
 means of the adjusting screws.            At Woolwich Common those
 feet are placed upon the heads of three separate piles which stand
 detached from the floor of the Observatory.            In Balta a suitable
 piece of rock was selected as the pedestal of the transit instru
 ment (which is a portable one by Troughton) : the top of the
 rock was properly levelled; holes were drilled to receive fused
 lead, on which, after it had cooled, the feet of the transit instru
 ment were placed.       A wooden frame was placed round the piece
 of rock, to keep the observer from accidentally pressing against
 it during the observation.         At Woolwich Common the transit
 instrument is placed upon a piece of stone thirteen inches square
 and six deep, which is half embedded in a strong prismatic box
 of sand, that rests upon piles. This, which I recommended as
 an appropriate pedestal for a transit instrument, has been found
 to answer remarkably well ; the instrument, when properly ad
justed, having preserved its level accurately for months in suc
cession *.
     These particulars are premised from a conviction that the
 public cannot be expected to place any confidence in the results
of an experiment, unless the means taken to guard against the
probable errors are fairly explained.            Under this persuasion I
shall, as     I proceed, enter into minutiae, where their omission
might occasion doubts ; and may here mention, while speaking
 of the clock, that the actuating weight was never permitted to
descend lower than within two inches of the top of the pendulum
ball ; lest a nearer approximation of two svtch masses of brass,
might produce irregularity (however slight) by their mutual at
traction.
    The small island of Balta, upon which M. Biot, Captain Colby,
and myself fixed, after mature deliberation,             as by far the most
convenient on the whole, for landing our apparatus and carrying
    * Such a box may be readily made to take to
                                                   pieces, and join together
again by screws ; and will then serve to accompany a portable transit in
strument from place to place, as it may be needed.        But for a permanent
observatory, it might be well to have the sand contained in a case of bricks.
The instrument would then, I am persuaded, be less affected by any exter
nal impressions, than if it stood on a solid block of stone.
                                                                           on

  on our several operations in concert, serves as a natural break
  water to the fine harbour of Balta Sound, and is separated from
  Unst (to which M.Biot's apparatus was removed after he quitted
  us) by two narrow straits.         After tents were set up for M. Biot,
  for ourselves   and   the  soldiers who accompanied us, a temporary
  house, with walls of stone and a strong tarpaulin cover, was erected
  for the reception of the astronomical clock and transit instru
  ment ; and suitable spots within a few yards of this were chosen
  for the establishment of the great theodolite tent, and that for
  the zenith sector. Mr. Edmondston's house at Buness, in Unst,
  where M. Biot ultimately fixed his station, was within sight of
  ours : the distance being about two miles and a half, and bearing
  nearly west by north *.
      The house in which the clock was placed, stood at an eleva
  tion of 121 feet above the level of low water in Balta Sound,
  and in north latitude 60° 45' 3".           The transit instrument being
  adjusted to the plane of the meridian, by one of the methods
* described in Ludlam's Astronomical Observations, published in
   1769, and confirmed by means of the elongations of the pole-
  star observed with the great theodolite by Captain Colby, a suit
  able meridian mark was fixed, at the distance of more than two
  miles on the island of Unst.         The pendulum of the clock was set
  in motion on the morning of July 30, 1817. On the next day,
  when it seemed to have attained its full rate, its semi-arc of vi
  bration was 2° 20' ; and thus it continued until August 1 7th,
  when the clock was taken down, and its parts returned to their
  respective boxes.
      Were I here to copy the entire record of my observations with
  the transit instrument much room would be uselessly occupied ;
  because the mean or reduced time upon the five wires in no in
  stance deviated more than three-tenths of a second from the time
  on the meridian wire, and usually agreed to about one-tenth of
  a second.      I shall, therefore, reserve the entire publication of
  these to a more suitable time and place, and here simply pre
  sent results.      They ,are sufficiently numerous for the purpose;
  but not so numerous as would have been obtained in the same
  interval, in a climate better suited than Zetland for astronomical
  observation f.
      * Buness is, in fact, as little above the level of the sea, as any point
  which could have been selected in the north of Zetland. It is almost entirely
   surrounded by hills, at no great distance ; and was, therefore, in my opinion
   as well as Captain Colby's, altogether unfit for an astronomical station,
   from which triungulation was to proceed ; however much the hospitality of
   Mr. E. might render it an agreeable residence.
      f  From July 22d, to August 1 7th, we had but one day that was entirely
   free from rain: though during the whole interval we were but once visited
   with a fog, and that did not last more than an hour.

    From these and some other observations from day to day, I
inferred that no change either of temperature or of barometric
pressure experienced here, occasioned a change of half a second
in the " rate." I therefore proceeded to deduce the average
'' rate " at Balta, from those observations on which 1 could most
rely, on account of being enabled to see the star pass all the
wires of the transit instrument.     The result is here presented.

     The thermometer by which the temperature was measured,
 hung upon the side of the clock-case; the barometer which served
 to measure the atmospheric pressure, hung within "two feet of
 the clock.     The great differences between the maximum and
 minimum temperatures on July 31st, and August 1st, 3d, 11th,
 and 14th, were occasioned by the sun's rays striking upon the
 slightly elevated tarpaulin roof of the transit-house, thus greatly
  raising the afternoon temperature, and by the wide opening from
 the top to the bottom of the roof during observation, which gave
 a corresponding depression to the temperature at night.
     The rapid depression of from 13" to 1.5° of temperature, took
 place on three afternoons between four o'clock and ten : yet this
 produced no appreciable change in the rate : from which we may
 infer, that the compensation in the pendulum is exceedingly per
 fect, and that the instrument does not yield to the changes of
 temperature
                " by starts," as has been often objected to the grid
iron compensation.
     Again ; the " rate" of the clock, not varying from its mean
 rate more than one-fifth of a second on any day during the ob
 servations, although the barometric column varied from 29-22
 to 29-96; we may, I think, fairly infer, that if the barometric
 changes do not exceed an inch, in the course of a series of com
 parative experiments with this clock, the introduction of any al
 lowance for thff air's buoyancy or its resistance, would be a use
 less refinement in the computation.
                                                                          We

     We may now proceed to detail more briefly the observations
to determine the rate of the clock at Woolwich Common ;
omitting as unnecessary the register of the barometer and ther
mometer: of which the former oscillated between 30,402 and
29-464, the latter between 54° and 42°.
     The hall of my dwelling-house having a window that opened
to the north, from which I could conveniently observe several cir-
cumpolar stars, the clock was set up there November 15, 1817 J
the proposed observatory at the Royal Military Academy not be
ing then ready to receive the apparatus. The nuts a b and cdc d
were placed precisely as they had been in Balta ; and of course
the pendulum was effectively of the same length.           After the clock
had been going two days, the semiarc of vibration was observed
to be 2° 30^ ; and so it continued till the clock was stopped.
     The transit instrument was placed on a slab of stone half im
bedded in sand, as before mentioned.          The latitude of the place
of observation is 51° 2S' 41" north; its altitude 201 feet above
the level of the sea.
     The " rate of the clock, as given by observations upon dif
                  "
ferent stars from day to day, varied between — 19 6" and —20".
     The mean rate as determined from those stars which presented
a series of observations upon all the five wires of the transit tele
scope, is   as  below  :

     But,  as  the  constant semiarc of vibration was less at Balta
than at Woolwich Common, a correction must be made upon one
of the rates on that account.          Thus, if D = 2°± and 8=2°^-, we
have (Hutton's Course, vol. iii. p. 358, or Gregory's Mechanics,
book ii. chap. 2), f(D2— ll) = |(V — V)— 1*.342, correction
to be taken either from the -f- rate at Balta, or from the — rate
at Woolwich Common : consequently there results, for

   Such would be the ratio of the lengths of a pendulum to vibrate
seconds at the two assumed stations : and from this it follows,
that if at the temperature 50°, 39- 1^6 inches be the length of a
second pendulum at Woolwich Common, its length at the spot
assumed for the experiment in the isle of Balta would be 39- 1 724
inches ; and this result, I have no doubt, is exceedingly near the
truth.
   But before  a result of this kind can he classed with others, in
order for application to the question of the earth's figure, the
deductions from the respective series of observation must be re
duced to the same level.    Such reduction I shall make conform
ably with the principles usually adopted, although I am per
suaded (and could easily show, would it not extend this paper to
too great a length) that it often introduces a greater error than
that which it is intended to correct.   In the case before us, where
the difference between the levels of the two stations is eighty feet
and 2101,0000 feet the earth's radius, we have                                               V
or 1-000007615,   for the factor by which the last term of the
above ratio must be multiplied.    The multiplication being ef
fected, we have when  reduced  to the level of the sea,
 Length pend. at Woolwich: length                       at   Balta    : : 1 :   1-0009379.
    This ratio is the only independent result as to the lengths of
pendulums at the two places furnished by the apparatus com
mitted to my charge.
   To judge to what extent confidence may be placed in this ul
timate deduction, let us consider what will follow, supposing the
difference in the rates at the two stations to be appreciated within
only half a second of the truth. Then, since (n + d)*— nz=
2nd + di, n being = S6400, and d less than \, 2nd is less than
8ijg69
         of    n1, that is, the difference              between the lengths of two
pendulums that shall vibrate seconds at the respective stations,
is, by such an experiment, ascertained to within the 2220th part
of an inch.
    I have no conception that any result which depends upon ac
tual measurement, and still more upon measurement and com
putation conjointly, can go beyond this degree of accuracy ;                                 if,
indeed,     can attain it.

compression is expressed by the fraction                j~- ;      agreeing    nearly
with the result of a comparison between the measurements of de
grees at the equator and in America.   But the only use to which
two or three results thus obtained by one observer can be legiti
mately applied, is to make them parts of a series obtained by
different persons in different places, and reduce the whole to
computation by the
                      " method of least squares." The general
result would in such case probably             agree nearly with              the de-i
duction from the lunar theory.
    So long, however, as the investigations are conducted upon the
hypothesis that the meridians are similar ellipses, or even ellipses
 at all, they proceed upon a pctitio principii, and must involve
error, while they are employed to elicit truth.       For, as Horsley
remarked when speaking of this very hypothesis f, " Plausible as
it may seem, I must say that there is much reason from expe
 riment to call it in question.     If it were true, the increment of
the force which actuates the pendulum as we approach the poles,
should be as the square of the sine of the latitude ; or, which is
the same thing, the decrement, as we approach the equator,
should be as the square of the cosine of the latitude.       But who
ever takes the pains to compare together such of the observa
tions of the pendulum in different latitudes, as seem to have been
made with the greatest care, will find that the increments and
decrements do by no means follow these proportions; and in
those which I have examined, I find a regularity in the deviation
which little resembles the mere error of observation.          The un
avoidable conclusion          is,
                            that the true figure of the meridians                     is
not elliptical. If the meridians are not ellipses, the difference
of the diameters may, indeed, or         may not, be proportional to

the difference  between   the polar  and  the equatorial force   but       ;          it
is quite an uncertainty what relation subsists between the one
quantity and the other our whole theory, except so far as
                               :                                                      it

    If these reflections be correct, how absurd and unphilosophical
must be the procedure of those persons, who make the coinci
dence or the want of coincidence of a result (deduced from one or
two experiments) with an assumed value of the compression, the
test of the accuracy or the inaccuracy of the experiments them
selves!
    As the attention of men of science is now drawn, and is likely
to be drawn still more, to the subject of experiments with the
pendulum, it may be useful to collect together the principal re
sults which have been furnished during the last and present
century with regard to this point. These I shall present in the

      These tables (in the computation of which I have taken consi-
 deiable pains to reduce the various measures accurately to one
standard) exhibit some singular anomalies*.                                  The different tem
peratures at which the lengths were ascertained, doubtless furnish
one cause of discrepance, which, in most cases, from the want of

in the results from any law which has yet been assigned, as will
induce the investigator to seek for some general cause distinct
from imperfections in the apparatus, and from inevitable aberra
tions in their use.
    Laplace, when reasoning on this subject from the examination
of results obtained at only fifteen different places, says, " Nous
remarquerons ici que les memes anomalies que presentent les di
vers degres mesures depuis Dunkerque jusqu'a Barcelonne, et
dont la cause est sans doute l'irr£gularile des parties de la terre,
se retrouvent dans les longueurs observees du pendule ; car Gris-

sensiblement plus grandes que celles qui resultent de la loi pre-
cedente de la variation du pendule de l'^quateur aux poles." —
Mec. Celeste, tome ii. p. 151.
    Another philosopher, who (though he thinks fit to give his opi
nion on this subject anonymously) is so clearly seen through the
 veil that he may be appealed to as an authority, observes — " It
must not be supposed that, with the pendulum carried to its pre
sent state of sensibility and precision, the results will be free from
inconsistency, or beyond the influence of the local irregularities
that may exist immediately under the surface of the earth. Were
 the pendulum the same inaccurate instrument that it was a few
years ago, it might not feel the influence of such causes as only
increase or diminish the intensity of gravity by a very small part
 of the whole.    But when the length of the pendulum can be de
 termined to the ten-thousandth of an inch, or to 1 3              of its

(juiry, I would most earnestly recommend that proper persons be
appointed to make experiments with pendulums, not only in dif
ferent plat es on the same meridian, or in widely differing lati
tudes; but in various places upon or near the same parallels of
latitude. Experiments of this kind can be made with more fre
quency and conducted with less expense, than any other class of
operations for determining the figure of the earth ; and they
would not only be subservient to the determination of that figure,
generally, but would furnish by their local anomalies ready indi
cations of geological peculiarities, which might not previously
have been detected by geologists themselves.      That every possi
ble satisfaction might result from these experiments, it would
be adviseable that at each station they should be conducted si
multaneously,     by three, or at least two distinct classes of ap*-
paratus,   and  by separate observers.   It was on a high estimate
of the advantages of simultaneous operation at the same place by
means of different instruments and observers, that I anxiously en
gaged in the experiment in the Zetland Isles.       While I regret
that M. Biot, by quitting the Balta station, and by declining to
make a regular exchange of records of the respective experiments,
precluded us from realizing this species of benefit; I have the
satisfaction of feeling that the occasion of the separation cannot
correctly be imputed, either to myself or to Captain Colby, my
indefatigable and liberal-minded associate in that expedition.
    This paper might now terminate, were it not that an acci
dental circumstance, the tendency of which to introduce error
has been most industriously and ungenerously misrepresented,
and made the basis of an illiberal comparison between the accu
racy of my experiment and that of M. Biot, by persons who have
not taken the trouble to ascertain facts — renders it expedient
that I should present them here.
   There being no observatory at the Royal Military Academy in
1817, the "rate" of the clock was ascertained by the Rev. Lewis
Evans, at his- private observatory on Woolwich Common, in the
spring of that year.     The rate was found to keep generally be
tween -3 and .9 of a second, the mean being, nearly, +-44 ; and
on April 14, 1S17, the clock, pendulum, and bob, were carefully
packed up in their respective cases.      I was not present at the
packing, because at that time it was not determined that I should
for a season quite my official duties at Woolwich, for the pur
pose of assisting in the proposed operations in the north.     Col.
Mudge and M. Biot started for Edinburgh early in May ;       and on
June 2Sth I joined them at Leith.      On my arrival there I found
Col. Mudge too ill to render it possible for him to accompany
us further northward, or indeed to give any specific directions as
                                 E e 4                            to

   to the way in which he should wish the husiness to be conducted,
    or any detailed account of the state of the apparatus. He quitted
    Leith on his way home, the next morning; and on June 30th, I
   travelled from Leith to the Seadiey Hills near Dundee, in order
    to acquaint Captain Colby with the state of affairs, and request
   him to suspend the operations in which he was there engaged,
    and accompany us to Zetland.            To this he assented with that
   eagerness     to promote   the  cause   of science which has uniformly
   marked his character*.
       On our arrival at the north of Zetland, as soon as the removal
   of M. Riot to Unst rendered it necessary for Captain Colby and
   myself to carry on our operations apart from that philosopher,
   we agreed that the captain with his assistant should undertake
   the observations with the zenith sector and the great theodolite,
   while I carried on those with the transit instrument and deter
   mined the rate of the clock ; each, however, assisting the other
   in setting up the apparatus.         Neither of us was at all aware that
   when the " rate " of the clock was determined at Woolwich, the
   nut a b alone was screwed beneath the ball of the pendulum, and
   that the smaller nut c d d d', was simply applied during the voy
   age, under the idea that it would serve to give steadiness to the
   former.     This smaller nut has a neat milled-head which gives it
   every appearance of an ornamental finish to a constant part of
   the apparatus ; and as such I continued to use it during the go
   ing of the clock at Balta, simply taking care that it was brought
  up close to the nut a b, while it stood in its proper position, as
   ascertained by the indices I and I'.         I made no computations of
  .what might be the expected acceleration in latitude 60° 45', lest
   their result should unconsciously bias my judgement in refer-
   ence.to the experiment ; but I knew very well, from my general
  recollections of the theory, that a clock which went truly at
  Woolwich, ought to gain from 35" to 40" per diem at Balta.
  An acceleration, therefore, which fell short of my expectations,
  not merely by two or three seconds, but by from fifteen to twenty,
  could not but excite my astonishment.            The observations of each
  succeeding day and night, convinced me that the rate was at least
  nearly correct ; so that, as I could neither detect nor conjecture
  any cause of variation in the clock, I began to suspect that there
  might be some latent cause in the geological structure of the
      * It is with reluctance I advert to such a trifle ; but as it may serve to
. show the injustice of animadversions which have been freely indulged re
  specting the dispositions with which we met M. Biot, I shall be excused for
  stating that while we were at Aberdeen in our way to Zetland, Captain Colby
  and myself procured for M. Biot's use from our friends among the Professors
  at Marischal College, such magnetical and eudioinetrical apparatus, as he
  thought himself likely to want when he arrived at the place of our ultimate
  destination.

island. My reflections in reference to this point bear date " Au
gust 8th, 1817," in my journal, and were read to Dr. Wollaston
and Captain Kater on the 4th of December, when thev came to
Woolwich to examine the clock.
   On the return of the clock to Woolwich its rate was again tried
by Mr. Evans at his observatory, and found to be nearly the same
as it had been in the preceding March and April.      After this I
set it up for experiment,     at my own residence, as before described;
 and had scarcely got it in motion when Colonel Mudge explained
 to me the intention of the smaller nut, which his severe indispo
 sition had prevented him from doing when at Leith. This ex
 planation, while it accounted satisfactorily for the apparently
 small acceleration at Balta, tended in no degree to diminish the
 rational confidence which might be placed in the invariability of
 the clock's motion while it was there ; but simply made me the
 more solicitous to obtain the correct result at Woolwich, that the
 aggregate acceleration due to the change of latitude might be
 come known : after which I was, of course, desirous to appreciate
 the real effect of the supplementary nut upon the pendulum. The
 aggregate acceleration, therefore, having been determined, as al
 ready described in this paper, I stopped the clock and inverted
 the nut, so as to make c' d' upwards and c d below       it,leaving the
nut     a  as before, and bringing up the smaller nut so as to be in

threads of the screw.       The inversion, however, considering that
this smaller nut weighed less than three quarters of an ounce,
could not be expected to produce more than a slightly percepti
ble effect and thus
                 :          was found in fact

 that they had been exposed to the tossings of three rough and
 tedious voyages; and that the apparatus had been subjected to
 experiment in summer's heat and winter's cold ; the agreement
 of results at Woolwich before and after the expedition, and with
 the smaller nut on and off, is so great, as, in my mind, to pre

                                                                     attached

   attached to the lower extremity of the metallic thread.          These
   together constitute the vibrating part of the apparatus.          4. A
    metallic circular plate, capable of accurate adjustment to hori-
   zontality, and of very gentle elevation or depression by means of
   a fine screw, so as to be brought into contact with the bottom of
   the ball, when the pendulum is at rest ; and thus to furnish the
   actual distance between the fixed plane which supported the
   " knife edge" and the bottom of the ball.
        Now, without adverting to other matters which call for the
   utmost nicety in this experiment, it is obviously requisite that
   the knife-edge with its stem and nut be made to vibrate, not ap
   parently, but to a considerable degree of precision, in the same
   time as the wire and attached cup and ball : for a very slight dif
   ference in their respective times of vibration may evidently im
   pair the accuracy which is assumed in the result.         But how can
   the interval of vibration in the upper part of the apparatus he made
   equal to that of the other portion, when this latter is not known,
    being a main object of the experiment itself?        How, again, is
   the latter ever known separately, when the experiments deter
    mine solely the motion of the complex pendulum ?              But ad
    mitting, in order to lessen the difficulty, that it is known, how
    are the knife-edge, stem, and nut, made to vibrate accurately
    ox nearly accurately in the same time?         To ascertain whether
    they  do  so or not, appears   a problem of equal difficulty, and re
    quiring equal care with the other.       Supposing, however, all this
    effected, and the precise period of oscillation of the knife-edge,
    stem, and nut, ascertained and adjusted for one latitude, and for
    one temperature, — how is it determined through what space the
    nut, N, must move, to ensure the same or any proposed time of
    oscillation in another latitude or at another temperature ? And
    it is evident that in so short a part of the apparatus as this which
  . we are now considering, where a minute change in the position
    of the nut may change that of the centre of oscillation (that is,
    of N K E B) even inches, the variations of gravity in different
    latitudes, or of temperature whether in different latitudes or the
     same, may so affect the place of that centre, as to disturb the
    vibration of the complex pendulum, and totally to cancel all pre
    tensions to extreme accuracy in the general result drawn from
    the experiment.      All this, then, requires a frank explication be-
.
     fore the result can be safely adopted, even though it may agree
     with an hypothesis to winch our prepossessions tend; unless it
     be decisively confirmed by another experiment of unquestion
     able correctness.
        But there is another circumstance which may, still more than
     the preceding, affect the precision of M. Biot's operations in the
     north.     To obtain the length of a second or other pendulum,
                                                                      from

 from such operations, appropriate corrections for the changes in
 temperature and in atmospheric pressure, are applied to two mea
 surements ; viz. that of the diameter of the ball of the pendulum,
 and that of the vertical distance between the plane- of suspension
 and the horizontal metallic plate which is screwed up to become
 a tangential plane to the ball of the pendulum when hanging at
 rest.    Of these measurements, I venture, with all proper defe
 rence to the ingenuity of M. Biot, to question the accuracy of
 the second ; and it is due. to the cause of scientific truth to state
 why I entertain doubts. The adjusting screw, &c. by which the
 metallic plate was elevated to come into contact with the bottom
 of the ball, were fixed upon a prismatic block of stone which,
 both at Leith and in Unst, was embedded in the earth.                The
 consequence was, that when M. Biot, or any other individual
 whom he permitted to approach, stood within a foot or two of
 the apparatus, as he set down or took up one of his feet, the
 stone with the adjusting screw, metallic plate, &c. perceptibly
 became elevated or depressed, so that in one case the ball would
 touch the plate, in the other vibrate freely.           Several persons
 besides myself witnessed this effect, both at Leith Fort, and in
 Mr. Edmondston's cow-house where the apparatus was placed in
 Unst M. Biot, indeed, was in the habit of advancing and re
 ceding within suitable limits, to show to strangers this motion in
 the stone and what it carried.       Now, as it was not possible to
 bring up the metallic plate to touch the ball, and to measure the
 distance between that plate and the plane of suspension, without
 the observer's moving to and fro, and at the same time moving
 the stone, the question naturally arises, How was error preclu
 ded ? If it be replied, that the conductor of the experiment al
 ways knelt down gently on a certain point when he screwed up
 the plate, and stood on that point, or some other constant point,
 every time he approached (for he must approach several times,
 see Biot's Physical Astronomy, .vol. iii. p. 159. Additions) for
the purpose of applying his metallic ruler to measure the above-
mentioned distance ; the obvious remark is^ that notwithstanding
those precautions there would probably be a constant deviation
of the horizontal metallic plate from its true position ; and that
since the change of position in the plate was perceptible during
different positions of the observer, it is further probable that the
said constant deviation, should it be such, far exceeds the allow
able limits of error in an experiment which pretends to an accu
racy expressed by a recorded result carried to the ninth place of
decimals*.      Is this deviation appreciable? If it be — upon what
principles, and by what process ?

              gives .994948151 of a metre as the length of the second pen-
dulum at Unst. He does not specify to what temperature this determination

   Nothing was easier than to have removed this cause of doubt
altogether.   If it were not convenient to have the plate with its
adjusting  screw,  &c. rise from a stone, detached from the floor,
but projecting from the pier to which the upper part of the ap
paratus was attached, as exhibited in the neat representation of
the whole given in the 8d volume of Delambre's Astronomy ;
a platform might have been placed on a detached frame, on which
the observer might kneel or stand, as required, while he performed
the several operations. M. Biot had such a platform in the tem
porary observatory erected for his Repeating Circle; why he
omitted it with regard to the pendulum apparatus I know not,
   I can now cheerfully leave this general question in the hands
of the public ; regretting, however, very sincerely that the unge
nerous detraction which renders necessary the latter part of this
memoir, should have also compelled me to give it something of a
personal complexion, by requiring not merely a defence of my
own operations, but at least my opinion of those of our foreign
companion in the voyage.       In all this, I can conscientiously af
firm that I am not actuated by a love of fame, but by a desire to
obtain justice. Personal sacrifices I did make, with regard to
the Zetland expedition, solely in order to promote the cause
of science, and obtain new facts in an interesting department of
inquiry. But it would be puerile indeed to expect any reputation
to accrue from the circumstance of having made accurate obser
vations with a transit instrument — that     is,

LXXII.     On the Aggry Beads          of

                          Bowdich, Esq.*
The     natives invariably declare that the aggry beads are found
in the Daukara, Akim, Warsaw, Ashanta, and Fantee countries,
the greater number in the former (first) being the richer in gold:
they say they are directed to dig for them         by
                                                  a spiral vapour      is
suing  from  the ground,  and  that they rarely lie near the surface    ;
—the finder said to be sure of series of good fortune. The

riegated consist of every colour and shade.       The Fantees prefer
the plain yellow bead, the Amanaheans the blue and yellow, for
which they will give double the weight in gold those of inferior

some royal or eminent character. Dr. Leyden, who writes " the

aigris is a stone of a greenish blue colour supposed to be a spe
cies of jasper, small perforated pieces of which, valued at their
weight in gold, are used for money," (which I never heard of,)
rather describes the pope bead; though that is semi -transparent
(of a bright blue) resembling carnelian (which is frequently found
in these countries), and said to be obtained in the same manner
as the aggry bead.          Issert * writes, " they are a sort of coral
with inlaid work : the art of making beads is entirely lost, or was
never known in these parts : it is not improbable that in the golden
age of Egypt she had communication with the Gold Coast; indeed,
it has been thought, and perhaps not without some reason, that
the Gold Coast is the Ophir of Solomon."
   The variegated strata of the aggry beads are so firmly united,
and so imperceptibly blended, that the perfection seems superior
to art : some resemble mosaic work ; the surfaces of others are
covered with flowers and regular patterns, so very minute, and
the shades so delicately softened one into the other and into the
ground of the lead, that nothing but the finest touch of the pen
cil could equal them. The agatized parts disclose flowers and
patterns deep in the body of the bead, and thin shafts of opaque
colours running from the centre to the surface.                  The natives
pretend that imitations are made in the country, which they call
boiled beads, alleging that they are broken aggry beads ground
into powder and boiled together, and that they know them be
cause they are heavier; but this I find to be mere conjecture
among themselves, unsupported by any thing like observation or
discovery. The natives believe that by burying the aggry beads in
sand they not only grow but breed.
   The colouring matter of the blue beads has been proved by ex
periment to be iron :-that of the yellow without doubt is lead
and antimony with a trifling quantity of copper, though not es
sential to the production of the colour.             The generality of these
beads appear to be produced from clays coloured in thin layers,
afterwards twisted together into a spiral form, and then cut
across; also from different coloured clays raked together without
blending. How the flowers and delicate patterns in the body and
on the surface of the rarer beads have been produced, cannot be

and being encouraged, he set out in June 1786; and staying some days in
Aguassim, was just about to enter Akim when he was recalled by the go

Richard Hoare ; as it seemed to correspond so closely with the
bead which he found in one of the barrows, and describes as fol
lows in his History of Wiltshire : — " The notion of the rare virtues
of the Glain Neidyr, as well as of the continued good fortune of
the finder, accords exactly with the African superstitions."        A
large glass bead of the same imperfect petrifaction as the pullev
beads, and resembling alsoin matter the little figures that are found
with the mummies in Egypt, is to be seen at the British Museum.
This verv curious bead has two circular lines of opaque sky blue
and white, which seem to represent a serpent entwined round
a centre which is perforated.       This was certainly one of the
glain neidyr of the Britons, derived from glain which is pure and
holy, and neidyr a snake. Under the word glain Mr. Owen in
his Welsh Dictionary has given the following article : — " The
glain neidyr, transparent stones, or adder stones, were worn by
the different orders of the bards, each having its appropriate co
lour. There is no certainty that they were worn from supersti
tion originally ; perhaps that was the circumstance which gave
rise to it.   Whatever might have been the cause, the notion of
their rare virtues teas universal in all places where the Bardic
religion was taught.    It may still be questioned whether they are
the production of nature or of art."      The beads which are the
present object of my attention   are thus noticed  by Bishop Gibson
in his improved edition of Camden's Britannia. " In most parts
of Wales, and throughout all Scotland, and in Cornwall, we find
it a common opinion of the vulgar, that about Midsummer-eve
 (although in the time they do not all agree) it is usual for snakes
to meet in companies ; and that by joining heads together and
hissing, a kind of bubble is formed like a ring, about the head of
one of them, which the rest by continual hissing blow on till it
comes off at the tail ; and then it immediately hardens and re
sembles a glass ring, which whoever finds (as some old women
and children are persuaded) shall prosper in all their under*
takings. The rings which they suppose to be thus generated are
called Gleinu Nadroedh,      i. e. gemmce anguium, whereof I
have seen at several places about twenty or thirty.         They are
small glass amulets, commonly about half as wide as our finger
rings, but much thicker; of a green colour usually, though some
of them are blue, and others curiously waved with blue, red, and
white. I have also seen two or three earthen rings of this kind,
but glazed with blue and adorned with transverse streaks in fur
rows on the outside. There seems to be some connexion between
the glein neidyr of the Britons and the ovum anguinum men
                                                               tioned

tioned   by Pliny* as being held in veneration by the Druids of
 Gaul, and to the formation of which he gives nearly the same
origin.    They were probably worn as an ensign or mark of di
stinction, and suspended around the neck, as the perforation is
not sufficiently large to admit the finger."
    The bead engraved in Tumulus No. 9 resembles closely a
coarse sort of bead, still manufactured in Syria, brought over by
Dr. Meryon. The glass globes dug up in Lincolnshire, and pre
sented by Sir Joseph Banks to the British Museum, are very like
a distinct sort of aggry beads dug by the natives even more rarely
than the others, but not larger than a moderate-sized apple :
they are more opaque than the other beads ; and the ground or
body is generally black, speckled confusedly with red, white, and
yellow.
    Aggry is the generic not the abstract name : ' awynnee' is
bead, but aggry is an exotic word no native can explain. When
first I heard of similar beads having been lately dug in India, I
associated for an instant the expectation that it might have been
in the neighbourhood of Agra, and thus have thrown some light
on the name ; 'but it appears they were found in Malabar. I am
indebted for the following account of this interesting discovery to
a gentleman lately returned from India : " The bead you sent
me is more like those I saw in India than any I have seen before,
but it is thicker and shorter ; neither does the material of which
it is formed exactly agree with those in India, which appear to be
of a red glass very like red carnelian (such however are frequent
among the aggry beads) with white lines of enamel inlaid as it
were in the body of the bead.         I gave these to a friend in India,
who promised to send them to the Asiatic Society in Calcutta.
The circles of stone in which these beads have been found abound
most in Malabar, in the neighbourhood of Calicut ; but I have
seen them in other parts of India, and I am of opinion that they
might be traced throughout the whole of the southern peninsula.
They are formed of large masses of rough stones placed round in
irregular circles, some of verv large extent, some of smaller ; they
appear so much like natural rocks that most persons would, pass
them unobserved. Several of these circles about three years since
were excavated in the vicinity of Calicut, and in the centre of
each of them we found, at the depth of about five feet, a large
earthen jar, of the same shape as those found in Wiltshire, as near
as we could judge, for it was broken to pieces : it was about four
or five feet deep, its mouth in general closed with a square piece
of granite : the beads were found at the botom of these jars with
some pieces of iron, apparently parts of swords and spears. There
was an iron javelin found in one of these places tolerably perfect ;

it was   about five feet long, with a large iron knob at one end      of
it.   In the centre of one of the circles we came to     a flight of se
ven steps, which led to a eave excavated in the rock ; it mea
sured eleven feet in diameter and seven feet in its highest part ;
the entrance to it was a square opening of about eighteen inches,
mwhich was closed up by an immense block of granite. We found
in this place a great number of earthen pots of very curious shape ;
in one of these were the remains of bones which appeared to have
been but imperfectly calcined ; in several of the larger jars there
were the husks of rice, which dropped into dust immediately they
were opened. We found here also an iron tripod, and a very curious
stone somewhat similar to what the Indians now use for grinding
their curry-powder on. The large stones forming the circles were
set upright and capped with still larger ones. They are not of.
granite, but of the stone of the country in which they are situated ;
they are of different sizes ; I have seen some of them ten or twelve
feet high, and the large stone on the top from ten to twelve feet in
diameter, or perhaps more. Coimbatore is a district situated be
tween the Coromandel and Malabar coasts ; it is bounded on the
east by the river Caverv, on the banks of which the tumuli are
in general situated.      In some a few silver coins have been found
of a square figure with characters on them, which none of the most
learned Bramins have been as yet able to make out ; it is in these
also, that remains of very large swords, &c. have been found.
The Roman coins to the number of90 were all of gold, andNero's;
each of them had a cut or slit in it ; they were not found in one
of  these barrows, but were discovered in a garden by one of the na
tives when digging:; they were in a small copper pot.       Pandu kurt
literally means Pandu's caves or holes. Pandu is a very celebrated
personage in the Hindu mythology, and a great warior ; it is com
mon in India to ascribe to him all great works of antiquity: this
term, therefore, only shows that these places are very ancient, and
that the present inhabitants are quite ignorant of their origin.

larly the excavated temples ; the author's journey across the De
sert to Egypt ; and some interesting particulars respecting the
labours of Belzoni, Caviglia, and Salt, in exploring the pyramids,
the sphynx, the tombs, and the temples, in Egypt and Nubia.
   As military operations come not within the plan of our pub
lication, we will select some particulars respecting the antiquities
of Egypt, which, with previous articles in our present volume, will
give our readers some idea of the labour it has cost the meritorious
individuals above named to lay open these ancient edifices, to pro
cure the knowledge that has been obtained respecting them, and
to gain possesion of those singular monuments which already grace
the British Museum, with others now on the way, or in readiness
to be embarked, to be deposited in the same singularly splendid
and unrivalled collection of Egyptian antiquities.
   On the author's arrival at Cairo, he introduces us at once to
 some of the curiosities collected by Mr. Salt. "At last (says he) we
reached the door of the house I was in search of, and learned,
with pleasure, that its owner was at home.         I jumped off my
donkey, and passing through a narrow passage, entered a court
yard of small dimensions ; and from the extraordinary figures
against the walls around me, should have fancied I was in the
catacombs, had I not recollected that I was in the sanctum sanc
torum of an inveterate and most successful antiquarian.          The
lantern illuminated the massy figures around ; and having the
prospect of viewing them the next morning, I went on with the
hope of entering when supper was on the table ; but before I
could attain the desired object, I had to pass two large wooden
figures, like porters, at the door, from the tombs of the kings of
Thebes                     While at supper, Mr. Belzoni, of whom
I had heard so much, made his appearance, and I was greatly
struck with his person, being in the Turkish costume.         He was
the handsomest man I ever saw, was above six feet six inches high,
and his commanding figure set off by a long beard.          He spoke
English perfectly, and the subject which had engrossed our
thoughts so long, that of opening the second pyramid, was brought
on the tapis*." — It was agreed that they should set off next day
to see the adjacent wonders.

zoni, by what he calls a certain index, which has guided him in
opening the second pyramid: what this index is I know not; but
certainly he has been most successful, and cherishes the intention,
if supported by our government, of doing much more. In my
opinion, he is too valuable a man for us to permit to labour for any
other nation. Fame appears to be the object for which he is most
anxious, though he has nothing to live on but the produce of a
few statues sold to the Comte de Forbin (who has been in this
country travelling for the French Government), to replace those
various niches in the Louvre now vacant by our having forced them
to deliver back divers works of art to their original possessors.
     " Mr. Salt showed me some beautiful specimens of papyrus
 which he had himself taken out of the mummy wrappers. They
 all appeared to have at the top of the roll a representation of re
 ligious worship, and the figures were painted in more than one
colour. He pointed out some small wax figures; one with the head
 of a woman, one with an eagle's head, one with a monkey's, and
 another with that of a ram : these were uniformly found in the
better kind of mummies. To prove that sculpture had been car
ried to very great perfection among the ancient Egyptians, he
showed me a small leg and thigh made of wood, about 10 inches
long, most correctly carved, and equal to, if not surpassing, any
thing I had previously seen. He showed me also a piece of linen
 covered with hieroglyphics, which appeared exactly as if it had
 been printed.     Several mummies which he had opened had down
the front of their person broad pieces of leather, gilt, as fresh as
the day they were made ; and I have understood that gilding
has, in several instances, been proved to be well known to the
 Egyptians
    " Both Mr. Salt and Mr. Belzoni were enraptured with the
sarcophagus they had discovered ; and when I fully comprehended
its beauty and value, my feelings were congenial with theirs with
out having seen it.          A piece of alabaster 9 feet 3 inches long
vating in calcareous materials as in Egypt. Of this grand temple he has given
in the volume before us such an account as the short time he was there would
permit.    He speaks of the sculptured decorations and the taste of the orna
ments in this temple being such as " would do credit to the best period of
the Grecian school ;" and gives the following measurements of this extraor
dinary place " from the Asiatic Researches." — Gateway, height 14 feet :
passage of the gateway, having on each side rooms fifteen feet by nine, 42 f. ;

wall of the temple, 103 f. 6 in.; length from the same place to the end of the

 would in itself be a curiosity; but when it is considered that so
 much pains have been used in the elaborate carving of so fragile
 a material, it alraost surpasses belief.  It is, made something in
the form, of a human body, but. the sides of it are not above 2|
inches thick, all deeply carved in miniature figures representing
triumphs, processions, sacrifices, &c. All these figures are stained
In. the deepest blue ; and when a light is placed in th.£ inside, the
alabaster being transparent, they appear upon a pellucid ground.
It was found in what Mr. Belzoni supposes to be a tomb of the
god Apis, and was most unaccountably placed across the top of a
hollow passage (which leads 300 feet beyond, into the solid rock,
and has not yet been explored to the utmost) with not above one
inch resting on one of the sides, so that, had it slipped, it would
have fallen and been shattered to pieces.
    " We visited the court-yard which I had passed through last
night, and surveyed four statues of black granite as large as life,
with women's bodies and heads of lions. They are in a sitting
posture, with the emblematical key of the Nile in one of their
hands. Belzoni discovered these, with about thirty others, deep
under the sand.      They had been deposited there without regu
larity, as if to be concealed.    Two of these he had sold to the
 Comte de Forbin for the French Museum. Mr. Salt next drew
my attention to two wooden figures as large as life, found at
Thebes in a standing position.       They were covered with a sort
of varnish, and had their eyes and part of their bodies inlaid with
some metal."
    On the 10th of March 1818, the author set off with Messrs.
 Salt and Belzoni to view the Pyramids. He pays a just tribute
to Captain Caviglia, who so successfully explored the well as it
used to be called in the great pyramid ; to him and Mr. Salt, in
laying open the front of the sphynx ; and to Belzoni, of whose
labours in opening the second pyramid he gives some particulars.
 "  At a distance were Arabs employed on the third pyramid, by
 Belzoni ; and certainly, if we may judge from his former success
at Thebes, and the second pyramid, it is to be hoped he will not
labour in vain."
    "  We proceeded (says the author) to the buildings of masonry
 situated to the west of the great pyramid. The paintings in the
 interior of one of these are particularly curious, representing,
 among other things, the mode by which large stones were trans
 ported both by land and water. In the former of these the stone
 is placed on a sledge drawn by bullocks with collars, which at
 the present period are not used in the country.     Figures of per
 sons ploughing, driving herds of cattle, fishing, in several in
 stances cooking immense quantities of provisions, and in one de
 sign, an uncommonly spirited fight in boats, in which the wea

 pon made use of is a spear, and the figures are particularly slen
 der and black. They appeared to me to represent persons si
 milar to the Arabs I saw at Mocha, or the slight forms of the
 inhabitants of the southern parts of India. They did not strike
 me as having the features of the negro."
     Speaking of the colossal head, now in Mr. Salt's possession,
 which was brought from the neighbourhood of Thebes, and is
 called the head of Orus, the author says: '' It is ten feet front
 the top of the mitre to the chin, having a band round the bottom
 part of it not unlike a turban.       It is of red granite, and in very
 fine preservation.     There is an arm eighteen feet long of the same
 statue, with the fist clenched, of excellent proportions.         Delzoni
 thinks he could convey the whole of the figure to England piece
 meal, and that it might be placed in any public situation, as one
 of the greatest and most 'complete remains of antiquity ever car
 ried out of Egypt. The celebrated French stone has also been
 removed to this place [Cairo],         It consists of a block of granite
 about four feet square, and has evidently been an altar.          On the
 sides are figures with draperies supporting the summit.            I hope
 eventually    to see the whole  of these   in  the British Museum    ;"— .
 and so must every one who can duly appreciate such valuable
 antiquities.
    We have not only been amused but instructed by the work
 before us, which cannot fail to be highly acceptable to the his
 torian, the military man, and the antiquarian.
 Description     of the Process  of manufacturing Coal-Gas for          the
    Lighting of Streets, Houses, and public Buildings; with Eleva

    procuring this Species of Light. With seven Plates. By Fre
    drick Accum, Operative Chemist, Lecturer on Practical Che
    mistry, &c. pp. 330.
    It  will be remembered that when the art of lighting by gas was
yet in its infancy, Mr. Accum published a Treatise, containing a
description of the various processes of the art as far as then un
derstood and practised in the metropolis.           Such was the general
avidity  for  information   on the subject,    that in the course of a few
years four large impressions of the work were disposed of, and
it was successively transferred into the French, German and Italian
languages.       Since Mr. Accum wrote that Treatise, however, the
art of manufacturing and applying coal gas has undergone many
material improvements, all combining to bring it to a degree of
simplicity, precision, and oeconomy, far surpassing every thing

which the original mode of practice exhibited. Mr. A., sensible
of this, felt, as he informs us, that he should have been" guilty
of an injustice to the constant demand which still exists for his
former Treatise," had he not made it his duty to suit it to the
changes which have taken place; and in execution of this de
sign, he has now presented the public with what is in fact quite
a new work, superseding altogether the former publication, but
superseding      it,
                 we must readily allow, from circumstances of ne
cessity, and with an undoubted view to the public good.
   The object which Mr. Accum seems already to have pursued
in the present work has been, to make        compendium of all the
                                              it

moment has been able to afford      and we must do him the justice
                                     ;
to state it  as our opinion that he has fulfilled   his object with
equal amplitude    and exactness.      includes
                                         It     not  only the result
of his owri experience in this department, which appears to have
been extensive, but     great number of valuable data with which
                        a
he has been favoured        by
                            other gentlemen practically versant in
the art;   and we are well satisfied the ingenious author will not
be disappointed in the hope he expresses of its proving        work a
of truly practical utility.

   We have here another work professing to embrace the same
objects as the one by Mr. Accum, which .we have just noticed.
Mr. Peckston in going over the same ground as Mr. A. seems not
to have found it; necessary to deviate greatly from the line of de
scription followed by the latter in the earlier editions of his work:
in some instances, indeed, he has adhered perhaps too literally
to Mr. A.'s statements and illustrations. See particularly n. 73,
the rules in which Mr. Accum acknowledges he borrowed from
the Plain Dealer, but which Mr. Peckston borrows at second
hand without making any acknowledgement either to the Plain
Dealer or Mr. Accum. Compare also from p. 85 to 90 inclusive,
on the theory of the combustion of coal, with what is said on
the same subject in the former editions of Mr. A.'s work.         Mr.
Peckston, however,    is less to be  quarrelled   with  for enriching
his work with valuable matter from preceding writers, than for
omitting much new matter, which, though within his reach, seems
altogether to have escaped his observation.       A sufficient cause
for this deficiency may perhaps    be found in the following resolu
tion, of which jn his preface he apprizes the reader : " He (Mr. P.)
has only further to observe, that in no one instance does he in
tend to lay before the public experiments which have not been
made under his own observation; unless of such a nature as are
likely to be beneficial, and then by stating his authority."      Mr.
P. has, we think, adhered sufficiently to the first part of this in
tention ; but failed in the second.     He has confined himself too
much to his own experience, and made too little inquiry after
the experience of other labourers not less assiduous in the same
department.     As far as he goes he is generally an intelligent, cor
rect and well-informed guide, but he has neither gone far enough
nor looked sufficiently round about him.         We shall subjoin, as
we have done with Mr. Accum's work, a table of the contents of
Mr. Pecksron's, in order that our readers may judge for them
selves between them ; but that the judgement we have ventured
to pronounce may not go forth without some facts in support of
it, we shaH briefly point out    few of those instances    inwhich we
                                 is a
think the sin of omission         honestly chargeable against Mr.
Peckston.
      In p. 212,  speaking of the purification
                   in                             of gas, he informs   us
that    "
       means have been tried for purifying        the gas  by  lime in a
semi-fluid state, thus decreasing the quantity     of this objectionable
matter but the vessel which my observations
         ;                                        were made upon was
                                                                  found

        Peckston's Theory and Practice             of Gas-lighting.        457
found inadequate for accomplishing the purpose of purification."
 In the hands of other people, however, this vessel appears to have
performed     its office very satisfactorily       ;   for we leam from     Mr.
Accum's work that it has been adopted at the Gas-Works at the
Royal Mint, Chester, Birmingham, Bristol, and       many other
                                                                  "
provincial gas establishments."
   In treating again from p. 220 to 272 of the gas-holder, and
giving " descriptions of such as would best answer the purpose
of the manufacturer ,"      he states pretty positively that a certain
 cylindrical gas-holder,    which  he describes minutely, with the ap
 pendages of balance weights, pulleys, and frame-work,
                                                                 " is the
-most simple construction of gas-holders for working on the or
 dinary principles that has hitherto been adopted." With balance
•weights, pulleys and frames—
                                  "   the most simple construction !"
    Would not Mr. P. think a machine without any of these ap
 pendages a vast deal more simple ? The reader who may think
 with us that there can be no doubt on the subject, will please to
be informed that all these appendages have actually been got rid
 of, and that gas-holders are now every where to be found in full
 action, without any such specific gravity apparatus attached to
 them. All that Mr. P. informs us        is,that some experiments have
been made       by a Mr. Malam to attain " method of working the
                                               a
gas-holder without using chains or balance weights, and in such
a way as to have the pressure uniform at all its heights           and          it
 does seem  a  little strange that set of experiments done in cor
                                     a                                a
ner, and never adopted in large practice, should have so parti
cularlyattracted Mr.P.'s notice, while he has overlooked entirely
 how perfectlv all the objects of these experiments have been                   al
ready publicly effected     by  the gas-holders without specific gra
vity apparatus adopted     at the Gas-Works of Bristol, Birmingham,
Chester, and most of the recent establishments for lighting                      by
coal-gas.    The gas-holder of this description at Bristol             we is,
believe, the largest which has been yet erected in this country.
 For its dimensions .see Mr'. Accum's work, p. 177- So much has
 the removal of the old appendages, as exemplified in Mr. Peck
ston's " most simple construction of gas-holders." contributed to
lessen the expense of this part of the apparatus, that, as we learn
from Mr. Accum's book, "         a  reservoir for storing up any quan
tity of gas may now- be furnished for nearly one-half the sum
which such a vessel cost as originally constructed."
    The manner in which this important improvement has been
effected is   by attaching to the gas-holder what         called
                                                             is     regu
                                                                      a
 lator or governor, through which the gas           made to pass before
                                                       is
it  enters into the mains.       Mr. P. has not. been unaware of the
 existence of this instrument, for he has devoted        chapter exclu
                                                            a
sively to it; but singularly enough he omits including among the                      ,
                                                                  various

  -458                     Notices respecting     New Books.
    various uses to which it is applied, that to which it is chiefly ap
    plied — the regulation of the specific gravity of the gas-holder.
         In the chapter on the regulator or governor to which we have
    just alluded, Mr. Peckston observes, p. 357, that
                                                               "  the smaller
    ones," for the purpose of regulating the size           of flames in the
    burners,    "  such as have fallen beneath his notice no reasonable
     person    would   expect much service from."         We have here an
    other instance of the disadvantage of judging from a limited
    sphere of observation ; for it is a matter of notoriety that many
    hundred governors of the description alluded to by Mr. P. have
    been for some time in constant action at Bristol, Birmingham,
     Chester, Manchester, &c. and have been found to answer ex
     tremely well.
         The chapter on gas-meters is almost wholly occupied in an
    attempt to settle the comparative merits of the gas-meter ori
    ginally invented by Mr. Clegg, and the instrument of the same
    kind supposed to be an improvement invented by Mr. Malam.
    We are not at all disposed to take any part in the controversy,
     resting satisfied that both instruments may be employed with ad
    vantage; but we hold it a duty to see that the facts as between
     the parties are fairly stated. Mr. P. asserts, p. 334, " that in the
     large establishments, where of course the gas-meter (i.e. Mr.
     Clegg's gas-meter) would in proportion be more useful, it has
     not been introduced."        We suspect that Mr. P.'s information on
     this point is somewhat inaccurate. On consulting Mr. Accum's
     work, we find that gas-holders of this description have been
     adopted at the Gas-works at Manchester, Bristol, and Ghester ;
     and " larger
                     " or better conducted establishments than these we
     need not look for, with a view to any sanction which their sy
     stem of practice affords.         It is also but just to observe on the
     other hand, that although it is now about two years since Mr.
     Malam's supposed improvement was made public ; yet the only
     gas-meters erected on his plan, of which we can find notice taken
     in Mr. P.'s book, are two — one at Brick- Lane, and another small
     one in Mr. P.'s own office.
          In the chapter on retorts, Mr. P. mentions that the first three
     of the rotary retorts which were ever put up, were worked un
     der his (Mr. P.'s) observation; and that had not the expense of
     erecting retorts of this description been very considerable, and
      the wear and tear enormous, they would doubtless have been
      adopted in the establishment to which he belongs; but that "both
      were so much against them that every idea of using them there
      was entirely relinquished."        This it will be observed was a first
      trial, and like most first trials appears to have been a very unsuc
      cessful one ; but Mr. P. seems not aware of what the reader will
      find fully shown in Mr. Accum's work, that since then the rotary
i                                                                      retorts

   retorts have undergone such improvements in point both of the
  facility and the oeconomy of working them, that though not used
   at Mr. P.'s establishment, they are now used almost everywhere
   else — at the Royal Mint, Bristol, Birmingham, Chester, &e.
      While we have thus pointed out some of tbe deficiencies which
   have arisen from the circumstance of Mr. P. confining himself too
   much to his own experience, we must not forget a tribute of well-
  deserved praise, which remains to be paid to the various Tables
  which he has given of the results of that experience.       They are

the first  Course   of the   kind  ever  delivered in the city of Cork,
and hias been greatly extolled by the highly respectable class
which attended it. It is with much satisfaction we have heard
that it is Mr. Davy's intention to deliver a course of a similar na
ture next year.
    One of his pupils has favoured us with some of his concluding
observations.     In addressing Medical Students he said, "As
Chemistry forms an indispensable part of your profession, it is
not a mater of choice, but of necessity, that you acquire a com
petent knowledge of this science.         The sooner you are initiated
into- the principles and doctrines of chemistry, the better.          The
acquisition will   not  only  be  important in itself, but it will deriva
additional value from the early habits of application with which
it will furnish you ; — habits which will be always useful, and which
you may immediately transfer to every other pursuit. Whilst you
are attending lectures on chemistry, and studying the best ele
mentary works on the science, you ought to be furnished at least
with a small apparatus (which maybe done at a trifling expense),
and make experiments yourselves.: — The information you will thus
gain, will make a deep and lasting impression, and will in fact
be more valuable than that which you can acquire by any other
means.
    You have chosen a useful, an honourable, but an arduous pro
fession; you all, I trust, anticipate the day, when you shall at
tain eminence and distinction in it ; when the talents, which now
in the season of youth you are cultivating with assiduity, shall
grow up and be matured in flourishing manhood, and not only re
flect lustre on your own name, but confer honour upon your coun
try. And why not ? In every liberal art, in every useful science,
eminence is the reward of labour. It is a proud distinction which
no power on earth it competent to confer; a tribute due only
to industry ; nor is it ever paid but as the price of individual and
active exertions.
    The highest motives are not wanting to awaken in you a lau
dable and generous ambition ; — reputation, influence, rank, and
property, are distinctions equally open to the talents of every in
dividual, and they particularly invite you to honourable exertion.
Animated by a noble emulation, inspired by an ardent enthu
 siasm, you can scarcely fail of ultimately attaining the proud and
enviable summit of excellence.
    So interesting is the study of chemistry (independently of its
professional applications)       that the pursuit of it in early life will
not dispose you to cast it off with the playthings of childhood,
 or the amusements of youth. A taste for this science, when once
                                                                 imbibedi

   imbibed, is scarcely ever eradicated. It grows with the progress
   of refinement, and is often conspicuous in those who are most di
   stinguished in active and social life.      It affords security against
   ignorance, superstition, and vice.      It helps to open and enlarge
   the mind, cures it of little partialities and narrow prejudices, and
   gives it a generous, liberal, and manly way of thinking.
      Chemistry is not an abstract study, terminating in barren and
   empty speculations ; but a practical science, designed to increase
   the sum of human happiness, and intended solely for the occa
   sions and uses of life.  As chemistry is eminently conversant with
   Nature, in her slow and silent as well as in her magnificent and
   terrible operations, we cannot turn our attention to it without
   feeling an expanse of thought, and a conscious elevation of mind.
   We cannot behold this wonderful system of things, with its mutual
   adaptations and subserviencies, without admiring the wisdom and
   power and goodness of our beneficent Creator, so eminently dis
  played in the perfection and majesty of his works.

               WAVBLLITE — A SUBPHOSFHATE         OF  ALUMINA.
      Berzelius has discovered, by a careful analysis, that wavellite
  contains phosphoric acid.      This mineral yields by analysis : alu
  mina 35-35 ; phosphoric acid 33.40 ; fluoric acid 2-06 ; lime
  0-50; oxides of iron and manganese 1-25 ; water 26-90.
                            SULPHURIN ACID.
      This new acid, discovered   by M.Gay-Lussac and M.Welther,
  is,  as  its name expresses, a combination of sulphur and oxygen,
  intermediate between sulphurous and sulphuric acid as regarding
  the dose of oxygen taken into combination.             It is obtained by
  passing a stream of sulphurous acid gas over black oxide of

water, which dissolves the sulphurinate.     Caustic barytes preci
pitates the manganese, and" forms with the sulphurin a salt very
soluble, which crystallizes like nitrate on muriate of barytes.
The sulphurinate of barytes thus obtained is decomposable by
sulphuric acid, added gradually to its solution, which precipitates
the barytes, leaving the sulphurin acid in the water.                              It   may be
much concentrated without any loss.

that it possesses a most horrid smell.      " Itis from this last cha

Greek vexgof.
   Dr. Hayden subsequently found in a marble of the same kind,
but from a different quarry and a few miles distant from the first,
a quartz almost as fetid as the necronite, and likewise associated
with small prisms of titanium. " These substances," he adds,
" carry with them a degree of interest in another point of view.
They seem to invalidate the opinion that the fetid smell of se
condary limestone shale, &c. is derived from the decomposition of
animal matter ; as their gangve is decidedly a rock of primitive
formation.
         TUNGSTEIN AND TELLURIUM FOUND. IN AMERICA.
    It is well known to mineralogists that tungstein is very rare,
and that tellurium is- found only in Transylvania.        Both metals
have been discovered in a bismuth mine in tha town of Hunting?-
ton, Connecticut. The tungstein was in the state of yellow oxide,
and the tellurium in the metallic state.      The tungstein is stated
to be abundant in the mine ; it is the ferruginous species known
to mineralogists by the name of wolfram. Both the tungstein and
the tellurium are found blended in the same picces,but whether in
mere mixture or in chemical combination is not yet quite deter
mined.      Many specimens of the tungstein exist without the tel
lurium, but every piece which has afforded tellurium has also af
forded tungstein, and in greater abundance. Even in well-defined
crystals both metals have been found in the same crystal, and
where the external appearance was homogeneous. In other spe
cimens a difference seems to be apparent, and a proper ore of
tellurium appears to be blended with a proper ore of tungstein.
This latter ore is the wolfram composed of oxide of tungstein,
or, as some choose to say, tungstic oxid combined with iron and
manganese. The crystals, however, are octahedral ; a fact which
we believe is not mentioned of this species by authors, although
this form is found in the calcareous tungstein. — American Journal

ACOUSTIC INSTRUMENT FOR ASCERTAINING THE STATE OF THE
                                  LUNGS.
    Dr. Laennec lately presented to the French Academy of Sciences
an acoustic instrument, which, according to the Doctor, affords a
certain means of discovering diseases of the thoracic viscera, and
particularly phthisis pulmonalis.        M. Perey was appointed by
the Academy to make a special inquiry into the utility of the in
strument ; and the report he has made is extremely favourable.
The little advantage, says the reporter, which has iu many cases
                                                                  been

been derived from the percussion of the breast, according to the
method of Auenbrugger, and a consideration of the facility with
which, sound is transmitted through solid bodies, suggested to
the inventor tne idea of studying, by the aid of similar interme
diums, the different sounds which the movements of the respira
tory and circulating organs produce in the interior of the chest,
and of ascertaining whether the sounds which they emit might not
give-some more certain signs than those already known, as to the
maladies with which they may be affected.          The instrument
which M. Laennec made use of        for this purpose was a cylinder
of wood, one foot in length, sixteen lines in diameter, and per
forated in the centre (like a pipe) by a bore of three lines in dia
meter.     This instrument, when applied to the chest of a healthy
individual when speaking or singing, only produces a sort of
humming sound, more marked at certain points of the chest than
others.    But when there exists an ulcer on the lungs, the hum-
mings sound changes into a phenomenon altogether singular,
 which the inventor calls pectoriloquy, and which the reporter
M. Perey regards as sufficient for furnishing a certain and easy
sign of any alterations in the state of the lungs.     M. Laennec
distinguishes three sorts of pectoriloquy, which, according to his
anatomical researches, correspond with the size of the ulcers,
with their state of vacuity or fullness, and with the consistency
of the matter which they inclose.

    By  an eclipse of a small star by the moon on the 5th    of De
cember 1818, observed by      Mr.  J. B. Emmett, and published in
 The Annals of Philosophy, No. 77, it appears that the star was
 visible when really behind the moon's disc ; an effect that could
 be produced only by the refraction of the atmosphere of the
 moon,. The existence of a lunar atmosphere has been very ge
nerally doubted, but certainly contrary to every philosophical
 principle.
                         MOVING    MOUNTAIN.

 and citadel of Namur have been receiving great enlargements;
 and the spring happening to be in the way of them got encum
 bered, and finally disappeared.   Not long afterwards the whole
 mass of the mountain was observed to be in motion, inclining in
 a direction towards the river Meuse ; owing,-as is reasonably con
jectured, to the pent up water having increased to such a quantity
 as to heave the mountain from its foundations. It has continued
ever since imperceptibly moving forwards in the same direction,
 without any part of it tumbling away, or any crevice breaking
out in its sides. Already it has advanced as far as the old road
to Dinant, which it now covers so completely, that a new line of
 communication lias been obliged to be opened by a bridge over
the Meuse.     The country people have given it the name ofThe

        Happy should   we be  if Pearce's statement should     be found cor
    rect, and the illustrious Park still in existence.         That Pearce
    gave    the  above relation  to the  writer  of the  letter,  we do not
    doubt ; but we question the truth of that relation.            There is a
    greater weight of evidence to prove the melancholy          fate of Park,
    than there is to prove his being still in existence. No intelligence
    has been received from him since he left Sansanding in the year
     1805 ; and this fact itself is a strong presumption that he is not
    now in existence, and a corroboration of the several accounts which
    have been published respecting the manner of his death, the most
    recent of which we lately noticed.          Pearce, we suppose, ob
    tained his intelligence respecting Park in Abyssinia; but the
    distance of Tombuctoo from the eastern coast is so great, and
    the intermediate regions so completely a terra incognita, that this
    consideration alone is sufficient to overthrow the whole story.
     But there is one fact which to us is decisive against the truth of
     Pearce's relation. Many of our readers, may have read the narra
    tive of Robert Adams, a sailor, who was wrecked in the year 1 S10
    on the western coast of Africa, detained by the Arabs of the Great
    Desert, and carried by them to Tombuctoo:           He remained there
    several months, resided the whole period of his stay in the pa
    lace of Woollo the king, and frequentlv walked about the town.
    Adams, from the uncommon degree of curiosity which he excited,
    believed that the people of Tombuctoo had never seea a white
     man before.     Now, supposing Park to have been then detained
     in that city (and he must have been there at that time, if Pearce's
    story be true), engaged in explaining to the rude and ignorant
     natives the sublime science of astronomy, is it at all probable,
     either that Adams would not have seen or heard of so wonderful
     a man, or that Park would not have found -some means of com
     munication with Adams?         The writer of the letter states, that
     when he met him at Juddah, Pearce was endeavouring to make
     his way to Tombuctoo.       This, in our opinion, is as improbable
*
  . as the story about     Park. For where is this Juddah? It h, no
     doubt, the well known sea-port of Arabia Felix on. the Red Sea.
     If it be so, and if Pearce were endeavouring to penetrate to the
     far famed Tombuctoo, is it not a little singular that he should
    endeavour to do so from Juddah, which is on the Asiatic side of
     the lied Sea, which, before he could commence his journey, he
     must cross to the African side ?                                 storm

                               STORM COMPASS.
                                 7.0  Mr. TilldVh.
    •Step. Tbiiuy^^btmkmi^m'him^mii mmteim font
laist Nurpber, I take the liberty to advert to a hew stdtm com
pass which was introduced Hito the port of Genoa by a Danish
vessel.       The Baron de Zach first called, my attention toit, and
 I tool: a sKetch of it at fHe time ; but as it appfcifffc td me suf
ficiently explained at page 200 of THe " Cbrrespondance Astro-
nomique," &c. I shall simply submit a translation.
     It  seems ah interesting     improvement;    arid may' be Useful J and
it might have escaped my recollection,             but for the incident in
question.
     "All    the secret 'of the storm coMpass consists in this, that the
 ic&p   fixed at the bottom of the box is mounted according to the
suspension of Cadran.            The whole compass is suspended a ta
 Cadran, arid the cap in like manner : thus the motion of the ves
sel is >doubty counterbalanced.         The cap reversed, is mounted in a
kind of fork which attaches to the bottom of the box ; it balances
in this fork', and tarries below a little tail of copper, which serves
as a counterpoise for it in the different balancings on every side.
We can how easily comprehend that the needle of such a com
pass ought necessarily to experience fewer shocks in the violent
 movements of a ship upon a stohny sea, than in ordinary com
 passes in which the box is well counterbalanced, but not the card.
 It is on this account that it receives the name of storm compass.
                   I have the honour to be, sir,
                              Your most obedient humble servant,
