   Similar results were arrived at by Guldberg & Waage".
They found that the force which produces the formation of A<U+017F>
and B' increases proportionally to the coefficient of affinity (k)
for the reaction A+B = A/+ # , and is proportional to the pro
duct of the active masses (p,q) of the two substances A and
B: they equate the force to kpº, and, on this basis, find them
selves able to represent the results of a long and detailed expe
rimental investigation into the measurement of chemical attrac
tion. They have also shown that the results of the researches
of Berthelot, Scheerer and Debus are capable of representa

research on the fractional precipitation of mixed baric and
calcic chlorides by sodic carbonate deserves especial notice,
because the numbers obtained by that chemist had long been
supposed to support the ordinary view that chemical action is
 characterized by discontinuity.       No real break, however,
occurs. Of his three   investigations,  they take that f in which,

     I cannot dismiss the    question of chemical substances without
referring for a moment to those that are isomeric. The general
phenomena of isomerism are conceived to point irresistibly to
an atomic theory of some kind. As                                   I

Until periodic verifications are made            the quantities     of which                          in

if the atomic theory is indeed the legitimate parent of the                                           in

   (8) The use of such symbols will depend upon the object in
view. One instance of their application has been given in (7),
                 .
where the effect of one          (calcic chloride) on another
variable (baric sulphate) is thereby expressed. The logarith
mic and hyperbolic curves of Esson, in which are shown
the relations        of changing substance to change produced, also
make use of such symbols.                 These are representations of the
chemical process.
   But we          to use symbols for other purposes.      Suppo
sing that, in Debus's investigation, baric iodide had been used
instead of baric chloride, what weight of the former would
have done the same work as the latter? The answer to this
question gives us the real or dynamic equivalent of baric iodide
in terms of baric chloride.   In other words, if i stand for baric
iodide and c for baric chloride, it is a solution of the equation
                                        i-fe.
It was after such numbers that Bergman sought in vain; but
he was the first who clearly saw their immense importance.
In memory of him we may term them Bergmannics.         For the
few that are known          I

Society, vol. xviii. p. 348, and this Journal (IV.), vol. xliv.
p. 506". Thus, if N stand for thallous, argentic, or plumbic
nitrate reduced to the unit (NO3), and P stand for potassic
nitrate, the bergmannic is
                                      N =# P       ;
if S   stand for sodic nitrate,
                                        S = 1 P.
Diffusion bergmannics were obtained by Graham (Phil. Trans.
                        jº.
1850, p. 46), who proved that they are not by nature atomic,
but either equal          or multiples of equal weights.

     Having harvested such dynamic units, and classified them
upon a common scale, we should certainly see a new calculus
and a new nomenclature. Instead of Daltonian atomic weights,
we should have the realities which have termed bergmannics;        I
and chemical substances, instead of being named dually, on
the current system, would be called by their bergmannic sym

volume “On Fuel,’ 1875, p. 419. The Chinese give some of
their common earthenware a coating of carbon of this kind,
which gives it a metallic lustre. Mr. C. Tookey, formerly of
the Japan Mint, tells me that the Japanese use, for the roofs
of their houses, tiles which have been coated with carbon in a
manner similar to this.
    The second kind is that which is commonly known as hair
like coke, and is interesting inasmuch as it presents, when
 examined with the microscope, a great variety of curious forms.
 In most instances these “hairs” are of a dull black; but some
 times they have a silvery appearance. The forms assumed are
 occasionally of such a character that it is difficult to divest
 one’s mind of the idea that they are organic structures.
    The “hairs” are not uniform in thickness, but vary from
 the Tºrº of an inch in diameter, or even less, to perhaps the
 Tºg of an inch, or even more. Some are straight                   only                        or,
 slightly curved (figs.         5); others are bent, distorted, and

ridge broken up into segments, as in the figure. This speci
men is not cylindrical, but flattened, and has the appearance of
being two “hairs” placed side by side and joined to each other
at intervals.
    Specimens such as that given in fig, 11 do not seem to be so
common as some of the others.            At first sight this appears
like a number of shots      irregularly  massed together; but upon
closer inspection it will be seen that it consists, not of spheres,

which are uniformly turned
    Fig. 10 represents one of a number of forms which resemble
minute drumsticks—the knobs of each consisting of a tangled
mass of hairs and granules, and giving one the impression that
it has been caused by an explosion.
    With regard to the internal structure of this hair-like coke,
some of the fibres when broken open appear vesicular, while
                                                  I iii.
others are solid and have much the aspect of a piece of char
coal. The solid “hairs” must,                   have been formed in
the first  place  as threads of semifluid carbonaceous material,
and subsequently decomposed by being further heated. There is
little room for doubting that the vesicular kind of “hairs” have
been produced by a process of bubbling, caused by gases
forcing their way through the semifluid carbonaceous matters
in the manner intimated by Dr. Percy (loc. cit. p. 421). It is not
difficult to imagine that such simple forms as those represented
in figs. 3, 4, and 5 may have been formed in either of these
two ways, or to understand how a series of bubbles formed ra
pidly one beyond another might produce the moniliform cha
racter of fig. 7, although one would scarcely have expected it
to be so regular; but it is not easy to imagine how either pro
cess could have produced the regular Silique markings of
#: 9, or the
                   i.i.d.  of tubes (?) seen in the specimen fig. 8.
With    regard   to the   hemispheres   (fig. 11), one would like to
know how it is that     they  are so sharply  defined as half-spheres,
instead of
              .#     spheres (or nearly so), as we might have ex
pected them to be—that                 is,
                                  supposing that they are bubbles.
   The   figures  which are    given             do
                                         not represent       the formsall

I  have assumed in illustration only, is not 0.75, but 0:5; and

sures of a few pounds per square foot as in Morin's experiment,

where the pressure per unit of surface enormously exceeds the
crushing-resistance of the material as in his case, where the
pressure is that of a column 400 miles in              Yet it is upon
these data that his  argument   rests, and  by which he manages to
get rid of the largest portion of the work due to the descent of the
crust, and so to prove the residue insufficient for the production of

sented, than the Second Proposition, and from which the latter
could then             be

 we  name heat; while the second group comprises those hypo
theses which relate      the nature of the motion,
                                  to
     the group

cooling any natural substance below the temperature         the coldest                   of

   (4) Belpaire's axiom                    $,    viz.:-"If

first advanced          1871 in  and has since more fully developed
in  several large memoirs.
      Of   all

tion), but requires a special demonstration, and which is
equally important with the other, because it is only the combi
nation of the two that can form a complete basis for the mecha
nical theory of heat.”
   It is evident that Clausius's statement directly contradicts
the assertion of Rankine. The latter maintains that the Second
Proposition can be deduced from the First; while Clausius says
that the Second is not contained in the First.
   The purpose of the present paper is to examine this important
question, and to prove that, without any further hypothesis,
the Second Proposition can be deduced direct from the First.
                                            I.
  Every material body can be regarded as an aggregate of an
immense number of material points, which, under the influ
ence of internal and external forces, move according to certain
unknown laws. We will not bind ourselves to any hypothesis
concerning the nature of this internal motion; our sole and
single assumption shall be that the particles are not at rest,
but in some kind of motion.
   To characterize this motion, or, in other words, to determine
the thermic condition of a body, it is known that two indepen
dent variables are necessary. Let them be denoted by £ and
m; then the state of the body remains unaltered so              as                    ii,
neither £ nor m    changes;  but as soon as either § or m or both
together undergo a change, the state of the body in question
changes at the same time.
    As long as the thermic condition of a body remains un
changed, so long do, according to my conception, the total
living force (T) by itself, and the total potential energy (U) by
 itself, remain constant.
   If,  therefore, the state   the body

to hold good.
  But now, from the time =0 onward, we will convey

the vis vira and potential energy of the body will be augmented,
and, in general, external work will be done. In the measure
in which we add more and more energy to the body,                                              the state
becomes also more and more changed. Assume that the series
of successive changes is regulated in such manner that the con
dition-variables satisfy at every instant the equation m=f(£),
or, in other terms, that the succession of the changes of state
(say, the path of the state) is given by the function f. We will
continue the importation of energy until the condition-variables,
corresponding to the relation m=f(£), take the values     #1 and
mi.  Let the  quantity of imported   energy  be then Q.     With
the cessation of the importation of energy change of state

       city of the line cannot be neglected, it may be perfectly
        ced by distributing artificial capacity along the resistance
6 with the same uniformity it has along the line; and this may
be approximated to by subdividing the resistance and required
capacity as much as possible.                            If
                                               l is the resistance and li tile
capacity of the line, and c, the required capacity, then the con
dition of balance as regards capacity is cel-ll.
   Since each station has three adjustable resistances, a, b, and
e, and they are connected by the single relation air-bc, it fol

lows that any two of them may be taken arbitrarily and balance
made with            third. Thus we may take b and c as indepen
dent variables, and eliminate a.              The question then arises, in
what    respects   an   arrangement       in which the resistances b and c
have particular values differs from another in which b and c
have other values.          There are three principal differences: first,
 the  received currents will                       be

from               that the sensitiveness of any exact balance
            which we          see
to disturbances in the resistance of the line, either in duplex
working or in testing, is proportional to
                                                bc                         -

and this expression is a maximum when b and c have the values
given in (7) above.
   Hence it is perfectly hopeless to find any arrangement of
Wheatstone's                 bridge   for duplex telegraphy which shall give
the maximum                  received current at both stations and at the same
time be least       liable to disturbance.       Generally speaking, the
more sensitive the balance the         stronger   the received current.
    Since r, the resistance external to one station, includes the
resistance at the other station, any alteration of adjustment at
one station will theoretically cause a disturbance in the other
station's balance; and it is true that an infinite series of suc
cessive adjustments must be made by each station to reobtain
an exact balance whenever balance is disturbed.
alterations are so excessively small that

 resistance   a,  each station's balance becomes       independent   of the
 other's; but this is introducing a greater difficulty to avoid a
lesser and inappreciable one, since to keep be-fg frequent mea
surements would have to be made off, the battery-resistance, a
variable quantity; and besides, such an arrangement would not
give the maximum current, as is evident from equations (7).
    The above investigations apply to any instrument, battery,
and line, and therefore admit of immediate practical application
in any particular case.          There are, however, two principles

  Any instrument may be used in the bridge system without
alterations being made ; but in the differential system the
coils must be differentially wound, or some equivalent device
employed, so that two currents, one passing through each coil,
may annul each other's action on the magnet or cores within
them.   On the other hand, only one                 resistance is     ºfºil.

 exact balance being always required, the signalling can be
 continued for great lengths of time without any change of ad
 justment; and, moreover, the balancing resistances may some
 times be altered very considerably without actually interrupt
 ing the signalling.     The actual received current may be con
  sidered as the algebraical sum of two parts—one the proper
  received current, the other an interfering current produced by
  inexact balance. In the double-current Morse system in com
 mon use in England the marks are made by one current (say,
  positive), and the spaces by the negative current.       If C is the
  strength of the received current, then the whole range of the
  current is 2C.    In the single-current Morse system employed
  on the Continent and elsewhere there is no current during the
  spaces; hence the range of the current in the receiving instru
  ment is only C. Therefore an instrument that admits of being
  worked either by single or double currents, as magnetized or
  polarized relays, will give signals twice as strong with double
  currents as with single with the same battery-power.           This
  applies both to ordinary single working and to duplex work
  ing. In the latter there is a further advantage in favour of
  double currents.     It is theoretically possible to work duplex
  with double currents when the interfering currents are little
 less strong than the received currents; for as the received
  current is always either + C or      –C,   the superposition of any
  current of less strength than C will not alter the sign of C,
  whether + or —. On the other hand, in single-current work
 ing the received current is always either C or zero. In the
  first case the current C overpowers the tension of a spring or
  other opposing force; and in the latter the spring is unopposed,
  The most rapid signalling is to be obtained when the forces
 moving the armature or tongue of the relay are equal in each

 direction ; and then the retractile force of the spring must be
 equivalent to a reverse current of the strength 4C.
 the interfering currents in duplex working with single currents
 must never be so great as C—thus giving an immense advan
 tage to the double-current system as regards freedom from         in
 terruption by inexact balance or other causes, in addition to
 the advantage before mentioned of giving signals of twice the

 currents are, as much as , or       ;  the strength of the received
 currents with double currents, and # or 4 with single cur
 rents - although no hard and fast line can be drawn, owing to
 the very numerous causes in operation.          On an overland wire
 worked    duplex  with differential  relays  and double currents the
 resistance which gave exact balance was, at one end, 2560

           Mr. O. Heaviside   on Duple.” Telegraphy.           43
ohms, which could be increased to 3860 or diminished to 1760
ohms without interrupting the working. At the other end the
balancing resistance could be varied from 3000 to 6000 ohms           .
without interfering with rapid signalling.     The variation
allowable above balance is always much greater than below,
because the interfering current is inversely proportional to the
resistance external to the battery, which is increased when the
balancing resistance is increased. In the above example the
line was fairly insulated.   When the insulation falls, the effect
is to strengthen the sent and weaken the received currents;
consequently the interfering currents bear a larger ratio to the
received currents for a given change of balance; and the balance
therefore requires nicer adjustment.       The extreme case is
reached with the very low insulation which prevails in this
country in continuous wet weather, when not much difference
can be detected between the resistance of the wire whether it
is insulated or to earth at one end. Under such circumstances
a very small change of balance is sufficient to upset the work
                             iº,
ing.   The ratio of the interfering to the received currents
may be diminished ad lib. by increasing the resistance of the
apparatus, or more simply by inserting a constant resistance
in the main circuit. As,               it is only when the insula
tion is very bad and the received current very weak that the
interfering current due to inexact balance attains such a pro
portional strength as to mutilate the signals, the increase in
the resistance of the apparatus would be an evil rather than a
benefit, on account of the reduction in the strength of the re

    The two other systems               in my former paper (Phil.
 Mag. June 1873) are not likely, in accordance with the prin
 ciple of the survival of the fittest, to come into practical use;
 and it is therefore unnecessary to enter into details concerning
 them.    But this I  may observe, that in both of them the ar

 the case in four different systems, renders it probable that it is
 universally true for  allduplex systems,  in         some kind of
 balance is  concerned.

     HAWE, in the first place, to                     redeem the promise given     in
      $89, and, by discussing the behaviour as cryogens and
cryohydrates of a few peculiar                   salts, to complete one part       of
my undertaking.
   § 105. Chloride of Calcium as a Cryogen. A. Crystallized
CaCl, +3H, O.-The heat liberated when anhydrous CaCl, is
brought into contact with water interferes with, by diminish
ing, the manifestation of cold due to the proper liquefaction of
the salt and of the ice when the two are brought together.
Accordingly in experiments with chloride of calcium as a cryo
gen  .#      are to serve as a guide to the temperature at which
the formation of the cryohydrate may be predicted, we may
conveniently begin with the crystallized salt. A seasonable
 fall of snow last winter enabled me to extend my experiments
 with the chloride of calcium, not only in regard to the relative
 quantity of the two constituents, but to the relative effects of
 snow and pounded ice, and to establish conclusively that the
              i.
 two are of quite equal power when used as one element of a
 cryogen.         crystallized CaCl, +3H, Q was finely powdered
 and placed in weighed quantities on the weighed snow or
 crushed ice in a beaker, the two being             continuously  sti
 with the thermometer.        Under these conditions the lowest
 temperature       is   quickly reached.

    Here the lowest temperature is reached at the ratio 1 : 4, or
about CaCl, +15 H. O. We must not attach too much import
ance to the numbers of this Table, because, as before remarked,
the liberation of heat when the anhydrous salt dissolves in, or
rather combines with water, largely supplies heat for the lique
faction of the solid ice and salt. And accordingly, though the
heat-quantity concerned may be deduced from knowledge of
the quantity due to such combination and the specific heat of
the solution and the heat of liquefaction of the ice, yet the tem
    rature or heat-tension, being a function of the time or rate of
  iquefaction, cannot be so deduced. The caking of the chlo
ride is also a source of experimental difficulty.
     § 107. Monohydrated Chloride of Calcium as a Cryogen.—
 On baking the terhydrate of chloride of calcium a porous mass
is left, which is used for the absorption of water in gases.
 This, though called anhydrous in commerce, contains about
one molecule of water. And the presence of the water is be
 trayed when the body is used as a cryogen.                   The chloride,
 finely powdered, was weighed upon snow or ice and stirred
with the thermometer unceasingly. The higher ratios of frozen
 water were ice, the lower ones were snow; the two are con
nected together at the 50 per cent. ratios, marked +.

Hence it appears that the presence of the nitrate of sodium
lowers the temperature at which the cryohydrate of the nitrate
of potassium is formed, while the temperature of final solidifi
cation is virtually as low as when the nitrate of sodium was
alone present.

     Since the water-worth of NH, Cl is  12:4 and that of KCl is
16-61 (§  88),  we cannot look   upon   the compound body as a
mixture of the two   cryohydrates;   but we may perhaps regard
it as consisting of seven molecules of the cryohydrate of chlo
ride of ammonium in which three molecules of ammonium are
replaced by potassium.
   The possible precision in the analysis of the mixed chlorides
of potassium and ammonium induced me to extend the exami
nation to the intermediate crops of cryohydrates.   Accordingly,
the  dry salts being  mixed as before in   equivalent ratio,                                        #.
solved, concentrated and cooled, five successive crops of cryo

58              Frederick Guthrie on Salt Solutions
were treated in the same way. This gave solution (2).           On
cooling (1) and (2), they showed the same behaviour throughout
and solidified to dryness at —5°.       And accordingly there is
so far nothing  in their behaviour to disprove their identity.
But this does not show that partial double decomposition has
ensued in both cases to produce in each mixture a portion of
the original synthetical constituents of the other. On the con
trary, a comparison of this experiment with those above dis
cussed (of the form AX+                Ex.
                                    oes very far to prove, not that
there are four salts in each of the solutions 1 and 2, but that
there is none of the original salts in either.       For it has ap
peared that when AX and BX are mixed in solution, the tem
perature of final solidification is in no case sensibly above the
temperature required for the solidification of that constituent
whose solidification takes place at the lowest temperature.
Now,   if in solution (1)          or (2) there were nitrate of sodium pre
sent, whether original or derived, the final solidification would
not take place above –17° instead of –5° as found.                The
absence of nitrate of sodium     argues  forcibly  for the absence of
each of the other single salts.      The most rational formula for
such a mixture is the most empirical one possible.             As we
cannot intertwine the     symbols into a monogram     in three dimen
sions, I  arrange them alphabetically, and denote either of                            the

excess  of hydrogen at the high temperature of the flame seemed
to reduce the oxide of calcium, and an atmosphere of vapour

      as is well known, advanced a law on the force exerted on

72               Royal Society:—Mr. Tisley on a new
1867 (see Royal Society's Transactions) the power of augmenting
the magnetism by successive currents, developed from the original
residual magnetism contained in the iron, was fully demonstrated,
and it was shown that the power of the machine could thereby
be developed to a great extent; but the only means for obtaining
external work was by the insertion in the circuit of a magnet or
coil so that the secondary discharge could be utilized. Sir Charles
Wheatstone also showed that a great part of the current could
be shunted through a platinum wire, care being taken that the
resistance of the platinum wire was sufficient to compel a large
part of the current to pass round the electromagnet.
   In the same year the writer designed a machine which was made
by Mr. Ladd, and described by him in a paper read before this
Society (see Transactions), the principle of which was that two
separate armatures being introduced, one was employed for mag
netizing the machine, the other being used for external work.
This machine gave a good electric light &c., and was shown in
the Exhibition of Paris, 1867, when a silver medal was awarded
for it.
   To simplify this machine, the author of this paper afterwards
placed the two armatures in the same groove between the poles
of the electromagnet, bolting the two together at right angles to
each other, so that they came under the influence of the magnetism
alternately; by this method one pair of bearings was sufficient
instead of two, and the machine altogether was much simplified.
   The machine now about to be described is a still further modifi
cation, in which the greatest amount of simplicity and effective
power are combined.
   The apparatus consists essentially of an electromagnet with
shoes, forming a groove in which a Siemens's armature is made to
revolve: this is much the same as the original machines made by
Siemens and Wheatstone; but the difference occurs in the break or
commutator; here there are two springs or rubbers employed in
taking the current off from the commutator. The commutator con
sists of threerings: one of these rings is complete for three quarters
of the circle, the other quarter being cut away; another ring is cut
away three quarters, leaving the one quarter; and in between these
two rings is a third ring, insulated and connected with the insu
lated end of the wire wound round the armature; on this centre
ring are projecting pieces, one a quarter of a circle and the other
three quarters, so arranged as to complete the two outer circles.
The rubber spring which comes into contact with the quarter of
the middle circle is connected with the electromagnet of the machine,
and the armature is so arranged that at the time of contact the
best magnetizing current is developed.       The other spring rubber
is in connexion with the wire on the armature during the other
three quarters of      its
                        revolution; and this      connected with any
                                                 is
external piece   apparatus required
                  of                   to   be
                                         worked.          -
  By this arrangement, the alternate currents being utilized, they
are   all  the same direction; and
            in                         by
                                       the length     of
                                                     contact the

             Form of Dynamo-Magneto-Electric                               Machine.                  73
whole of the current is obtained in the best condition for heating
wires, decomposing water, giving an electric light, and other usual
experiments.
   At present a model machine has been constructed on this prin
ciple, the armature of which measures 5 inches long by 2 inches
diameter, on which is wound about 50 feet of cotton-covered copper
wire, no. 16, B. W. G. The magnet has about 300 feet of covered
copper wire, no. 14, B. W. G. : the whole instrument, without
the driving-gear, weighs 26 lbs. ; with this apparatus 8 inches of
platinum wire, '005, can be made red-hot, water is rapidly decom
posed, &c.
    The armature is constructed specially to prevent the accumulation
 of heat to which every class of dynamo-magneto-electric   machine is
liable.     It
             is made in two halves, a groove of a zigzag form being
 cast in each half, so that when the two are screwed together a
 continuous channel is maintained through the bearings for a cur
 rent of cold water to pass during the whole time the machine is at
work.
   The advantages suggested by these arrangements are their ex
treme simplicity, the few number of parts, only one armature and
one   wire being used.
   This principle of the alternate current being utilized is also
applicable to machines constructed on the multiple armature prin
ciple; and the economy thereby resulting would prove of great
advantage, as the power of the machine could be varied by throwing
into the electromagnets either every other current, or every fourth,
sixth, or eighth current, according to the strength required in the
machine, the whole of the other currents being utilized for electric
light or otherwise.
   “On the Determination       of Verdet's Constant in Absolute Units.”
By    J.   E. H. Gordon, B.A.,  Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge*.
   In the year 1845 Faraday discovered that certain media possess
the property of rotating the plane of polarization of light passing
through them when a magnetic force acts on them. About the
year 1853 M. Werdet found that with the same magnet and medium
the rotation is directly proportional to the strength of the magnet
—that       is,
           that the ratio between the amount            rotation and the  of

     “On      Rolling-Friction.”           By Professor Osborne Reynolds.
     The motion of a roller or wheel on a surface is always attended
with resistance.       Coulomb made some experiments with wooden
rollers on a wooden plane, from which he deduced two laws, viz.
that the resistance is proportional to the weight of the roller, and
inversely proportional to its diameter. These laws have since been
found to apply to other substances, a different coefficient being used
in each case. Beyond this, however, nothing appears hitherto to
have been ascertained as regards the nature of this resistance to
rolling. The source from which it springs does not appear to have
been made the subject of investigation.
    Some time ago it occurred to the author that it was probable
 that the deformation of the surface of the roller and of the plane,
which must take place at the point of contact, would affect the
distance which the roller would advance in turning through a
 certain angle". The pressure of the roller on the plane causes a
certain temporary indentation and lateral extension in the latter,
 so that in passing from one point to another the roller does in
 truth pass over a greater extent of surface than the distance between
 these points.      A simple experiment was sufficient to verify the
 truth of this  conglusion.    An iron roller 18 inches in circumference
 was found to roll through something like # inch less than a yard
 in two complete revolutions when rolling on a plate of india-rubber.
 The softness of the india-rubber suffered the roller to indent it
  considerably; and hence it might be expected that the effect would
 be much more apparent than when the roller was rolling on iron
 or any hard material. At the same time there is doubtless a certain
 amount of indentation in this latter case; and this will probably
 cause a similar alteration in the distance rolled through, although
 too small to allow             its
                           being measured.
    This  falling         off

 suggested          an
                  explanation                         rolling, namely, that

  causes the one surface to slide over the other; and this sliding is
  accomplished against friction.        In this way we should expect to
  find the resistance to rolling greatest under those circumstances in
  which the sliding is greatest, i. e. where the indentation is greatest;
  and so far it is in accordance with Coulomb's laws.                In the case
 of india-rubber, we find the slipping is very large; and hence we
 should expect the resistance to rolling to be large also ; and ac
 cordingly we find it so, for it is more than ten times as great as
 when the roller is on an iron plane. This very great resistance
 which india-rubber causes to rolling appears not to have previously
 caught attention; and yet it is the natural explanation of the
 invariable failure which has attended the numerous endeavours
 which have been made to use this material for the tires of wheels.
     This idea, that the resistance to rolling is due to the friction
 between the surfaces sliding at the point of contact, naturally leads
 to the conclusion that it must depend on the coefficient of friction
 between these surfaces, and that we might expect to diminish the
                                oil
 resistance by using           any other means
                                or                    reducing the coefficient
                                                               of
 of  friction. This was the author's first       impression.      Experiments,
 however, showed that the effect            oiling the surface, although
                                                  of                                                 it
 did generally reduce the resistance, was very small; and sometimes
it  appeared        to
                  act     the reverse manner, and increase the resistance.
                           in
This conclusion         surmise was therefore wrong; and the cause
                           or                                                                        of

    The   investigation    to which this note refers has occupied me, with
little  intermission,    since my former communication in 1869 to the
Society, “On the Continuity of the Liquid and Gaseous States of
Matter.” It was undertaken chiefly to ascertain the modifications
which the three great laws discovered respectively by Boyle, Gay
Lussac, and Dalton undergo when matter in the gaseous state is
placed under physical conditions differing greatly from any hitherto
within the reach of observation.             It embraces a large number of
experiments of precision performed at different temperatures and
at pressures ranging from twelve to nearly three hundred atmo
 spheres.      The apparatus employed                                    is,

responding to 500 atmospheres, at which                     I  have no difficulty in
working with my apparatus, a mercurial column of the enormous
height of 380 metres, or 1250 feet, would be required.                      Although
the mechanical difficulties in the construction of a                   long  tube for
this purpose are perhaps not insuperable, it could only be mounted
in front of some rare mountain escarpment, where it would be
practically impossible to conduct a long series of delicate experi
ments. About three years ago                 I   had the honour of submitting
to the Council of the Society a proposal for constructing an ap
paratus which would have enabled any pressure to be measured
 by the successive additions of the pressure of a column of mer
cury of a fixed length; and working drawings of the apparatus
 were prepared by Mr. J. Cumine, whose services                        I am glad to
 have   again    this  opportunity     of     acknowledging.         An unexpected
difficulty, however, arose in consequence of the packing of the
screws (as      I  have already stated) not holding when the leather
was in contact with mercury instead of water, and the apparatus
was not constructed.            For two years the problem appeared, if
not   theoretically,    to be practically impossible of solution; but               I
am glad now to be able to announce to the Society that another
                                                                              .
method, simpler in principle and free from the objections to
 which     I  have referred, has lately suggested itself to me, by
 means of which it will,         I fully expect, be possible to determine
 the rate of      compressibility   of hydrogen or other gas by direct
 reference to the     weight   of a liquid column, or rather of a number
 of liquid columns, up to pressures of 500 or even 1000 atmo
 spheres.     For the present it must be understood that, in statin
 the following results, the pressures                 in atmospheres are
  º
 from the apparent compressibility, in some cases of air, in others
 of hydrogen gas, contained in capillary glass tubes.
    In this notice      I  will only refer to the results of experiments
 upon carbonic acid gas when alone or when mixed with nitrogen.

 It is with carbonic acid, indeed, that have hitherto chiefly
 worked, as it is singularly well adapted for experiment; and the
               it exhibits will doubtless, in their main features, be
  ound to    represent    those of other gaseous bodies at corresponding
 temperatures below and above their critical points.

80            Royal Society:—Dr. Andrews on the Physical
    I
    have been gratified to find that the two results (for 13°09
and 21°46) recorded in my former paper are in close agreement
with these later experiments.  On the other hand, the pressures
I have found are lower than those given by Regnault as the result
of his elaborate investigation (Mémoires de l'Académie des Sci
ences, vol. xxvi. p. 618).  The method employed by that distin
guished physicist was not, however, fitted to give accurately the
pressures at which carbonic acid gas liquefies. It gave, indeed, the
pressures exercised by the liquid when contained in large quantity
in a Thilorier's reservoir; but these pressures are always con
siderably in excess of the true pressures in consequence of the
unavoidable presence of a small quantity of compressed air, although
the greatest precautions may have been taken in filling the appa
ratus.   Even rim part of air will exercise a serious disturbi
influence when the reservoir contains a notable quantity of liquid.
   Law of Boyle.—The large deviations in the case of carbonic
                                                      I
acid at high pressures from this law appeared distinctly from
several of the results given in my former paper.          have now
finished a long series of experiments on its compressibility at the
respective temperatures of 6°7, 63°7, and 100° Centigrade.      The
two latter temperatures were obtained by passing the vapours
 of pyroxylic spirit (methyl alcohol) and of water into the rect
angular case with plate-glass sides in which the tube containing
 the carbonic acid is placed.    The temperature of the vapour of
the pyroxylic spirit was observed by an accurate thermometer,
whose indications were corrected for the unequal expansion of the
mercury; while that of the vapour of water was deduced from
the pressure as given by the height of the barometer and a
water-gauge attached to the apparatus.       At the lower tempera
ture (6°7) the     range of  pressure  which could be applied was
limited  by the occurrence of  liquefaction; but at the higher tem
peratures, which were considerably above the critical point of
 carbonic acid, there was no limit of this kind, and the pressures
were carried as far as 223 atmospheres.    I  have only given a few
of the results; but they will be sufficient to show the general
effects of the pressure.  In the following Tables p designates the
pressure in atmospheres as given by the air-manometer, t' the
temperature of the carbonic acid, e the ratio of the volume of the
carbonic acid under one atmosphere and at the temperature t' to
its volume under the pressure p' and at the same temperature, and
6 the volume to which one volume of carbonic acid gas measured at
0° and 760 millimetres is reduced at the pressure p and tempera
ture    t'.

than those produced by liquid nitrous oxide are reached.
   Law of Gay-Lussac.—That the law of Gay-Lussac in the case
of the so-called permanent gases, or in general terms of gases
greatly above their critical points, holds good at least at ordinary
  ressures, within the limits of experimental error, is highly probable
    m the experiments of Regnault; but the results                      I  have obtained
with carbonic acid will show that this law, like that of Boyle, is
true only in certain limiting conditions of gaseous matter, and
that it wholly fails in others. It will be shown that not only does
the coefficient of expansion change rapidly with the pressure, but
that, the pressure or volume remaining constant, the coefficient changes
with the temperature.           The latter result was first obtained from
a set of preliminary experiments, in which the expansion of carbonie
acid under a pressure of 17 atmospheres was observed at 4°, 20°,
and 54°; and it has since been fully confirmed by a large number
of experiments made at different pressures and well-defined tem
peratures.       These experiments were conducted by the two methods
commonly known as the method of constant pressure and the
method of constant volume.                    The two methods, except in the
limiting conditions, do not give the same values for the coefficient
of expansion; but they agree in this respect, that at high pressures
the value of that coefficient changes with the temperature.                        While
I  have confined this statement to the actual results of experiment,
I  have no doubt that future observations will discover, in the case,
at least, of such gases as carbonic acid, a similar but smaller change
in the value of the coefficient for heat at low pressures.                           The

and it is greater at lower than at higher temperatures.       But a
remarkable relation exists between the coefficients in the present
case which does not exist between the coefficients obtained from
the expansion of the gas. The values of a, deduced for the same
range of temperature from the elastic forces at different pressures,
are directly proportional to one another.  We have, in short,
                  0-004367_o.                                       0.04804_o.

     NOTE ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE UPPER STRATA OF THE
                ATMOSPHERE.  BY D. MENDELEEF.                                                                                     -
   A great number of atmospheric phenomena depend chiefly on
the difference of temperature of the strata of the air; and so the
quest of the theoretic and empirical laws of the variations of tem
perature with altitude has for a long time attracted the attention of
several savants.    Nevertheless even the theory of this question is
still very imperfect.
   The theory of the variation of temperature in the atmospheric
strata rests on the supposition that the upper strata receive heat
only from the lowest stratum, which is heated by the earth; the
upper ones, therefore, would be cooled in dilating in consequence of
diminution of pressure.      Such a supposition    contains implicitly
this  other, that air is diathermanous.    For this case Poisson has
demonstrated, between the final temperatures t, and t, when the
pressure varies from H, to H,”, the relation

     ON   THE ACTION OF FLAMES IN PRESENCE OF ELECTRIFIED
                     BODIES.  BY M. DOULIOT.
     A
     flame in communication with the earth discharges an electrified
conductor placed near it; and if the flame is insulated, the dis
charge still takes place.  In the first case the electricity of the
conductor flows into the earth; but there is occasion for investi
gating what becomes of it in the second. It is with this view that
the following experiments were undertaken.
   1. A lighted taper, insulated, is placed at an equal distance from
two electroscopes with gold leaves of equal dimensions, the knobs
of the electroscopes and the flame forming a triangle of about
20 centims, length of side. If we bring an electrified body between
the flame and one of the electroscopes, or into the interior of the
triangle formed by these three bodies, the electroscopes are affected
in the usual manner, and the gold leaves fall again as the body
brought near loses              its
                          electricity.   But     we place the electrified
                                                                        if

                                 the line from one      the electroscopes           of
to  the flame,  we see this   electroscope   become   charged    with elec
tricity    ofthe same kind        that lost                          it,
                                                the electrified body; the

former retains           its
                      charge;   the latter reverts      the natural state
when the electrified body has discharged itself             taken away.            a or to   is
   2.  The insulated flame         placed  between
                                                is     badly    conducting
                                                                                              a 15

tance from each.    Let     bring         us
                                   behind the screen     body charged
with positive electricity; the gold leaves    the electroscope diverge  of
instantly. We remove together both the screen and the electrified
body; the electroscope remains electrified, and           electricity                         its                 is
positive.  Nevertheless the electrified body has not been discharged;
we can assure ourselves that          still electrified positively; but
                                                     it   is
we find also that the screen     charged with negative electricity
                                                    is                                                            on
the face which was towards the flame and the electroscope.
   If, instead      removing together the electrified body and the
                     of
screen, we slowly take away the electrified body alone, we see the
gold leaves, which received      charge      positive electricity

instant when this body was brought near them, fall again, come
into contact, then separate afresh      we then withdraw the screen,
                                                          ;   if
we find that the electroscope remains electrified, that         contains                          to
negative electricity, and that the screen has reverted         primitive                          its it
state.
  It  would         be
               difficult    explain   to

     N my memoir entitled “Théorie           des Phénomènes Elec

way, that the resistance to galvanic conduction must be pro
portional to the intensity of the current.      This conclusion from
theory contradicts the view, hitherto generally received, that
 the resistance              to
                      conduction       independent  is   the current     of

the positions of the wire of the magnetometer were made use

                              and g, and in the other with h and n.
At Kan electromotor is inserted, one pole of which is connected
with g and h, and the other with the gold wire in the middle
                                                                  º
side-tube d. The gold wires of the outer side-tubes c and e
are united by means of a conducting-wire with fand n.
    Ifthe glass tube is filled with liquid, and this is at rest, the
current from the electromotor divides itself between the two
conductions, and these two portions of the current go
the turns of the magnetometer in opposite directions.              The
resistances of the two conductions are as      equal  as possible; and
the polarization in the one must be just in the same proportion
equal to that in the other, because the polarization of the gold
disk in the middle side-tube exerts the same action upon           É.
portions of the current, and the polarization of the two outer
polar disks must be of the same nature and amount. Both
portions must therefore be nearly the same in quantity, and
the sum of their actions on the magnetometer become nearly
equal to zero. The experiments also showed that the position
of equilibrium of the needle-system differed by only a few
scale-divisions from that occupied by the system when no cur
rent was passing through the windings of the magnetometer.
   If, for instance, the liquid is moving from a to b, one portion
of the galvanic current goes in the same direction as the flow
ing liquid, but the other portion goes in the opposite direction
against the liquid stream.          If
                                     the positive pole of the electro
motor is connected with the gold disk in the middle side-tube,
the stream of liquid and the portion de of the galvanic current
go in the same direction, but the portion cd in the reverse             di
rection to that of the liquid ; but if the negative pole of the
series is connected with the same gold disk, the conditions are
reversed. Now, if the resistance is dependent on the motion of the
liquid (as the theory requires), the two portions of the current
become unequal, and consequently the needle of the magneto
meter must make a deflection, the direction of which can easily
be determined beforehand.           But there is another reason that
the needle of the      magnetometer    may alter       its

the same manner. Although we try as much as possible to
give them the same magnitude, form, and position, yet a
slight difference in this respect may be present; and in con
sequence of it the variation in polarization effected by the flow
of the liquid may be a little greater in one plate than in the
other.    Under all circumstances a difference between the two
plates is present, consisting in the fact that during the flow of
the liquid the upper disk is exposed to a greater pressure than
the lower one; it is therefore possible that this may cause the
needle to make a slight deflection.            The deflection which
results from variation of polarization, however, we can make
 as small as we please, by selecting for the experiments liquids
                                                º
 the resistance of which is sufficiently great. Moreover it results
 from the experiments which have been made, that the direction
 of the deflection is determined exclusively by this—that the
 resistance of the liquid becomes less if it          in the same di
rection as the   galvanic  current,   but   greater  if the directions
 are opposite.
    The form of the experiments was as follows:—When the
positive pole of the electromotor was connected with the gold
 disk in the middle side-tube, as soon as the liquid was set mo
                     I
                          º
 ving from a to b obtained a deflection which indicated that
 the part of the current passing through the liquid column de
 (therefore the portion         had the same direction as the flow
 of the liquid) possessed a greater intensity than the other.
 Now the cause of this might either be that the resistance in the
 column de became less, and in column ed greater, than when
 the liquid was at rest, or possibly that by the motion of the
 liquid the polarization of the polar disk e was rendered feebler
 than that of the disk c.     If the change produced in the polari
 zation of the one disk   by  the motion of the liquid actually dif
 fered from that   produced    in the polarization of the other, this
 must have depended on the disks in the side-tubes c and e dif
 fering somewhat in size, form, and position, or else it was
because the one was exposed to a greater pressure than the
other.    Therefore it cannot be with safety concluded from a
 single experiment that the resistance to conduction is depen
 dent on the motion of the liquid. Thereupon the glass tube
 was inverted, so that the liquid flowed from b to a, while          all
 the other conditions remained unchanged. The direction         of  the
 deflection obtained was the opposite     of  the previous one, from
 which  it  follows that the part    of   the current which passed
 through the column      of  liquid from       to  (and consequently
 had the same direction
 than the other.

thereon depending, had no effect on the direction of the deflec
tion. If, as in the first experiment, the liquid moved from a
to b, and the negative instead of the positive pole of the elec
tromotor was connected with the disk in the middle side-tube,
the deflection obtained indicated that the part of the current
which passed through the liquid column c d (and therefore had
the same direction as the flow of the liquid) possessed a greater
intensity than the other. In the first two experiments, there
fore, the more powerful part of the galvanic current went be

but in the last experiment the more powerful current passed

    Series 1.—The glass tube had an internal diameter of 5.5
millims. ; the distance between the side-tubes was 70, and the
length of the entire tube was 270 millims.           The gold disks
were drawn so far back in the side-tubes that the distance from
                         ...i.
the inner surface of the glass tube amounted to 1 centim.
Trial was first made               a deflection could be obtained
merely by the motion of the liquid, without inserting an elec
tromotor at K. In this the gold disk in the middle side-tube
was connected immediately with the binding-screws g and h
by a simple conducting-wire.        As was to be expected, in - this
experiment not a trace of a current was observed.
    A series of two Daniell's elements was now inserted at K.
The rest of the conducting-wires were arranged as shown in
fig. 1. The position of equilibrium occupied by the needle
Wi.     the glass tube was filled with water at rest is denoted by A
in the following. As soon as the cock was opened and the
 water set in motion, the magnetometer-needle made a deflec
tion.    The scale-division at which the needle, after a complete
deflection, began to return, is given by B ; and D gives the
 difference between A and B.
    The negative pole of the electromotor was connected with
 the middle polar disk; the water-flow was from a to b:

  The            pole was connected with the middle disk; the

  The deflection had now the same direction as in the next
preceding experiment.    It thence follows that the part of the
current which coincided in direction with the water-flow,
going from d to c, exerted the greatest action.
   The glass tube was then inverted, so that the water flowed
again from a to b;         all

current   having  the same direction         as
                                           the water-stream was
stronger than the other.

   The direction of the deflection showed that the current                 in

   Consequently this series gives the same result as the first—
namely, that the resistance to galvanic conduction is diminished
if the conductor moves in the same direction as the galvanic
current, but it is increased if the two go in opposite directions.

than in the foregoing experiments; this results clearly from
equation (9).     On this account, the experiments had to be
conducted with suitable precautions to prevent the polarization
from affecting the direction of the deflections. Before each
experiment the electric series had to remain a longer time
closed in order that the disks might be completely polarized.
During this time the water-cock was several times turned on
and off.    It was only after this had been done that I could
reckon upon obtaining constant and regular deflections. It
must, besides, be remarked that the galvanic current employed
should not be too powerful, because the harmful effect arisin
from the galvanic difference between the disks increases

two Daniell's elements were     employed.      Out of the observa

lowing series. A, B, and D have the same signification as
before.
   Series 3–Here another glass tube was employed; but the
distance of the disks from each other and the diameter of the
tube were about the same as in the first tube. The velocity of
the water, when the cock was turned full on, amounted to about
 10 metres per second.      In reckoning the magnitude of the
deflections, the mean was taken of two successive positions of
equilibrium with still water.

106        Prof. E. Edlund on Galvanic Resistance as
other end of the windings a wire conductor went to the other
 brass spring.     From this it is evident that, during the turning
 of the winch, the direction of the currents was continually
 alternating, not merely in the glass tube, but also in the coils
 of the magnetometer. The winch was usually turned once in
                          º
 a second ; consequently the currents changed their direction
 120 times in the same time.
    In order to ascertain whether, with the alternator just de
 scribed, the measurements could be carried out quite indepen
 dently of the polarization,   I procceded as follows:—A paral
 lelepipedal wooden box,               on the inside, was filled with
water from the conduit. . Two       gold  plates, just large enough
 to fill the cross section of the box, were placed at a distance of
50 centims, one from the other. A constant galvanic current
was then caused to pass through the water; and as soon as the
gold plates were completely polarized, the intensity of the cur
rent was measured. After that the plates were placed at a
distance of 25 centims., and just so much rheostat wire inserted
in the conduction that the intensity was the same as before;
the resistance in the water column of 25 centims. length was
then equal to that of the rheostat wire employed.         I now tried
whether by means of the alternating currents of the alternator
the same value of the resistance of the water column would be
obtained. The wire conductors by which the electromotor,
magnetometer, alternator, and water column or the rheostat
were connected were so arranged that              all
                                                 the currents flowed

water column     or   the rheostat. To attain this end, one pole
of  the electromotor was connected with the brass disk                 A   or   B,
and the other pole with one end         of

tometer. The other end   B      the magnetometer-wire was joined
to  the other brass disk or of     A. Finally, the two brass sliding
springs were united either with the two gold disks                or
                                                             with the
ends of the rheostat wire.

the alternator a   constant deflection of 135 scale-divisions was
obtained.
   When the water column was inserted, the deflection was
136-5 scale-divisions.
   The experiment repeated with the rheostat gave 138.
   The mean of the first and third experiments gives 136-5
scale-divisions,   orthe same number         as
                                          the water column.

different velocity, with the water column      deflection
                                                  a         125-5, of

It is hence clear that by the alternator the polarization was so
completely eliminated that the possibly remaining effect of it
fell within the limits of errors of observation.
   The gold plates used in these last experiments were many
times larger than those little gold disks which were inserted in
the side-tubes of the glass tube; but the intensity of the cur
rents employed was also in nearly the same proportion greater
than the intensity employed in the previous experiments;
therefore the polarization on the unit of surface of the polar
plate cannot have been very different in the two cases.        Con
sequently the proof now given that alternating currents render
the polarization    harmless must hold good also for the experi
ments with the small gold disks.        Moreover it is self-evident
that, for the utility of the method of observation here presented,
it is quite immaterial whether the entire polarization is got rid
                                                                 to is,
of or not. The only thing requisite          that both plates shall
be      in
       the same condition with     respect   polarization;  and this
requirement          any rate completely satisfied.

the angular velocity reckoned in the same direction of a line
drawn perpendicular to the tangent through P and Q, two con
secutive moving particles.  The sum of the two is therefore
twice the molecular rotation; and if we call the molecular ro

Now v. PQ is constant, being the flow in an elementary stream
of breadth unity; and hence we see that the difference of energy
between two consecutive elementary streams is proportional to the
molecular rotation at any point of either.
   An immediate consequence of this is that the molecular ro
tation is the same at          all
                         points situated     line   motion, and  in  a                 of

rotation is not zero, but any constant.
   When the motion is not confined to one plane, the energy
of the fluid will be uniformly distributed in any case in which
the molecular rotation is zero, or more generally when the axis
of rotation of a fluid element is likewise the direction of its
motion of translation ; but the consideration of this kind of mo
tion is postponed for the present.

basis of an erroneous observation made by Young in repeat
ing Wollaston's experiment; 4th, that Young subsequently
tested his hypothesis of colour-sensation and found that it was
in accord with facts reached by experiment, and that these
experiments then vindicated his hypothesis and raised it to the
dignity of a theory.
     efore discussing the subject proper of this article, it may
be well to give the reader a clear conception of Young's theory
of colour-sensations, and to show in what high estimation it is
at present held by men of science. This can best be done by
the reading of the following short extracts from Helmholtz's
‘Physiological Optics’ and from his “Popular Scientific
Lectures.’
   “To     speak       of three fundamental colours in an objective
sense would be nonsense; in fact, as long as one refers only
to purely physical conditions, and while there is no reference
to the human eye, the properties of compound light depend
alone on the proportions in which exist                                 lights of different
wave-lengths.     The reduction of light to                            three fundamental
colours can never have any thing else than                             a subjective signi
fication ; it consists simply in reducing                       all    colour-sensations              to
three fundamental sensations.           this sense that Young

the manner that vibrations in the air cause a sensation of
sound, by beating against the                  of hearing. Now the
most free and natural    application  of this hypothesis to the solu
                          I
tion of phenomena take to be this: that the agitated parts
of bodies, according to their several sizes, figures, and motions,
do excite vibrations in the ether of various depths or bignesses,
which being promiscuously propagated through that medium
to our eyes, effect in us a sensation of light of a white colour;
but if by any means those of unequal bigness be separated

from one another, the largest beget a sensation of a red colour,
the least or shortest of a        violet, and the intermediate ones
of intermediate colours; much after the manner that bodies,
according to their several sizes, shapes, and motions, excite
vibrations in the air, of various bignesses, which, according to
those bignesses, make several tones in a sound; that the largest
vibrations are best able to overcome the resistance of a refract
ing superficies, and so break through it with least refraction;

and entitled “An account of some cases of the production of
colours, not hitherto described.”
   “In consequence of Dr. Wollaston's correction of the de
scription of the prismatic spectrum, compared with these obser
vations, it becomes necessary to modify the supposition that                                                        I

position between the orange and yellow, and well known to be
caused by the reversal of the bright yellow light of sodium
vapour.   No one, however, could now say, after an exami
nation of the spectrum as observed by Wollaston, that the
line D divides the red from the green. Wollaston also calls
his D and E lines (the G and                       É

   Fraunhofer's observations are irreproachable, and are to this
day in high esteem for their accuracy. They were made by
          the prism in front of a telescope mounted on a divided
  orizontal circle, and viewing a distant slit through the prism
and telescope.     He observed spectra as pure as those given by
modern spectroscopes of low power.             Fraunhofer discerns
orange and yellow and green where Wollaston only sees yel
                                                                 its all

122         Prof. A. M. Mayer on the History of Young's
laston's supposed complete analysis of the sun's light into red,
greenish blue, and violet colours separated from each other in
the spectrum by dark spaces.            - -        -         -
    We hear no more from Young about his theory of colours
until 1807, when he published the first volume of his celebrated
work, ‘A Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy and the
 Mechanical Arts”.       On page 439 et seq. of this work Young
                                                ...
gives a concise statement of his views on the analysis of the
sensations of colour, and supports these views with conclusive
experiments with rotating               disks; but, strange to say,

the omission of some of the rays naturally belonging to white
light. Thus if we intercept one half of each of the four prin

cipal portions into which the spectrum is divided, the remaining
halves will still preserve, when mixed together, the appear
ance of whiteness; so that it is probable that the different
 parts of those portions         spectrum

colour have precisely the same effect on the eye.      It is certain
that the perfect sensations of yellow and of blue are produced
respectively by mixtures of red and green and of green and
violet light; and there is reason to suspect that those sensations
are always compounded of the separate sensations combined; at
least this supposition simplifies the theory of colours; it may
therefore be adopted with advantage until it be found incon
sistent with any of the phenomena; and we may consider white
light as composed of a mixture of red, green, and violet only, in
the proportion of about two parts red, four green, and one
violet, with respect to the quantity or intensity of the sensa
tions produced.
     “Ifwe mix together in proper proportions any substances
exhibiting these colours in their greatest purity and place the
mixture in a light sufficiently strong, we obtain the appearance
of perfect whiteness; but in a fainter light the mixture is grey,
or of that hue which arises from a combination of white and
black, black bodies being such as reflect white light, but in a
very scanty proportion.       For the same reason, green and red
substances mixed      together  usually make rather a brown than
a  yellow  colour,  and  many   yellow  colours, when laid on very
thickly or mixed with black, become brown. The sensations
of various kinds of light may also be combined in a still more
satisfactory manner by painting the surface of a circle with
different colours in any way that may be desired, and causing
it to revolve with such rapidity that the whole may assume the
appearance of a single tint, or a combination of tints resulting
from the mixture of the colours.
    “From three simple sensations, with their combinations, we
obtain seven primitive distinctions of colours; but the different
proportions in which they may be combined afford a variety of
tints beyond      all
                   calculation.  The three simple sensations being
red, green, and violet, the three binary combinations are
yellow, consisting       ofred and green; crimson,         red and      of
yiolet; and blue,       green and violet; and the seventh

126         Prof. A. M. Mayer on the History of Young's
statement as to the composition of yellow light; and it is
therefore probable that Wollaston communicated orally this
view of the subject to Young.            Every student of optics, now
knows that the       description   already   given of Fraunhofer's ob
 servation on the colour      composition     of the spectrum is the cor
 rect one; yet the errors of observation of Wollaston and of
 Young were errors which led to a great discovery, as we shall
 see on the further examination of the history of this beautiful
 and comprehensive theory of colour.
      Further on in the “Natural Philosophy’ we read that “the
 sensations of various kinds of light may also be combined in a
 still more satisfactory manner by painting the surface of a
 circle with different colours, in any way that may be desired,
 and causing it to revolve with such rapidity that the whole
 may assume the appearance of a single tint, or of a combina
 tion of tints, resulting from the mixture of the colours.” These
 experiments were evidently first made by Young, and are fully
 described in the text and perfectly illustrated in the coloured
  disks in the plates of Young's work. These experiments have
  been carefully repeated by Helmholtz, Maxwell, and others;
  and of their general accuracy there is no doubt. We can rea
  dily imagine the delight with which Young must have viewed
  these beautiful experiments, which, however, together with
  other truths unfolded by him, were destined to remain unnoticed
  “until a later generation, by slow degrees, arrived at the dis
  covery of his discovery.”
       It must now recur to the reader to inquire when were made
  these experiments which first confirmed Young's hypothesis
  and placed it among the best-established truths of optical
  science, and why it was that Young should for so long a time
  have been satisfied with a hypothetical statement of his views
  on the colour-sensations, and should have deferred to bring
  those views to the test of experiment.             For reasons already
  stated, Young, in July 1802, changed his three elementary
  colour-sensations, red, yellow, and blue, to red, green, and vio
  let. The experiments with the rotating coloured disks were
   first published in 1807. Young printed the syllabus of his
   first course of lectures on January 19, 1802, in a volume of
   250 pages.      I  have not been able to procure a copy of this
   syllabus; but evidently it does not contain even the corrected
   statement of his theory of colour; for that was based on Wol
   laston's observations, which appeared subsequently to the
   syllabus, on June 24, 1802".            It is therefore evident that,
     .* Professor Tyndall has recently informed me that Young's syllabus
  gives red, yellow, and blue as the three elementary colour-sensations,

        VII. Some Triassic                                 Trap Minerals.
CEy.TRALLASSITE-The                                        publication       of a letter on
      “Doubtful Minerals” in the ‘Chemical News' (vol. xxx.
p. 165), has recalled my attention to some mineralogical work
which occupied a good deal of my spare time in former years.
In that letter, and in others subsequently written to the same
Journal on the topic indicated, allusion is made to some of
this work; and I open this communication with an attempt to
make matters clear so far as this is concerned.
    In   1859      I described           (in the “Edinburgh New Philosophical
Journal, vol. x. p. 84) three minerals found in trap of Tri
assic age near Black Rock in the Bay of Fundy, which I con
sidered new, and which I called cyanolite, cerinite, and cen
trallassite: they are among the “doubtful minerals” of the
                       j'
letters above mentioned.      I have nothing to add to what was
originally given with regard to the first two of these; but                                        I
find, on referring to my notes, that I can contribute something
more to the history of the third; and while preparing this
paper,    Ihave        occasion to reclaim a formula assigned to
a related mineral by     discoverer, the late Professor Anderson,
                                   its
of  Glasgow.     Some notes respecting other trap minerals and
the rocks      which they occur are added.
                  in
   The three minerals mentioned were found constituting                                            a
nodule: cyanolite had somewhat the characters         chalcedony;            of
centrallassite was      colourless lamellar mineral
                               a                           radiated                 in
spherical concretions, and cerinite        yellowish waxy-lookin

mineral enveloping the others.        From the analytical details
obtained  I  thought    was justified

minerals; and        regards the first two (cerinite contained
                         as
alumina), their relations,       made out, are shown
                                                  as         taking                      by

   Sphaerostilbite.—Among the forms of stilbite occurring here
are to be observed crystalline incrustations on various mine
rals; calcite and apophyllite, for example, and crystals of stil
bite are sometimes coated with layers of a mineral which seems
altogether destitute of crystalline structure.                  I
                                                      have collected,
near Hall's    Harbour,    a number of specimens showing most
curious concretionary structure.       In several of these the ex

in blowpipe characters, and seeming to pass in a suite of spe
                  from well-defined stilbite into such forms, they
refused to   gelatinize.     But since           I
                                           found that, according to

described by Mr. G. W. Hawes, who says (p. 191), in refer
ence to the chemical composition of the rocks and the contents
of cavities, “That there was such a passage of vapours through
the molten mass is evident; for the rock of some dykes contains
long pipestem-like cavities which were made by the ascend

 continuous mass at several miles depth may be subjected, we
 can readily see that the transformed heat of friction produced
 by internal movements taking place in such materials after
 crushing has occurred, must be the source of          amount of
 heat over and above that originally due to the crushing itself.”
  It is evident from this passage that Mr. Mallet thought a
  large value for friction was favourable to his theory (as
 developed by Prof. Hilgard); and he afterwards generously
 assumes the smaller value 0.5 for the coefficient.           purposely      I
 gave him the advantage of the larger estimate. But                  am                  I
  quite content that Mr. Mallet should make use of any co
 efficient of friction which he thinks admissible.
     The following passage strikes me as certainly unfair:—
 “Somewhat further on we find the author overthrowing,
 in the following sentence, the entire mathematical house of
 cards which he has with so much parade erected. ‘If, how
 ever, as is more likely, the crust rests upon a fluid or viscous
 layer, the resistance to lateral motion will be much smaller;
 but we are not able to guess what it will be, so that we cannot
 à priori assign a value to p.’”          Why did not Mr. Mallet
 quote the sentence which follows and qualifies this?—“But a
 probable estimate [for uj may be arrived at from the considera
tion that a great circle of the sphere cuts on an average at least
three lines of weakness, as appears upon the inspection of a
map showing the lines of volcanic action.” }. fact my
formula is general, and can be applied whether there be a
solid nucleus or a viscous substratum.                                  -
     It is well known that some physicists insist upon a solid
nucleus; and no doubt Mr. Mallet would have been quick to
notice the omission had               I
                                not adverted to that case; but by

the presence of dissolved air, and that in air-free liquid the

into play.

   If the following facts are held to give an affirmative answer
to both the above questions, the objections raised are invalid
and may be dismissed.                                                              -
   To test the first point, it was necessary to compare the effect
of a small known electromotive force acting through platinum
electrodes, first in air free, next in aerated acidulated water,
under identical conditions.     In the former experiments the
electromotive force was  generated   in the liquid by      motion;                            its
for my present purpose     was sufficient

 Since a Daniell's cell is about 100,000,000 units in electro
motive force, the above Table shows that, with the galvano
meter employed, the least electromotive force which, acting
for one minute under these circumstances on platinum plates
of 16:39 centims. surface, would leave a           polarization,
was about stoo of a Daniell's cell.

  An examination of these two Tables shows that there is very
little difference between them which cannot properly be ascribed
to errors in observation. There is no difference in the mini
mum electromotive force which could give in each case a visible
polarization with the galvanometer employed.     But now there
       º
was one very striking difference between the two sets of expe
riments, not shown in the Tables, viz. the time required after
each   experiment for the polarization to subside.         In the case
of the aerated water, the polarization disappears very much
more             when the plates are short, circuited than in the
case of the air-free water. With this latter it was most trouble
some to get rid of the last traces, even with the smallest pola
rizing currents. . This has been previously noticed and ex
plained by Helmholtz".        It however, point

tion of their properties.   This part of the subject does not present
any serious   difficulty, especially as in it we have to deal with
functions of but one independent variable.     It is easily shown that
P. satisfies the equation

this equation will have a second solution which can be obtained in
a finite form, and which Mr. Todhunter calls “a coefficient of the
second kind.”    It is easily shown that any rational function of w
can be  expressed in terms of Legendre's coefficients. This suggests
the  question, Can any function of a be so expressed?       The dis
cussion of this question yields the following answer:-If
                         f(x)=a,--a,P,-Ha,P,--. . . . .                                     •   * >

second   form, such as  b, +b, Pi—H b,P,-- . . . can exist.  In the
third place, the expression is always practicable, provided the
series, whose general term is

is   finite; but whether the series is necessarily finite or not is not
shown; and here the discussion comes to an end with this difficulty
left in       it.
              Further on, however (art. 220), the series           shown                               is                    to

they are apt to regard a book like the present as containing little
more than a series of manipulations of symbols; and it is greatly
to their advantage to see the results applied to concrete cases.
Thus Chap. X. is devoted to the question of approximate quadra
ture in the case when it is effected by ordinates at unequal dis.
tances, so taken as to ensure the best result; at p. 128, there is
an application of Legendre's functions to the determination of the
temperature of a sphere cooling under assigned conditions; and
Chap. XXV. is devoted to similar questions of a more general charac
ter.   Still, questions of this kind come in only incidentally, and
the student is cautioned that for applications he must look elsewhere,
The author states that his demonstrations have been carefully
chosen so as to bring under the attention of students some of the
most instructive processes of modern analysis; and we may add
that students may consider themselves fortunate in having a guide

Solid Geometry.     By Pencival. Frost, M.A., formerly Fellow of
  St. John's   College,  Mathematical Lecturer at King's College.
  Vol. I.  8vo,  pp.  422.  London: Macmillan and Co. 1875.
  This work is the first volume of a second edition of the ‘Treatise
on Solid Geometry” published some years ago by Messrs. Frost
and Wolstenholme.   Owing to the removal of the latter gentleman
from Cambridge,  the preparation of the present edition has der
 volved on Mr. Frost, who has greatly altered the work both in
 form and substance, and has made additions which bring the first
 volume nearly up to the size of the original treatise. The subject is
 one that may be studied either for        own sake      its
                                                         those who are             by

 notice for which we should look in vain                                  in the earlier treatise.                In
 the advanced parts the additions    are still more numerous, as in
 the chapter on tortuous curves, where the subject of their curva
 ture, their normal and osculating planes, and the connected lines
 and developable surfaces are admirably worked out. Here the
  subjects discussed are perhaps twice as numerous as those in the
  corresponding chapter of the earlier work.        A similar remark
  applies to the discussion of surfaces of the second degree, which,
  of course, occupies a large part of the volume. Thus the reduc
  tion of the general equation of the second degree is not only
 effected by modern methods, but the discussion is very complete,
 while the chapters on confocal surfaces and on the modular and
 umbilical generation of “Conicoids” contain parts of the subject
 which have been worked out only of late years.
         It
        will be observed that Mr. Frost uses—or, as he puts                                                       it,
 persists      using—the word conicoid for the locus
                   in                                    the equation                         of

     With stronger currents this ratio was found to diminish.
   On magnetizing the wires transversely by sending a current in
 the direction of their length, a diminution of resistance was also ob
 served, which diminution also increased when the strength of the
 current was increased.
     When a current was sent along the wire itself, on increasing
 the  current there was found to be also a diminution of resistance
 in the case of hard steel, and an increase of resistance in the case
of soft iron and soft steel.
   Thus the effects produced are the same as those due to trans
verse magnetization by a neighbouring current.
   Conclusions to be drawn from the experiments:—
   (1) The effect of passing any current through a bar of hard steel
is to diminish            its
                   resistance, and through    bar   soft iron   soft          a              of                         or

  With the lid of the box on, the resistance of the selenium was
measured, and was found to increase slowly and regularly in con
sequence of the heating by the current. In most of the experi
ments a battery of 30 Leclanché cells was employed.
   It was found that the higher the battery-power the less is the
resistance of the selenium.  Experiments with 5, 30, and 35 cells
gave the following results:–

   This diminution of resistance with increased battery-power may
be accounted for in part by leakage from the rheocord; and there
may be also an opposing electromotive force similar to polarization
brought into action in the selenium when the current is passing
which increases with the current.
.  Exposure to light diminishes the resistance of selenium.
   This may be accounted for by either of two hypotheses:–
   (1) That light acting on the selenium sets up a polarization
current in it which opposes the battery-current passing through                                                            it.

   With the same battery-power, an increase             the temperature                    in

flame there was a sudden deflection, which increased to 250 divi
sions of the scale in a few seconds.
   This corresponded to a change of resistance in R of about 1250
ohms.
   This experiment was repeated in a slightly different way. The
selenium was balanced; and before exposure to the luminous Bun
sen flame, R was diminished by 1000 ohms.      On making contact
and  exposing  at the same instant, there was a slight deflection,
showing that the sudden effect was equivalent to rather less than
1000 ohms; but in a very few seconds the needle was at rest at
zero; and to keep the needle at zero the resistance was further
diminished by 300 ohms.
   The resistance had been diminished by one fourth of its whole
amount in less than one minute in consequence of the exposure.
   Exposure to an ordinary wax taper diminished the resistance
of the selenium by 300,000 ohms, or about one eighth part of its
whole resistance.
   The illuminating powers of these sources of light were com
pared by means of the Bunsen photometer.
   The light of the ordinary Bunsen flame could scarcely be
measured, but was somewhere about ºn part of a candle, and of
the luminous Bunsen flame about 10 candles, whilst the light from
the taper was at              its
                     best rather more than one fourth      candle.               of   a

the luminous Bunsen flame was 52°, whilst the taper produced                                       no
effect which could be measured.

on placing the mirror outside the window so as to send the moon
light perpendicularly through the window on the selenium, the
deflection of the needle was 40 divisions.     The window was kept
closed  during  these experiments.                                      l
   On another    evening when the moon shone      very  obliquely on the
window, and the selenium was exposed on the inside of the
window directly to the moonlight, the needle was deflected 100
divisions of the scale, and the deflection increased to 150 divi
sions after exposure for about 3 minutes.
   The change in the resistance of the selenium was from 60,000 to
70,000 ohms.
   These experiments show that the action on the selenium is due
principally, if not entirely, to radiations belonging to the visible
part of the spectrum.     Light rays of        kinds, particularly theall
                                                                                            by

 district under consideration, and stated that on the uplands the
 drift consists of undisturbed gravels and travelled boulders, which
 occur only in isolated remnants on the lower ranges, and that in the
 lowlands and valleys within 100 feet of the present level of the sea
 the gravels are widely spread, and show signs of sudden and tumul
 tuous action.    Between the upland and lowland gravels he considered
 that great denudation had taken place.         He maintained that the
 boulders and the materials of the gravels had been distributed by
 floating ice, and that their presence on the summit of Dartmoor
indicated that the water on which the ice floated must have extended
up to 1200 feet above the present sea-level; but he argued that
 this water was not that of the sea, because no old sea-beaches or
remains of marine organisms are to be found in the region, although
freshwater shells are preserved.       He ascribed these phenomena to
the   presence  of a great freshwater lake, produced by the drainage of
Europe being dammed back by a great glacier flowing from the
north-west (Greenland) down the present bed of the Atlantic, and
over the northern parts of the continent.         The author discussed
the characters of the superficial deposits in the southern and south
eastern counties, and indicated the points in which these seemed
to bear out his hypothesis.
    The sequence of phenomena assumed by the author is as follows:
—Accepting Mr. Tylor's notion that the actual sea-level must have
been lowered during the Glacial period in consequence of the great
accumulation of water in the form of ice at the poles, he seeks a
point of departure for the Glacial period in the first evidence of such
a lowering of the sea-level. The Weybourne sands and the marine
beds of Portland Bill were deposited when the sea was at about its
present level; and the Bridlington Crag probably belongs to the same
period.    The fossils found in these deposits show that the waters
were cold. The first stage of the Glacial period is that of the older
Forest-beds; and the immigration of a number of great Mammalia
and of Palaeolithic man, indicates that the sea had retired from the
British Channel and the German Ocean, leaving these islands con
nected with the continent. . A great river probably ran southwards
through the region now submerged. The second stage is marked by
the continued advance of the ice from the north, the retreat of the
southern fauna and Palaeolithic man, and the arrival of Arctic
Mammals.       The third stage saw the culmination of the Glacial
period and the greatest extent of the Atlantic glacier, which reached
to the coast of Europe, blocked up the English Channel, and caused
the formation of an immense lake of fresh water by damming back
the drainage of the whole of North-western Europe, as already indi
cated.    In the fourth stage the Atlantic glacier began to retreat,
and the sudden breaking away of the barrier of ice that blocked up
the mouth of the Channel caused the tumultuous discharge of the
waters of the great lake, by which the spreading of the lowland
gravels was effected.      To this cause the author attributes the for
mation of the Middle Glacial sands and gravels of Norfolk and
Suffolk.    During the fifth stage the ice of the German Ocean con

        Mr. G. Gunn    on the Forest-bed Series     in Suffolk.       161
 tinued to retreat; but there was a temporary advance of the Atlantic
 glacier, which again blocked up the Channel, and produced a second
 great lake, which, however, did not attain so great a height as the
first, and its waters were not discharged in the same tumultuous
fashion.    At this period the Upper Boulder-clay of Norfolk and
Suffolk was formed; but the author is not convinced that this
formation is represented south of the Thames, except by the “Trail”
of the Rev. O. Fisher.     In the sixth and last stage the Atlantic ice
retreated as far as the north of Scotland: but the sea had not re
turned to its former level; the British Isles were connected with
the continent and with each other. To this the author assigns the
last great forest period, and the arrival of Neolithic man and the
associated fauna from the continent.

    In this paper the author described a section from the cliff at
Kessingland and Pakefield, from the examination of which he
arrived at the conclusion that the Forest-bed series underlies the
Chillesford Clay and Sands. At the foot of the cliff there is an
estuarine deposit forming the soil of the Forest-bed, consisting of
blue clay and gravel, the “Elephant-bed” of the author's former
paper.    Above this is the Forest-bed, containing large stools and
stems of trees, but no fossil bones.   This is followed by a freshwater
deposit, consisting of black soil with freshwater shells, corresponding
to a similar bed at Mundesley and Runton, known as the “Unio
bed,” and including the “Rootlet-bed ” of oozy clay, regarded by
Mr. Prestwich as an indication of the forest. The author considers
the supposed rootlets to represent brushwood which succeeded the
true forest. Above this come Fluvio-marine deposits, in which Crag
shells occur, although but rarely.     To this division the author was
inclined to refer the Norwich Crag, which at Bramerton underlies
the next division, regarded by the author as the Chillesford Clay
 and Sands.    Of the overlying deposits the first is supposed to be the
 “Pebbly bed” by the author; it has been regarded as Middle Drift;
 and the uppermost is Upper Boulder-clay.      The paper was illustrated
 by the exhibition of a fine series of bones, chiefly Cervine, from the
lowest deposit noticed by the author.

                                             Lake-district.
   The object of this paper was to examine into the evidence afforded
by the liquid-cavities of the granitoid rocks of the Lake-district,
in reference to the pressure under which these rocks may have
consolidated.   In the first division of the subject the geological re
lations of the three granitic centres of the district were considered,
and it was shown that these several granitic masses probably soli
dified at depths varying from 14,000 to 30,000 feet.         The most
probable maximum depth for the Skiddaw granite was stated as
30,000 feet, the maximum for the Eskdale granite 22,000 feet,
and for the Shap granite 14,000 feet. These maximum depths were
arrived at by estimating the greatest thickness of strata that was
ever, at one time, accumulated above the horizon of the top of the
Skiddaw slates.
   The mode of microscopic examination, together with a description
of the precautions taken in measuring the relative sizes of the
cavities and their contained vacuities, formed the second division of

results to be considered as preliminary only, since the complete                            in

racy was insured, while pointing to the many little-known causes
which might affect the conclusions.
 Part     II.    On the Eskdale and Shap Granites, with their associated
                              Metamorphic Rocks.
   The author brought forward evidence in this paper to prove the
possibility of the formation of granite by the extreme metamorphism
of volcanic rocks. The passage is shown in the field, and may be
observed in a complete series of hand specimens.         Frequently,
indeed, the actual junction is well marked; but in other cases the
transition is gradual; and there occur, at some little distance from
the main mass, inlying patches of what may be called bastard
granite.   The microscopic examination proves the passage from a
distinctly fragmentary ash to a distinctly crystalline rock, and to
granite itself.   Also the chemical composition of the altered rocks
agrees very closely with that of the granite.
   Both Eskdale and Shap granite were believed to have been formed
mainly from the rocks of the volcanic series by metamorphism at
considerable depths; but the granite of Shap was thought to be in
great measure intrusive amongst those particular beds which are now
seen around        it.
                   decided increase

acid was noted           in
                  the volcanic rocks               on   approaching the granite, and
a decrease       in
             carbonic acid.
     Part   III.   On the Skiddaw Granite and                its   associated   Metamorphic
                                  rocks.
   The subject was treated under the three heads                       of

and the following were the general results arrived at. The meta
morphism        the Skiddaw slate extends for many miles around the
                of
several granitic masses, and commences                       by
                                                  the formation    small              of
spots which become developed into chiastolite crystals.       The chias
tolite slate passes into spotted schist,                by
                                               the great increase     the              of
small oblong spots arranged along planes         foliation; and mica ap

pears. The spotted schist graduates into mica-schist, which, however,
often retains       the last faint spots, and occasionally chiastolite
                      to
crystals.    The junction between the mica-schist and the granite                            is
generally rather abrupt.      On the whole, chemical and field evidence
especially are against regarding the granite now exposed            the                as
result     the extreme metamorphism
          of                                           of

   A short description of the geology and physical features of the
district was given, and an inference drawn from the varying faunas
of the “Crag" that the land was sinking during that era and until
after the deposition of the Cromer “Forest-bed.” Then Arctic con
ditions began to prevail, and the great glacial subsidence com
menced; the “lower glacial” beds were formed, and succeeded by a
large series of false-bedded gravels and sands, with intercalated
patches of unstratified clay. These deposits run up only to a
certain   level, about 300 feet, never quite reaching the top of the
Chalk    escarpment,     where the overlying Boulder-clay is invariably
found   resting   on the older rock, without any gravel or sand between.
The author inferred from this circumstance that after the deposition
of the “lower” beds, and as submergence went on, the waters of
the North Sea were again united to those of the Atlantic.                 A strong
current was thus set           up,    which  swept    down from the north,
bringing with it the material of which the gravels are composed, and
which is found to consist of pebbles, all derived from the northern
and eastern coasts, mixed with flints from the Chalk. The escarp
ment of this formation stood at the time above the water; but when
once sufficiently submerged to admit the water over                    lower por      its
tions, the conditions were altered, the current lost its force, and the
deposition     ofgravel ceased.       An occasional iceberg had dropped                              its
load  of  unstratified clay, which became intercalated with the gravels;

   The other conclusións arrived at, after mature consideration of all
the evidence hitherto obtained, are:—that a gradual passage will be
found to exist from the base of the Crag up to and through the drift
deposits to those of recent date; that in East Anglia we have evi
dence of but one, and that a gradual, period of glacial submergence,
succeeded by a corresponding movement of reelevation; and that
there are no “middle glacial” deposits whatever within the area of
the Cambridge valley.

Flow of Ice and Water, with the Laws which regulate these actions,
and the special bearing on River-action of observations on the
Mississippi and other great rivers, and their present and past Mete
orological conditions, and similar remarks on Marine Deposits, illus
trated by the Irish Sea and the Chesil Beach.”     By A. Tylor, Esq.,
F.G.S.
   The writer adduced evidence by measured sections and drawings
to show that the Quaternary gravels were deposited rather in a wet
or pluvial than in a snowy or glacial period.       He thought the de
nuding action of springs and the alternate action of rain and frost
had been neglected.     He considered Agassiz and other writers had
overlooked the previous writings of Playfair, to whom he referred.
   The rainfall of Westmoreland, Switzerland, and the Mississippi
valley were compared in summer and winter, to prove that floods
were not necessarily greater from land covered with snow than
from land covered with trees and vegetation when height above the
sea and local circumstances were taken into consideration.          Mr.
Dana’s “Great    Glacier,” whose  melting was to  supply   a Quaternary
river Mississippi 50 miles wide, would require a supply equal to
625 times the present rainfall to fill           it.
   The melting        of
                    snow was assumed               such proportions by
                                                     to    be   of

    The laws     of river-motion are very simple and precise; and                          as
depressions and upheavals are always unequal, any great movements
in  the Quaternary period would affect the courses            rivers, and -of              be

   He did not find any evidence of a plane of denudation on any
sea-coast, but, on the contrary, deep gorges and curved surfaces,
depth varying with width, &c.
   The nearest approach to a plane surface was in the estuary of the
La Plata; but that flatness appeared more the consequence of depo
sition than denudation.
   The great cuts or indentations out of coast lines where rivers
discharge into the ocean, when compared with the absence of
indentations in areas where there are no great rivers, but where
 the rocks are equally hard, showed that such denudation de
pended upon the alternate and opposite action of rivers and the tide.
He referred to the removal of the bar of the Danube, and to the
great laws which regulate the flow of water, which he illustrated by
diagrams.
   Hydraulics and meteorology must be studied in connexion with
the lines of denudation and deposition; and however difficult and
inconvenient these subjects might be, no results would be reliable
unless all the physical circumstances were taken into account.

   1. “Historical and personal Evidences of Subsidence beneath the
Sea, mainly if not entirely in the fourteenth and fifteenth cen
turies, of several tracts of Land which formerly constituted parts of
the Isle of Jersey.”    By R. A. Peacock, Esq., C.E., F.G.S.
   In this paper  the author brings forward a great number of details,
derived in  part from personal observations and in part from ancient
documents, to prove that a considerable submergence of land has
taken place round the island of Jersey within comparatively recent
times.    He referred principally to the existence of a submerged
forest in the Bay of St. Ouen, evidenced by the existence of stumps
of trees in the sea-bottom there, and by the traditional fact that up
to quite a late period fees were paid for privileges connected with
the forest of St. Ouen, although the forest itself had long previously
disappeared beneath the sea.     From the evidence it would appear
that the submergence took place at the end of the fourteenth or the
beginning of the fifteenth century.      The author also noticed the
occurrence of peat and submarine trees in the little bay of Greve de
Lecq on the north side of Jersey, and especially referred to the
evidence afforded by the Ecrehous rocks and Maitre Isle, there
having been in the latter a priory or chapel, supported by rents
derived from the parish of Ecrehous, which is now represented only
by a small islet, with the ruins of an ecclesiastical building uponit,
anda   range of  rocks protruding but little above the sea.

   2. “The Physical Conditions under which the Upper Silurian
and succeeding Palaeozoic Rocks were probably deposited over the
Northern Hemisphere.”       By Henry Hicks, Esq., F.G.S.
   In this   paper  the  author,  after pointing out the lines of de
pression explained in his former paper to the Society, now further
elaborated the views then propounded by him by carrying his
examination into the higher Palaeozoic series and into more exten
sive areas.    Beginning at the top of the Lower Silurian, where he
first  recognizes any evidence of a break in the Palaeozoic rocks, he
proceeded to show that this break was restricted to very limited
areas, and almost entirely confined to the parts which had been first
submerged, and where the greatest thickness of sediment had accu
mulated on both sides of the Atlantic, and hence where the prae
Cambrian crust had become thinnest.        On the European side this
break occurred where volcanic action had taken place, and has
doubtless to be attributed to the combined action of upheaval of
portions of the crust and the heaping up of volcanic material, the
latter in some cases forming volcanic islets of considerable extent.
He strongly objected to look upon these breaks, even in the British
area, where they are most marked, as evidence of a want of con
tinuity over other and far greater areas, or to admit that, even where
there was conformity in the rocks at this point, “great                in
tervals of time are indicated unrepresented by stratified formations.”
The conformity found in extensive and widely separated areas is
proof also that a gradual contraction took place of an enormous
portion of the crust in the northern hemisphere in Palaeozoic times;
and the breaks at the close of the Lower Silurian and in the De
vonian are not indications of an arrest in the general subsidence.
After indicating the changes which must have taken place in the
climate from this gradual spreading of the water, and the evidence to
be derived from the consideration of the deposits and the faunas,
the author drew the following general conclusions:—
    1. That the condition of the northern hemisphere at the beginning
 of Palaeozoic time was that of immense continents in the higher
latitudes, traversed by mountainous ranges of great height, but with
a general inclination of the surface, on the one side (European) to
the south-west and south, and on the other side (American) to the
 south-east and south.                          -
    2.  That these continents were probably    eovered,  at least in their
 higher parts, with ice and snow; and that much       loose material  had
consequently accumulated over the plains and deeper parts, ready to
be denuded off as each part became submerged. This would account
for the enormous thickness of conglomerates, with boulders, grits,
 and sandstones, found in the early Cambrian rocks, and also to a
certain extent for their barrenness in organic remains.
    3. That the depression over the European and American areas
was general from at least the latitude of 30° northwards; that the
parts bordering the Atlantic were the first to become submerged;
the lower latitudes also before the higher.
    4. That the depression could not have been less altogether, for
the whole of the Palaeozoic, than 50,000 feet; and that conform
    Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol.     1. No. 2. Feb. 1876.                 N

.170              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 able sediments to that extent are found over those parts of the areas
 first submerged and which remained undisturbed.             That volcanic
 action was chiefly confined to parts of the regions which became
 first submerged; that the immediate cause of these outbursts was
 the weakness of the prae-Cambrian crust at those parts, from the
 great depression that had taken place, it being too thin there
 to resist the pressure from within, and to bear the weight of the
 superincumbent mass of soft sediment.
     5. That the seat of volcanic action at this time was at a depth of
 probably not less than 25 miles, as sediments which were depressed
  to a depth of from 9 to 10 miles do not indicate that they had been
  subjected to the effect of any great amount of heat, and are free
  from metamorphosis.
      6. That the climate at the early part of Palaeozoic time was one
  of very considerable, if not extreme cold, and that it became gra
  dually milder after each period of depression. That towards the
  close of the Palaeozoic, in consequence of the elevation of very large
  areas, and to a great height, the climate became again more rigo—
  rous in character.
      7. That the various changes which took place over the northern
  latitudes during Laurentian and Palaeozoic times allowed marine
  and land life to develop and progress in those areas at interrupted
  periods only; consequently most of the progressive changes in the
  life had to take place in more equatorial areas, where the sea-bottom
  was less disturbed, and where the temperature was more equable.
  Any imperfection therefore in the Palaeontological record belonging
  to these early times should be attributed to these and like circum
  stances; for wherever an approach to a complete record of any part
  of the chain is preserved to us, the evidence points unmistakably to
  an order of development, through a process of evolution from lower
  to higher grades of life.

  RECOMPOSITION OF THE COMPONENT COLOURS OF WHITE LIGHT.

            following experiment to illustrate the recomposition of the
 THE     component colours of white light was devised by me about a
  year ago; and as        I have looked in vain for it in the scientific
 periodicals and works on experimental physics with which              I am
 acquainted,     I  have thought it might be useful to some of your
 readers.
     The spectrum of the light of the sun or of the electric lamp is
 formed in the usual way, the slit being vertical; and the spectrum
 is projected on to the screen by means of a small plane mirror
 placed close to the prism. If this mirror be capable of vibrating
 through a small angle around a vertical axis, the vibrating spectrum
 on the screen will give rise to a horizontal band of white light with
 red and blue ends.
     The advantages of this method over that of the vibrating prism

are so obvious that it will be surprising if it has not already oc
curred to some one. Not only are the results better, but the expe
riment is more easily performed.   For the purpose have employed          I
the vibrating prism   manufactured by Mr. Ladd of London, to one
face of which            I
                have affixed a small plane mirror.

oN       THE TRANSPARENCE OF FLAMES AND OF THE ATMOSPHERE,
     AND     ON THE VISIBILITY OF SCINTILLATING SIGNAL-LIGHTS.
     MEMOIRS BY E. ALLARD.              (ABSTRACT             BY THE AUTHOR.)
     I
     have the honour to present to the Academy several memoirs
relative to some experimental and theoretic researches which                                   I
have been led to make in the exercise of my functions at the Dépôt
Central des Phares.
   The first memoir is concerning the transparence of flames. The
burners of the lamps employed in the light-house service have
diameters increasing from 3 up to 13 centims., and carry from one
to six concentric wicks.    By measuring the luminous intensities
of the flames produced  by  them, it is ascertained that these inten
sities augment a little less rapidly than the consumption of oil<U+017F>;
and if compared with the dimensions of the flames, the intensity
per square centimetre of apparent surface is found to go on aug
menting, whilst, on the contrary, the intensity per cubic centi–
metre of volume diminishes in proportion as the diameter becomes
greater.    These results can only be explained by admitting that
the  transparence    of the flame is not absolute.                       I
                                                            have sought to
determine the coefficient of this        transparence   by  three series of
experiments:—first by measuring the intensity of different flames
with flat wick, seen in front or sideways; then by means of a
catadioptric reflector, which sends back towards                         its

traversed.

to  the flames mean specific intensities increasing         little with        a

volume      of   its
              flame,    find that the total quantity
                             I                          light produced   of
(or the absolute intensity) increases much more quickly than the
weight      of   oil
              consumed; but,        the quantity
                                        as           light absorbedof                         by

                     of                                    still greater in    a
proportion, the difference between these two quantities (or the

172             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
effective intensity) follows a law of increase a little less rapid than
the consumption of oil, as indicated by experiment.
   The second memoir relates to the nocturnal transparence of the
atmosphere.       The observations made by the lighthouse-keepers on
the visibility of the neighbouring lights consist in noting, three
times each night, whether each of those lights can or cannot be
perceived; so that at the end of a certain number of years it is
known how many times per cent. each of the lights is visible.         On
the other hand, the equation of the luminous ranges, and the graphic
Table which     I  have constructed for its ready solution in all cases,
make    known,     for each of the lights observed, what is the lowest
state of  transparence    at which it ceases to be seen from the place
of observation.       The information supplied by the keepers makes
known, therefore, during what fraction n of the total duration of
the nights the transparence of the air remains above a certain
value represented by a coefficient a ; and as we have a series of
corresponding values of n and a, we can, by constructing the points
which have these values for coordinates, determine a more or less
regular curve. This curve generally permits us to determine the
degree of transparence above which the atmosphere is maintained
during a given fraction of the year. It is found, for example,
that during half the year the transparence-coefficient remains above
0.910 per kilometre on the Ocean, and above 0.932 on the Mediter
ranean.     Similar curves constructed for different sections of the
coast, and for the four seasons of the year, enable us to account for
the variations undergone by the transparence of the atmosphere.
   Lastly, in a third memoir,     I examine the impressions produced
on the visual organ by the scintillating lights obtained by the
more or less rapid rotation of a system of lenses with explosions.
Experiment shows that, if a luminous discharge is caused to pass
before the eye, the impression experienced goes on diminishing in
proportion as the velocity is augmented.       If a series of discharges,
succeeding one another at equal intervals, passes, with low velo
cities each discharge produces nearly the same effect as if it were
isolated; then, when the velocity increases, the impression, while
diminishing in intensity, is prolonged until the commencement of
that produced by the following burst, so that one has the sensation
of a light agitated with a more or less rapid trembling.           If the
velocity be further augmented, the trembling tends to disappear,
and at last there is the sensation of a continuous light which
possesses nearly the intensity of that which would be got by spread
ing uniformly round the horizon the quantity of light contained in
the explosions.
    These are the facts of which     I have sought the theoretic expla
nation.    I  first admitted that, when a luminous source acting on
the eye vanishes suddenly, the impression grows weaker with a
velocity at each instant proportional to the value of the impression,
according to the law given by Newton for cooling.          From this we
can easily deduce the value of the impression experienced by the
eye when submitted to the action of a light variable with time; in

fact, it suffices to calculate the value, at a fixed instant, of each of
the preceding impressions, and to add the results. Formulae are
thus obtained the discussion of which conducts to the same con
sequences as observation of the facts.           I
                                             have nevertheless marked
a difference: it is that the fixed light, of which we have the sensa
tion when the velocity is very great, has in practice an intensity
one or two tenths below that given by the formula. This depends,
doubtless, on the circumstance that, in establishing the formula,
account has been taken of all the impressions, even of those which
have become too feeble isolatedly to produce a sensation, thus ad
mitting that these impressions, though insensible by themselves,
may accumulate so as to become sensible by their sum.            Experi
ence seems to indicate that it is not     quite   so; and if the results
 given by it could be sufficiently precise, there would hence, per
 haps, result a means of determining in every case the time during
 which the impression on the retina remains sensible.—Comptes

                  ON SOME PROPERTIES    OF GALLIUM.
                       BY LECOQ DE BOISBAUDRAN.
  After some trials which the scarcity of material rendered long
and laborious,    I
                  prepared some salts of gallium sufficiently pure to
give in the spectroscope, besides a magnificent spectrum of gallium,
only a feeble trace of the zinc lines Zn a 144-62 and Zn y150.05.
Such a proportion of zinc is far below the limit of sensibility with
the ordinary reagents.
   In examining the properties of the pure salts of gallium, have                    I
noted certain divergences from what is presented when the gallium
is mixed with much zinc. In the main, this is not surprising; but
it will demand fresh researches, with which shall occupy myself I
as soon as    I
              have renewed my store of gallium, which is exhausted
by the following essays and what            I
                                     send to-day.
   Here is first the continuation of the facts observed in mixtures                               -
of gallium and zinc:—
   (18)*. Ferrocyanide of potassium appears to behave with gallium
as with zinc.   To a dilute solution of chlorides of zinc and gallium
1% of its volume of concentrated       HCl was added, then a slight
excess of yellow    prussiate; lastly, to the liquor was added four
times its volume of water.     The whole of the gallium and        the               all
zinc were  precipitated.   The ferrocyanides were washed with pretty
strong   HCl, and then decomposed               by   sulphydrate           of
                                                                     ammonia.
The chlorhydric solution          of   the sulphides  gave the lines   Zn and   of
Gabrilliantly.

 elean that one of the precipitates may give the lines of gallium
brighter than those of zinc, while the following one shows a feeble
image of the line Ga a 417 and a bright spectrum of zinc.
    (21) If acetic acid be added to an ammoniacal solution of sul
phates or chlorides of gallium and zinc, almost the whole of the gal
 lium separates in the form of a gelatinous flocculent white precipi
tate, which is not redissolved by boiling with a considerable excess
 of C, H, O,.
  I    now examine certain reactions of pure salts of gallium.
    1. The electric spectrum of slightly concentrated chloride of gal
lium is very brilliant. The line 417 is much brighter than the line
 404.       I
           have not observed any other line attributable to gallium;
 there is certainly not any of notable intensity, at least under the
 physical conditions of my operations.      The colour of the spark
 bursting on chloride of gallium is a beautiful light violet.
     2. In the gas-flame              I
                            obtained only the line Ga a 417; and it
 was very faint and fugitive, even with a salt that gave a brilliant
electric spectrum.
   3. The chloride and the sulphate of gallium are precipitated by
NH, ; but the precipitate is in great part redissolved in an excess
of NH, Taking up by HCl the portion not dissolved by NH,
and recommencing the operation,           the gallium    promptly ob
                                                          all                         is
tained as ammoniacal solution.

extremely dilute.

of acetic acid.

   12. The crystals of gallium-alum do not act on polarized light
(between two Nicols at extinction).
   13. A small crystal of gallium-alum was kept some time under
water, and then removed into a slightly supersaturated solution of
alumino-ammoniacal       alum; it immediately began to grow, and de
termined the    crystallization of the liquor.
   14. With ammonia in       excess, gallium-alum behaves like the other
salts of this metal;   a  portion of the oxide is precipitated; the other
part remains in solution.
   15. The very acid solution of Ga, Cl, is precipitated by the yel
low prussiate (specimen 4).
º
   16. The ammoniacal solution of sulphate of gallium is decom
posed by the voltaic current. Metallic gallium is deposited on
the platinum plate which serves as negative electrode. The posi
tive electrode becomes covered at the same time with a whitish
coating, consisting of a pellicle which is easily detached from the
            and is insoluble in a large excess of NH, (specimen 5).
    a first operation 1.6 milligramme was deposited in 4 hours 30
minutes on a platinum plate of about 185 square millims. superficies.
The surface of the positive electrode was 877 square millims. The
pile was composed of fivebichromate couples (zincs 17 x 10 centims.)
coupled in tension. The sample which              I
                                              have the honour to offer to
the Academy (No. 1) weighs 3.4 milligrammes: it was deposited in 5
hours 40 minutes, on a surface of 123 or 124 square millims. ; the
positive electrode had a surface of 877 square millims. ; the current
was supplied by ten bichromate elements (zincs 17 x 10 centims.)
coupled in tension.
    17. Electro-deposited gallium forms a very adhesive layer.       It is
hard.   It  cannot be very well polished by rubbing it with an agate
burnisher; a better polish is obtained by forcible compression under
the burnisher: these two operations were performed on two faces
of specimen 1. By the latter method the metal acquires a brilliant
 lustre, and appeared to me rather whiter than platinum. When
 the electric current is suitably regulated, as well as the relative
 dimensions of the electrodes, the gallium presents a fine frosted
 surface of silvery whiteness, finely granulated, and strewed with
 brilliant points, which the microscope shows to be crystals.
    18. Deposited on platinum, gallium does not oxidize notably
during the washing with cold or boiling water", nor when dried at
nearly 200° in free air. It decomposes water acidulated with HCl
cold, and more rapidly when heated, with brisk liberation of hy
drogen.
   The salts of gallium which have hitherto served for my researches
were derived from the blende of Pierrefit, of which a copious supply
was obligingly sent me by M. Malgor, Engineer of the Mine; but
I have ascertained the presence of the new metal in other ores of
zinc, especially in a transparent blende from Santander, given me
by M. Friedel.        I
                     believe that gallium will be met with in       all

   The gallium which                        I
                           extracted from the blendes came really from
those  minerals,  and not from the metallic zinc (Vieille-Montagne)
employed for the precipitations; for                                    I
                                               have obtained no traces of
gallium with quantities of this zinc greater than what would have been
necessary of blende to get a very pure spectral reaction of gallium.
   My last investigations have confirmed the scarcity of gallium in
blende.    The extreme delicacy of the spectral reaction had even
caused me to estimate too high the quantities obtained.             do not                            I
think              I

       GENTLEMEN,
         Mr. Crookes's Radiometer is at present deservedly at
A*tracting      a large share of attention, it will probably not
be  without interest to many of your readers, and may perhaps
dispel some illusions, to point out that the excess of pressure
which he has observed is within the limits of what may be
accounted for by the known properties of the material agents
that are present.
                          I am, Gentlemen,
                                    Yours faithfully,
                                        G. Johnston     E STONEY.
    1. The Radiometer, as I have seen it in Mr. Apps's shop,
consists of four vanes supported at the ends of slender plati
num arms, and movable in a horizontal circle on a cap rest
ing on a steel point at the centre.      I  was informed    that each
vane consists of three folds of thin     platinum   foil.   The faces
of the vanes are presented horizontally, and are each about
two square centimetres in area.         One face of each vane is
blackened.     The whole is mounted within a small glass cham
ber, some six or seven centimetres across, which          I  was told
had been exhausted by the prolonged action of a Sprengel
pump.                                                            -

  the temperature varies gradually, having on one side the tem
  perature of the surrounding air, and on the other the tempera
  ture of the disk.
     5. If  the chamber enclosing the apparatus contained air
  at atmospheric pressure and temperature, this layer would be
 thin.    It would consist of air which has been expanded by the
 warmth of the disk, while the air in the rest of the chamber
  would by this, expansion be in a trifling degree compressed.
 In other words, the molecules whose activity has been                     in
 creased by contact with the heated disk would, in their en
 counters with other molecules, keep back some of them, and
 in this way reduce the number of molecules striking the heated
 disk, while this process would slightly crowd molecules into
 the rest of the chamber, and thus increase the number coming
 into collision with unheated surfaces. In this way the pres
 sure everywhere is in a small degree raised, but everything is
 adjusted so that there is no excess of pressure anywhere; and
 this adjustment takes place in an exceedingly short period of
 time, so short that no sensible motion of the disk can establish
 itself while it is being effected. In fact the number of molecules
 per cubic millimetre in atmospheric air is known to be about a
 unit—eighteen"; the molecules are dashing about with velocities
.
 of which the average is about 500 metres per second; each
 meets with about 1000 millions of encounters with others in
 every second; and the adjustment accordingly takes place with
what is promptitude as compared with visible motions (see
         on the Internal Motions of Gases, in the Philosophical
    agazine of August 1868).
    6. It is necessary for our purpose to form some estimate
of the thickness of the layer of warmed air. In the absence
                                         I
 of direct experimentst, will assume that this layer of gra
duated temperature would in ordinary air be one fourth
metre thick (about as thick as a sheet of paper) if the disk
were 20° Centigrade hotter than the air.                         #.
                                                      seems a very
moderate estimate, judging from the copiousness of the con
vection currents which would quickly establish themselves if
there were such a difference of temperature.        And from this
assumption it follows that if the temperature of the disk had
been raised 0-1 of a degree before the chamber was exhausted,

                                     *
ture that actually takes place in the radiometer, the thickness
of the warmed layer of air would have been half a sixth-metre.
This is a very small thickness. It is about the wave-length

the diameter of the disks which float in human blood.  Let us
suppose, then, that a layer of this thickness is heated, irre
spective of convection, when ordinary air is inside the ap
  aratus.
   7. On the foregoing assumptions, we can compute what the
state of things will be when the chamber is exhausted. When
the  pressure is made to vary, it appears from the doctrine of
probabilities that the value of A (using A to designate the length
of the average excursion of a molecule, i.e. the distance a
molecule on the average travels in the intervals between two
of    its
       encounters with other molecules) will vary inversely                                                               as

      9. Instead    of the actual condition of
                                             the molecules which
  come into collision with the heated    disk, we may substitute
  one more convenient for calculatiou.      The resulting pressure
  will be the same as if some moderate proportion of the mole
  cules, say one third of them, had reached it with velocities
  corresponding to the temperature 15°1, while the remaining
                     º
 two thirds reached it with velocities corresponding to 15°. We
 may further regard the increased pressure on the disk caused
 by the former        of molecules as equal in amount to the
 portion which is compensated        by the slight reductions of
 density in the neighbourhood of the disk, and by the slightly
 increased temperature and density elsewhere, which are due
 to the existence of a portion of the gradient.         Under this
hypothesis the effect of these molecules may be left out
 of account. There would, however, remain the augmented
pressure arising from the other two thirds of the molecules,
 uncompensated so far as regions behind the disk are con
cerned ; and it is the amount of this pressure which we have
now to estimate. The molecules in question reach the disk,
according to the hypothesis, with velocities corresponding to
 15°, and are thrown off from it with velocities corresponding
to 15°1. It is easy to see that the augmentation of pressure
which they will produce upon the disk, will be half what
would arise if they had reached the disk as well as left it with
velocities corresponding to the higher temperature.           This
latter can be calculated by Boyle and Mariotte's law.         It is
two thirds         of a decigramme x 273+15'               "       0.000,023            of
a gramme per square centimetre.       The uncompensated excess
of pressure on the disk    will, upon  the assumptions we have
    e, be half of this, or 0.000,011,5 of a gramme per square
centimetre, the amount as determined experimentally by Mr.
Crookes being 0-000,01.        Accordingly an elevation of the
temperature of the blackened face of the disk to the extent of
about one tenth of a degree above the temperature of the glass
and the back of the disk, is enough to account for the observed
pressure.

A* Williamhave been introduced, and very properly, by Sir
                  Thomson in his two recent tidal papers in the
September and October Numbers of the Philosophical Maga
zine as an indorser and adopter of certain views and results
of Sir G. B. Airy contained in his ‘Tides and Waves, which
Sir William Thomson controverts,            beg leave to occupy a I
few  pages   of your Magazine    on the  subject.

of Laplace's method of determining the constant A® in his
result, corresponding to K, in Airy's presentation of                                           it,   as
quoted    by Sir William Thomson           6—a method which has

equation  (3), in the expression of u, equation (10) in Sir
William Thomson's paper; and then by putting u=0 we
should have an equation which must be satisfied where
cos 3=0, in order to satisfy the condition above.    Now it is
readily seen from mere inspection that equation (10) with
u-0 is satisfied at the equator by any expression of a in
which the terms contain a factor which is any power whatever
of x= sin 6, 6 being the polar distance; and hence the expres

    The great improbability of some of Laplace's results obtained
with his value of Ki may be seen by comparing his tide with
that of canals extending east and west around the globe. With
a depth of sea of about 5.5 miles, Laplace gets, with the moon
and sun in conjunction on the equator, a direct tide with a
range at the equator of 36 feet.                            If
                                                we now suppose the whole
globe to be divided into canals extending east and west around
the earth, say, one or two degrees in width, so that the oscil
lations in the canals would be entirely independent of one
another, we know that with a depth of 5.5 miles                   the canals           all
between the latitudes                of
                                about 60° north and south would have
inverted instead          direct tides, with range
                              of                                the equator
                                                                  a               at

those parallels and the poles would have direct tides. Hence
the             the canals are inverted over the whole globe ex
                in
cept comparatively small areas between the parallels and
the poles.           we now suppose the partitions between the

is completely  satisfied by the preceding expression of a with
any value of Bo whatever; but it must be determined by some
condition outside of it; and this condition is that the volume
of the sea must be constant, or, in other words, that the mean
depth of the sea must remain the same.         This condition is
already satisfied for the equilibrium part of this tide repre
sented by H(1-3/14); and it now only remains to satisfy it

XXIV.  On the Magnetism of Steel Bars.           By Dr. CARL
  FROMME, Instructor in Physics at the University of Göttingen".
                  present memoir was suggested by a prize-theme
§ 1.
       THEset       by the Philosophic Faculty at Göttingen in the
 summer of      1873,   which demanded “a closer investigation of
the temporary portion of the magnetism of a steel bar with
various intensities of the permanent part, and under the action
 of various separating forces.” This problem touches a still
 rather obscure department of physics.
    The magnetization-relations of soft iron have, in the last
 three decades, been so profoundly investigated by numerous
 observers, that, it might be thought, much more than a finish
 ing-off of the building can hardly remain for the next period.
 But if we consider how long it took to attain clearness in
 regard to soft iron, so easy to manage in comparison with
steel, it cannot be surprising that the researches hitherto car
ried on concerning the latter are far from having brought the
desirable, or even the attainable perspicuity in the comprehen
sion of     its
              magnetization.
    The causes        the difficulties presented
                        of                               steel

forces    acting always in the same direction.
   § 2. Having regard to the reasons above touched upon,                                          I
selected only two sorts of steel, differing in specific gravity
and possessing great homogeneity.                              Of each sort five pieces
were     cut;     and since the           theory      developed         by Neumann and
Kirchhoff, of the magnetization of an ellipsoid of rotation, had
been verified for soft iron, they were brought into the form of
an elongated ellipsoid              of rotation.
   In Table I.          are collected :—the semi-major and minor axes
a and b of         the ellipsoids; the constants C, determined by the

   With these data G, and from it k and K, can be calculated
as  soon as the angles a and 3 are ascertained by observation.
   On every occasion three series of observations were made
for this purpose, as before and after each observation with the
ellipsoid inserted the angle 8, corresponding to the direct        in
duction-current, was found by turning the helix alone.           Each
of the three series consisted of two sets of twelve return-points
of the galvanometer-needle, half belonging to one, and half to
the other extremity of the multiplication-arc.             The return
points were taken successively in threes; and from the eight
resulting triples the multiplication-deflection was calculated on
the scale.

smaller the value  of the force at which the minimum enters.
  Thus, with the harder sort under the action of the vertical
component the minimum appears to be reached, or even to be
already passed.
    Hence differently elongated ellipsoids of the same sort of steel,

    § 7. Before we draw the conclusions to be deduced from
this Table, we will again lay before us the alternatives which
are here to be decided.                   There are two cases possible; either
the residual       magnetism               converges simultaneously with the
magnetizing force towards zero, or else the residual magnetism
reaches zero already for a finite value of the force.
    Now the Table shows that, at least with the more-elongated
ellipsoids, a value of the magnetizing force can be approxi
mately fixed, at which the increment of the magnetism alread
  resent (UM) first exceeds the errors of observation.                              Resi

202              Dr. C. Fromme             on the Magnetism                of Steel Bars.
    The harder the steel, the feebler is the magnetizing force at
                                           º:
 which residual magnetism enters.
    This result was to be expected beforehand, according to the
 representation which the                  of rotatable molecular mag
 nets  gives  of the process    of  magnetization.
    The molecular forces oppose the placing of the molecules
 in positions of magnetic equilibrium when the molecules
 are acted on by magnetizing forces; but, inasmuch as the
 have themselves undergone a change by the rotation of the
 molecules, they also resist the rotation of the latter back to
 their unmagnetic positions, and keep them fixed in certain
 magnetic ones after the force has ceased to operate. Now, as
 the molecular forces are more intense in the harder sort of
 steel than in the softer, the temporary magnetization turns out
 less in the former; and, on the contrary, the residual mag
 netism is greater, because the molecular forces are more altered
 on the rotation of the molecules.
    That with the more-elongated ellipsoids residual magnetism
 commences earlier than with the less-elongated ones receives
 its explanation from this—that              the former, with
                                                       in                equal                   an
 enternal   magnetizing     force,   the sum         the forces     acting
                                                                     of                                    on

C.H10,               &c. respectively, constitutes the series of the

is sometimes       spoken   of as the marsh-gas series.
    Each successive member of the series differs in composition
from the immediately preceding member by an increment of
carbo-hydrogen, CH, ; and as, in the unit-weight of every
member of the series, the number of proportions of hydro

of one proportion of hydrºgen by one proportion of some par
ticular radical—chlorine, Cl, or hydroxyl,.OH, for instance—
gives rise to the production of at least two distinct isomers.
And a study of the formative and transformative reactions
of these isomers leads to the conclusion that the difference be
tween them depends upon whether they result from a substi
tution of the introduced radical for the hydrogen of a methyl or of

   The paraffin radicals resulting in this way from the intro
duction of a foreign radical in the place of the hydrogen of a
methyl- or of a methylen- or of a formyl-residue in the original

formulae of the several 2-, 3-,              4-, and 5-carbon alcohols as
            derivatives, and the             second column their formula
as paraffin derivatives.  In the             third column, a few of these
last formulae are set out in a slightly more elaborated form;
and those of the primary alcohols thereby adapted to Kolbe's
system of names, which, however, appear of less advantage as
         to this class of primary than as applied to either of
  e other two classes  of alcohols.
   The  system of alcohol notation employed in these Tables has
the advantage of manifesting clearly the relationship of the
paraffin alcohols in general to their associated paraffins and to
the olefins and olefin alcohols, also the relationship of the
primary alcohols to their associated aldehyds and fatty acids,
and of the secondary alcohols to their associated ketones, and,
lastly, the relationship of the alcohols in general to their asso
ciated glycols, glycerines, and erythrites, &c. Its adaptability
to the #.       ºft corresponding to the several primary alco
hols, whether derived from normal, iso-, or neoparaffins, &c.,

     216             Mr. W. Odling         on the Formulation          of
       As regards the choice of distinctive names, indicative of
     the modes of origin and transformation of the different iso
     meric acids, those chemists who employ Kolbe's system of
     nomenclature in the case of the primary alcohols will naturally
     prefer to use some corresponding terms for their associated
     acids, and, calling the alcohol butyl-carbinol or -methol, for
     instance, would call the associated acid butyl-oxatyl or deri
     vatively as butyl-formic acid, thus:—
                      Butyl                       Isobutyl                   Katabutyl
-carbinols   .   (HO)H,C.C.H.              (HO)H,C.C.H.                 (HO)H,C.C, H:
-formic acids        HO.C.C, HT                HO,O.C.H.;                  HO,O.C.H.
                                      #.
           Other chemists, again, paying special regard to the consti
        tuent residues of the           acids, will prefer to designate
        the three 5-carbon acids, for instance, as ethyl-propionic,
        pseudopropyl-acetic, and katabutyl-formic acids respectively.
        Altogether, however, the names which call to mind that the
        normal, iso-, and neo-acids are mono-, di-, and trimethyl &c.
        derivatives would seem to be most advantageous. The rela
        tionship to one another of the different seriations of names is
        shown below:—
                  Normal, Iso-, and Neo-pentoic Acids, C. H10O2.
 Nor. Methyl-butyric. Ethyl-propionic             Propyl-acetic             Butyl-formic
 Iso-                 Dimethyl-propionic.         Pseudoprop-acetic         Isobutyl-formic
 Neo-                                             Trimethyl-acetic.         Katabutyl-formic.
          The simplest term of the iso-series is derivable from the
        secondary alcohol or pseudol of the next preceding lower
        carbon group, and the simplest term of the neo-series from
        the tertiary alcohol or carbinol of            its
                                               next preceding lower

   Where, however, as in the case of    the more complex suc
ceeding terms, isomerism does or may    occur among iso-acids
with one another, and among neo-acids   with one another, these
relations of derivation are confined to certain isomeric forms
only, as instanced in the case of the four acknowledged forms
of isocaproic acid, the first two forms only being derivable as
above from the two 5-carbon pseudols each to each, and the
last two deriving from the two 5-carbon iso-primary alcohols
each to each, by the substitution, as before, of oxatyl for hy
droxyl, thus:—

takes   part in the action. For the actions exerted upon one

 facts established by experiment, in harmony with the prin
 ciple of the Conservation of Energy.
     I have already, in my previous communication, said that it
 is  theoretically most probable that the value of the constant n
 is zero.   Thereby   the terms affected by the factor n fall away
 of themselves; and consequently the principle of the Conser
 vation of Energy is fulfilled not merely for closed currents,
 but also for the single elements of them.
    Besides this simplification, however, a second can now be
 introduced, which likewise refers only to a constituent of
 the formulae not affecting the actions of a closed galvanic
 current.
    I  have, in deriving the above equations, already deviated in
 some essential points from the views hitherto held.         I have,
 namely, taken into consideration not merely the relative
motion of the two particles of electricity, but also their abso
lute motions; and for the electrodynamic forces exerted by
the particles on one another    I have neglected the assumption
 that their direction must fall in the line joining the particles.
                        I
 On the other hand, have held fast to the hypothesis that the
two forces are equal and opposed to one another. Nevertheless
even this hypothesis is not necessary for forces such as the
electrodynamic; if we drop it also, we can give to the funda
mental equations the following form :—

 222          Mr. H. M. Taylor      on the Relative Values
 when placed in succession on every square of the board,             it
 seems fair to assume that this gives a not very inexact measure
 of the value of the piece.
     For special reasons the above problem is stated in the fol–
 lowing manner:—“A king and a piece of different colours are
 placed at random on two squares of a chessboard of n° squares:
 it is required to find the chance that the king is in check.”
     The ordinary chessboard has an even number of squares;
 and as some of the results take different forms for odd and
 even values of n, the results are given merely for even values
 of n, and the results for the ordinary chessboard of 64 squares
 deduced from them.                            -
                                                                   -
    As the relative values of the knight and bishop on the ordi
 nary chessboard on this hypothesis came out in a ratio very      dif
 ferent from the ratio that is ordinarily received by chess-players,
 it occurred to the author to investigate the chance that when
 a king and a piece of different colours were placed at random
 on two squares of a board, the king would be in check but
 unable to take the piece. This check is called safe check in
 contradistinction to a mere check, which may be safe or unsafe
 and which is called simple check.
                   Simple check from one rook.
    A rook in any position    checks 2(n-1) squares.        The king
 can be   placed on n°–1 for       any  given  position  of the rook.
 The chance of check, therefore, is
                         2(n-1)          2
                           nº–T T n + I’
 If m=8   y
                      the chance     =  3.

    If the rook be on a corner square, it could be taken by a
king in check on two squares, and so on. The number of safe

                           Safe check with one bishop.
   This is best found by finding the number of unsafe checks.
It will be seen      that    if the   bishop be on a corner square, there
is one unsafe check; for any other outside square there are
two unsafe checks; and for any other square there are four.
The whole number therefore of unsafe checks

Therefore the numerator of the chance-fraction

These results will be the same for a bishop restricted to squares

  We may conclude by remarking that the relative values of
the knight, bishop, rook, and queen are, according as we mea
sure them by the chance of simple check or of safe check, on
the ordinary chessboard in the ratio of 3, 5, 8, 13, or 12, 13,
24, 37 respectively; while the values of the pieces in the
same   order, as given by Staunton in the ‘Chess-Player's
Handbook,” are 3.05, 3:50, 5:48, and 9.94, the value of the
pawn being taken as unity.
  N.B.-The value of a pawn depends so much on the fact
that it is possible to convert it into a queen, that this method
does not appear applicable to                 it.

ened firmly to them.     At intervals of 3 inches along this cross
piece are inserted violin-pegs, each peg carrying a light string
with a heavy ball of 1               attached. Before fastening
the strings to the violin-pegs, each string is passed through a
small hole in the projecting base of the crosspiece, so that the

   M. de Bruno in many places gives notices of the history of the
subject; and this renders a mistake in the very first page of
the Preface matter for regret.     The passage runs as follows:—
“La Théorie des Invariants.                    ...
                                   doit son origine à un excellent
mémoire de Boole sur les Transformations lineaires inseré dans le
Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal, 1847.” The article
in question consists of two parts, both in the third volume of the
‘Cambridge Mathematical Journal;' and the first part was pub
lished in November 1841. The “Cambridge and Dublin Journal’
was a second series of the Cambridge Journal.       There were four
volumes of the latter published.   The twofold mistake in the date
and the name of the Journal has the effect of quite misrepresenting
the history of the origin of the subject, though it can only be due
to an oversight, as the means of correcting it are to be found
within the volume itself.

is strikingly similar to that of iodine at a dull red heat. . We have
    *
first a bank of continuous absorption in the blue with a sharp
boundary on the less refrangible side, and then a channelled-space
absorption throughout the entire green part of the spectrum reach
ing to D.
              This metal at first caused an absorption at both ends of
the spectrum; shortly afterwards the whole spectrum was extin
guished.      As this is a readily oxidizable metal, special care was
 taken to prove that a large excess of hydrogen was present.
     Thallium.—We are indebted to Mr. Crookes for a generous
 supply of this metal. The characteristic green line of thallium was
 observed bright, the light of the arc not being reversed; and it may
 be interesting to note that the vapour of this metal was incan
 descent five minutes after the withdrawal of the flame.
      Gold.—A distinct absorption in the blue and red was observed,
 but there were certainly no traces of a channelled-space spectrum.
 The spectral lines due to the oxyhydrogen flame were very con
 spicuous.     It may be noted that the amount of gold volatilized was
 only 0:01 oz. ; but this quantity of metal was sufficient to produce
 an abundant supply of vapour.
     Palladium.—This metal caused a distinct absorption in the blue,
 but no effect was noticed at the red end of the spectrum.        There
  was no channelled-space spectrum, and the lines caused by the
  oxyhydrogen     flame were barely visible.
      Selenium.—With the greatest thickness employed a channelled
  space spectrum was given by selenium.
      Iodine.—It will be remembered that, according to the results
  already published by one of us, iodine vapour exhibits, at a low tem
  perature, a channelled-space spectrum, and a bank of absorption
  in the violet. These later experiments showed that, at the more
  elevated temperature, this bank was broken up and disappeared,
 leaving a continuous channelled-space spectrum.
      These experiments, made at the Royal Mint, were often prolonged
  for many hours consecutively.      They involved much furnace-work
                                                                         |
  of a peculiarly trying nature; and we have much pleasure in
  acknowledging the assistance we received from Mr. Edward Rigg,
  one of the assistant assayers, who conducted many of the tedious
  manipulations with great skill and patience.         We should also
  mention that the care exercised by Joseph Groves, senior fireman,
  in the preparation of the furnace and the lime-moulds, contributed
  in no small measure to the success of the experiments.
      It appears to us that these experiments, conducted at the high
  temperature of the oxyhydrogen flame, go far to support the con
  clusions which were drawn from the experiments at a lower tempe
   rature. First, in passing from the liquid to the most perfect gaseous
  state, vapours are composed of molecules of different orders of
   complexity; and second, this complexity is diminished by the
   dissociating action of heat, each molecular simplification being
   marked by a distinctive spectrum.     There is also an intimate con
   nexion between the facility with which the final stage is reached,

          eriments to ascertain the Cause of Stratification in Elec
trical   Discharges  in vacuo.”     By Warren De La Rue, Hugo W.
Müller, and William Spottiswoode.
    Some results obtained in working with a chloride-of-silver battery
of 1080 cells in connexion with vacuum-tubes appear to be of
sufficient interest to induce us to communicate them to the Society,
in anticipation of the more detailed account of an investigation
which is now being prosecuted, and which it is intended to con
tinue, shortly, with a battery of 5000 cells, and possibly with a far
greater number.
    The battery used up till now consists of 1080 cells, each being
 formed of a glass tube 6 inches (15-23 centims.) long and 3 of an
 inch (1-9 centim.) internal diameter; these are closed with a vulca
 nized rubber stopper (cork), perforated eccentrically to permit the
 insertion of a zinc rod, carefully amalgamated, ºr (0:48 centim.) of
 an inch in diameter and 4-5 inches (11:43 centims.) long.    The other
 element consists of a flattened silver wire passing by the side of
 the cork to the bottom of the tube and covered, at the upper part
                                                     ºf
  above the chloride of silver and until it passes the stopper, with
  thin sheet gutta percha for insulation,     to protect it from the
action of the sulphur in the vulcanized corks; these wires are is
of an inch (0-16 centim.) broad and 8 inches (20:32 centims.) long.
In the bottom of the tube is placed 225-25 grains (14:59 grms.)
chloride of silver in powder; this constitutes the electrolyte: above
the chloride of silver is poured a solution of common salt containing
25 grammes chloride of sodium to 1 litre (1752 grains to 1 gallon)
of water, to within about 1 inch (2.54 centims.) of the cork.
The connexion between adjoining cells is made by passing a short
piece of india-rubber tube over the zinc rod of one cell, and drawing
the silver wire of the next cell through it so as to press against
the zinc.    The closing of the cells by means of a cork prevents the
 evaporation of water, and not only avoids this serious inconveni
 ence, but also contributes to the effectiveness of the insulation.
 The tubes are grouped in twenties in a sort of test-tube rack,
 having four short ebonite feet, and the whole placed in a cabinet

voltameter having a resistance of 11 ohms. The striking-distance
of 1080 elements between copper wire terminals, one turned to a
point, the other to a flat surface, in air is 345 inch (0.096 millim.)
to   ºn inch (0.1 millim.). The greatest distance through which
the battery-current would pass continuously in vacuo was 12 inches
(30:48 centims.) between the terminals in a carbonic acid residual
vacuum.     This battery has been working since the early part of
November 1874, with, practically, a constant electromotive force.
    Besides 2000 more cells like those just described, we are putting
together 2000 cells, with the chloride of silver in the form of
rods, which are cast on the flattened silver wires, as in a battery
described by De La Rue and Müller”, but in other respects
 similar to the battery above described, the glass tubes being, how
ever, somewhat larger in diameter; the rods of chloride of silver
are enclosed in tubes open at the top and bottom, and formed of
vegetable parchment, the object of these vegetable-parchment cases
being to prevent contact between the zinc and chloride-of-silver rods.
The internal resistance of batteries so constructed is only from 2
to 3 ohms per cell, according to the distance of the zinc and chloride
 of-silver rods, and they evolve from 3 to 4-5 cub. centims. (0.18 to
0-27 cub. inch) per minute, in a voltameter having a resistance of
 11 ohms.     Their action is remarkably constant.
    For the  experiments   detailed below, vacuum-tubes were generally
used of about 14 to 2 inches (3-8 to 5 centims.)in diameter, and from
6 to 8inches (1524 to 20:32 centims.) long; also prolate spheroidal
vessels 6 inches by 3 inches (1524 by 7-62 centims.).          The termi
nals are of various forms, and from 4 inches to 6 inches (10-16 to
15-24 centims.) apart, and made of aluminium and occasionally of
magnesium and of palladium, the latter showing some curious phe
nomena with a hydrogen residual vacuum, which will be described
in a future paper. A tube which has given the most striking results
is 8 inches (20:32 centims.) long, and has a series of six aluminium
rings varying in diameter from # of an inch to about 13 of an inch
(0.95 to 3:17 centims.), the thickness of the wire being about tº
(0:16 centim.) of an inch ; the rings are a little more than 1 inch
(2.54 centims.) apart; and connecting wires of platinum pass
through the tube from each ring and permit of the length and other
conditions of the discharge being varied.
   At times the terminals of the battery were placed in connexion
with accumulators of different kinds—for instance, two spheres of
18 inches (45-72 centims.) in diameter, presenting each a superficies
of 7-07 square feet (65-68 square decims.), and cylinders of paper
covered with tinfoil, each having a surface of 16 square feet (148-64
square decims.); the globe and cylinders were in          cases carefully  all
insulated. Other accumulators were composed                 coils     two   of       of
copper wires             in T',   an

     Inaddition to these accumulators we have several others formed
of alternate plates of tinfoil and insulating material, such as paper
saturated with paraffine, and also sheets of vulcanite.          These are
of various capacities and contain from 5 to several hundred square
feet. The largest has a capacity of 47.5 microfarads; when it is
discharged it gives a very bright short spark, accompanied by a
loud snap; the charge deflagrates 8 inches (20:32 centims.) of

 which passes continuously. It may be stated that the capacity of the
accumulator has to be carefully adjusted to prevent any cessation
of the current, to avoid, in fact, a snapping discharge at distant
 intervals. The periodic overflows, so to speak, which increase the
 current from time to time, would seem to have a tendency to cause
 an interference of the current-waves, and to produce nodes of
 greater resistance in the medium, as evinced by the stratification    º
 which becomes apparent.       To the eye no pulsation in the current
  is apparent ; and in order to convince ourselves whether or not
 there was really any fluctuation in the current when the apparatus
 was thus coupled up with the battery, we made several experi
 ments, and ultimately hit upon the following arrangement(fig. 3):—
                                 Fig. 3.

    The primary wire p p' of a small induction-coil, both with and
without the iron core, was introduced into the circuit as well as the
vacuum-tube V; to the secondary wire ss' of the induction-coil was
connected a second vacuum-tube, W*.        Under these circumstances
there was no change in the appearance of the discharge in V,
in consequence of the introduction of the induction-coil, the termi
nals being still surrounded by the soft nebulous light before spoken
of: no luminosity appeared in the second vacuum-tube W*in con

   making and breaking the connexion with the battery.         At other
   times there was evidently no fluctuation in the continuous dis
   charge, no periodic increase or diminution of flow, and conse
   quently no induced current in the secondary wire ss of the         in
   duction-coil.
       In the second experiment wires were also led from the terminals
   of the battery (all other things remaining as before) to the coil
   accumulator as in fig. 4; then immediately the discharge in W
   became stratified and the secondary vacuum-tube V* lighted up,
   clearly showing that under these circumstances a fluctuation in the
   discharge really occurs on the appearance of stratification.
       The brilliancy of the discharge in V* (the induced current passes
   through complicated vacuum-tubes through which the primary
   current cannot pass) depends greatly on the quality and quantity
   of the discharge in the primary vacuum-tube W. Under some cir
   cumstances the secondary discharge is extremely feeble, and the
   illumination in W” barely visible; under others it is very brilliant.
       Preparations are being made to render evident induced currents
   in the secondary wire of the coil too feeble to produce any illumina
    tion.   Pending the further development of our investigation, we
    have ventured to give an account of our progress in elucidating
    some points in the theory of the vacuum-discharge, without any
    wish to ascribe to our results more weight than they deserve.

   Batteries of this description may be had from Messrs. Tisley
and Spiller, Brompton Road. Their cost, in large numbers, is
about one shilling per cell, exclusive of the charge of chloride of
silver, which costs about two shillings per cell. The latter, either
in the form of powder or of rods cast upon flattened silver wire,
may be obtained from Messrs. Johnson and Matthey, Hatton
Garden. When the battery is exhausted the reduced silver may be
readily reconverted into chloride, with scarcely any loss.

   “On the Action of Heat on the Absorption-Spectra and Chemi
cal Constitution of Saline Solutions.” By Walter Noel Hartley,
F.C.S.
   The effects of heat on absorption-spectra were recorded in the
preliminary notice of this paper, published in the ‘Proceedings of
the Royal Society’ for 1874 (vol. xxii. p. 241).
   The contents of the present communication consist of:—1st, his
torical notes; 2nd, method of working; 3rd, the spectrum-measure
ments of different solutions; 4th, conclusions as to the effect of
heat on coloured liquids, and the following deductions as to the
constitution of salts when dissolved in water:-
   I. When a simple metallic salt is dissolved in water, it is not de
composed in such a way that an oxide and an acid is produced, nor
does a compound of the metallic oxide with the acid result.
    II. When a metallic salt is dissolved in water to form a saturated
 solution, it does not necessarily attain    maximum state         its

     III. When      simple
                        a  hydrated    metallic salt      dissolved   water         is              in
 to  form    a  saturated solution, the crystalline molecule remains
 chemically intact, except        the case    incertain compounds which
                                                                    of

    “On   Attraction and Repulsion resulting from Radiation.”—Part
II.    By William Crookes, F.R.S. &c.
    This is the second part of a paper which the author sent to the
Royal Society in August 1873. The author commences by de
scribing improvements which he has made in the Sprengel pump,
and in various accessories which are necessary when working at
the highest rarefactions.
    Continuing the description    of apparatus, the author describes dif
ferent new forms which enable the phenomena of repulsion by ra
diation to be observed and illustrated. A bulb 3 inches in diameter
is blown at the end of a glass tube 18 inches long. In this bulb a
fine glass stem, with a sphere or disk of pith &c. at each end, is
suspended by means of a cocoon-fibre. The whole is attached to
the Sprengel pump in such a way that it can be perfectly exhausted
and then thermetically sealed. Besides pith, the terminals may be
made of cork, ivory, metal, or other substance.      During exhaustion
 several precautions have to be taken, which are fully entered into
in the paper. To get the greatest delicacy in an apparatus of this
kind, there is required large surface with a minimum of weight.
An apparatus constructed with the proper precautions is so sensi
tive to heat, that a touch with the finger on a part of the globe
 near one extremity of the pith will drive the index round over 90°,
 whilst it follows a piece of ice as a needle follows a magnet. With
 a large bulb, very well exhausted and containing a suspended bar of
 pith, a somewhat striking effect is produced when a lighted candle
 is placed about 2 inches from the globe. The pith bar commences to
 oscillate to and fro, the swing gradually increasing in amplitude
 until the dead centre is passed over, when several complete
 revolutions are made. The torsion of the suspending fibre now
 offers resistance to the revolutions, and the bar commences to turn
 in the opposite direction. This movement is kept up with great
 energy and regularity as long as the candle burns.
    The author discusses the action of ice, or a cold substance, on
 the suspended index.      Cold being simply negative heat, it is not
 at first  sight obvious how it can produce the opposite effect to
 heat.    The author, however, explains this by the law of exchanges,
 and shows that attraction by a cold body is really repulsion by
 radiation falling on the opposite side.        According to the same
  law, it is not difficult to foresee what will be the action of
  two bodies, each free to move, if they are brought near to one
  another in space, and if they differ in temperature either from
  each other or from the limiting walls of the space. The author
  gives four typical cases, with experiments, which prove his reason
  ing to be correct.
     Experiments are described with the object of ascertaining whether
  the attraction by heat, which, commencing at the neutral point,
  increases with the density of the enclosed air, will be continued in

spheric pressure.       This is found to be the case.
   Various experiments are described with bulb-apparatus, in which
the bulb is surrounded with a shell containing various adiathermous
liquids and also with a shell of vacuum. In                      cases radiation    all
passed through, producing the normal action                   attraction        air

 highest rarefaction, there is not found any difference in the results
 which can betraced to the residual gas. A hydrogen-vacuum appears
 the same as a water- or an iodine-vacuum.
    With this apparatus the effect of exposing a torsion-balance to a
continuous radiation is described, and the results are shown graphi
cally. The effect of a short (11:3 seconds) exposure to radiation
 is next described, and the results are given in the form of a Table.
    In another Table is given the results of experiments in which a
constant source of radiation was allowed to act upon one end of the
torsion-beam at a distance of 140 or 280 millims., various substances
being interposed.       The sensitiveness of this apparatus to heat-rays
appears to be greater than that of an ordinary thermo-multiplier.
Thus the obscure heat-rays from copper at 100°, passing through
glass, produce a deflection on the scale of 3:25, whilst under the
same circumstances no current is detected in the thermo-pile.              The
following substances are used as screens, and the deflections pro
duced (when the source of radiation is magnesium wire, a standard
candle, copper at 400°, and copper at 100°) are tabulated:—
    Rock-salt, 20 millims. thick; rock-crystal, 42 millims. thick;
dark smoky talc; plate glass of various thicknesses, both white and
green: a glass cell containing 8 millims. of water; a plate of alum
5 millims. thick; calc-spar, 27 millims. thick; ammonio-sulphate of
copper, opaque to rays below F ; ditto, opaque to rays below G.
    The author considers that these experiments show that the re
pulsion is not entirely due to the rays usually called heat, i. e. to
the extreme and ultra red of the spectrum.                Experiments have
been tried with the electric and the solar         spectrum    formed with a
quartz train, which prove the action to be also exerted by the lumi
nous and ultra violet rays. Some numerical data have been obtained;
but unfavourable weather has prevented many observations being
made with the solar spectrum.
    The barometric position of the neutral point dividing attraction
from repulsion is next discussed.         The position of this point varies
with the   density   of the substance on which radiation falls, the ratio
of      its
        mass      its surface, its radiating and conducting-power for
                   to

   The paper concludes with a discussion of the various theories
which have been adduced in explanation of these phenomena. The
air-current and electrical theory are considered to have been
 abundantly disproved.      The following experiment is given by the
author to show that Prof. Osborne Reynolds's hypothesis of the
movements due to evaporation and condensation at the surface
will not account for all the facts of the case, and that therefore he
has not hit upon the true explanation.       A thick and strong bulb
was blown at the end of a piece of very difficultly fusible green
glass, specially made for steam-boiler gauges. In it was supported
a thin bar of aluminium at the end of a long platinum wire.       The
upper end of the wire was passed through the top of the tube and
well sealed in, for electrical purposes. The apparatus was sealed by
fusion to the Sprengel pump, and exhaustion was kept going on for
two days, until an induction-spark refused to pass across the vacuum.
During this time the bulb and its contents were several times raised
to a dull red heat. At the end of two days’ exhaustion the tube
was found to behave in the same manner as, but in a stronger degree
than, it would in a less perfectly exhausted apparatus, viz. it was
repelled by heat of low intensity and attracted by cold.    A similar
experiment was next tried, only water was placed in the bulb be
fore exhaustion.     The water was then boiled away in vacuo, and
the exhaustion continued, with frequent heating of the apparatus
to dull redness, for about 48 hours.         At the end of this time
the bar of aluminium         was found to behave exactly the same
as the one in the former experiment, being repelled by radiation.
   It is impossible to conceive that in these experiments sufficient
condensable gas or vapour was present to produce the effects Prof.
Osborne Reynolds ascribes to           After the repeated heating
                                           it.                                              to

                 Supplement.          Received     April 20, 1875.
   Since the experiments mentioned  the foregoing Abstract were
                                                  in

ation on black and white surfaces. At the highest exhaustion
heat appears      toact almost equally    white andon   lampblacked          on

repel the black surface more energetically than they do the white
surface.    Taking advantage of this fact, the author has constructed
an instrument which he calls a radiometer.                     This consists of four
arms, suspended on a steel point resting on a cup, so that it is
capable of revolving horizontally. To the extremity of each arm
is fastened a thin disk of pith, lampblacked on one side, the black
surfaces facing the same way.            The whole is enclosed in a glass
globe, which is then exhausted to the highest attainable point and
                                                   -
hermetically sealed.
   The author finds that this instrument revolves under the influence
of radiation, the rapidity of revolution being in proportion to the
intensity of the incident rays.
    Several radiometers, of various constructions as regards details,
but all depending on the above-named discovery, were exhibited by
the author at the Soirée of the Royal Society on the 7th inst., and nu
merous experiments were shown with them. The following Table,
which gives the result of some experiments tried with one of the
first-made radiometers (and therefore not so sensitive as more recent
instruments), is copied from a card which was distributed during
the evening:—

       mena of attraction and repulsion which, he says, result from
 calorific and luminous radiations, could not fail to fix the attention
of physicists; yet the explanation which he gives of them must of
necessity call forth numerous objections.                It          fact, difficult          is,   in

  ON THE ACTION OF HEAT                        IN MAGNETIZATION.                 BY L. FAVé.
   It has long been known that the magnetic state of a steel bar
changes with the temperature. Coulomb, Kupffer, and other physi
cists have studied the very complex laws of the diminution of

  We thus observed that the quantity of residual magnetism slowly
diminishes as the temperature of magnetization is increased; it is
still considerable at incipient redness, but becomes insensible at a
cherry-red heat.
   The magnetism, which is rapidly lost if the bar is allowed to
cool, is preserved at any temperature if the same calorific state is
maintained—if not indefinitely, at least during a time so long that
the very slow enfeeblement observed can be attributed to oscillations
of temperature resulting from the difficulty of keeping a very high
temperature perfectly constant.    An augmentation or a diminu
tion of temperature is accompanied by a loss of magnetism, which
therefore does not depend on the temperature at which the bar was
magnetized, but is a correlative phenomenon of the thermal state.
The quantity of magnetism at a determinate temperature depends
on the nature of the steel, the temperature of magnetization, and
changes of state subsequently undergone.
   When the bar is heating, the magnetism diminishes according
to a law which depends on the composition of the steel, but in a
pretty regular fashion ; when it is cooling, the law of the loss of
magnetism is very different from that of the loss of heat.        The
temperature diminishes, as we know, at first rapidly, then less and
less quickly, and can be represented approximately by Newton's
formula,
                                                    6= eat.

          ON       THE PHENOMENA OF INDUCTION.                                  BY M. MOUTON.
   The experiments which have been made and the theories formed
in regard       induction-phenomena
                   to                      have generally referred                                             to   an
induced wire included              circuit; the electricity set
                                           in   a                   motion                         in

    Ifthe duration of the communication, commencing with the
breaking of the current, exceeds a time which          I
                                                have not tried to
estimate rigorously, but which is not much less than .001 of a
second, the condenser does not become charged, and the needle of
the electrometer remains at rest.
    If
     the duration of this communication is reduced to much less
than gºgo of a second, we find charges absolutely different ac
cording to the instant at which this rapid contact is produced; and
we can thus study, from less than goºrly to Tºwn of a second, the
difference of potential presented by the extremities of the induced
Wire.
    The following is then the succession of the phenomena which             I
have observed     :—
   Take the times for abscissae, the origin being at the metallic
rupture of the inducing current, and the differences of potential
(or, what comes to the same thing, the deflections of the needle)
for ordinates.
    At   the time zero the difference of potential is nil; it then         in
creases regularly, and at about Toºwo of a second reaches a maxi
mum which can be kept to a remarkable degree constant ; it
afterwards decreases regularly, again becoming nil.              But the phe
nomenon does not end there.                Ifthe examination be continued,
the difference of potential changes sign, the positive extremity
becomes negative, and vice versä; there is a new maximum reached
                          I
in the opposite direction, then a return to zero, then another
change of sign, &c.

                   The first ocillations have always seemed to me longer
and more intense; they appear to tend rapidly towards isochronism.
I  beg, however, permission to reserve this question of the duration
of the oscillations, which a special commutator,           I  hope, will soon
enable me to determine.
    In regard to the intensities the results are very clear.

with water and sulphate of copper, the inducing bobbin having
 only one thickness of wire, and the induced bobbin 10,000 turns of

difference of potential equivalent to 80 Daniell elements, betrayed
 by a deflection of 350 divisions by the needle of the electrometer,

  XXXII.      On Waves.      By LoRD RAYLEIGH, M.A., F.R.S."
    HE    theory of waves in a uniform canal of rectangular sec
       tion, in the case when the length of the wave is great in
comparison with the depth of the canal, and when the maxi
mum height of the wave is small in comparison with the same
quantity, was given long ago by Lagrange, and is now well
known. A wave of any form, subject to         É.   above conditions,
is propagated unchanged, and with the velocity which would
be acquired by a heavy body in falling through half the depth
of the canal. The velocity of propagation here referred to is
of course relative to the undisturbe<U+017F> water.        If we attribute
to the water in the canal a velocity equal and opposite to that
of the wave, the wave-form, having the same relative velocity
as before, is now fixed in space, and the problem becomes one
of steady motion.      It is under this aspect that    I  propose at
present to consider the question; and we will therefore suppose
that water is flowing along a tube, whose section undergoes a
 ..".        and gradual alteration in consequence of a change
in the vertical dimension of the tube. The principal question
will be how far the pressure at the upper surface can be made
constant by a suitable adjustment of the velocity of flow to the
force of gravity.
   That the two causes which tend to produce variation of pres
sure at the upper surface act in opposition to each other is at
once evident.     If there were no gravity, the pressure would
vary on account of the alteration in the velocity of the fluid.
Since there must be the same total flow across all sections of

the pipe, the fluid which approaches an enlargement must lose
velocity, and the change of momentum involves an augmented
pressure.
                             Lord Rayleigh on Waves.
             On this account, therefore, there is an increased
pressure at a place of
at a contraction.
                                       and a diminished pressure
                      On the other hand the effect of gravity is in
                                                 jº
the opposite direction, tending to produce a loss of pressure at
the upper surface where that surface is high, and a gain of
  ressure where the surface is low. This effect of gravity is
independent of the velocity; but the changes of pressure due to
               and retardation depend on the velocity of flow,
and we can therefore readily                 that, with a certain
definite velocity of flow, compensation may take place, at least
approximately.      When this happens, the condition of a free
surface is  satisfied, the constraint may be removed, and we are
left with a stationary wave-form.
   In the theory of long waves it is assumed that the length is
º
so great in proportion to the depth of the water, that the yelo
city in a vertical direction can be neglected, and that the hori
zontal velocity is uniform across each section of the canal.
This, it should be observed, is perfectly distinct from any sup
          as to the height of the wave.    If l be the undisturbed
  epth, and h the elevation of the water at any point of the
wave,       wo,

By the principles            of    hydrodynamics,                 the increase   of   pressure
due   to   retardation          will   be

On the other hand, the loss   pressure due      of

    The energy of a long wave is half potential and half kinetic.
 If we suppose that initially the surface is displaced, but that
 the particles have no velocity, we shall evidently obtain (as in
 the case of sound) two equal waves travelling in opposite direc
 tions, whose total energies are equal, and together make up
the potential energy
                         of the original displacement. Now the
 elevation of the derived waves must be half of that of the ori
 ginal displacement, and accordingly the potential energies less
 in the ratio of 4:1. Since therefore the potential energy of
 each derived wave is one quarter, and the total energy one
 half of that of the original displacement, it follows that in the
 derived wave the potential and kinetic energies are equal.
     We may now investigate the effect on a long wave of a gra

 dual alteration in the breadth of the canal and the area of the
 section. The potential energy of the wave varies directly as
 the length, breadth, and square of the height; and, by what has
 been proved above, the same is true of the total energy.      Now
 the length of the wave in various parts of the             is obvi
 ously proportional to the velocity of propagation, viz.    VA;
 and we may therefore write

 But when the alteration in the canal is very gradual, there is
 no sensible reflection and the energy of the wave continues

   These results are due to Green, Kelland, and Airy". The
same method may be even more easily applied to the sound
wave moving in a pipe of gradually varying section.

der this conclusion probable.      Should it be correct, the analy
tical character of the solitary wave remains to be discovered.”
   The theory of the solitary wave has been considered by Earn
shaw (Camb. Trans. vol. viii.), who, distrusting what he calls
analytical approximations, bases his calculation on a supposed
result of experiment, namely that the horizontal velocity is uni
form over each section. This, as we have seen, is the fundamental
assumption in the theory of long waves; but when the length
of the wave is moderate, such a state of things is impossible in
a frictionless fluid which has been once at rest; for it involves
molecular rotation.     In fact if there be a velocity-potential,
the horizontal velocity u satisfies Laplace's equation
                         d’u     d°w

and therefore cannot be a function of a without being also a
function of y. The motion investigated by Earnshaw has
therefore molecular rotation; and the rotation remains con
stant for each particle; otherwise the equations of fluid motion
would not be satisfied. This is the explanation of the difficulty
with which Earnshaw meets, that while the necessary condi
tions are satisfied in the wave itself, there is discontinuity in
passing from the wave to the undisturbed water. The discon
tinuity arises from the fact that, as there is no rotation outside
the wave, it is necessary to suppose finite rotations imparted to
the particles as the wave reaches and leaves them. It is evi
dent that, except in the case of very long waves, u must be
treated as a function of y as well as of w.
   In considering the theory of long waves (reduced to rest by
imparting an opposite motion to the water), we saw that it was
impossible to satisfy the condition of a free surface if the height
of the wave were finite. It occurred to me to inquire whether
there might not be compensation in certain cases between the
variation of pressure at the upper surface due to a finiteness of
height, and the variation due to a departure from the law of
uniform horizontal velocity proper to very long waves.       It was
conceivable that the surface-condition in the case of a wave of
given finite height might be better satisfied by a moderate than
by a very great wave-length.         In this way   I have obtained
what seems to be a     perfectly  satisfactory approximate theory
of the solitary wave.

stream moving in two dimensions without molecular rotation,

These results are in agreement with Russell's observations.

   The velocity of propagation is given by (H), which is Scott
Russell’s formula exactly.       In words, the velocity of the wave
is that due to half the   greatest  depth of the water.
   Another of Russell’s observations is now readily accounted
for :—“It was always found that the wave broke when               ele                       its

   It is not difficult to show that the motion represented by
these equations satisfies the condition of continuity, and is con
sistent with the principles of fluid mechanics; but it involves a
molecular rotation, whose amount is

This molecular rotation, being constant for each particle, is not
inconsistent with the properties of frictionless            when the
motion is once set up; but it is known that a motion of this
kind could not be generated from rest in such fluid by any
natural force. We proceed to consider the theory of periodic
waves in deep water when there is no molecular rotation.
   As in the case of long waves, the problem may be reduced
to one of steady motion by attributing to the water a velocity
equal and opposite to that of the waves.           If a be measured
horizontally and y downwards from the surface, the conditions
of continuity and of freedom from rotation are satisfied by

which is the formula proper for long waves. When obtained
 thus, it is applicable in the first instance only to waves of a
 particular type; but the fact, that it is independent of k or A
 would lead us to the conclusion that the same formula would
            a long wave of any type.
      n one respect the theory of irrotational waves may be con
 sidered inferior to that of Rankine, which last is ea act, in the
 sense that    it is independent of any supposition as to the small
 ness of the waves. So far as I am aware, writers on this sub
ject appear to think that it is only a question of mathematics
 to determine the form of irrotational waves of finite amplitude
 to any degree of approximation.            But it seems to me by no
 means certain that any such type exists, capable of propagating
 itself unchanged with uniform velocity.            I  see no reason wh
 the possibility of such waves in deep water should be taken for
 granted, when we know that in shallow water waves of finite
 height cannot be propagated without undergoing a gradual
 alteration of type.
     One of the most interesting results of Professor Stokes's
  theory is the existence of a slow translation of the water near
  the surface in the direction of the wave.            I propose to show
  that this  superficial   motion is an immediate consequence of the
  absence of molecular rotation, and that it is independent of the
  condition of constant pressure at the bounding surface.
     Let A B be the surface from crest to hollow, and CD a
  neighbouring stream-line.          Draw A/B, C, D, two stream
  lines at such a depth that the steady motion of the fluid is uni
  form, and so as to include a total stream equal to that which
  flows between A B and CD. Then we have to show that a
  particle at   A will take longer    to reach   B, than a particle at A<U+017F>

the tube A D at any point, and v the velocity, the total stream

And if t' represents   the time between      A'   and B',
                          t' = area   A/D'-i-K,
K  being the same in both cases, since the total streams are by
supposition equal. Thus
                   t; t = area AD : area.A'D',
and   it remainsto prove that AD is greater than A/D'.      -
    If
     we draw    equipotential lines in such a manner that the
small spaces cut off between them and AB, CD are squares,
then we know that the same series of equipotential lines will
divide the space between A'B', C'D', into small squares also.
Now if a line be divided into a given number of parts, the sum
of the squares of the parts will be a minimum when the parts
are      all
         equal.   Hence the space AD       greater than

the sum of the squares                    of the   same number             of equal parts of a
shorter line.
     It   follows that when a particle starting from                               A'   has arrived
at B', another particle starting at the same moment from A
will fall short of B. Thus in a progressive wave the water
near the surface has on the whole a motion                                     of translation in
the direction in which the waves advance.

The frequencies of vibration in the three gravest modes, being
inversely as the square root of the corresponding pendulum
lengths, are in the ratio
                          1 : 1:29: 1-44.
Professor Guthrie's observations give for the value                                            of   these
ratios

DP hornblende              referring to the “apparent passage” of
                      slate into serpentine rock at Poltreath and
other places, remarks that the phenomenon is “somewhat em
barrassing, inasmuch as there is reason to conclude, from the
  rauwacke conglomerate at the Nare Point in the north part
of the Lizard district, that hornblende slates were in existence,
forming a surface from which large portions were abraded by
the action of water, while the serpentine and diallage rocks of
the Lizard were not formed; for rounded pieces of the hornblende
slate, though rare, are found in the conglomerate, while no
trace has yet been discovered of either serpentine or diallage
rock, though the latter especially is of great hardness, and
therefore quite as likely as the hornblende rock to resist com
minution into fine sand, and the two former are nearer to the
conglomerate than the latter.” He also observes, “in contra
diction to this apparent passage, we find a mass of serpentine
amid the hornblende slate between Dranna Point and Port
halla, on the north of the principal mass of serpentine,
which has every appearance of having been thrust up among

with the passage of the serpentine in a state of igneous fusion
through them. As a whole, however, the hornblende slate and
rock seem to have formed a basin into which the serpentine
and diallage rock have been poured in a state of fusion” f.

examination of the Lizard in the summer of 1873, kindly
by Mr. W. W. Symons, manager of the Poltesco Marble Works,
we are ready to admit that the serpentine rock of that district
occurs both as interstratified and intersecting masses.
    On the east side of Poltesco Cove there is a hard heavy rock
in well-marked thick beds, composed of darkish green and
greyish alternating laminae lying strictly parallel with the
planes of bedding, and porphyritic through the presence of
innumerable disformed crystals of a kind hereafter to be de
scribed. The green laminae consist of impure serpentine, ap
parently highly aluminous; and the grey ones are seemingly an

intimate mixture of felspathic and quartzy matter. The laminae
are regular, even, and widely continuous, so that they have
   uite the appearance of having resulted from sedimentation.
   n the other hand, there are places in the neighbourhood,
especially on the shore between Poltesco and Kenwick Cove,
where a rock, essentially serpentine, encloses separated masses,
in beds, of semimetamorphosed sandstones and argillites, the
 latter possessing the character of imperfect hornblende schists.
                                                                                 º
     These no doubt would be “embarrassing” cases to De la Beche;
 but now that important discoveries connected with serpentine
 have of late years been made, they cease to be such any longer.
 Hence we shall adopt the opinion (fully confirmed by our own
 researches in ophite) entertained by some of the              mine
 ralogists and mineralogical chemists (Bischof, Dana, G. Rose,
  Blum, Haidinger, and others), and disputed by only one autho

porphyritic pyroxenic rock (a hard wackite) of Bufaure in the
Val di Fassa, Tyrol, which contains crystals of pyroxene of the
average size of the Cornish                        is a still nearer
counterpart.    It must also be borne in mind that at Monzoni,
in the same   region,  porphyritic pyroxenite passes into serpen
tine rocks, some of which contain crystals in various stages of
pseudomorphism, ending in perfect serpentine.
   The Lizard serpentine is not characterized with many struc
tural varieties or allomorphs. Chrysotile, which is the only
one we are acquainted with, does not occur to any extent.

                                Serpentinite       of the Lizard.                              285
tions of the zigzag edge and the two limbs of the ridges strictly
correspond with the two cleavages above mentioned.         Obvi
ously, then, there is an intimate connexion between these three
formations; and no one can observe the ridges without feeling
convinced that they were once integral portions of the adjacent
mass of saponite, also that the presence of calcite in the inter
mediate spaces is an interpolated phenomenon.      Moreover, on
further consideration another conclusion irresistibly forces
itself into notice—that the intermediate spaces were once oc
cupied with saponite, which, having been removed, has under
       replacement by the calcite now occupying them. As in
#"
the case of an outlying reef of rock that has been separated
from the mainland by the gradual removal of an intermediate
mass of rock, and the latter replaced by the sand now occupy
º    the denuded space, so it must have been with the outlying
ridges of saponite and the calcitic interspaces.
    t may be suggested with regard to the latter interspaces,
that they are the result of cracks, widened by some cause or
other, and subsequently filled up with a deposition of calcite;
but this is completely disproved by their being shaped like the
ridges.    The portion corresponding with, say, the downward
limb of the ridges might be produced by a widened crack; but
in such a case the origin of the other or transverse portion must
be the same.      Again, the slightest reflection on the integrity,
relative  position, and uninterrupted connexion of the two Timbs
of the ridges must deprive the suggestion of every probability.
   Guided by what we have very frequently observed in ophite
(clearly leading to the conclusion that serpentine has been gra
dually replaced by calcite), we have no hesitation in offering,
in general terms, the same explanation for the case under
notice”.
   * We would suggest the following as
the particular way in which it may have
been produced.         As the saponite is in
termittently cleared, it is consequently
liable to be disintegrated or decomposed
here and there where the cleavage is pre

   In some other specimens collected at Kynance Cove the sa
ponite encloses calcite on a small scale. It is only by immer
sing the specimens in a weak solution of hydrochloric acid and
examining them with a magnifier that they can be seen to con
tain here and there patches and strings of this mineral.   The
vacant spaces resulting from decalcification are often crowded
with projecting configurations of saponite, presenting every
variety of form, including regular-shaped aciculae, and no end
in shape of arborescences.
   The aciculae, pretty uniform in length and thickness, occa
sionally form a regular layer investing the wall of saponite
bounding a piece of calcite; and they may be in immediate
contact, or separated by thin interspaces filled with calcite.
In the latter condition they line one side of a fissure in the
case represented in fig. 12.   In their parallelism, as well as
every feature, these aciculae of saponite, it will be seen, differ
in nothing except their substance from those which characte
rize the acicular modification of chrysotile occurring in certain
ophites, and forming the so-called “nummuline layer of Eozoon
canadense”     +.
  The arborescences may be simple, or highly complex—large,
or small.   Fig. 13 represents a medium example—which, it

 Soit   happens that, besides the fossils  in   the “limestones” particularized
being converted into calcite, the interstices    in these rocks contain the same
mineral, which,     in the form ofa    calcareous solution, had infiltrated itself
into them.       But obviously neither the crystallized fossils, nor the calcitic
infiltrations, have any analogy with the “pastes, magmas,                      or

   Occasionally the saponite assumes an oolitic structure, pre
senting spherical grains which closely resemble the ova of a
fish. Fig. 14 represents a cluster of them, nestling as it were
in  a recess, as if they had been purposely or instinctively placed
there, and had afterwards got covered up with a calcareous de
posit. Many of the grains are in contact; others are isolatedly
imbedded in the transparent calcite remaining undissolved
after partial decalcification.
    The saponite in the mass also presents appearances as if it
contained organisms, entire and in fragments, distinguished by
their comparative opacity in some cases and translucency in
others, as in fig. 15. These are vermicular bodies—straight,

be readily taken for fossil corals of the genus Stenopora; and
some resemble certain Carboniferous                   Permian species so
closely that a consideration of structural characters alone does
not enable one to differentiate them from the organisms they
simulate.
    The spheres have also a strikingly organic appearance.
Some specimens resemble, when a few are clustered together,
certain foraminifers—notably             Rotalia and Globigerina (fig.
 19"); while others in an isolated state have the resemblance
of Orbulinas.        Nay, have we not an appearance of actualities
 of the latter   represented    in fig. 20? As shown in this figure,

Again, where the prismatic structure is well defined, the
prisms, especially if they are large, have their interior in the
same condition".        These differences are clearly assignable to
different degrees of fibrous and prismatic development.
    Why some fasciculi are unlimitedly divided by which they
are made eminently fibrous—why some are formed of well-defined
prisms, and others, instead of being fibrous or prismatic, are en
*
tirely amorphous—we shall make no attempt to explain; but it
may be remarked, with some confidence, that the ovoids resem
        Stenopora are each a fasciculus of prisms with their interior
in the amorphous condition. The remarkable appearance of
empty tubules in the ovoids that are finely prismatic we assume
to be caused by the interior of the prisms being imperfectly
illuminated: opaque walls would necessarily intercept the light
in    its
        passage into the interior                       of
                                         such small prisms.
    With   respect     the  spheres,
                              to      we would suggest that they are
 each the   nucleus,      amorphousin  serpentine,      mass    radia     of   a            of
 ting prismatic tremolite; that the prisms radiated from and
 originated            on
                  the surface     the nuclei, and were characterized
                                                  of
 by opaque walls and translucent interior; that

A, and the increment B of the moment from the first to the
last impulse.
     The magnetization by induction-currents, on the other hand,
is very well represented, he says, by the formula
                                y=A+B (1-e-*),             .    .   .   . (2)
where A, B, and a are constants, A the moment originally
present, B the total increment produced by the action of the
force, and e the base of the natural system of logarithms.
 This formula corresponds to a much quicker increase of the
residual magnetism than the first.
     While M. Bouty is inclined to deduce the difference of the
 formulae from the difference of the methods of magnetization,
 I  should rather, judging from the examples he adduces, seek
 them in the different initial magnetic states of the steel needles.
 Two of his examples may serve as evidence:—

      While, then, in the first instance the little bar had no initial
  magnetism (was “innocent of any previous magnetization"),
  and at the conclusion possessed the residual magnetism 57-75,
  in the second the initial magnetism was 71-55, which was
  raised by the action of the magnetizing force to 81'05 only.
  But then, according to the proposition previously advanced,

  markable result that, with freshly annealed bars, the residual
  moment R, attained by an impulse a stands in an invariable
   ratio to the moment of saturation R, independent of the dimen
  sions of the bars, their hardness, and the strength of the force
   acting upon them. Now my experiments seem to prove that

but probably mutually complementary.
  For reasons easily conceivable, which need not further
discuss,      it cannot well            be assumed that the ratio
                                                                      I

to diminish till it arrives at zero ; much rather it is not im—
probable that, as the magnetizing force goes on increasing, the
ratio begins to rise again.             M. Bouty, however, worked with
                             I
very thin, while worked with tolerably thick steel bars; and
hence it really follows that in his, in comparison with my ob
servations, much greater magnetizing forces were in play. At
all   events the subject             well deserving

  But similar       questions       thosetorespecting   the residual, can now
  be   put concerning the temporary magnetism. Here three
  cases are        to   distinguished.
                        be
     The    first,  simplest,      that is          of
                                             repeated magnetization          the                  by
  same     current,    which,   however,     has never previously acted                                   on
  the rod      (§  9). The question is:—Does the temporary magne

tism, like the residual, increase with each successive impulse,
remain constant, or diminish?
    In order to contribute to a correct judgment on the degree
of accuracy which an answer to such questions concerning the
temporary magnetism can possess,           I would remark that the
latter, as is well known, may fluctuate, always within certain
but, with soft iron, tolerably wide limits, even when the cur
rent is constant.
    Nevertheless, on the ground of numerous experiments,               I
believe     I may assert that The temporary magnetism of a steel
bar diminishes on the bar being repeatedly magnetized by a con
stant current, but so that the total magnetism remains unaltered;
therefore what is gained in residual, is lost in temporary mag
netism.
    The second case has been already treated in § 11.               We
there had the same ellipsoid in different magnetic states, with
different RM, submitted to the same force; and we inquired
how the magnetization-function behaves with an increasing
                                         .
permanent magnetization.          To this question we could make
no definite answer; k, and with it the temporary magnetism,
in part remained constant, in part increased, and in part even
diminished.
    From this it is now evident that an answer to the third case,
#.       by the last preceding section, cannot but be extremely
  ifficult.    In fact, on making some experiments, I obtained
                                                   sometimes smaller
contradictory results, sometimes
temporary moments, while the residual magnetism, in accord
ance with the proposition advanced in § 14, always proved
greater.

 The first    that which occurs when the exhaustion

this layer  the air throughout the greater part of the chamber
 will be very  slightly denser and warmer than before the ad
justment.     There will also be another layer of varying tem
 perature and density in contact with the glass, having on
 one side the temperature of the air in the little chamber,
 and on the other the somewhat lower temperature of the
    lass. This is the state which will come into existence during
the  adjustment,   and which will then continue as the permanent
state of affairs so long as the disk and glass are maintained at
their respective temperatures. While this is the condition of
the apparatus, there would be no transfer of heat from the disk
to the glass if convection-currents were absent: the contrivance.
cannot act as a heat-engine; and there is accordingly no pres
sure of the kind which Mr. Crookes has detected, and to which
I  would suggest that we should give the name of Crookes's
pressure.                                                        -
    13. On the other hand, if the exhaustion be carried further,
the layers of varying temperature in contact with the disk and
with the glass will become thicker; and if the exhaustion pro
 ceed sufficiently far, these layers will be so dilated that there
will not be room between the disk and the glass for their full
development; and then will arise the state of things in which
 Crookes's pressure presents itself. The following description
                                                                     iº

ference in the state of things behind the disk; but it will cause
a new adjustment to be necessary in front.              In fact the part
of the gradient which lies outside the sphere will cease to exist,
since there is nothing now to prevent air of the same pressure
and density as in the rest of the apartment from coming quite
up to the sphere. Accordingly, when the little instant of ad
justment is over, this will be the state of things outside the
 sphere. Hence, when the adjustment is over, there will be n
 molecules flying inwards through every square centimetre of

                         molecules passing one way as the other.
 Hence we find that after the adjustment, n molecules per
 second must come up to every square centimetre of the inside
 of this hemisphere and demand an exit through                    which                      it,               is

value of this fraction      will scarcely differ from unity when p
      º,    Iºw        Lºw of an atmosphere. Using these values
becomes            Or
for          we can compute by the foregoing formula how much
the front of the disk would need to be warmer than the rest
of the apparatus at these several tensions, to produce a Crookes's
pressure of the hundredth of a milligramme per square centi
metre, which is an amount Mr. Crookes observed.
    24. We thus find that if there were no convection-current we
should produce this pressure by                     the front of the disk
                                         warming
about 0.09 of a degree at a tension of fºo of an atmosphere,
while     an elevation of 0:6 of a - degree would be- required at a
       -        I                             O                   — —
tension of Rio, and an elevation of 6° at a tension of Toºwo of
an atmosphere. This last excess of temperature may be looked
upon as inadmissible, since it is not likely that the front of the
disk is ever so much as 6° warmer than the back. Hence we
         I
may, think, conclude that where Crookes's pressure is con
spicuously * present, the exhaustion does not approach the
millionth of an atmospheref.
     25. The probability seems to be that the effects of convection
currents are sufficiently feeble at tensions between <U+017F>ºo and
wº        of an atmosphere for      us to fix on some tension between
these    limits as the tension at which we are likely to find the
 greatest apparent effects, i. e. the greatest excess of Crookes's
 pressure over the resultant of the forces due to convection
currents.
    * It must, however, be remembered that a force very much less than
 the hundredth of a milligramme per square centimetre would manifest
 itself by causing motion in a radiometer.
    f  This would afford a means of ascertaining whether there is any re
 sidual effect not accounted for by the foregoing explanation, if we might
 depend on the methods by which very low tensions are determined.        But
 it is evident that a gas which can be occluded in any of the solids present,
 or absorbed in any liquid, or condensed upon the surface of either, or any
 trace of vapour which either the solids or liquids can give off, will at a
 certain point of tenuity elude detection. . All direct methods are on this
 account so untrustworthy that    I should be disposed to think that low
 tensions may be best estimated by observing the amount of torsion
 which the Crookes's pressure in them can give to a fibre of glass or silk,
 and comparing    it with             in § 22, using unity for      when the
                          the formula                          ***
 tension is excessively low.    A gauge might easily be constructed     upon
 this principle.

  The relationships of position seem to be primarily dependent
upon the properties of elastic media. In such media, as the
distances from a centre of force increase in arithmetical pro
  ression, the densities decrease, in geometrical progression if
   e central force is constant, in harmonic progression if the
central force varies inversely as the square of the distance. In
the earliest stages of nucleal aggregation, when particles are
subjected to nearly equal impulses from every direction, but
with a slight preponderance towards special nucleal centres,
the variations from constancy of force may be so slight as to
introduce a geometrical progression ; and if those tendencies
occur when the contest between the aggregating and dissocia
ting forces is the strongest, the ratio           progression should                    #.

see a circle an inch in diameter as a circle ; but an ordinary eye
could see it in a good light at a considerably greater distance, and
Saturn with an apparent diameter of about 15" is distinctly visible
on a clear night. On p. 26 we read that “the force of rotation of
a globe like the earth, nearly 8000 miles in diameter, and spinning
round at the rate of more than 17 miles a minute, is quitº sufficient
to render the position of     axis incapable     to its

  Two platinum wires were attached to the ends of a small
bar of tellurium, about 1 inch in length, by heating the wires to
a bright red heat and bringing them suddenly into contact, one with
each end of the bar. The platinum wires melted a small portion
of the tellurium, and became imbedded in         The resistance                       it.                                     of

been  exposed to light for seven days, the tellurium was found
to be much more sensitive. When exposed at a distance of about
half a metre, as before, to the paraffin-lamp the needle was gra
dually deflected through 30 divisions of the scale, showing that
the resistance of the tellurium was now diminished as much with
out interposing the beaker of water as it had previously been when
the beaker was interposed. On making no change whatever, except
placing the beaker of water between the lamp and the tellurium,
so as to focus the light on the tellurium, the deflection of the needle
gradually increased to 80 and then more slowly to 100 divisions.
On balancing this deflection, it was found that, to bring the needle
to zero, it was necessary to diminish the slide-resistance by 400
millims. Thus the diminution produced in the resistance by expo
sure to the light of the paraffin-lamp was girth of the whole re
sistance of the tellurium.
   On exposing the selenium bar used in my experiments to the
direct rays of the same paraffin-lamp at the distance of 1 metre,
the resistance of the selenium was diminished by one fifth of                                                                    its

    Osborne Reynolds, Owens College, Manchester.
       This paper may be said to consist of two divisions.          The first
    contains an account of some experiments and observations under
    taken with a view to ascertain how far the refraction of sound caused
    by the upward variation of temperature may be the cause of the
    difference in the distances to which sounds of the same intensity
    may be heard at different times.
        Some rockets, capable of rising 1000 feet and then exploding a
    cartridge containing 12 oz. of powder, having been procured, an
    effort was made to compare the distance at which the rockets could

ample time for the formation in mountain-regions of deep valleys,
down which, during the Glacial epoch, glaciers would take their
course.      He noticed the evidence of this local glaciation furnished
by the striation of the Welsh mountains, from which he inferred
that these mountains as a whole were not overridden by a great
ice-sheet coming from the north, and he described the course of the
glaciers flowing from the north-west slopes of Snowdonia as being
in the directions west, north-west, and north. These glaciers,
however, did not reach the region now occupied by the Menai Straits,
but spread out in broad fans on the north-western slopes of the hills
now overlooking the Straits—a fact indicated by the directions of
the glacial striae in these parts.       Anglesey, therefore, was not
glaciated by ice-masses coming from Snowdonia; and as the stria
tions on that island point directly towards the mountains of Cum
 berland, the author inferred that these markings were produced by
 a great ice-flow coming from that region, reinforced probably by
 ice-streams from the north of Scotland, an- which were large and
 powerful enough to present the glaciers of Llanberis and Nant
 ffrancon from encroaching on the te ritory of Anglesey.
     The author described the rocks bordering the Straits as consisting
 of nearly horizontal Carboniferous strata, which, from appearances,
 must once have filled the whole of the region now occupied by the
 straits. He considered that the softer shaly, sandy, and marly beds,
 remains of some of which a e still to be seen on the coast, were
  swept away by the action of the great glacier coming from the
 north-east, forming a valley now occupied by the sea; and in sup
 port of this view he cited the valley of Malldraeth Marsh, running
 across Anglesey, parallel to that of the Menai Straits, about 4 miles
 to the north-west, which a very slight change in conditions would
 convert into a fjord, differing from the Straits only in being closed
 at the north-east end.

     1. “On the Greenstones of Western Cornwall.”         By John Arthur
  Phillips, Esq., F.G.S., F.C.S.
     In  this paper the author brought forward     evidence to show that
  the so-called   “greenstones”    of Penzance really belong chiefly to
 the following three classes:—

328                          Geological   Society:-
     a. Gabbros or Dolerites, in which the originally constituent
minerals are either to a great extent unchanged, or, sometimes,
almost entirely represented by pseudomorphic forms.
     b. Killas, or ordinary clay-slates.
     c. Highly basic hornblendic rocks, exhibiting a tendency to break
into thin plates; these under the microscope present the appearance
of metamorphosed slates.
     Slavy rocks of a char...eter intermediate between b and c also occur.
     In the Cape-Cornwall district the “greenstones” are chiefly
hornblendic slates, sometimes with veins or bands of garnet, mag
netite, or aximite. The rocks near the Gurnard's Head are almost
identical with those of Mount's Bay. The crystalline pyroxenie
rocks and metamorphic slates of the St.-Ives district exactly re
semble those of Penzance. The greenstones between St. Erth and
St. Stephen's are probably altered ash-beds or hardened hornblendie
slates:     unlike the hornblendic and augitic rocks of the other
districts, they do not occur in the immediate vicinity of granite; but
elvan courses are always found near them. The percentage of
 silica in the two series of rocks is nearly constant: the hornblende
slates contain about 10 per cent. less silica than the crystalline
 pyroxenic rocks; and there is an excess of iron oxides to nearly the
same extent, their composition in other respects being very similar.
The Killas is an acidic rock of essentially different chemical com
position.
     2. “On Columnar, Fissile, and Spheroidal Structure.”            By the
 Rev. T. G.    Bonney,   M.A.,    F.G.S.
     Some of the above structures have comparatively recently been
discussed by Mr. Mallet and Professor J. Thomson.               Both these
authors agree in attributing columnar structure to contraction due to
loss of heat while cooling, but differ in their explanation of cross
jointing and spheroidal structure.          In this paper it is sought to
 show that the principle proved by Mr. Mallet to be the explanation
of the columnar structure is capable of a wider application. After a
 brief notice of some instances of columnar structure, the author
 described cases of a fissile structure seen in certain igneous rocks
 (especially in the Auvergne phonolites), closely resembling true
 cleavage, and often mistaken for it—also the tabular jointing of
 rocks, a peculiar form of this where most of the segments are of a
 flattened convexo-concave form, spheroidal structure, and cup-and
 ball structure.       He showed by examples that Prof. Thomson's
 explanation of spheroidal structure was inadequate, and gave reasons
 for considering all these structures to be due to contraction.          He
 also discussed more     particularly   the cup-and-ball  structure, giving
reasons for thinking that the spheroidal and the horizontal fissures
were often to some extent independent of each other.

     1. “On the influence of various substances in accelerating the
precipitation of Clay suspended in water.”         By Wm. Ramsay, Esq.,
Principal Assistant in Glasgow University Laboratory.

 Mr. Ramsay     on the Precipitation   of Clay suspended in Water. 329
    The author referring to the fact that clay when suspended in
 water in excessively minute particles, settles more rapidly when the
 water contains salts in solution, noticed the opinions expressed by
previous writers on the subject, and gave the results of experiments
 made by him, from which it would appear that the rapidity of pre
cipitation is proportionate to the amount of heat absorbed by the
salts in process of solution.        By another series of experiments
 he found that the    fluidity of the respective solutions had apparently
 no influence on the      rapidity of deposition of the clay. He also
found that clay is deposited less quickly in acid solutions than in
 solutions of salts, and more rapidly in a solution of caustic soda
than in one of caustic potash.          In solutions of common salt of
different strengths he found that clay settled in the inverse order of
their specific gravities.     From all these results the author is    in
clined to attribute the varying rapidity of the settling of clay sus
pended in saline solutions to the varying absorption of heat by the
solutions.    When water containing suspended clay was heated, the
rapidity of the settling of the clay was proportionate to the heat of
the water. The author suggests that the increased rapidity of set
tlement may be due to the greater amplitude of vibration of the
molecules of water when heated; the vibrations being performed in
equal times, particles descending at right angles to the plane of
vibration will experience less resistance from the molecules of water.
   A note by Prof. Ramsay, briefly indicating some of the geological
bearings of these results, was appended to the paper.
   2.  “On    some   Fossiliferous  Cambrian    Shales  near Carnarvon.”
By J. E. Marr, Esq.,
    The shales described by the author extend from about three miles
S.W. of Carnarvon to Bangor, running nearly parallel to the Menai
Straits. They are faulted against Lower Cambrian to the east, and
disappear against a dyke on the west. The shales vary from greyish
black to bluish black in colour, and are generally sandy and mica
ceous, but in places chiefly clayey.         Fossils were obtained from
three places on the banks of the Seiont—namely, near Point Seiont
(where the beds are concretionary in structure), along the old tram
way from Carnarvon to Wanttle, and near Peblig Bridge. The first
named locality is richest in fossils; and here there is a greenstone
dyke, parallel to the bedding of the rock, and altering the shales for
a distance of about four yards from the edge of the dyke.            The
fossils seem to indicate that the deposit belongs to the upper part    of
the Arenig group.
   3.  “On   the occurrence of the Rhaetic Beds near Leicester.”      By
W.   J. Harrison, Esq., F.G.S., Curator   of the Town Museum, Leicester.
   The sections described by the author are shown in brick-pits in
the Spinney Hills, forming the eastern boundary of the town of
Leicester, and in the Crown Hill on the eastern side of a valley
excavated by the Willow Brook. In the latter locality they are
capped by Lower Lias. They have a slight dip to the south-east.
The brick-pits show a thickness of about 30 feet of Rhaetic          beds

and volatilize them again a dozen times in contact with the same
mass of gas, without the appearance of the spark which exploded
between the electrodes being modified in the slightest degree.                                             I
made use of the Holtz machine, or an induction-coil with the addi
tion of a Leyden jar: the space between the poles was rosy violet,
and gave the grooved spectrum with the utmost purity.               When
the disruptive spark of the Holtz machine is employed, the jet of
rosy-violet flame, which gives the grooved spectrum, is instan
taneous; we can assure ourselves of this by a very simple method:
the luminous jet is viewed through the glass wheel of the machine,
on which little black points are traced with ink. Now these points
appeared perfectly distinct, even when the handle made sixty turns
in a minute; we can hence infer that the discharge does not last a
thirty-thousandth of a second.
    2. By volatilization the sodium can be readily brought into the
vicinity of the electrodes. It presents itself then, as always, under
the aspect of very pure silvery white shining globules; but if the
tube be brought into play, the portions submitted to the action of
the   jet   offlame tarnish immediately: the metallic appearance

     The lines described by M. Schuster * have not been found again
by    MM. Stearn and Wüllner, who, after verifying the disappear
ance of the band spectrum, saw the well-known spectrum appºar
of the oxide of carbon or acetylene.              Schuster's tubes more care
fully prepared gave me, after a certain time, the bright lines of
hydrogen only. What, then, was the origin of the lines described
in the memoir of 1872? It is permissible to attribute them to the
vapour of sodium.
     In fact, we remark that the published numbers were not got by
direct measurement, but refer to the nitrogen lines of Plücker's
spectrum which appear to coincide with the lines observed; and
these, moreover, are not the most characteristic.               Now, if sodium
 be heated in a Geissler tube, or in an apparatus like that described
in $1, and the spark be made to pass, a bright greenish yellow light
 is produced, the spectrum of which is composed of the following
 lines:—                      Spectrum of sodium.
                       615-5 double . . . . . . . . . . 515-3

                       568-7    ,,     . . . . . . . . . . 467
      These numbers are       very   near those of M. Schuster; only the
  line 498.3 does not      figure   in his Plate, it is replaced by 489.4.
  Conversely, we find in that Plate three extreme lines—628-8,
  421-4, and 418-4, which        I have not been able to produce, nor are
  they indicated by MM. Thalén and Lecoq de Boisbaudran.                      A
  curious thing, these lines nearly coincide with the characteristic
  lines of rubidium (629-6, 421-6, and 420-2).               I would not by any
  means say that this metal was present in M. Schuster's sodium,
  especially with the uncertainty of the wave-lengths; but in any
  case it must very readily give a spectrum in a Geissler tube; for
  potassium offers much better facilities for this kind of experiments
   than sodium. It furnishes, without difficulty, a very pure spectrum,
  of which the principal lines are the following:—
                             Spectrum of potassium.
                  583           535-3              511         404'4

      It   must   be possible,   employing the same method, but under
   slightly different conditions of experiment, to produce not only the
   secondary spectra of the alkali-metals, as we have done in the
   present researches, but also their primary spectra, for the inter
   esting discovery of which we are indebted to Messrs. Roscoe and
   Schuster.—Comptes        Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences, vol. lxxxii.

   ON CERTAIN REMARKABLE POINTS IN MAGNETS. BY R. BLONDLOT.
       If a very short magnetic needle, the centre of gravity of which
   is  supported,   be brought near the surface of a magnet, the direction
                        * Pogg. Ann. vol. cxlvii. p. 106.

334                  Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
of the needle is seen to vary at the same time as the coordinates of
its centre of rotation.  Among these directions there are some re
markable ones to which we would call attention—namely, those
normal to the surface of the magnet.    For the sake of brevity, we
will give to the points to which they correspond the name of ortho
gonal points.
   To take an example, let us consider a magnetized bar having the
form of a rectangular parallelepiped; on each half of the bar we
shall find five orthogonal points:–one on the terminal face, at the
point where the magnetic axis meets it; and one on each of the
four lateral faces, situated on the right line joining the centres of
the short sides of this face, the last four points being symmetrical,
two and two.
   Around each of the points we are considering, the directions are
such that, reckoning from the surface of the magnet inwards, they
are always convergent in any plane drawn through the normal.
   A first property of orthogonal points is the following:—
  If  a small magnetic body be placed on an orthogonal point, more me
chanical work will be requisite, in order to remove the small body thence
to infinity, than if it had been placed on any other neighbouring point
of the surface of the magnet. In other terms, the orthogonal point
                                                                                      i.
presents a marimum of the work above-mentioned.
   The demonstration of this theorem is very simple.
   With respect to terrestrial magnetism, the orthogonal           of the
surface of the earth are what are somewhat improperly called the mag
netic poles. Halley and Hansteen believed in the existence of four
of these poles; Gauss and Duperrey admit only two, or, more pre
cisely, two polar regions.    Parry, John Ross, James Ross, Dumont
d'Urville, and Wilke were able to determine approximately their
positions.
   On a given line, also, points possessing the same property of
maximum of work of removal to infinity are found ; they are those
for which the magnetic action is normal to the curve.
   We will remark that                 all
                              these marima presented          orthogonal             by

ratios    of
           curvature with the surfaces       equal potential.

ON THE METALLIC REDUCTIONS                              PRODUCED IN CAPILLARY SPACES.
                                           BY M. BECQUEREL.
   When a cracked tube containing a concentrated metallic solution
(of nitrate of copper or chloride of cobalt for example) is dipped
into a solution of monosulphide of sodium, if the crack is not suf
ficiently narrow, diffusion is produced, giving rise to the production
of metallic sulphide in the solution of copper or cobalt; this sulphide
forms a coat adhering pretty strongly to the glass; and then by
degrees a denosit of bright metal is seen to form in the molecular
space between the coat of sulphide and the glass, on the side of the
metallic solution.
    Similar effec's are produced by applying to the crack, outside the
tube, a strip of paper covered with a layer of freshly precipitated
sulphide, fixing it to the surface by means of a wire wound round
it.   Cobalt, copper, platinum, &c. have thus been obtained             the                            in
metallic state; the first was attracted        the magnet.     by

  ON THE CHEMICAL ACTIONS PRODUCED BY THE DISCHARGES
     FROM AN INDUCTION.—APPARATUS. BY M. BECQUEREL.
    The memoir commences by recalling the experiments of Wollas
ton on the decomposition of water by the electricity from the ordi
nary electrical machine, as well as those made by Faraday for the
purpose of rendering sensible the decomposition of salts, when he
sought solely to make evident the presence of acids and bases by
aid of test-papers.
    With a Ruhmkorff induction-apparatus,          which gives a much
more   rapid succession of sparks  than the  ordinary   electrical machine,
more marked effects are obtained.      The  arrangement       have adopted I
to exhibit them is the   following:—Taking      a plate   of  gutta percha
on which was    placed  a small   slip of  platinuin   in communication
with the positive pole of the apparatus by means of a metallic stem,
I  applied to this slip of platinum a strip of paper moistened with a
metallic solution (copper or silver), and then to the paper the point
                                                                It was not
of a platinum wire connected with the negative
long before the metal was seen depositing around the point in ad      ".
herent layers.    On a slip of platinum being placed between the
paper and the point of this metal, it likewise became coated with a
thin layer of metal. Submitting to experiment successively various
solutions, the apparatus operating with only two chronic-acid
                ..
couples, and sometimes with four,             I
                                         thus obtained the reduction of
copper, nickel, cobalt, iron, lead, bismuth, antimony, zinc, cadmium,
silver, gold, and platinum.
     I
     likewise          myself to the formation of amalgams by aid
of the same apparatus, following the method which Davy employed,
with the pile, to obtain the amalgams of potassium, sodium, and
other metals.      On a slip of platinum which was brought into
contact with the positive pole of the apparatus                   I
                                                         placed a piece of
caustic   potass slightly  moistened,  and introduced into a small cavity
in   its          drop      mercury
                            of          contact with the point         pla          of

    The  copper-amalgam     was obtained           by

coming into contact with an anvil in electrical connexion with
the support of the lever l, allows the charge of the accumu
lator to leak partially away through m and r until the pointer,
i, rotating with the disk, strikes l from m to n, thereby stop
ping further discharge through r, and putting the accumulator
to the galvanometer, which indicates the remaining electricity, e.

     In employing this system have found that there are certain
precautions which it is necessary to               in view. In the first
 place, it is desirable, in taking the readings of the excursions
 of the needle, to so adjust the resistance-wire that the value of
 c is not too nearly the same as that of the initial charge C.
 When they are nearly of the same value, a very slight error of
 observation makes a material error in the result, because the
 difference of their logarithms may increase or decrease much
 more rapidly than the numbers themselves.                 On the other
hand, the proportion between C and c should not be too great;
 in other words, the accumulator should not be too empty when
 its  reduced charge        observed. The electricity which flows
                                is
 from  a  battery into           an
                             accumulator (assumed                perfectly     to    be

     My first machine with ebonite disks dates from the year 1873.

stance; and, as far as                     I could         consult different periodicals,                           I
have found no mention                           of a true Holtz machine with disks of
ebonite.    Ebonite (a mechanical mixture of india-rubber and
sulphur) has many advantages for this purpose, which glass
can but rarely offer. It is capable of developing much more
electricity, and readily becomes electric ; it is much less hy
groscopic, and, especially with regard to the boring of the
apertures in the disk, is cheaper. Here may also be added that
no part of the apparatus is liable to be broken. Yet unfavour
able properties must be noticed, which are well known to
experimenters with this substance. It tends slowly to alter
 itscomposition, especially     exposed       the solar rays
                                                 if                  to

sulphuric acid, and the insulating properties are destroyed.
But mayit       observed here that some qualities
                       be                                  ebonite are                       of

has a diameter of 35 centims, and the two rotating ones 30

terminates in a spheroid) a stream of sparks is produced, with

sparks pass from one to the other electrode at a distance of 10

      The ebonite electromachines, when constructed with
     1.
ebonite of good quality, are at least equal to the best machines
with glass disks in regard to their action; but they s
them by their relatively small expense, nonfrangibility, and
permanent electric condition.
  2. The double electromachine constructed by me is a very
powerful arrangement for producing electricity in great quan
tity, as well as of great tension.
   3. The substitution of ebonite for glass disks not only de
serves attention because the usefulness is enhanced, but also
because new data are acquired, which may be of great interest
for the complete theory of electromachines.

                         from solutions of Salts below 0°C.
                    many determinations have been made of the

tures ranging   from 0°C. to the temperature of ebullition of
the saturated salt solution.     To Gay-Lussac, to Kremers, to
Regnault, and others are due several series of exact determi
nations in this direction of research.   But the examination of
the phenomena     of solidification which take place in salts of
certain strengths at temperatures below 0° C. has suffered
comparative, almost complete, neglect.      And this appears to
have arisen partly from the circumstance that it has been
                                                                    .
asserted by some philosophers, and denied by others entitled
to equal respect, that when a solution of a salt below 0°C.
begins to solidify by loss of heat, the solid formed is pure ice.
It has been my privilege to reconcile the opposing views by
the discovery of               |.
                     fact which trust now to     I    ully estab
lished, that when a salt solution which is already any fraction
of a degree below 0°C. is cooled, one of three things must
happen ; and which of them happens is determined with the
same salt by the strength of the solution.
    1. In         all
            solutions weaker than the cryohydrate,ice    formed,          is
at  temperatures which are lower according        the solution      as              is
richer
          In in
          salt.
     2.               certain strength (namely that
              solutions         of   a                 the cryo          of
hydrate), combination                    of
                          the salt and water take place     defi               in
nite ratio and    constant temperature.
                         at   a           The solution    there               is
fore   melted cryohydrate, and solidifies
          a                                   whole,           as
                                                                a

                               and Attached Water.                               355
    3. When solutions stronger than the cryohydrate, below 0°
C., are cooled, either the anhydrous salt or some hydrate richer
in salt than the cryohydrate separates.
    It follows        that the cryohydrate may, and indeed must inevi
tably be reached both by cooling a solution weaker           than the
cryohydrate (ice separates, the solution strengthens,        the tem
perature sinks), and by cooling a solution stronger          than the
cryohydrate (anhydrous salt or a hydrate richer than                     the    cryo
hydrate separates, the solution weakens, the temperature sinks).
Assuming as a fact that which will be abundantly proved,
namely, that every salt which is soluble above 0°C. is also
soluble below 0°C. (we shall see that there is even no quanti
                                                               §,
tative discontinuity at 0°C. in the solubility), it follows immedi
                                            n.
ately that a solution of any degree of strength whatever gives
rise on cooling, sooner or          to a liquid           remains unso
lidified until the proper ratio and temperature is reached, and
then solidifies in that constant ratio and at that constant tem
perature.      From a solution of the strength of the cryohydrate
                                                               º,
nothing separates until the proper temperature is reached.
And then, however rapid the absorption of heat may be, the
temperature never sinks lower until solidification is complete.

                propose in the present communication (1) to trace
§º
the history of solutions weaker than the cryohydrates as they
   ield ice on cooling, and (2) to examine the separation of an
            salts or hydrates richer than the                      when
solutions richer than the cryohydrate are cooled. With regard
to the first of these branches of inquiry, the only experiments

in this direction which have described are those relating to
chloride of sodium in § 10, and those concerning spirits of
wine in § 96.
     A solution of a salt below 0°C. which is stronger than the
cryohydrate, may be viewed as a solution in the
either of a hydrate richer than the cryohydrate or of the anhy
drous salt. A solution of a salt below 0°C. which is weaker
 than the cryohydrate may be properly regarded as a solution
 of ice in the cryohydrate. A solution of chloride of sodium

358                       Frederick Guthrie on Salt Solutions
against supersaturation.      The notion that in order to start the
crystallization of a supersaturated solution crystals must be
present in the air identical in chemical kind with those ready
to be formed in the solution, seems to be disproved by the fact
that supersaturation in regard to ice is of the very commonest
occurrence.      In many cases a salt solution which should yield
ice at a temperature —tº refuses to do so until –(tº-F 5° or 6°)
is reached; then ice-crystals are formed through the mass and
the temperature rises. Although we may indeed imagine ice
crystals to be floating in the air about the surface of the cryo
gen, we can scarcely conceive these microscopic crystals to
travel unmelted through the surrounding air, which may be at
19° or 15°C., so as to reach the liquid. And if it be argued
that the origin of the ice-crystals may be at or near the surface
of the salt solution in the experimental tube, reply that crys                   I
tallization from a supersaturated solution occurs both when it is
                                       on oil

differ more than 0.3 per cent.         For the determination of the
temperatures above 0° C. at which salts and their hydrates

chlorine as chloride of silver. There is such little difference

position at intermediate temperatures. There is no evidence
of the formation of any other hydrate than the one usually
regarded as containing six molecules of water. On account

are here concerned at the maximum,        have less confidence in            I

till —6°5,    when the   opaque     cryohydrate       is formed. The solu
tion, however, is particularly prone to double supersaturation.
A solution may sometimes be cooled to —8°; and during this,
while the crystals of the nitrate fall, ice-crystals are formed
which float. By and by the true cryohydrate is formed on the
side of the glass; and     ãº     both separate crystallizations cease.
This double     supersaturation     is entirely prevented by introdu
cing a fragment of the previously formed cryohydrate into the
mother-liquor which is being further cooled. The temperature
                                                                            –
remains then constant at –6°-6 to the last drop.                        e final
crop being remelted gave, on analysis, the following results
14:3538 grms. gave 6'9442 grims. of AgNO3, or 48:38 per cent.
of AgNO3 in the cryohydrate. The cryohydrate has Accordingly
the composition AgNO3 + 10-09 H, O.                #.   temperature —6°5
is obtained on employing nitrate of silver as a cryogen. There
are few more beautiful colourless bodies than the cryohydrate
of silver. Opaque, lustrous, and semimetallic, it is somewhat
heavier than the liquid in which it is formed.
    Of a solution saturated at 0°I found that 6:3581 grims. gave
3'5068 of the anhydrous nitrate, or 55.01 per cent.                   Kremers

the left-hand branch of each curve makes a more acute angle
with the zero axis than any tangent to the right-hand branch
of the same curve.                    If
                              this be true throughout, the unknown
right-hand branch of the HCl curve must be very nearly at
right angles to the axis of 0°C. There is no evidence to show
that the right-hand branch is continuous with the left-hand.
 In the case of the halogen salts this almost appears to be                                              di
 stinctly shown not to be the case.                              If
                                                  the branches be conti
nuous, it appears that the colder the cryohydrate the less the
curvature there.                 If
                           the branches be discontinuous, the colder
the cryohydrate the more acute is the angle between the tan:

in all cases; but between NaCl and                                KI
                                                    there is considerable
difference of sharpness at the cryohydrate, attending identity of
temperature.        It is not the case that the deeper the valley the
more    precipitous    the ascent, travelling from left to right; nor
is it true that the deepest valley has the widest mouth.                That

   § 1. Imagine a plane sheet, some portions having infinite
conducting-power, other portions consisting of ordinary matter,
and again other portions possessing infinite resisting-power.
The whole extent of any of the infinitely conducting regions
will have a uniform potential ; and hence the bounding line
between any such region and the ordinary matter of the sheet
must be an equipotential line.          Further, if one defines a line
of flow or stream-line as a line across which no electricity passes,
 an the
      boundary line between the ordinary matter              the sheet and         of
     infinitely resisting region must           line

XLVI.     On the Determination of the Longitude of Cairo from

   Erpedition".
              having been chosen by the Astronomer Royal as
        the position  for a group of stations for the observation
of the retarded egress of Venus in transit on Dec. 8, 1874, the
question arose as to the feasibility of employing the telegraph
connexions between England and Egypt to exchange time
signals, in order to determine the longitude from Greenwich.
#"Astronomer Royal decided to make trial of this method,
if a reliable signal could be obtained through the cable of the
Eastern Telegraph Company, when such connexions should be
made as would bring the English end of the cable into direct
circuit with that at Alexandria.
    With a view to ascertaining this, the Astronomer Royal
sent me twice to Porthcurnow, in Cornwall, where the cable
comes to land, and where the Eastern Telegraph Company
have their terminal station, under the direction of Mr. Edward
Bull, to whom the Directors had kindly sent instructions em
powering him to devote the cable to the purposes of the ex
periment for as long a time as might be required.       It is not
too much to say that to Mr. Bull's services in suggesting expe
dients, and to his determination and perseverance, is to be at
tributed the success in getting the signals through so great a
length of line.
      rom Porthcurnow there run two cables—one coming to
land at Vigo, which is connected by a separate length of cable
with Lisbon, the other proceeding direct from Porthcurnow
to Lisbon. A single cable runs from Lisbon to Gibraltar, and
another from Gibraltar to Malta.         From Malta two cables
run to Alexandria.
    To connect Porthcurnow directly with Alexandria, then, it
is necessary to “join up" the cable-ends at Malta, Gibraltar,
and Lisbon, and, if the Vigo cable be used, at Vigo also; and
 in the experiment that eventually took place this was the line
employed. The particulars of the cables thus brought into the
 circuit are given hereafter.
    On the occasion of the second preliminary experiment, Mr.
 Ellis, of the Royal Observatory, and Mr. S. Hunter, of the
 Transit-of-Venus Expedition, who had been appointed by the
Astronomer Royal to conduct the work in concert with the
 officers of the Telegraph Company at Porthcurnow and at
 Alexandria respectively, came down to Porthcurnow, and

curnow.    By this means experience was obtained by the
observers at the opposite ends of a cable 1734 knots in
length; that is to say, more than half the length of the Porth
curnow-and-Alexandria Cable. This was a valuable preli
minary experiment, because the observers at the opposite ex
tremities of the cable were sitting side by side, and able to
compare and rectify faults together.
   The first object of the Porthcurnow experiments was to
ascertain the possibility of getting a reliable signal through
the great length of cable between Cornwall and Alexandria,
which, it may be observed, is not only 638 knots longer than
the Transatlantic one, but has also a much smaller section of
                              ...

ment of apparatus to employ, and to take steps to ensure the
same conditions being              at Porthcurnow and Alexan
                                     took place. It was found

usual way, that the movement of the beam of          was feeble,
but that with an  arrangement    proposed by Mr. Bull, an amply
sufficient length of travel was obtained.
   This arrangement consisted in the attachment of the small
mirror to the coil of a Thomson's recorder, by which the for
mer was rendered much more sensitive than when used on the
ordinary galvanometer by being brought into a strong mag
netic field f.
   Signals were made with and without condensers. When
no condenser was used, the beam came to no fixed zero posi
tion, but was subject to continual fluctuation.   On the other
hand, when a condenser was employed at the sending end, the
travel of the beam of light was not sufficient to furnish a re
liable signal.                 -
     The     flºwing
                   was the arrangement finally adopted:—A
condenser was employed at the receiving end only, between
the line and instrument. The mirror was used on the recorder

in the manner proposed by Mr. Bull—an instrument being
lent by him at my request to take out to Alexandria, in order
to ensure the same conditions being observed at both ends of
the cable.
   Mr. Cromwell Warley, F.R.S., was consulted as to the par
ticular character of signal that his experience in the Atlantic
exchanges led him to prefer. He recommended the use of the
signal made on the “break” of current, rather than that given
by the “make,” because in the former case, the battery bein
put out of circuit, the danger of irregularity due to                                                   Hººi
 resistances in the batteries employed at the terminal stations
would be avoided.       He also advised that the transit of the beam

Mr. Varley, however, strongly recommended the adoption                                                      of   an
intermediate station        giving greater accuracy and security,

 Longitude  of Cairo from Greenwich by Telegraph-Signals.      393
 and as incidentally giving the longitude of another important
 place in Europe very accurately.      He calculated that the re
 tardation of the current would be about 1:25 second between
 Porthcurnow and Alexandria, a calculation which was proved
 by the result to be remarkably correct.         The idea of the
 establishment of an intermediate station was negatived as
impracticable by the Astronomer Royal.
      r. Varley kindly placed his artificial line (furnished with
 condensers, &c., to represent the conditions of a submarine
 cable of greater or less length) at the disposal of the Astro
nomer Royal.      By means of this apparatus abundant practice
 was obtained in the observation of a signal similar to that
made on the actual cable. When the expedition had gone
 out to Egypt, and stations had been established with proper
telegraph-connexions, the actual exchange of signals took
 place.   Matters were then in the following condition.
    The primary station in Egypt was established on the western
spur of the desert range of the Mokattam hills, about 560 feet
above Cairo.    The real object of the experiment was to obtain
the longitude of this point from Greenwich.       The longitudes
of the subsidiary stations at Thebes and Suez, and if necessary
Alexandria also, might be readily obtained from the Mokattam
station by exchange of signals through land lines.
    To compare the Mokattam local time with Greenwich time,
it was necessary to exchange land-line signals between these
two places with the transmitting stations established, as above
noticed, at each end of the cable; consequently Mokattam and
Alexandria exchanged signals, while Greenwich and Porth
curnow were similarly engaged. Then took place the ex
change of cable-signals between Porthcurnow and Alexandria,
which lasted for four hours. Finally Mokattam and Alexandria
again exchanged signals.
    While the cable-signals were passing a number of star
transits were observed at Mokattam, as well as both before and
after the exchanges with Alexandria.
    Mokattam was my own station. The principle            I endea
voured to follow, was to multiply star- and telegraph-signal
observations at that end of the line where each star-observa
tion must be expected to be the less accurate, and where the rate
of the clock was more liable to fluctuation. In some cases an
unusually large number of stars were observed, owing to the
fact that at each opportunity that occurred it was desirable to
secure several   ...!  transits, because the skies might cloud
over at any time.
    Mr. Hunter was at Alexandria. In addition to his work
in transmitting cable and land signals, he undertook star

394   Determination            of the Longitude of Cairo from Greenwich.
transit observations on each night, in order to obtain the
.
longitude of Alexandria direct from Greenwich, instead of
from Mokattam, by a separate operation.
   Mr. Ellis was at Porthcurnow, and, under the Astronomer
Royal's direction, arranged the exchanges between Greenwich
     that station with Mr. Criswick, who observed stars and
signals at Greenwich.
   A complete exchange of signals was effected without any
hindrance or disappointment on four nights, namely Novem
ber 14, November 15, November 21, and November 22, 1874.
On three nights stars were visible at Greenwich, and on                                         all
four nights     Mokattam and Alexandria.

of the atoms at and near the superficies of the vane, analogous
in some degree to the state of the superficial atoms of a body
electrified by friction. Such disturbance of the atoms at the
surface must be accompanied by change in the interior, having
the effect of causing the atoms to be somewhat more crowded

These impressed  accelerations maintaina steady circulating motion

        its
      unlimited mass,      put stop    such motion. According
                                               to      a              to

                   of Mr. Crookes's Radiometer.                  397
to the known law of steady motion, the density and pressure
of the fluid are greater as the motion is less. Now in the case
of the aetherial current maintained by the variation of atomic
density in the radiometer's vane, the direction will be trans
verse to the parallel surfaces of the vane, and the motion will
be least near the black surface because, by reason of excess of
temperature, the channel will there be greatest.        Hence there
will be a decrement of aetherial density from the dark towards
the bright surface, and the atoms, being immersed in this va
riation of density, will be urged as if the vane were pushed on
the black surface. This agrees with the fact as observed. (It
is proved in art. 33 of the communication in the Philosophical
Magazine for September 1872, that the acceleration of an atom
resulting from the variation of density of the aether has a con
stant ratio to the acceleration of the fluid where the atom is
                                 -
 situated.)
     Having surmised from the foregoing theory that the rotation
 of the  vanes might be affected by the streams of a magnet in
 the  neighbourhood     of the radiometer, I found on trial that this
 is the case, the rate of revolution being much reduced by the
 proximity of a magnet of considerable power. This result
 might be due to the influence of the magnet’s streams on those
 which, according to our theory, cross the vanes transversely, and
 may be taken to be evidence of the actuality of the latter streams.
      The theory shows that the vanes are impelled by a constant
 accelerative force so long as the same quantity of light falls on
 them.     But from observation it appears that for a certain quan
 tity of incident light they attain a certain rate of revolution
 and then cease to be accelerated. How is this fact to be ex
 plained? It is evident that there must be some amount of
friction between the glass support and the pivot on which the
  system of vanes turns; and this, together with the resistance
  which would be produced by ever so small a residuum of air in
  the glass globe, may sufficiently account for a limit to the rate
  of revolution.   As respects friction, this explanation appears to
            ... "...
  be confirmed by a peculiar circumstance which has been very
  recently                       that when the glass globe is caused
  to float in water and the motion of the vanes is stopped, on
  throwing light upon them the globe is observed to rotate. The
  reason seems to be that the accelerative force which by the in
  cidence of light is made to act on the vanes, takes effect, by
  the intervention of friction, so as to move the globe. It is
  evident that the tendency of the friction is always to make the
  globe partake of the rotatory motion of the vanes.       I give this
  explanation with reservation, not having yet seen a complete
  account of this novel experiment.

 400        Prof. R. Weber on a new Owide of Sulphur and an
   W. Stein" agreed with Berzelius in regarding the blue
 substance produced from sulphur and anhydride as a solution
 of the former in the latter. The blue colour he believed to
 be due to the extremely finely divided state in which he                                                         sup
 posed the sulphur to be present.

  most carefully dried flowers of sulphur are successively added
  to the pure, clear, liquid anhydride : fresh quantities of sul
  phur must only be            after the first portions have entered
  into combination with the anhydride, because any excess of
  sulphur is readily enclosed by the blue compound as it solidifies,

  Immediately that the sulphur comes into contact with the

402             Prof. R. Weber on a new Owide of Sulphur and an
of sulphur dioxide.       The conclusion arrived at from Schweig
                        viz. that the sulphur is merely dissolved

in the   anhydride     without any true chemical action taking
place, is not a                conclusion.
   This compound decomposes but slowly in a cool place when
protected from the action of moisture; quantities required                                                      for

selenium, contained a coloured oxide of tellurium dissolved in
acid, and that these oxides were decomposed by water with
precipitation of the elements selenium and tellurium.              He                                           did

                                                     The selenium
 absorbs the anhydride somewhat more slowly than sulphur
does.   A fine glass rod is used for determining whether any
little particles of selenium remain unacted upon. When the
whole of the selenium is combined with the anhydride, the
excess of the latter is poured off, the last particles being re
moved by the application of a gentle heat in the manner
already described. Decomposition of the compound may be
         during the heating; but inasmuch as           selenium is                 }.

crust, which strongly adheres to the glass. It is removed by
means of a rough glass rod, and quickly brought into a carefull

            This body is therefore a compound analogous to dithionic
            oxide, in which one atom of sulphur is replaced by one atom
            of selenium. These compounds are produced by the imme
            diate addition of one atom of sulphur, or of selenium, to sul
            phuric anhydride.
              The products            obtained from each                     by decomposing                 them
            with water show that the collocation of the atoms is the same
            in each. In both cases the chief product is sulphuric acid,
            accompanied by sulphurous acid; in the decomposition of the
            selenium compound selenious acid is also produced; and in the
            decomposition of the sulphur compound, hyposulphurous acid
            or one of the polythionic acids is formed. The largest por
            tions of the elements, sulphur or selenium, are separated as
            such on the addition of water. The constitution of this sub
            stance can only be guessed                        at,                      it. as

 the purposes of the ordinary chemical student. In the introduction
 it is set forth that “this book is intended for the use of students
 who, after they have mastered the first rudiments of chemistry,
 entor a laboratory to work under a teacher, while at the              ºie
                                                                       time
 they continue their study of theoretical chemistry.”      (The italics are
 the author's.)     The suudent who, fresh from his mastery of the first
 rudiments of chemistry, enters a laboratory with this book as
 his guide, even if its teaching be supplemented by that of a
 chemical tutor, would, we should imagine, before long devoutly
 wish that he had never set foot in such a labyrinth as that of
 qualitative analysis, to lead him out of or through which there
 appears to be no clue.
      uch a multitude of facts concerning the reactions of metals
 and of acids are in this book presented to the bewildered gaze of
 the student, in the separation of each group so many courses are
 open to him, that he must be either bold almost to rashness, or
 possessed already of a large stock of chemical knowledge, who
 would venture to adopt one method in preference to another, or
 (to use the language of the author) from those which are “poten
 tially” applicable to choose that which is “substantially” the best.
 The style in which the work is written is peculiar.           Simplicity
 would appear to be in the author's eyes the unpardonable sin.
 Such expressions as “the solution potentially contains such and
 such metals, but substantially consists         of,” the “complex of
 metals,” “in the heat” as opposed to “in the cold,” &c., grate
 upon the ear of the English reader.
    As an example of that want of straightforward simplicity for
 which we blame the author, we might refer to par. 464, p. 277, in
 which the reactions of prussic acid are detailed. This acid is
 usually called hydrocyanic, and its formula is written HCN : in
one part of the paragraph in question the usual name is employed,
in another the name cyanhydric. Sometimes the formula is written
NCH, sometimes HNC. Of course these are but small things;
nevertheless to the ordinary student these little changes of name
and formulae, when made for no apparent reason, are perplexing.
and only perplexing.
    What does the author mean by calling glass an alloy of alkaline
silicates with silicates of other metals 2 Such a use of the name
alloy is not sanctioned, so far as we are aware, by any of our
standard writers on Chemistry.           Again, the phrase “hydrogen
salt of an acid” is used as       synonymous   with the acid itself.     Of
course the term salt may be used to include acids; but if we speak
of the salt of an acid the phrase seems to apply to a derivative of
that acid;      if,
                  however,     means the acid itself, then we are calling
                               it
a  substance and      derivative
                      a                of

 a special test, he is told to prepare that reagent ec tempore. But
 perhaps   it is scarcely fair to condemn the style of a book which is
  not written in the native tongue of the author.      The well-known
  skill of Mr. Dittmar as an     analyst is a guarantee  of the general
 correctness of the methods      given in the book. In the statement
  of so many reactions it is almost impossible that no mistake should
 occur. On page 229 the action of nitric upon hydrochloric acid
 is said to produce the substance NOCl, ; Tilden has, however,
 shown that no such substance exists, and that the reaction in ques
 tion results in the formation of NOCl.
    Hitherto we have been looking at the work before us as a text
 book for the ordinary chemical student. If, however, we view it as
 a book of reference for the very advanced student, or for the
 chemical teacher, it must appear worthy of the highest praise.   In
 no other English manual is there gathered together such stores of
 information on            all
                      matters connected directly     indirectly with                   or

Comptes Rendus, Feb.    1875, which  1,  will briefly recapitulate:—
                                                             I

       1. If a steel bar be put in contact with the pole of a magnet, and
    for a point M of the bar, the value of the current of demagnetiza
    tion at the ordinary temperature be determined, and the bar be
    afterwards slightly heated with a spirit-lamp, the value of the de
    magnetizing current corresponding to the point M is found to be
    very notably augmented.
       2. When the bar is allowed to cool in contact with the magnet,
    the magnetization does not retrograde, but receives a slight incre
    ment.
       3. When the bar has returned to the ordinary temperature,
    removing it from the magnet for a few moments is sufficient to
    cause a portion of the increment resulting from the heating to dis
    appear: when contact between the magnet and bar is reestablished,
    we do not find the same total magnetism as before contact was broken.
       The new facts which             I
                                have ascertained are as follows:–
       4. When the steel bar   put in contact with the magnet, instead of
    being very moderately heated, has its temperature gradually raised
    until it assumes the blue tint, the magnetism at first rises, reaches
    a maximum, and then retrogrades.      In a series of experiments upon
    a bar of 24 centims. length and 10 millims. diameter       ascertained     I
    that, when one end of the bar was put in contact with the pole of
    a magnet, the total magnetism of the middle point was represented,
    at the surrounding temperature, by the number 41.6; on gradually
    heating the bar,          I
                        found that the magnetism took in succession the
    values 44, 51, 55.2, 52, 52:8, 52:1, 50, 48.5, 48, 48.
       5. When, after being strongly heated, the bar is left in contact
    with the magnet during the whole time of cooling, the total mag
    netism is augmented in proportion as the bar cools; and on
                                                                                                In a its
    arrival    the surrounding temperature, the magnetism retains
              at
    value much superior        that which
                                  to           had before the heating.
                                                      it
    the series     experiments just now mentioned the value
                   of                                               the total      of
    magnetization was 632 after the heating, while before           was only   it
    41-6.
          We have seen above (4) that when the temperature
         6.                                                           the bar       of
    exceeds   acertain limit, its total magnetism diminishes, instead                           of
    continuing        to
                    increase.   One might infer from this that the mag
    netization     of
                  the bar brought   back    the ordinary temperature would
                                                     to
                less,         temperature

                                                                     it

    perature,    the greater the more the bar has been heated,

                                                       is
been heated, because the number               layers which partake
                                                            of               the                         of
magnetization increases with the temperature; the superficial layers,
according       the hypothesis, are not sensibly magnetized
                to                                                       long                       as         as
the bar    isstrongly heated; but they receive magnetism when the
bar  is sufficiently cooled; and this magnetism             added        that   is               to            of
the deeper layers.
  If   one admits that the magnetizing force exerted                the current            by
of  an induction-coil upon        steel bar diminishes when the tempera
                                         a

admit that reciprocally the inducing action exerted               the bar upon         by

when the temperature increases beyond the same limit. Therefore,

variable, the demagnetizing current must diminish; and                       this                        as
current serves me for measuring the magnetization, the magnetiza

of the inductive force must contribute a certain share to the decrease

explain other facts, which     I propose to discuss in a sequel to the

PRELIMINARY NOTE         ON PHOTOGRAPHING         THE LEAST-REFRACTED
   Portion of THE solar        sPECTRUM.       By CAPT. w. DE w. ABNEy,
   R.E.
   Within the last two years there have been many attempts made
to photograph     the least-refrangible      rays of the spectrum ; and
though stated to have been accomplished by the elder Draper on a
daguerreotype plate in the early days of photography, yet there is
reason to believe that this was effected by the reversing action of
                                                              i.
these rays on slightly exposed sensitive iodide of silver, and that
                       .
really no direct photographic impression had been obtained till Dr.
Vogel published an account of a method for effecting this object
in 1874.      More recently, Capt. Waterhouse, of the                    Staff
Corps, has followed up Dr. Vogel's researches, and with a larger
share of success than the originator.          Both these gentlemen have
had resort to aniline dyes of varying colour, using them with the pre
servative to the plate; and they state that the red end of the
spectrum is most sensitive when a red dye (naphthaline) or rosine
is employed, and                  generally that the rays that can be
photographed are dependent on the colour of the dyes employed:
that colour, and not the ingredient added to the sensitive silver
salt, is the essential.
   Lately   I have had occasion to investigate the subject, and have
met with such good results that       I  desire to communicate a prelimi
nary Note to the Society.        I have carefully repeated the previous
experiments of Vogel and Waterhouse, and only attained partial
success with them, though there was sufficient evidence to show
that with the dyes the desired end would be attained.               Looking
more   carefully into the   chemistry   of the question, however,   it struck
me that the same results might be obtained by other means than
colour; and experiments were undertaken with a large series of
gum-resins and other oxidized hydrocarbons (added to ordinary
collodion), some colourless and some not.           With every gum-resin
was obtained a considerable extension of the photographic spectrum
below the lines b ; and at length       I  procured a resin forming with
silver a perfectly white compound that seems to be capable of
taking an image far below the line A. At present,           I  find that the
longer the exposure given, the greater the length of the spectrum
impressed; and     I  believe that, with patience, a very large part of
the absorption-lines     lying beyond that point may be registered, as
I  have obtained impressions which are constant in each plate ex
posed. The past winter has been of a most unsatisfactory nature
for this kind of work, and it is only at long intervals that I have
 been enabled to catch the sun for this purpose.           I  am earnestly

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             415
looking forward to brighter sunshine, when         I have not the least
doubt that   I  shall obtain sharp fiduciary lines in the ultra-red.
The addition of any colour to the preparations has been any thing
but beneficial, retarding the action greatly; and, from what is
apparent, the virtue of the dyes used consists simply in the fact
that they are hydrocarbons of some kind, probably combined with
the faint traces of silver always left in the film of the sensitive
plate.
    Experiments with potassium bichromate have also been under
taken; and the result shows that (where partially insolated) the
rays which usually have no effect on the sensitive compound are
capable of continuing the action set up, as       I  pointed out in the
year 1872. Iron and uranium have also yielded prolonged spectra.
    The first experiments were carried out with a single prism of
60°, and a lens to the camera of 4-feet focus; the later experi
ments have been made with a direct-vision spectroscope of 9
prisms, being equivalent to about three single prisms, and with 4
prisms in battery.      The same camera and object-glass have been
employed.—Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,

ON THE OCCURRENCE OF PHOSPHATES            IN THE CAMBRIAN       ROCKS.
                     BY HENRY   HICKs, ESQ.,    F.G.S.
    In this paper the author showed from experiments that the Cam
brian strata in Wales contain a far greater amount of phosphate and
carbonate of lime than had hitherto been supposed.           The results
published by Dr. Daubeny some years ago, and which have since re
ceived the support of some eminent geologists, were therefore proved
to be entirely fallacious when taken to represent the whole Cambrian
series; for though some portions show only a trace of these ingre
dients, there are other beds both interstratified with and underlying
these series, which contain them in unusually large proportions. The
author therefore objects to look upon Dr. Daubeny's experiments as
tending in any way to prove that the seas in which these deposits
had accumulated contained but little animal life, and that we
here approach the borders of the lower limit of organic existence.
He contended that the presence of so much phosphate of lime, and
 also of carbonate of lime, as was now proved by analyses made by
 Mr. Hudleston, F.C.S., Mr. Hughes, F.C.S., and himself to be
 present in series of considerable thickness in the Longmynd group,
 Menevian group, and Tremadoc group, showed that animal life did exist
in abundance in these early seas, and that even here it must be con
 sidered that we were far from the beginning of organic existence.
 The amount of phosphate of lime in some of the beds was in the pro
portion of nearly 10 per cent., and of carbonate of lime over 40 per
cent. The proportion of phosphate of lime, therefore, is greater than
is found in most of what have been considered the richest of recent
 formations.    The amount of P.O. was also found to increase in pro
 portion to the richness of the deposit in organic remains. It was

 416               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
  found that all animal and vegetable life had contained it from the
  very earliest time; but it was apparent that the Crustacea were the
 chief producers of it in the early seas, and of the Crustacea the
  trilobites more particularly. It was always found where they were
 present, and the shells of some of the larger trilobites, as now pre
 served, contained as much as from 40 to 50 per cent. of phosphate of
 lime.     The analyses made by Mr. Hudleston and the author of
 recent Crustacea proved that they also contain P,0, in very consider
 able proportions.
      In the second part of the paper the author showed that where
 intrusive dykes had passed through or between the beds containing
 the phosphate of lime, the beds for some distance on each side of the
 dykes had undergone a considerable change. Scarcely a trace of the
  P,0, or of the lime was now to be found in them, though it was
 evident that, before the intrusions into them had taken place,
  they, like the other portions of the beds, had contained both in
 gredients in considerable proportions.        It was well known that heat
  alone could not separate P.O. from lime; therefore he found it
  difficult to account for this change in the character of the beds, un
 less it could be produced by gases or watery vapour passing into
 them at the time the intrusions took place. He thought it even
 probable that the dykes, which in some parts are found to contain a
 considerable amount of lime and also of P.O., might have derived
 these, or at least some portions of these, from the beds through which
 they had been forced, and which must have been broken up and
 melted as they passed through them. There are no contemporaneous
 tuffs known in Wales of earlier date than the Llandeilo beds; and
 he thought these dykes belonged to that period, and that they were
-injected into the Lower Cambrian beds after from 8000 to 10,000 feet
 of deposit had been superimposed. In an agricultural point of view
  the author considered that the presence of so much phosphate of
 lime in some of the series of beds must be a matter of great import
 ance; and on examining the districts where these series occurred, he
 invariably found the land exceedingly rich.
      Mr. Hudleston gave the results of the analyses made by him
 at the request of Mr. Hicks. He found in a portion of dark grey
 flaggy rock taken from close to a fossil 1-62, in a portion of
 black slaty rock containing trilobites but in contact with trap 0-11, in
 a portion of the shell of a trilobite 17:05, and in the trap above
 mentioned 0-323 per cent. of phosphoric anhydride.          A lobster-shell
 dried at 100° C. gave 3:26, an entire boiled lobster (undried) 0-76,
 and a boiled lobster without shell 0-332 per cent. of P.O..
 analysis of an entire lobster was correct, he estimated that a ton of
                                                                      If  the
 boiled lobsters would contain about 17 lbs. of phosphoric anhydride.
 In the analysis of the shell of a Trilobite there appears to be a great
 excess of phosphoric acid, which Mr. Hudleston thought must be due

        LI.   On the Simultaneous Sounding of two Notes.
                By Dr. RUDOLPH KöNIG, Paris".
IF     two notes are produced upon the same instrument, or
                         ..
      by the vibrations of two bodies which are closely con
nected together through a third, there ensue, some very
                          j
intricate phenomena,              are partly produced by the re
action of the two sources of sound upon each other, and the
action of both upon the connecting body, and partly also have
their origin in the continuance of the two sound-waves in the
air. It is my present intention in the following pages to
submit to a closer examination only those phenomena which
arise from the coexistence of two sound-waves in the air ; and
I  have therefore used for the demonstration of these waves
                                            .
only such sources of sound as were absolutely isolated
from each other, and could not possibly act upon each other
directly, or combined together upon a third body. As, further,
the waves produced by               must always be considered as a
combination of waves of simple notes,              as therefore it may
remain doubtful when clangs are employed whether the phe
momena observed are produced by the fundamental notes or
by the over-notes, I have been careful in these experiments so
to select the sources of sound that they should only produce
the simplest possible notes.        For the low notes        I used very
stout tuning-forks, mounted on isolated iron frames, and
placed in front of large sounding-boxes; for the upper notes

420              Dr. R. König     on the Simultaneous
confused character, and changes into a still rapid but simple
roll, which becomes so much slower between the sixth and
the seventh that at 233 and 236 v.s. twelve and ten single
beats can already be counted, which at the seventh, B=240 v.s.,
decrease to eight, at 244 v. S. to six, and become gradually
fewer in number, till at the octave of c=256 v. s. they at last
cease altogether.
    As the number of vibrations of the primary notes can be
directly read off from the tuning-forks, it will be found that
the number of single distinguishable beats near the unison is
equal to the difference of the double vibrations of the two
primary notes, and that of the beats near the octave is equal
to the difference of the double vibrations of the higher of the
two primary and of the octave of the lower note.
    The above result can be shortly expressed in the following
manner.      Each interval n : n' (less than the octave) exhibits
two sorts of beats, whose number is equal to the positive and
                                            f
negative remainder of the division         º, that is to say, equal to
the two numbers m and m/= n—m, which we obtain by stating
n' = n+m=2n—m'.            I shall in future, for the sake of brevity,
call the beats m lower beats, and the beats m' upper beats.
 If  we increase the interval between two notes from the unison
 to the octave, the number of lower beats increases from o to n,
and that of the upper beats diminishes from n to o.              At the
fifth the number of both kinds of beats is
                                                =}
                                                        If m  is much
less than
             º only   the lower beats are audible;      if m  is much
 greater   than   º we   hear only the upper beats; and         if m  is
 nearly equal to
                     º both    kinds of beats, m and n—m, may        be

     The lower beats are more powerful than the upper beats:
 and their audibleness extends consequently                         the
                  *
 fifth than that of the   upper   beats below the same note.
     In the octave from      §  to c, which we have now been con
 sidering, it is very difficult to distinguish, through the loud
 º
 and confused            of the upper and lower beats above and
 below the   fifth, the rhythm which belongs to both these kinds
 of beats, as the number both of lower and upper beats is
          so great that heard alone they would produce a very
 rapid roll.    I only succeeded, therefore, in bringing to special
 and absolutely clear proof both kinds of beats during their

   Another peculiarity of  the beats of harmonic intervals is
that the two primary notes  appear alternately.     at the same                                      If
time with the powerful C   we sound c only a small fraction of
a vibration out of tune, sothat very slow beats are formed, we
hear the fundamental note and the octave alternately so clearly
that, when c is very powerful, we should sometimes be inclined
to count each vibration double ;          the other hand,               if,      on                                    c     is
weak, we only hear the fundamental note becoming alternately
stronger and weaker.     have succeeded     I  making precisely                             in
the same observations with the very slow beats of the twelfth
and the double octave,          and       c’; but when the vibra

intermediate notes which cannot be heard. In the beat of
the octave and the twelfth the fundamental note alone appears
at   a,

  In intervals with the fundamental note cº, the lower and
upper beats are only to be distinguished as such near the unison
 and the harmonic interval.         In consequence of their great
 numbers they change to notes which in the different intervals
 will be heard in the following manner:—
    In the second, c' d', the note m (64 beats) C is distinctly
 heard ; in the third, c’e”, it has risen to c (128 beats), and
 is still distinct; in the fourth the note m (1706 beats)
joined by the note m” (341-3 beats) f". These two notes

 blend, when the fourth is quite pure, into a clang that is heard
 sometimes as f, and sometimes as f". The notes m and m'
 become equal at the fifth c" g”, when c' is very distinctly
 heard.     At the sixth, the lower note m rises to f", and the
 note m' sinks to f. These two notes are more powerful, and do
not blend into one another so closely as at the fourth.                                        If,

the secondary beats sound in conjunction with the loud rattle
of the primary beats somewhat in the manner that         have de                            I
scribed above in the simultaneous sounding of 80 : 144 v. s.
At C : e, however, where the rattle of the primary beats is
already much weaker, it disappears before the secondary beats;
and the same thing occurs at the fifth c : g.
    In the intervals with the fundamental notec, the whole system
of secondary beats can be very fully observed. The beats of
the unison of the beat-notes can not only be numerously and
clearly heard in the intervals 2:3, where they can be followed
till they change to a rattle of from 12 to 16, at 2:5, 2:7, and
even at 2: 9 to the number of about 4, but also in the octave
formed by m and m' at 3:4, 3:5 to about 6 or 8, at 3: 7 and
3 : 8 (the former weaker than the latter) to about 4, and at
3:11 in the third period to 3 or 4. The beats of the twelfth
of m and m' are only perceptible in the first period at the in
tervals 4:5 and 4:7, and can only be followed to about 3
or 4.
    In the intervals with the fundamental note cº the vibrations
of my tuning-forks are somewhat less favourable than in those
justmentioned with the fundamental note c.                                      Consequently                  the

  fore be considered physically as the homologue of a saturated
  salt solution in the act of boiling. For absolute comparison
  we should have to eliminate pressure, or rather make auto
  matic pressure the measure of the effect of elimination.
  Wüllner (Pogg. Ann. Bd. cx.) found that the vapour-tension
  of a salt solution varied inversely with the amount of salt it
  contained. Thus at 51°8 the vapour-tension of aqueous so
  lutions of chloride of sodium, in mercury pressure, were found
  to be:—

purified
         by several recrystallizations, was dissolved to satura
tion at 12°C., and very gradually cooled to 0°. The crystals
  iven up in this range proved to be anhydrous iodide.       On
   urther cooling to –12°, a second crop of crystals was formed,
 which also proved anhydrous.          Between –12° and —20° but
 little further solidification occurred. When —23° was reached
 rapid solidification began, and the temperature rose to -15°.
 In another similar case the temperature sank to —24° before
 solidification began.       The whole becomes of a dough-like
 pastiness. The crystals are long, silky needles; they remain
 transparent.        On further cooling in a chloride-of-calcium
 cryogen to —26°, the silvery opacity due to a true cryo
 hydrate is produced, and the whole becomes of a stony hard
 ness.    It is clear, therefore, that with the iodide as with the
chloride of sodium there are two cryohydrates:—the subcryo
hydrate, having a melting-and solidifying-point at-15°; and

   With regard to the first eight determinations there is no
thing particular to remark.     For the 40-per-cent. solution a
CaCl, cryogen had to be used.       Finding that ice separated
from the 45 solution, and the subcryohydrate from the 50
solution, I concluded that the composition of the true cryo
hydrate must                      lie
                    between these values.       accordingly sub
mitted several ounces     the 45, and also    of
                                               the 50 solution                    of I                            to
a  carbonic-acid cryogen.    From the first ice separated; from
the second the subcryohydrate.       The temperature sank                                                         in
both cases      -30°,  and there remained constant, while from
                         to
both crop after crop     the pearly-white true cryohydrate was
                                             of
formed. After about three quarters       each had been thus                  of
removed, the temperature still remaining   –30°, the residual                     at
liquids were analyzed                         by
                         evaporation and strong heating.

  But it was impossible that the state of these sciences should
be otherwise.  Every student of physics or chemistry is con
tinually encountering such terms as force, matter, movement,
and the   like—terms which are ill-defined and are the bases of
alleged important theories, terms in a series of which no one
knows which is the ultimate operator.           Other sciences have
been  subjects    of a similar caprice, and render more vivid the
confusion.      In unity of plan, and in appropriating the great
results of kindred sciences, all have been deficient.
    If science is ever to offer an exact reflection of the object
of which it is the image, it will do so by appreciating the clear
and definite proof that it is dealing with an essential and                               in
divisible unity; not a unity produced by the mere heaping -
up of details.           -

  Natural existence, being subordinate to absolute unity, pre
sents twodistinct modifications: one is existence out of time,
and so far eternal ; the other, the temporal and transitory.
The union of these two constitutes life, which is the manifes
tation of the infinite in time.     Nature in her pure unity is
indeterminate, simply indicating potentiality.      But she un
dergoes a misus after development, and then presents us with
infinitely varied modes. These three logical moments are realized
at one and the same time, nature being simultaneously and
eternally one, varied, and entire ; the process of this evolution
is the process of life.    The realization of such a process re
quires an essential unity—an infinite variety of states, and an
intimate dependence and relation between the units and their
sum.     Thus, while each individual has a separate existence,
the whole is not made up by mere juxtaposition of parts. This
idea of tri-momental evolution agrees with actual observation;
we shall find it in the birth, process, and extinction of any
  enus, species, or individual, whether we refer to ordinary
living beings or the more distant substance of the stars.       In
the midst of       all
                  these changes, whether     person      of
                                                          system,          or   of
each man recognizes his own permanent and continuous unity,
and thence observes the systemic unity.
   Each individual—whether star, plant, animal,          man—is             or
modelled       the infinite variety
              on                        nature,of well         her as            as   on

             to      the celestial bodies for what we term gra
                         of
vitation—we meet with forces derived from individual functions
of various kinds.    Ascending higher, we see clearly that such
forces are not  distinct, and independent        the one activityof
of   nature, that their ordinary laws are but laws                         of   mode with
which she invests herself, and that heat, light, gravitation,
and the like are general determinations
                                                         in in
                                        which she manifests
herself.   But the sum total     energy   of
                                         nature remains one
and the same.

                     life and the evolution                   of

and determine the logical value of the abstract unity sought
     ut physics, as at present studied, has reference solely to
the general  forces or agencies of nature.    We must add to
this a higher and more philosophical regard. The science of

in the unity of       its

to increase the length of the spark, a small electromagnet,
capable of supporting perhaps two kilogrammes, was set up,

    The electromotive force in         the    circuit was very small, hardly
    enough to render the poles strongly magnetic. With a proper
    electromotive force we might expect the effects to be more
    striking.
       In order to measure the increase of quantity obtained by
    breaking the primary circuit between the poles of the magnet,
    the electromagnet and the primary of an induction-coil were
    placed in the same circuit as at first. The poles of the induc
              Fº
    tion-coil were connected (the one directly, the other by means
    of the spark leaping between two points) with a condenser of
    farad capacity.       #. oles of the condenser were connecte
    with a                  galvanometer of 5880 ohms resistance.
     Each of the following results is the mean of two observations.
     The length of spark was the same in both cases.

    In  a great many cases, where the magnet was quite powerful,
 it was not easy to get comparable results. When the primary
 circuit was broken between the poles, the spot of light was
 driven off the scale; but when the primary was broken outside,
 there was frequently very little deflection.
                                                                               -

    All these    results were taken with interrupting the primary
circuit   by separating      two copper wires held one in either hand.
Practice          e the results then obtained quite accurate.             I at
first tried breaking from the surface of mercury; but, beside
the irregularity in the amount of the deflection, there was a
most unaccountable change of polarity every few moments.                     I
distrusted the evidence of my own senses so much in this case
that I asked several other people to observe for me, without
  reviously telling them anything of this change of polarity.
  n each case the observer noticed the reversal for himself.              The
deflection was almost always in one direction when the circuit
was broken between the poles, and in the other direction when
                                                        º
the circuit was broken outside of the poles. This rule is not,
however, absolute.           This reversal of polarity only occurred
when copper was used to break from M. surface of the mer
cury.    %.   separation of iron from iron, or                  from copper,
or iron from mercury, never gave any reversal. The reversal
was best seen with the electrometer.

the deflection, by breaking inside the poles and outside of
them, when the                 over which the spark had to leap was
varied. The curves obtained by laying down these deflections
were not, as one might suppose, hyperbolas, but were appa
rently exponential curves, having the axis of a as an asymptote,
but not the axis of y. A series of very careful observations
was taken by observing the deflections when the distances over
.#
which the spark passed were small. The curves obtained by
breaking the primary between the poles were similar to those
             when the primary was broken outside. The observa
tions were taken by breaking the primary with the interrupter
of one of Ritchie's induction-coils. The sparks passed between
                                d;
two circular disks of copper 10 centims. in diameter. In the
centre of one of the            was an almost imperceptible protu

                    a

 was then discharged through           galvanometer.

the work of transport of the iodine is greater than that of the
transport of the metal.
    It is important to observe that, our reasoning being based
on the possibility of applying to these phenomena the principle
of the conservation of energy, i. e. the theorem of vires viva,
the value of the work accomplished is determined solely by
the initial and final states of the system of bodies under con
sideration, and is consequently independent of any possible
hypothesis on the nature of electrolysis.           As the liquid be
yond the immediate vicinity of the electrodes undergoes no
alteration, the total work is equal to the algebraic sum of the
weights of material transported from one electrode to the
other, multiplied by the height of the liquid column.           As the
phenomenon takes place in the interior of a liquid, the appli
cation of the Archimedean principle necessitates the introduc
tion of a correction.

The previsions given by the theory are, then, confirmed by
experiment, inasmuch as a difference is shown between the
intensities of the ascending and the descending current in a
column of an electrolyte, and the sign of the difference ac
cords with that indicated by the theory.     In nitrate of silver
the   descending  current is stronger  than the ascending; the
reverse is the case with iodide of cadmium.
    But the numbers given by experiment are twice or three
times less than those foreseen by the theory; it is impossible
to attribute so enormous a difference to errors of observation.
The most probable explanation of this apparent anomaly is to
be sought in a peculiarity of feeble currents noted by Helm
holtz”.    Feeble currents, which polarize the electrodes with
out producing definite decomposition of the electrolyte (their
electromotive force being less than the electromotive force of
polarization which they would call forth in passing through
 the liquid), or the currents which arise from the depolariza
tion of the electrodes, present according to M. Helmholtz the
 following peculiarity:-Ohm's law seems to be inapplicable
to them : a very great metallic resistance introduced into the
 circuit weakens their intensity but very little, which amounts
 to the same as if the liquid or the electrodes were the seat of
an enormous supplementary resistance. Experiment proves
that this fictitious resistance is variable and augments when
the intensity of the current diminishes.       These phenomena
 present a striking analogy with the currents given by elec
 trical machines.     M. Rossetti's experiments on the Holtz
 machine f have shown that what may be called the internal
 resistance of that machine in like manner varies with the
 velocity of rotation, consequently with the intensity of the
current.    My tubes presented this peculiarity in a very high

degree; it is therefore not surprising that the deviations of
the galvanometer, calculated on the basis of the real value of
the resistance of the circuit alone, should be less, when, besides
this real resistance, one must take into account a very con
siderable fictitious resistance.
   This circumstance not having attracted my attention at the
commencement of the experiments,              I
                                            cannot present the data
necessary for calculating the value of this fictitious resistance
in the experiments with nitrate of silver.          For those with
iodide of cadmium (Table IV.)             I
                                         determined this resistance
by measuring the intensity of the current, first, when the tube
and the galvanometer alone formed the circuit, and again
after the introduction of a coil of 7976 Siemens's units.                  I
*...*
found that the total resistance of the circuit was 18,240
units, while the real resistance was only about 5600. The
                              A–D,     calculated with this new
  atum, was found to be 6'6, in complete accordance with
the experiments.
   The electromotive force e, tending to produce a current
directed invariably downward in a column of nitrate of silver,
and upward in iodide of cadmium, is independent of the                    in
tensity and direction of the current of the pile.               I
                                                       endeavoured
to   pass through   my  tubes filled with nitrate of silver equal
currents    alternately  in opposite directions, supplied by a
magnetoelectric machine.         These currents, without acting
themselves on the galvanometer, were to call forth the electro
motive force e, which was to deflect the needles.
   Contrary to expectation, the experiment gave a negative
result; the phenomena were the same as if the alternate cur
rents had not traversed the liquid at all. The reader is re
ferred for fuller details to the articles above mentioned.    There
is reason to think that the quantity of electricity (necessarily
finite) conveyed by any induced current is insufficient to
charge the electrodes to a difference of potential above the
maximum electromotive force of polarization, as, according
to Mr. Varley" and Helmholtz, the electrodes may be re
garded as the armatures of a condenser of enormous capacity.
Now, under these circumstances, although the true electro
motive force of the induced current may at every instant be
superior to the maximum of polarization, the current cannot
pass through the liquid.         This complex and little-studied
subject requires fresh researches for          its
                                              complete elucidation.

   We can thus calculate, by means of the numbers and Tables
furnished by M. Régnault, two essential elements of the pro
blem:-(1) the heat absorbed in A by the volatilization of the
liquid, minus the heat restored by the return of the liquid
from the temperature t' to tº ; (2) the work expended, by the
action of the pump B, to obtain the compression of the vapour
from the pressure Po to P'ºo.

   The problem has not hitherto been stated in this form; and
yet it is the natural method for arriving at the discovery of
the connexion that may exist between the quantities which
have been supposed to be entirely independent and without

   Of these two hypotheses, therefore, the first is based on a
deduction resting upon the similar physical state of liquids, the
second on the principle of equality of return.
  If  the second hypothesis were not verified, we might com
bine two reversible cycles, Carnot's and that supplied by a
volatile liquid; the difference of the two would be represented
by the transformation of a certain quantity of surrounding
heat into mechanical work.       In fact, Carnot's cycle proves
that, given a quantity of heat Q disposable at temperatures
t’ and t, we can always transform into work a quantity
                                        _     tº   —t
                                      Q=3|Hºp calories.
  In the cycle represented in our figure 1, we dispose in the
condenser of a quantity of heat of which the minimum is
                             Q=X at a temperature                        t';

fig. 1, which has been employed industrially in the production
 f  ice by means of sulphurous acid. The observations were
made with extreme accuracy during the space of one month
at La Ciotat, near Toulon, by the care of M. Vésigné, Manager
of the dockyards of the Messageries Maritimes.
    One engine produced 36 kilogrammes of ice per hour, under
the following conditions:—
    Temperature of the refrigerant -10°; temperature of the
condenser + 35°.
    Pressure at — 10° = 762.49 millims.; pressure at 35° =
 4014.78 millims.
    Specific heat c = 0.35; A at — 10° for sulphurous acid
  = 102; and 8 = 2-112.
    The equation of the quantity of heat absorbed in one minute
 to produce 36 kilos of ice per hour is given by
                P 102 — p 45 x 0.35=60 calories,
in which p is the weight of sulphurous acid volatilized.  We
find p = 694 grammes.     Substituting this value of p in the
equation of the work T for 1 second, we have
               =   —

  We will remark that ice proceeding from the solidification
of water at 21° absorbs 100 calories per kilogramme; con
sequently the engine absorbs 1 calory per second; and by
Carnot's cycle we have the following relation,
               =-3741;          --300-- 63-13 kilogrammètres.
      By the cycle of sulphurous acid we find 69.44 k.; the co
 incidence is almost absolute.  Let us add that in practice the
 ice-engine consumes under these conditions one     orse-power
 of steam, or about 75  kilogrammètres.

independent of each other are united by relations                very                                        all

body can be reduced to a single force and a couple whose plane is

the starting-point of Theory. Adverting, in the first instance, to

it   explains naturally the abundant falls of rain or snow which have
always been noticed during the polar auroras.
      8. The sound that accompanies these experiments corresponds
to that which has often been heard during the aurora when the
distance was relatively small; it is due to the vaporization pro
duced by the electric trails of fire penetrating a liquid mass.
      9. The magnetic perturbations caused by the auroras are repro
duced in these experiments, on placing a magnetized needle near
the circuit. The deviation increases or diminishes as the luminous
are becomes more or less developed in the liquid.
      10. It follows, further, from these facts that the aurora must
be produced by a flow of positive electricity; for the luminous phe
nomena are the same as those at the positive electrode in the volta
meter, and the negative electrode exhibits nothing similar.
      11. But are the polar auroras a discharge between the positive
electricity of the atmosphere and that of the earth supposed nega
tive? If they were so, we ought to observe very frequent falls of
 lightning at the poles, or gleams or luminous tufts on the project
ing parts of the ground, forming the counterpart of the phenome
non that takes place in the air. Now observation shows that such
 is not the case.      I am therefore inclined to think that it is the im
 perfect vacuum of the upper regions that, acting as an immense
 conductive envelope, plays the part of the negative electrode in the
 above experiments, and that the positive electricity flows off towards
 the planetary spaces, and not to the earth, through the icy mists
 or    clouds which float above the poles.
      12. As to the origin of this polar electricity, it has been assumed
  that it comes from the equator and the tropical regions. But it
 may be objected that the electrified clouds must discharge them
 selves during so long a journey; and, in fact, we know that tem
 pests are rarer and rarer in proportion as we get nearer the poles.
 My previous experiments, and others not yet published, having led
 me to consider the heavenly bodies charged with positive electricity
  (perhaps the only sort that exists),     I should be inclined to re
  the earth itself as charged with positive electricity, which is libe
 rated from the land and sea by simple emission, radiated from the
 whole surface, at the poles as at the equator, producing very dif
  ferent effects in the atmosphere in consequence of the diametrically
 opposite meteorological conditions of these regions.
      Admitting this last hypothesis, one might conclude that the
  aurora results from the diffusion in the upper strata of the atmo
  sphere, around the magnetic poles, of the positive electricity ema
  nating from the polar regions themselves, either in obscure radia
  tions when no obstacle is interposed, or converted into heat
  and light by meeting with aqueous masses in the solid or liquid
  state, which it vaporizes with a noise, and reprecipitates in the form
  of rain or snow at the surface of the globe.—Comptes Rendus de

     oN STREAMS FROM GLACIERs.                                  BY CHARLEs KNIGHT, F.L.S.
       To    the Editors        of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal,
      GENTLEMEN,                          Wellington March 7, 1876.
    In reference to Dr. Pfaff's   experiments   on the plasticity of ice,
is the   following  extract from my Address to the Philosophical
Society of Wellington of sufficient interest to appear among the
 Miscellaneous Articles of the Magazine?
     “I see in Geikie's late work, ‘The Great Ice Age,’ that reference
is made to the fact that, from the foot of glaciers in Greenland,
 streams of water issue and unite to form considerable rivers, one of
 which, after a course of forty miles, enters the sea with a mouth
 nearly three quarters of a mile in breadth.
     “This flow of water, Geikie thinks, probably circulates to some
extent below every glacier; and he accounts for it by the liquefaction
of ice from the warmth of the underlying soil. A more complete
explanation of this flow of water from glaciers estimated not less
 than 3000 feet thick will be found in the suggestion first made by
Professor James Thomson, and subsequently proved by his brother
Professor W. Thomson, that the freezing-point of water is lowered
0°23 Fahr. for each additional atmosphere of pressure.            Now a
sheet of ice 3000 feet thick is equal to the pressure of about 80
atmospheres, at which pressure          temperature    its
                                                        the base should                 at

ning water beneath the glacier,         might readily, it Geikie  states,                    as

that   they  are not rounded as the planets are, but are angular,

no concentric structure.                   -
   Haidinger, who examined with much care the surfaces of
meteorites, arrived at the conviction that their dark-coloured
crust and the rounded nature of their edges were not original
characteristics, but that the thin crust was developed during
transit through the atmosphere, the sharpness of the edges
being at the same time abraded. A meteorite, in short, before
entering the atmosphere possesses an angular form; the greater
number are acutely angular. The faces of the angular masses
are surfaces of fracture; each meteorite is a fragment, and in
                        its
                       the disruption      larger mass.                  of

   Any collection,     which  complete meteorites are preserved,

fact   and among the specimens

   The greater number of meteoric irons exhibit a structure
which indicates that each has formed part of a large mass
  ossessing similar crystalline characters. The formation of
 arge masses so constituted, presupposes, as Haidinger has
pointed out, long intervals of time for tranquil crystallization
at a uniform temperature; and these conditions could only
prevail on one of the larger cosmical masses. On the surfaces
of many meteorites (such as the Château-Renard, Pultusk, and
Alessandria, ones) indications resembling in every particular
the “slide” or “throw ’’ of terrestrial rocks are to be met
with, appearances which indicate     the disruption or dislocation
of larger            Other meteorites, like those of Tula, Chan
                 masses.
tonnay, Orvinio and Weston, are congeries of angular frag
ments, and correspond, as regards structure, with terrestrial
breccias.   Many stones, moreover, are formed of very small
fragments, of tiny splinters, and resemble volcanic tuffs. These
characters, again, point to larger cosmical masses which have
undergone mechanical changes as the source whence they
have been derived.
   So far, then, it would appear that the material of which
meteorites consist has been furnished by one or more large
masses, the formation of which must have occupied a long
  eriod of time. The question which therefore suggests itself
 is, How     the process

500           Prof. G. Tschermak on the Formation of
would be a result; the fragments would be sundered with
great violence, and would acquire velocities in several direc
tions. The formation of meteorites may thus be explained;
we must, however, not lose sight of the fact that during such
a disruption large fragments, as well as small, would be pro
duced. Meteorites, however, are always small masses.            The
largest known are the meteoric stone of Knyahinya, in the
Vienna Collection, which weighs 294 kilog., and the meteoric
iron of Cranbourne, preserved in the British Museum, and
weighing 3700 kilog. Most of them are of far less magnitude;
and a stone of 5 kilog. is accounted a large meteorite.
    All these masses, even the largest, are but tiny splinters or
fine dust in comparison with a very small planet of only a
kº,
mile diameter. Were the latter divided into a million equal
  arts, one of them would be 250,000 times the size of the
              stone, and 10,000 times as large as the Cran
bourne meteoric iron.
    It appears, therefore, to be highly improbable that meteorites
 owe their form to the disruption, by impact, of planetary
 masses; it is much more probable that a disintegration, even
 to the smallest particles (what may be termed a pulverization),
 has been brought about by a force acting from within out
 wards—in short, by an explosion.
    Explosion is a violent process, and may appear to clash
 with our ideas of gradual cosmical development; yet it is not
 more violent than the movements observed on the surface of
 the sun, or those of the comets, whether observed or calculated.
                *.
 The explosive upheavals on the sun observed by Zöllner,
 Young, and Respighi, the cyclonic movements, as determined
 by Lockyer,             at far greater velocities than have ever
 been observed in the case of terrestrial explosions.
    Again, the sudden blazing-forth of certain stars is evidence
 of the activity of some vast force, which Mayer traced to the
 impact of fixed stars and their union after fusion.       The ema
 nations observed in comets by Schmidt take place with a
 vigour which also implies very rapid movement. There is

the meteorites shows that they are the result of a gradual
tranquil crystallization, while others, on the contrary, are
composed of fragments, and are the product of disintegrating
forces.   The majority are made up of minute flakes and
splinters and of rounded granules.
   Haidinger was the first who ventured to compare the porous
masses, made up of rock-dust, with the triturated and pul
verized products of terrestrial volcanoes, and to term them
meteoric tuffs. The marked preponderance of this structural
character in meteorites shows that in the star-masses whence
they were derived a state of quiescence must have been of
much rarer occurrence than one of volcanic activity.
     In the
          tufaceous meteorites a characteristic feature presents
itself which throws considerable difficulties in the way of our
explanation, a phenomenon which is not observed in so marked
a degree in the tuffs of our volcanoes.     It is the occurrence in
great abundance of minute rounded particles and spherules
which at once arrest the attention of the observer.             They
characterize          all
                   tufaceous meteoric stones which,         alread                 as
stated, constitute the largest class     these bodies, and whic

   These spherules present the following features, which suffice

They resemble rather the spherules which are frequently met
with in our volcanic tuffs, such as the chondra of the trachyte
tuff of Gleichenberg, those of the basalt tuff of the Venusberg,
near Freudenthal, and more especially the spherules of olivine
of Kapfenstein and Feldbach in Styria.
    As regards the last-mentioned chondra", we know them to
be the result of volcanic trituration, and to owe their form to a
                  †.
prolonged explosive activity in a volcanic “throat,” where the
older rocks              been broken up and the tougher particles
have been rounded by continued attrition.
    The characters of the meteoric chondra indicate throughout
a similar mode of formation f. We may at any rate conceive
the rock-masses which suffered trituration to have possessed
a somewhat soft texture, and thus arrive at an approximation
to Daubrée's view f of a rock-mass which assumed a solid
form while rotating in a gaseous medium ; it is certain, in
short, that the spherules are the result of trituration.
    The spherules are sometimes microscopically small, have
sometimes the size of a millet-seed; others may be as large
as a cherry or a small hazel-nut; but they are not numerous.
The tufaceous chondra of our volcanic rocks vary in size from
that of a hazel-nut to that of a head.            If from this disparity
we may form any conception of the different magnitudes of
the areas of activity in which they have been produced, we
must seek in numerous minute volcanic fissures for the source
of  the meteoric tuffs.
    The latter are peculiarly characterized as containing no
trace of a slag-like or vitreous rock, nor enclosing distinct
crystals in the matrix; in short they exhibit nothing which
their formation from lava would lead us to look for. All that
is to be seen in them is the triturated product of a crystalline
rock.
    Some    of   the tufaceous meteorites bear evidence        of a later
modification       wrought   by   heat: such are the stones of Tadjera
and    Belgorod     S.    Others,   again, exhibit phenomena which
can only be explained on the theory of their having under
gone a chemical change subsequent to their formation.                 We
not   unfrequently     find,  for  example,  in the meteorites of Mezo
Madaras and Knyahinya concentric aggregations of metallic
   *  They must not be confounded      with the volcanic bombs which   are
composed of lava.
   tº Reichenbach considered the chondra to be small meteorites.     Here,
however, the aim is merely to form a conception of a planetary form
of  meteorites.

  robably have possessed    if   the lunar craters had been formed
I.   gaseous explosion.     In view of this difficulty a suggestion
 has been put forth in a recently published work", that the
 volcanic activity on the lunar surface has been due to expan
 sion attending solidification.     Were this a correct interpreta
tion, it would equally follow that during the freezing of
water, which also expands on becoming solid, eruptive
phenomena, accompanied by the formation of craters, would
certainly be occasionally observed ; but such, it need hardly
be stated, are unknown.         It appears to us, however, that the
difficulty which would be disposed of by such an hypothesis
has never actually been presented.         It cannot have been by
means of permanent gases alone that the volcanic changes on
the moon have been brought about; and if vapours took partin
these operations they must have been subsequently absorbed by
the rocks forming the lunar surface. We have, however, thus far
not been driven to have recourse to Samann's theoryt, accord
ing to which the surface of the moon was at an earlier epoch
covered with water which has subsequently been absorbed.
We shall defer the examination of this subject to a later
occasion.
    All  these considerations, then, have led us to the     conclusion
               ...
that volcanic agency, resulting in the disintegration and dis
tribution of          masses in space, is inconceivable without the
simultaneous action of gases or vapours, or of perhaps both.
From this it follows as a direct inference that the explosive
activity, to the existence of which meteorites bear evidence,
is due to the sudden expansion of gases or vapours, among
which hydrogen may have been a prominent agent.
    The conclusions arrived at from     *. careful investigation and
comparison of meteorites, confirm the results obtained during
the last few years by students of geology and astronomical
physics.     The volcanic activity of which those mysterious
masses of stone and metal are evidence may be compared to
the violent movements on the solar surface, the more feeble
action of our terrestrial volcanoes, or the stupendous erup
tive phenomena of which the lunar craters tell the history.
    No one who at this juncture bears in mind Kant's            ºr,
of the homogeneous development of stellar masses, can fail to
be struck with the idea that the heavenly bodies already
alluded to are not the only masses which have undergone
these changes, but will rather incline to the opinion that
volcanic activity is a cosmical phenomenon in the sense that

tions of Uranus, the equation gives two values for Saturn's
mass, one of which is slightly larger, the other slightly smaller
than Bessel's value. There are, however, other relations of a
similar character which can be measured with great accuracy.
   Laplace found that if the mass of each planet be multiplied
by the product of the square of the eccentricity and the square
root of the mean distance, the sum of                the products will            all

                  III.      Difference-notes                  and Summation-notes.
   T   is well known that Helmholtz has proved theoretically
      that “whenever the vibration of the air, or of any other
elastic body set in motion by both the primary notes at
the same moment, becomes so strong that the vibrations can
no longer be considered as infinitesimal, vibrations of the air
must arise whose pitches are equal to the difference and to
the sum of the number of vibrations of the primary notes.”
These combination-notes, both those of the difference and
those of the sum, are quite distinct from the beats, and are
much weaker than the original note.
  If  we turn our attention first to the difference-notes, we find
that, in          all
               intervals           when    n   :

than,        they coincide with the original note, and therefore                                                     can

dissimilar order, namely the n+2nd note of the deeper clang,
and the n + 1st of the higher one, whose beat-note is equal to
the sum of the fundamental notes.     Thus, for example, in the
minor  sixth,  5: 8, the seventh note of 5 (35) and the sixth of
8 (48)  gave  the beat-note m, which is equal to the sum 5+8.
      t might perhaps appear strange that we should have                                              re
marked especially the beat-notes of overtones of two sounds
whose vibrations were equal to the sums of both fundamental
notes, while the beat-notes of many other overtones must also be
audible; but it must be remarked that the number of these
notes which are audible is by no means so great as we
might be disposed to assume without a closer inspection. Thus
the overtones of a fifth interval, up to the fifth, allow no beat
note, excepting the note 5, to be heard higher than the funda-.
mental note, which does not coincide with one of the overtones
of the two clangs.        In the fourth, except the note 7, only the
beat-note 5 of the first seven overtones arising from 15 and 20
does not coincide with the notes which are already contained
in the clangs; and the ratio is the same in the other intervals.
    The beat-notes in              all
                              the above-mentioned cases are equal                                     to

of card, the rattle is hardly to be discerned at all, and the note
e stands out with greater clearness.       If we turn the wheel
only once in two seconds, so that we only produce 64 strokes in
the second, we can still more easily observe the almost entire
disappearance or withdrawal of the note C from the rattle of
the 64 strokes. There exists consequently the most perfect
agreement between the ratio of primary impulses and that of
the beats.
   It is obvious that the simultaneous audibleness of single
strokes and of the notes which arise from their sequence, as also
the cessation of the audibleness of single strokes when these
surpass a certain number, are fully explained by the theory of
hearing put forward by Helmholtz. According to this theory,
as is known, there exist in the ear certain elastic bodies
“greatly muffled ” (Tonempfindung, p. 226), which serve
for the perception of swiftly passing irregular shocks—and
also “less-muffled elastic bodies,” which are much more
powerfully affected by a musical note of correspondingly high
pitch than by single beats.    Each of the single beats pro
duces, therefore, an impression                   upon a body              of the former
sort, so long as these strokes do not succeed each other in a
shorter interval of time than is necessary for the muffling of
the concussion produced in        But, further, the periodical

   This may be easily demonstrated by means of a disk in
which is a circle of large holes, and which is made to revolve
before a tuning-fork.                    I
                            have used different disks with 16,
24, and 32 holes, 20 millims. in diameter, at various distances,
each disk much larger than the circle of holes, so that the
note, as far as possible, should only penetrate strongly to the
ear when an opening was in front of the tuning-fork.          Of
course any particular note will not, in any particular number
of intermissions, produce a note which corresponds to this
number of intermissions; but it will be necessary, besides the
needful strength and the sufficient number of intermissions,
that the air-shocks which penetrate through the openings of
 the disk shall be equal to each other; and this cannot be, for
 instance, when the number of intermissions is greater than the
 number of double vibrations of the note. In this case either
 several holes pass by the same sound-wave, so that a fresh
 part of this wave always passes through each, or, at any rate,
they are not equal parts of different sound-waves which the
openings make a way for to the ear. When, too, the number
of the intermissions is only a little greater than the number
of double vibrations of the note, similar conditions ensue,
and it becomes necessary that at least one entire sound
wave should penetrate through the opening in order that the
intermission-note      may be clearly perceptible.           The most
favourable circumstance for its audibleness seems to be that in
which an entire series of sound-waves can penetrate through
each opening—that                  is,
                             when the vibrations                  of

31 and 33 at 1:32 can scarcely be perceived at all.
    In experiments with the last-named tuning-forks, which
are therefore the most favourable for the observation of the
intermitting notes,     I move the disk directly in front of the
forks.    When,   however,                          I
                              I use deeper forks, insert between
them and the disk suitable resonators of the same diameter
as the holes in the disk, so that the note always sounds loudly
when one of these holes is in front of the opening in the re
sonator.     It may be remarked, by the way, that with this
arrangement the variation-notes especially sound wonderfully
beautiful, and when the disk is moved alternately quicker and
slower they may be distinctly heard to retreat from and approach
one another.
    In the above, only a note of constantly equal intensity was
allowed to approach the ear intermittingly by mechanical
 means; the transition of periodical vibration maxima to a note,
 however, can also be observed in notes which themselves pos
 sess a periodically changing intensity.         For this purpose  I
 have constructed siren-disks with circles in which the holes

 intensity is produced    if they are sounded through reeds
 same diameter as the largest holes. One of these disks con
 tained three circles, each of 96 equidistant holes, whose dia
 meter varied on the first circle 16 times from 1 to 6 millims.,
 on the second 12 times, and on the third 8 times.          If these
 circles were sounded with a tube of 6 millims. diameter,
 while the disk was at first turned slowly, the single-hole
 periods were heard in each circle like separate beats; when it
 was turned faster, first the 16 periods of the first, then the 12
 of the second, and lastly the 8 of the third circle changed to
 one note; when, lastly, the high note of 96 holes with 8 turns
 of the disk had reached the second g”, the deep notes C, G,
 and double C, corresponding to the number of periods, were
  clearly and powerfully heard with this g”.
     On another still larger disk, 70 centims. in diameter,         I
  arranged seven circles of 192 equidistant holes, which periodi
  cally increased and decreased in size 96,64, 48, 32, 24, 16,
  and 12 times.     In the first, therefore, a whole period was con
  tained in two different large openings, and the note of the
     riods in it was therefore only an octave deeper than the
  note of the 192 holes, while in the seventh circle each period
  was formed of 16 openings, and the note of the periods was
  consequently four octaves deeper than the note of the 192

holes. Notwithstanding this great difference in the number of
the primary impulses which the single periods produced upon
these different circles, they                    all
                                     equally, when their number
had become sufficiently great, changed into             note; and               a                        if
the circles, following the series from the seventh            the first,                  to
were blown     upon,  they always   allowed the    deep   note      the                             in

loudly heard beside the constantly unchanging high note.
   Although, therefore, such series           isolated impulses of                                       of
periodically changing intensity show great likeness             clangs

the change of phases in the vibrations in the change from one
undulation to another. For this purpose           divided two con            I
centric circles working close together into 88 parts, and dis
posed the openings which were to produce successive undulations
alternately upon the two. As with 88 openings and 16 periods
5% holes would have come upon each of the latter,             always                               I
took two periods together, and bored therefore on the first
circle the divisions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and on the second 6, 7, 8,

the two sound-waves.
    (2) The beats                 of
                       the pure harmonic intervals can            heard                                  be

the help        of
             resultant intermediate notes, whose existence cannot
be  proved.
   (3) Both the beats         and the beats m', not only

interval n: n + m, but also of the interval n:h n + m (h–2, 3, 4),
when the intensity of the primary notes and their number are
sufficient, change into beat-notes.
    II. (4) When the two beat-notes m and m/ are near the
unison, the octave, and twelfth, the same beats may be heard as
would be produced by two equal primary notes.              I have
named these beats arising from beat-notes secondary beats, in
order to distinguish them from the beats arising from primary
 notes.
    (5) When the intensity of the beat-notes by which they
are formed and their number are sufficient, these secondary
beats change to a secondary beat-note, as primary beats change
 to a primary beat-note.
    III.   (6) The difference-notes and summation-notes, which
 are  produced   by the clang of two loud notes (the vibrations of
 vº
 the latter not being infinitesimal), produce a phenomenon
 which is independent of the beats and beat-notes: they are
                weaker than the beat-notes.
         . (7) The beat-notes cannot be explained by reason of
 the difference-notes and summation-notes, because the number
 of their vibrations is in many cases different from what this
 cause might produce.
    (8) The audibility of the beats depends solely upon their
 number and upon       §.  intensity of the primary notes, and is
 independent of the distance of the interval.
    (9) The number of the beats and of the primary impulses
 in which both may be perceived as separate impulses is the
 saille.
    §§      With the beats perceived as separate impulses, as
 with the primary impulses perceived in the same manner, the
 note which approaches them in number is audible.
    (11) The number at which beats and primary impulses can
 change into one note is the same.
     (12) As with beats and primary impulses, the intermissions
 of a note can also change into one note.
     (13) When the vibrations of a note vary periodically in
 intensity, the periodical maxima of vibration change into one
 note, if their number is sufficient.
     (14) The beat-note which is formed by two primary notes
 must always be weaker than the latter, although single beats
 are stronger than the notes which form them.

  The compensation method has two principal defects which
i.
the two preceding methods do not possess.
  First. The success of working a line dupliciter by the com
 ensation method will clearly depend on the possibility of
       able to close and open simultaneously two different con
tacts (4 and 5). The mechanical difficulty of doing so suffi
ciently accurately was pointed out by Dr. Werner Siemens,
   3.
and in fact constitutes one of the reasons which led him to
propose the differential method.
              The balance in each station may be disturbed
directly by a variation of the electrical condition (internal re
sistance and electromotive force) of the two batteries (E and
e) employed.
   In the preceding two methods the variation of the internal
resistance of the signalling-battery can only be felt indirectly
by affecting the balance of the distant station, while the varia
tion of electromotive force has no effect at all. Hence a given
variation in the battery or batteries must necessarily produce
                  <U+017F>º
a greater disturbance of balance in the compensation method
than in the two preceding ones. We know that even so-called
constant galvanic batteries, doing work, alter their electrical
conditions              especially their internal resistance; and
consequently this defect weighs most decidedly against the
compensation method.      In                all
                                 other respects the compensation
method has the same defects       the differential method, and
                                             as                                      in

532                  Mr. L. Schwendler                    on the General Theory
may be taken as constant, for their variation with temperature
is exceedingly small; and in case of accident (i.e. a coil break
ing or becoming shunted) nothing short of actual repair could
help.     Further, v, supposing the differential instrument to be
 properly designed and mechanically well executed, may be
 taken as a perfectly constant quantity, which certainly, as long
 as the coils or their armatures are not moved on purpose, does
 not alter of its own accord.
    The quantities left, which by variation may affect the balance
 equation, are K, R, and A.
    Of these three quantities the variation of K may become
 largest ; for         K
                   does not only contain the line-resistance, which
 is highly   variable, but K includes also the internal resistance
 of both the line-batteries, which, even for the best known form
 of galvanic battery, is by no means a constant quantity. The
 variation of the internal resistance of the line-battery in each
 station produces, of course, the greatest disturbance of balance
 in that station.
    The next quantity most liable to change of           own accord                            its

     Now we can decide on the method to be adopted for read
 justing balance. On account of the regularity-condition R= K,
  and as both undergo variation, especially K, we are obliged to
  adjust balance in the compensation branch by varying the
  resistance d, and leave the coils or their armatures stationary.
     Thus the general solution of the first problem for the com
 pensation method is :
     1. Readjustment of balance is to be effected by a variation of re
 sistance in the compensation circuit, and not by a movement of the
 coils or their armatures. By this adjustment R is kept equal to       K
permanently, no matter in which branch the variation takes place.

    & is known from the number and nature of the single cells

 sufficient strength.

                      Determination    of A and v.
    We know that Av=1, and, further, that            x=}     should   be
 selected as large as possible or v as small as possible'; but   other
                      ..
 wise it appears that no fixed values for A and v can be         ascer
tained.     If we, however, consider the nature of the variations
of R and K which may disturb the balance, viz. those varia
tions of R and K              are due to unavoidable decrease of the
internal resistance of the two batteries by the working            cur
rents, it will be seen that a best value      of A does exist, and  that
                                                       -
therefore v also becomes fixed.

thods by their own nature.       There are then remaining only
those variations of the battery-resistance which do not follow
the law of steady decrease, but which are more accidental, and
make therefore the compensation method still inferior to either
the differential or bridge method.
                       Physical meaning of               v=V;
  It has   been proved that balance in each station is to be estab
lished  by  adjusting resistance, and not by a movement of the
coils or their armatures.     Hence it will be practical and con
venient to coil the two helices above each other and have them
acting on one and the same iron core.
  Further, as v =

Therefore it will be best to coil the helix b on the top of the
helix a.

OF the
   roundings which have of late years been made and described,
none have been more     fully and carefully examined than the Tro
glodytic relics from the caves in the valley of the Dordogne. In
none have the finds been more complete, more varied, or more
interesting; in none has the enthusiastic scientific interest of an
able series of observers been more fully evidenced.
    The work has passed through many hands.         First, it was the
intention of the late Mr.   Henry  Christy, with the hearty coopera
tion of M. Edouard Lartet, to produce a work descriptive of the
results of their personal labours, which should be useful to the
 Anthropologist and Archaeologist alike. But the former gentle
 man's lamented death hindered the continued exhaustive examina
 tion of the caves; and though his executors were fully desirous of
 carrying out his wishes in the question, still his loss to some ex
 tent prevented the work reaching those dimensions which its ori
 ginal promoter ardently desired. Nor was this the only check the
 history received. M. Edouard Lartet, on whom the prosecution
 of the work now mainly devolved, passed away, and with him the
 opportunity for the completion of a careful description of the mam
 malian remains of which he was so able a judge.
     Notwithstanding these unavoidable drawbacks, the work was
 continued by Professor T. Rupert Jones, F.R.S., to whose care
 ful and painstaking editing the completion of Mr. Christy's plan
  is due ; and the book as it stands is a noble monument of MM.
  Christy and Lartet. Its general arrangement, whereby not merely
  the relics of the Cave Folk have been described, but their uses
  have been suggested, comparisons made with the habits and cus
  toms of known savage races, and monographs by able hands added
  when necessary, making the history of these singular people as
    complete as conjecture based on sound reasoning could make                  it.

                                 of
    Garonne, the sea, and the Pyrenees, was finally extended          the       to

    reached; and here the hitherto undulating country undergoes                       a
    marked change.    The valley      is   bounded      by    steep escarpments,      in

which the great flutings and projecting cornices of rock show how
the eroding action of weather has taken advantage of the relative
hardness of the limestone bands. These beds are very nearly hori
zontal, but dip slightly towards the north-west; and the irregular
action of the weathering or destroying agent has therefore pro
duced at many places, both at high and low levels, caves and rock
shelters in which the ancient dwellers of the valley lived. Thus
the cave at Les Eyzies is 100 feet above the river-level, and Le
Moustier 90 feet, while others again are but little above the level
of the extraordinary inundations of the Vézère, though now, owing
to the accumulation of a talus of limestone débris, the entrances
are often completely hidden, as in the Cro-Magnon cave, the dis
covery of which was accidentally made during the construction of
a railway approach.
    The excavations and discoveries were made at six places: at
                                                         i.
Laugerie Haute, Laugerie Basse, Le Moustier, Gorge d'Enfer,
and La Madelaine were rock shelters; at Le Moustier,
Gorge d'Enfer, and Cro-Magnon were caves; and in all these

numerous relics of human occupation and quantities of mammalian
and other bones were found buried and concealed, sometimes under
successive layers of stalagmite, sometimes under masses of earth
and detritus, resulting from the destruction of the rocky roof of
these ancient dwellings.
    The method whereby these hollows thus became places of bone
deposit had been long a subject for conjecture.      Some attributed
it to the action of wild beasts who made these caves their lairs;
others deemed the action of torrent-water washing down the re
mains of animals and filling these hollows a sufficient cause; but
that Man has had more to do with this infilling of the cave-stuff is
fully proved by the evidences of human work and art in the relics
he left behind. The first suggestion, that they were Hyaena-lairs,
may be dismissed at once, as no gnawed bones were found among
the débris; and this probably further indicates that the ancient in
habitants had some means of closing the entrances against such
intruders.
   The relics described and pictured are chiefly of stone, bone, and
antler, with some of ivory, and a few shells and other ornaments.
The particular prehistoric age or horizon to which these may be
referred can be more or less easily determined.      There are three
great periods into which prehistoric time is usually divided :-the
 surface-period, where implements are found associated with tombs
and places of sepulture; and here the relative age of each lies within
the province of the archaeologist. The Cave-period, previous to
 the construction of regular habitations for the living or tombs for
 the dead, offers with the implements only bones of animals whereby
the palaeontologist can estimate their antiquity. Then the drift
period carries us further back still in time; and here the ruder
implements are rarely definitely associated with bones, there are
no other human relics to guide us, and the determination of their
age therefore rests only with the geologist; many of the older

caves, however, belong to this era, as may be determined by the
nature of their contents.

family at least had ascended the valley of the Dordogne after a
sojourn on the Atlantic coast.
   Personal decoration is instanced by finding pieces of “soft red
haematite covered with scratches,” indicating how a red powder was
produced “which mixed with grease would furnish as good means
of personal adornment as is employed by many of the Indians of
the present day;” and pierced teeth of various animals, sometimes
marked with incised markings and carved, together with shells drilled
for suspension, may well have furnished necklaces or ornaments
which can easily find their analogue among Esquimaux or Indians
of modern     times.                                                               -
   But it is in the actual implements of war,               chase,    and domestic
life thatthe researches have been most definite.                     The materials
used were bone and stone, the latter generally flint, the former of
different kinds.
    The flint implements varied much in style and character. Some
were finely and delicately chipped to form arrow-heads and oval
lances of true Scandinavian type, as at Laugerie Basse.         Others,
as at Le Moustier, more nearly approach the drift-type of St.
Acheul in roughness of make, being mere blocks of flint, one side of
which has been reduced by chipping to a cutting edge, forming
either a tool for splitting open the marrow bones (which among all
the hearth-stuff of the caves are found so broken in profusion), or
as hand weapons for close combat in a mêlée. Manifestly what
could split the skull of an animal carried to the cave for the pur
pose of extracting the brain, could with equal facility be made to
crack a human skull of similar density.       Long even flakes of flint
with their extremities   chipped into an oval form, thumb-flints, fitting
conveniently to the grasp, were used evidently in dressing skins, or
as raspers and scrapers of wood and bone, though possibly those
which bear marks of wear and minute crushing or chipping along
the side, and hence turned “side scrapers,” were better for the
latter purpose. The flakes therefore bear marks of wear in three
ways:–first at the end, which is rounded artificially, the other being
left pointed; next at the side, the rest of the flake being untouched;
and lastly at the point, on one or both sides. This latter form may
have been produced in two ways—either by scraping a round sub
stance like an arrow-shaft, in which case it becomes a more or less
complete notch, or as a drill used for piercing the eyes of the
needles, or other holes in wood and other materials.

and as the place of attachment of one end of a lanyard of sinew
thong; or grass string, the other being attached to the shaft itself, so
that the latter, as in the arctic regions, might form a buoy if the
harpoon head were buried in the fish.       That such may have been
their use is suggested by the sketches of fishes which ornament
some of the weapons.
   But the most interesting articles in the collection are the long
implements of reindeer-horn        pierced with several large equidistant
holes and ornamented by linear carving or rows of animals, and a
long dagger poignard of deer-horn, the handle of which is artistically
carved into the shape of a reindeer.        The former may have been
arrow-straighteners, game clubs (Pogamagans), or even batons of
 office.   It is difficult to assign any other use to them. Those that
 are much perforated were evidently not weapons; and the care taken
 in the ornamentation would seem to indicate that they were either
 worn as ornaments or carried in the hand.
     The needles are carefully made and scraped or polished to a
 smooth surface, either with the flakes (“side scrapers,” which would
 account for the large number of used specimens), or by rubbing on
 a stone; and indeed several stones are figured the long narrow fur
  rows of which are exactly suitable for such a purpose.
     The sketches and markings are most various and suggestive.
  Many of them are probably owner-marks, or mere attempts at de
  coration in an idle moment; and others may from their regularity be
  tallies or the marks of gambling-tools.      A most interesting paper
 in support of this view,    and furnishing numerous authentic exam
 ples of markings for a similar purpose, is contributed by the Editor,
 which throws considerable light on the possible intention of similar
 obscure or in themselves meaningless marks.
    The animals sketched on the various fragments afford the most
 reliable means of discovering some of the habits of this ancient race.

 of which has since been proved by the discovery of equine skulls

which were in the same state of preservation as those of the rein
deer associated with them, and were imbedded in the same medley
of chipped flints and animal bones of which the bed of the cave is
composed; but though the nature of the remains was undoubted,
great reserve was exhibited in theorizing on the subject until the
important discovery of the Cro-Magnon cave pl          it beyond a
doubt that the Cave Folk buried their dead in places that had been
habitations.
   The Cro-Magnon cave, or rather rock shelter, was discovered
during the formation of a railway, which led to the removal
of the talus which hid the mouth of the cave, and the con
sequent unexpected discovery        of another “station:”     Several
successive layers of hearth-stuff and worked flints, covered by
intermediate   layers of débris which had fallen, in weathering,
from the    roof, indicated that the shelter was not always per
manently occupied, and that finally, when the height of the cave
had been considerably lessened by the accumulation of rubbish and
detritus, the back part was used as a place of sepulture, where the
skeletons of an old man, a woman, an infant not fully developed,
and other bones, surrounded by shells pierced for necklaces, ivory
pendants, worked reindeer-horn, and chipped flints, were exhumed.
   The skulls were all of the dolichocephalic type; and the skeletons
were those of persons of large stature, their platycnemic bones cha

p eriod.
   One peculiarity connected with the woman's remains is that the
skull bears the mark of a violent death, there being a clear oval hole
in the left temple which corresponds in shape and size with that
which could be made by one of the flint lance-heads found in the
caves. Whether this was the result of an accident or to an in
judicious and excessive exercise of marital authority in this ancient
dwelling is of course a matter of conjecture; but Dr. Pruner-Bey's
conclusion as to the appearance of the members of this family
deserves quotation.

    It   isexceedingly difficult       assign
                                        to        definite age

ancient remains.      Cro-Magnon, from the presence               bones    of              of
Bear, Mammoth, great Cave-lion, and Reindeer, has apparently some

                                  Notices respecting New Books.                                          557
of the oldest deposits of the series; and the successive evidences
of habitation shown by the several layers of hearth-stuff, sepa
rated by varying thicknesses of débris (the formation of which
was, if modern evidence be worth any thing, exceedingly slow),
would serve to carry the period of sepulture back to a very distant
period. The additional evidence of the heavy talus, 4 to 6 metres
thick, which had gradually formed against the mouth of the rock
shelter must not be forgotten.
     Le Moustier may even be older, judging from the rudeness of
the tools and their similarity to the drift-type, as well as to the
nature of the animal remains, Mammoth, Hyaena, and Felis spelaea,
with few relics of the Reindeer. It is possible that additional evi
dence of antiquity is found in the higher level of this cave above
the bottom of the valley.
     The others, judging from the associated remains, are more of the
same age, and were occupied when the larger animals were rarer and
 the reindeer in large numbers had taken their place. These latter
 were evidently plentiful, as the bones belong to animals of                ages,                  all
 judging from the horns.

   The “Reliquiae Aquitanicae’ furnish the best arguments in sup
port of this view in the excellent monograph on the Reindeer
by Mr. Alex. Anderson; and the other essays on the customs of
existing Indian races, the mature of implements used by them, and
the character and suitability of flint for implement-making are
most valuable, not merely to arrive at a just conclusion of the use
of the various relics in the caves of the Dordogne, but also as data
whence the value and character of other discoveries of a similar
nature may be deduced.      The illustrations are executed with ex
treme care and beauty, and the descriptions which accompany the
numerous lithographs are most valuable and suggestive.
   In the concluding words of the preface, “it must be noticed
that the resolution of Mr. Henry Christy's executors, desirous of
fully carrying out the last wishes of their brother, to give every
assistance in producing the book in the style he contemplated,
has been amply and generously fulfilled; and we believe the hope
formerly expressed has also been fulfilled—namely, that, supported

   The author described the mode                 of

sits  in
       various localities           in
                              Canada.    Dark phosphatic nodules, con
taining fragments         Lingulae, abound
                              of                the Chazy formation
                                                               in                                  at
Allumette   Island,  Grenville,   Hawkesbury,    and Lochiel. Similar

        of the Laurentian and Cambrian Rocks of Canada.             559
nodules occur in the Graptolite shales of the Quebec group at Point
Levis, and in limestones and conglomerates of the Lower Potsdam
at Rivière Ouelle, Kamouraska, and elsewhere on the Lower St. Law
rence; these deposits also contain small phosphatic tubes resembling
Serpulites.    The Acadian or Menevian group near St. John, New
Brunswick, contains layers of calcareous sandstone blackened with
phosphatic matter, consisting of shells and fragments of Lingulae.
The author described the general character of the phosphatic nodules
examined by him at Kamouraska, and gave the results of analyses
made of others from various localities, which furnished from 36-38
to 55.65 per cent. of phosphate of lime. A tube from Rivière Ouelle
gave 67-53 per cent. The author accepted Dr. Hunt's view of the
coprolitic nature of the nodules, and inclined to extend this inter
pretation to the tubes. The animals producing the coprolites could
not be thought to be vegetable-eaters; and he remarked that the
animals inhabiting the primordial seas employed phosphate of lime
in the formation of their hard parts, as had been shown to be the
case with Lingula, Conularia, and the Crustaceans.        The shells of
genus Hyolithes also contain a considerable portion of phosphate of
lime. Hence the carnivorous animals of the Cambrian seas would
probably produce phosphatic coprolites.
   With regard to the Laurentian apatite deposits, the author stated
that they to a great extent form beds interstratified with the other
members of the series, chiefly in the upper part of the Lower Lau
rentian above the Eozoon-limestones. The mineral often forms com
pact beds with little foreign matter, sometimes several feet thick, but
varying in this respect. Thin layers of apatite sometimes occur in the
lines of bedding of the rock. Occasionally disseminated crystals are
found throughout thick beds of limestone, and even in beds of mag
netite.    The veins of apatite are found in irregular fissures; and as
they are found principally in the same parts of the seams which con
tain the beds, the author regarded them as of secondary origin. The
Laurentian apatite presents a perfectly crystalline texture; and the
containing strata are highly metamorphosed. The author's arguments
in favour of its organic origin are derived from the supposed organic
origin of the iron-ores of the Laurentian, from the existence of
Eozoon, from the want of organic structure in the Silurian deposit
dcscribed by Mr. D. C. Davies, and the presence of associated gra
phite in both   cases, from the character of the Acadian linguliferous
sandstone, which might by metamorphism furnish a pyroxenite rock
with masses of apatite like those of the Laurentian series, and from
the prevalence of animals with phosphatic crusts in the Primordial
age, and the probability that this occurred also in the earlier Lau
rentian. The position of the phosphatic deposits above the horizon
of Eozoon is also adduced by the author as adding probability to the
existence of organic agencies at the time of their formation.

in the neighbourhood of Newton-Abbot.” By Horace B. Woodward,
Esq., F.G.S.
   The writer pointed out that most of the deposits termed Upper
Greensand in the immediate neighbourhood of Newton-Abbot were
in reality intercalated with coarse gravel-beds containing, among
others, fragments of greensand, chert, and chalk flint.             He con
sidered that the only traces of Greensand in situ were probably on
the summit of Milber Down and east of Combe Farm, deposits
which were identified by Mr. Godwin-Austen.                 But he could not
agree in the identification      of Greensand at other localities in the
Bovey valley, considering the few fossils found to have been derived,
and, with much other material, to have been evidently due to the
denudation of Chalk and Greensand.           He pointed out the geogra
phical distribution of these beds of sand and gravel, which extend
from the hill-tops bordering the Bovey valley to near the bottom of
the valley, but do not descend into any outlying valleys.           He like
wise alluded to the peculiar dip into the valley which affects these
beds in several places, and observed that sometimes they rested on
the Bovey Clays and Lignites. He thought that in their method of
formation some connexion might be traced with somewhat similar
deposits on the Haldon and Black-Down Hills.
   He pointed out that the “Head” at the bottom of the valley was
sometimes not to be distinguished from the older gravels, from
which, however, it was largely derived.         He alluded to the discovery
of  bones, a bronze     spear-head,  and a wooden doll or idol in this
deposit—observing       that they indicated the rapid accumulation of
gravel, and that this indication was one out of many that might be
given that our modern river-gravels are to a great extent made up
of older gravels.
   In conclusion the writer alluded to some of the deposits now
forming on the margin of the Teign estuary, and which are identical
in character with the Triassic breccia.
   4. “On certain Alluvial Deposits associated with the Plymouth
Limestone.” By R. N. Worth, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author adduced certain deposits found in fissures and caverns
of the Plymouth Limestone as furnishing evidence in opposition to
the views advocated by Mr. Belt in his paper on the Drifts of Devon
and Cornwall”.      The best examples occur at Plymouth Hoe, where
the chief   deposit  fills a large “pocket” in the limestone, and con
sists (beneath the turf) of a bed of clayey soil, containing pebbles
and small boulders, beneath which are patches of white and red clay
containing a few pebbles and overlying a large quantity of siliceous
sand.    Similar but slightly varying deposits not unfrequently occur
in association with the Limestone; and these are regarded by the

author as the remains of considerable deposits which once occupied
large areas in the valleys of South Devon; and if they are not the low
land gravels of Mr. Belt, the latter are not represented in the district.
The author states that there is evidence of the contemporaneity of
these deposits with those of the Oreston caves; and he adds that
they furnish no proof of cataclysmal action, but of orderly deposition,
the bulk of the pebbles and gravels being inland, nearer the source of
the débris, and further off the sands and clays, in fairly regular suc
cession.   The author further explains the presence in Cornwall of
stanniferous gravels only in valleys opening to the south, by refe
rence to the position of the watershed in that county, which has only
two rivers running to the north, whilst on the south-east rivers
abound.

    2. “The Physical History of the Dee, Wales.”             By Prof. A. C.
Ramsay, LL.D., F.R.S., W.P.G.S.
    The author stated that he regarded the valley of the Dee as mainly
preglacial throughout, and sketched the physical history of the
region through which it runs.         The Silurian rocks were much dis
turbed and denuded before and during the Carboniferous period, and
the Carboniferous Limestone was deposited very unconformably on
the upturned edges of both Lower and Upper Silurian strata, and
once spread all over the region, probably overlain by the Millstone
grit and Coal-measures, as now in the east of Denbighshire and
Flintshire. The region was again disturbed and elevated during the
formation of the Permian deposits; and then by subaerial denuda
tion a great part of the Carboniferous series was removed down to
the old plain of denudation of the Silurian rocks, the surface of
which thus probably stood higher than it does at present, being in
the midst of a broad continental area.         From a consideration of the
conditions of   deposition   of the Mesozoic and Tertiary formations the
author concluded     that, from the beginning of the Permian to that of
the Glacial   epoch,  the  higher  ground of Wales was land well raised
above the    sea, except    perhaps  during the deposition of the Chalk,
                    of all
and that   during       this  period    was exposed

of this investigation are as follows:—After the last important dis

           Volcano   of the District of Schemnitz, Hungary.                     563
recognized as volcanic products of a comparatively recent geological
period, while the “granite, syenite, and greenstone” were regarded
as being of far more ancient date. By Won Pettko, Richthofen, and
all the more recent investigators of the district, however, it has been
clearly perceived that the “greenstones” are certainly, like the
andesites, of Tertiary age; and hence such names as “greenstone
trachyte” and “propylite” have been applied to them.                The
studies of the author of the present memoir, both in the field and
in the cabinet, have led him to the conclusion that the granitic,
porphyritic, and lava rocks—which were formerly called “syenite,”
“greenstone,” and “trachyte” respectively—are all of similar com
position and equivalent age, and that they differ only in their more º
or less perfect state of crystallization, the result evidently of varia-2
tion in the conditions under which they have consolidated. He is
further led to regard the metamorphic masses around the several
intrusive centres as being not, as has hitherto been maintained, of
“Primary” (Devonian or Permian) age, but simply Triassic rocks
 affected by local or contact metamorphism.
    The real structure of the great Schemnitz volcano was first recog
nized by Won Pettko in 1848, though this author erroneously
regarded it as presenting an example of a “crater of elevation.”
The history of the formation and destruction of this volcano is now
shown to be as follows:—After some small and scattered outbursts
 of rocks of acid composition towards the close of the Oligocene
 period, the grand eruptions of andesitic lavas of the Miocene began,
 through the agency of which a volcano of larger dimensions than
 Etna was gradually built up, by both central and lateral eruptions.
 In the midst of this volcano a crater of enormous dimensions was
 formed, doubtless by some great paroxysmal outbreak; and by the
 subsequent subsidence of the mountain the sea gained access to, and
 by denudation greatly enlarged the area          of,
                                                 this “caldera.” Then
in   the central lagoon     of
                            the caldera    number
                                             a         minor eruptions,

 firstof  acid and then       basic rocks, took place; and the volcano,
                                 of
 which  at this period     its history must have closely resembled the
                            of

    a paper presented to the Academy, April 13, 1875, I showed
INthat the application of armatures to two straight electromagnets,
which formed the primary circuit of a Ruhmkorff coil, more than
doubled the strength of the induction-current produced by breaking
the primary circuit. When, however, the circuit of the secondary
coil was not closed, and a spark was allowed to jump across the
                               its
                       poles, the striking-distance      the spark, and

    In this Table the numbers are the deflections of the reflecting
galvanometer expressed in millimetres.           In this case the gain by
the use of the armatures was trifling, being only about 14 per cent.
These results were obtained by charging the condenser of 3 of a
                                                                 -
farad by sparks one millimetre in length.
    On a closed secondary circuit, however, a gain of one hundred
per cent, was clearly shown in the strength of the induced current
produced by breaking the primary circuit.             The question of how
to make this    great  increase in the  strength   of the induced current
by the employment of armatures manifest in the spark became an
interesting one.      It  seemed at first as if the application of arma
tures, by maintaining the temporary magnetization of the iron cores,
would be detrimental rather than otherwise.
    I next tried the effect of bundles of thin iron plates, which were
placed as armatures upon both poles of the electromagnets, thus
making a magnet of a horseshoe form. Oncharging the condenser
I  found a very great increase in quantity, which was manifested
by the swing of the galvanometer-needle, the indications being en
tirely off the scale. Table     II. shows the results obtained by the
use of iron plates ºr of an inch in thickness, twenty in number,
constituting    each armature.

    Here a gain of four hundred        per cent. was manifested by the
 use of the thin plates.
    The next step was to ascertain how many plates were necessary
 to obtain the maximum effect.         The difficulty of obtaining plates

566           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
of the same homogeneity made it impossible to obtain smooth
curves.    To this difficulty was added that of breaking the primary
circuit in a regular manner.
    If the results of Table     III.  be plotted, it will be seen that the
increase within small limits is very nearly proportional to the
number of thin plates (which were ºr of an inch in thickness).

    On increasing the number of plates, a point was reached where
there was no additional effect. The best result was obtained where
the mass of the armatures was approximately equal to that of the
cores of the electromagnets.          Plates of ºr of an inch thickness
were also used; but no advantage resulted in their employment,
over those of #5 of an inch.           It would seem that the thin plates
followed the same law as the bundle of fine iron wires which
constitute the cores of induction-coils of the present day, and
that only a moderate degree of discontinuity in the mass of
iron submitted to magnetic influence is necessary to prevent the
formation of currents of induction, which prolong the magnetism
of the cores and prevent the quick demagnetization necessary to
produce intense currents of induction.               The effect of insulating
the thin  plates   with thin   dielectrics,  like   paper,  was also tried, with
no gain in effect.      There appeared to be a slight gain by placing
the plates edgewise on the poles of the electromagnets, instead of
 allowing them to repose on their flat sides.               This was doubtless
 due to better contact of the metallic surfaces.
    Since the above results proved conclusively a very great gain in
 quantity and electromotive force by the application of thin plates
as armatures,    I  next measured the striking-distance of the spark.
 Table IV.  gives   the results, which are the mean of many trials.

    A curious fact came up in this connexion. The lengthening of
 the spark was not shown when the spark leaped directly between

electromotive force was only made manifest to the eye by the em
ployment of condensers in the secondary circuit.       The results in

large capacity.    The increase in the quantity and electromotive

form  “feldspar;”      and      also  Mawes,   so  his ‘Descriptive Cata    in
logue' (1821), and Townson,              his “Philosophy   inMineralogy’                             of
(1798); and Nicholson,              his  “Dictionaryin    Chemistry,  like                     of

 adopts essentially the same, though taking for the first syllable the
 Swedish spelling “felt-spar,” as given in Wallerius (1743). Again,
 Haidinger's English translation of Mohs (Edinburgh, 1825) has
 “feldspar.”     Further, Jameson in his edition of 1804 uses “fel
 spar ” with a caveat ; for he adds in a note at the bottom of the
 page, “More properly feldspar.”
     Kirwan appears to have decided the question in favour of
 “felspar” for all his successors (or at least set the current in that
 direction) by means of a piece of bad etymology.           He says, “This
 name seems to bederived from      Fels," a rock,” it being commonly    found
 in granite, and not from Feld, “a field;” and hence write it thus,             I
felspar.” Kirwan recognized the Germanic origin of the word.
 But he must have reached his decision without taking German works
 for authority.
    Among the Germans “feldspath” (meaning field-spar) (“felt
 spat” or “ffilt-spat” of the Swedes) is the only form that has ever
 been used. Wallerius, in 1747, nearly forty years before Kirwan
 issued his first edition, and Cronstedt, in 1758, nearly thirty years,
 used the term “felt-spat” or “filt-spat” in their treatises; and
 Grimm, in his German Dictionary, the latest and best, has “feld
 spath,” and not “fels-spath.”        There can hence be no dispute as
 to the true  spelling or derivation.    “Feldspar” therefore is the right
word    among   those who    speak  English.
    French mineralogists have conformed, with a rare exception,
to the German style, they retaining the d. Thus it is with
Des Cloizeaux (1862), Dufrénoy (1844–1860), Huot (1841),
 Beudant (1824, 1832), Brochant (1808), Haüy (1801–1822), Romé
de Lisle (1783), Démeste (1779). But Brongniart (1807) thought,
like Kirwan, that “feldspath" must be a corruption of the “mot
originaire felspath;” and hence, as he says, he “restored to the
mineral its first name.”         Later French mineralogists have not
followed Brongniart's example.
    In the United States, “feldspar,” except in sporadic cases (a
consequence of British example), has been the adopted form.              It is
the word used in the works of Dana (1837–1868), Shepard
(1832–1857), Robinson (1825), and Cleveland (1816–1822)*.
                                 º
    Thus British mineralogists are at present alone in using “felspar.”
There is nothing in favour of the word, unless it be        fewer letters its                 by
one, and     its
               smoother pronunciation; and such reason for change,    a
if  acted on, would make havoc             good English.

    The case between “feldstone” and “felstone”              very similar is                  to
that between “feldspar” and “felspar.”              The original German
word   is “feld-stein,” one long since introduced into the science, and
not fels-stein. Fels-stein would          bad    be   as

 thods of investigation require to be carefully reviewed.

discordant             magnitude, but sometimes even opposite; (3) Mr.

Huggins's observations give very similar results for great number                              a

ON A     SIMPLE AND VERY ACCURATE             METHOD     OF TUNING TWO
              Forks To UNISON. BY ROBERT          SPICE,   F.C.s.
    Though the optical method of tuning, of Lissajous, gives good
results,  I find that two forks thus tuned to unison may be a fraction
of a vibration out, without in any way disturbing the steadiness of
the figure.
    In the 2nd edition (English) of Tyndall's ‘Sound,’ in Lecture VII.,
the author says,        “I  divide this jar by a vertical diaphragm, and
bring one of the forks over one of its halves, and the other fork
over the other.         The two semicylinders of air produce beats by
their interference.       On removing the diaphragm, the beats continue
as loud as before, one half of the same column of air interfering
with the other.”
    Dr. Tyndall does not, however, mention the fact that precisely
the same result would have been obtained if no diaphragm had been
employed; yet this is so. When two unison forks are struck on the
knee (or by a piece of lead covered with leather) and then held
 together over their proper resonant column, the following phenomena
will be observed.
    If there   is a difference between their rates of several vibrations,
there will of course be rapid beats; if the forks are very nearly in
tune, the beats will succeed each other at long intervals; further,
when they are almost perfectly in tune, there will not be any beats
properly so called, but after the sound of the forks has nearly died
away, it will rise or swell out again very slightly, proving that there
had been interference.
    Finally, when the forks are absolutely alike, there will be a gra
dual decrease of sound, down to silence, without any reinforcement
 at any time.
    I find that, to carry out this tuning absolutely, both forks must
be at the same temperature; consequently, after using a file on one
of them,     I   place both forks in a vessel of water to equalize their
temperatures, wipe them dry, and test them. To show the accuracy
 of this method,     I select the following example:—
    A pair   of Ut" forks (256 vibrations) will sound over a column for
about 135 seconds.        Suppose that the sound decreases up to the 100th
 second, and then begins to rise; obviously 100 seconds is the time
 of half a beat, or 200 seconds the beating-time; that is to say, it
will have been demonstrated that one of the forks gave            ºr  of a
vibration per second more than its fellow.
    What has been said of the unison applies to other intervals.
    I have recently executed by this method Ut, Ut, Ut, and Ut.
forks for the physical cabinet of Columbia College.—Silliman's
