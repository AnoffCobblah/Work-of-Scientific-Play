        I.    The Fundamental        Atomic Laws of Thermochemistry.
                          By     WILLIAM SUTHERLAND+.
        HE    of Thermochemistry have been made the subject
                 data
        of many general suggestions as to relations and laws
  holding amongst them, but these suggestions have          the                    for
  most part remained undeveloped and uncoordinated.                                 It   is
 true that Thomsen and Berthelot,          whom we owe theto
greater part      the splendid
                        of      accumulation      experimental     of
material, have ever had                  in
                             view the deduction     generaliza          of
tions from their data wherewith     enrich chemical philosophy
                                                to
 on     the      side   of  energetics: thus Berthelot discovered his
principle         of    maximum heat; and Thomsen marshalled the
                                                                                         of an

                    in     was able he   show the operation
                                                      to
some beautifully    simple principles.     Unfortunately    few                    a
invalid assumptions and speculations introduced        Thomsen           by
        to his
into     theoretical systemization                   of
                                       carbon thermochemistry
seem      have made many chemists afraid that they have
involved his whole system      their invalidity.

these  assumptions  are quite unnecessary,   and when banished
from Thomsen's system leave his discoveries          grand un       a
obstructed main road into the region                       of

2            Mr. W. Sutherland   on the Fundamental
only, although by his experiments he also put upon a satis
factory footing the only general principle that has yet been
discovered in organic thermochemistry;     namely, the principle
practically enunciated in different forms by Hess, Andrews,
and Favre and Silbermann, that in the formation of salts in
solution from their elements each atom contributes an amount
of heat which is approximately independent of the other atoms
with which it is associated. More recently Tommasi (Comptes
 Rendus) and others have occupied themselves with this law,
 which indeed has for some little time been installed in text
books as the one generalization of value that the thermal
branch of chemistry has yet contributed to the science. Quite
recently Dieffenbach (Abst. Journ. Chem. Soc. 1890, p. 1206)
has tried to show that also in entering into the molecule of an
organic compound, an atom of an element always produces the
same amount of heat; and there is no doubt that this has
been a fair enough hypothesis with which to investigate the
accumulating store of experimental material, but it will be
made manifest in this paper that this hypothesis must be
abandoned in favour of one which provides for a dependence
of the atoms on one another in the matter of heats of com
 bination.                                      -
    The present paper embodies an attempt to unfold the
 fundamental atomic thermochemical laws in operation both
amongst inorganic and organic compounds.           In the First
Part, after an introductory chapter, the laws regulating the
thermochemistry of the haloid compounds of the metals are
developed ; and in the Second Part Thomsen's theoretical
systemization of carbon thermochemistry will be gone over
step by step with a view to eliminating a few principles that
seem untenable, and to re-stating his discoveries in terms
harmonious with the principles which will be shown to rule
the greater part of thermochemistry.
    One of the chief conditions which contributed to Thomsen's
success in the handling of the data of the thermochemistry of
the carbon compounds, was that he studied the heat of for
mation of the compounds in the gaseous state. The ideal
condition in which the data of thermochemistry should be
presented is that in which they relate to the heat of formation
at constant volume of the gaseous product from gaseous
elements; for these would be the pure heats of formation of
the compound molecule from the elementary, unmixed with
latent heats or heat spent in external work.     In the thermo
chemistry of the carbon compounds the latent heat of vapori
zation of carbon is unknown, so that Thomsen was not able
to put his data actually into the ideal condition, although he

did so as nearly as he could. But considerable progress can
be made in the thermochemistry of carbon compounds without
a    knowledge     of the heat of vaporization of carbon; for
many     different types of compound involving the same number
of carbon atoms in their molecules can be studied, and in the
differences of their heats of formation the unknown quantity
disappears.   Still, in striving for more comprehensive results,
Thomsen made certain assumptions in order to obtain, as a
singleknown quantity, the unknown latent heat of the carbon
molecule plus    heat    its         of
                        formation from atoms. These have
       stumbling-block    many chemists                                       on

6                      Mr. W. Sutherland                           on the Fundamental
critical temperature, v the volume of a gramme at that tem
perature, and M the molecular mass, c being a constant the
same for all bodies.       Now the surface-tensions of a number
of solids at their     melting-points,    or, more accurately, of a
number of liquids at their solidifying-points, were measured
some time ago by Quincke (Pogg. Ann. cxxxv, p. 138), and
quite recently by Traube (Ber. der Deut. Chem. Ges. xxiv.
p. 3074).     Quincke's data relate to a number of metals and a
few   salts, and Traube's to a number of salts of Na and K.
It is obvious that there must be a certain amount of roughness
in the measurements at the high temperatures of the melting
points of these bodies, and there is also an inaccuracy in the
equation by which Quincke calculates the surface-tensions
from the experimental measurements; but there is a com
pensating cause at work, and it may be said that both
Quincke's and Traube's data give a fairly accurate estimate
of the surface-tension at the meiting-point, if
                                                                                        in all

 with the solid element S to produce the solid compound RS
 with evolution of heat q, then, to obtain the evolution of heat
 when S as gas combines with R as gas to produce gaseous RS,
 we must add the latent heat of vaporization of R and of S
 and subtract that of RS: denoting these latent heats by L(R),
 L(S), and L(RS), and the required heat of combination of
 the gases by H(RS) we have
                     H(RS)=q-L(RS)+L(R)--L(S).                            .    . (15)
    There remains now only to give tables of the experimental
 data and the values of M*l calculated from them by equations
 (7), (11), and (13), and of Mlp/J or L, the latent heat per
 gramme-atom or gramme-molecule due to molecular force; L
is given in kilocalories.                As the application of (11) to the
metals       brings     out some      immediately          interesting results, the

   The first fact deserving attention in this table is that in
each  main family Mlp/J or L, the latent heat of vaporization
per gramme-atom due to molecular force, is constant. Thus, in
the first family it is about 8.7, and in Cu and Ag about 37 or
about four times the value in the main family; in the second
family the value is about 23-6, and for Zn and Cd about 18:5,
which is much nearer to the value for the main family than
was the case with Cu and Ag, a fact that is probably Con
nected with the greater chemical similarity of Zn and Cd to
the main family than is the case with Cu and Ag.          The third
main   family  is represented in the table  by  only  two members,
 Al and   La,      sºft
                      have practically the same value for L, the
 mean being 26-0, while in the related sub-family Ga has
 a value which is one third of this, just as that for Hg is one
 third of that in        main family;
                              its            has     value whichIn            a                           is
 nearly   a half     thatof   the main    family.
                                         in              the fourth                  At
 family we reach        point a  transition, after which the sub
                                              of
 families have more the character of main families than the
main families themselves.           the fourth main family
                                               In                   have                            we

For    Fe, Pd, and           Pt
                        the values are about 60.             interesting           It   is
 to   note how the latent heat       per  gramme-molecule         due                                     to
molecular force increases with the valency                order       the          or               of

                L,is                          the first row the mean

above  assumption.    From what is known of the saturation
densities of ordinary vapours, it is likely that with the true
volume of mercury vapour the value 14 for the latent heat
                                    º
would be reduced to at least 13, of which about one eleventh
part is due to doing external work; so that the pure latent
heat of liquid mercury      is about 12 kilocalories for the
gramme-atom.      The latent heat of fusion of 200 grammes of
solid Hg is 6 kilocalories; so that the latent heat of vaporiza
tion of solid mercury is about 13 kilocalories per gramme
atom.   The value              in Table I. for the latent heat
due to   molecular force is 7-8, and therefore the total latent
heats would appear to be 1-6 times the tabulated values.
   When the values of l are calculated for the metals by equa
tion (7) with Quincke's values for the surface-tension, certain
discrepancies with the values in Table I. appear, which were
remarked                         “A
                     Kinetic Theory of Solids” in an indirect
                    on    in
manner.   These discrepancies now appear to be due to varyin
molecular complexity in a few of the metals, and it would lea
us      too    discuss them

     The haloid compounds of the metals have been chosen as a
 group in which thermochemical law might be expected to be
 most easily discernible.            The following table of data for their
 heats of formation has been derived from Thomsen's data in

20                Mr. W. Sutherland                  on the Fundamental
   The first conclusion to be drawn from inspecting this table
is one unfavourable to the view of those who hold that each
atom in passing from the elementary to the combined state
evolves a fixed amount of heat irrespective of the atoms with
which it combines; or, in other words, that the heats of com
bination can be separated into thermochemical moduluses
or parameters characteristic of each element : for if this
were so, then the columns headed Br–Cl and             in this                 I-Cl
table   ought  to be   constant, whereas the large  variations
in these columns establish the fundamental principle that
the amount of heat evolved on the combination of two
atoms depends on certain mutual relations of the atoms, a
point that Beketoff appears to have been most strenuous in
insisting on, and also Berthelot.    Now in the case of com
pounds formed in dilute solution, it has been proved that in
a large number of cases the heat of formation is independent
of mutual relations between the reacting atoms, and may be
expressed as the sum of moduluses characteristic of each; and
thus it will be seen that our first result is calculated to throw
new light on the nature of solution, for it shows that in the
process of solution certain mutual relations of the atoms of
the dissolved molecule cease to be operative.
   The second conclusion which can be drawn from this table
is that the ratio of                  Cl– I
                                     to Cl–Br is nearly constant,
because the   large  departures     in the case of Ag and Hg do not
count for anything, seeing that with them. Cl–Br is so small
that      its
          value    relatively greatly altered
                       is                                relatively smallby
unavoidable errors        the values for
                                 in               and          Cl

from    constancy   are real         due    or  errors,  but under the

are represented by the form N × 1-06, in which N is an
integral number characteristic of each metal; as Jº (Cl)—wl (Br)
remains constant, the values of V (R) for the metals are pro
portional to a series of integral numbers.
  It will be well to arrange these integral numbers according
to the natural classification of the elements; the values for
#Sr and Ba can be derived from the values for                                           Cl–Br in

   This table shows that in each main family the integer
decreases with increasing atomic mass : if the value for $Sr
were 9 the series of values in the Mg family would run 11,
10, 9, 8 ; in the zinc family the series is regular, namely,
9, 6, and 3; but the data are not extensive enough or
accurate enough to make sure whether in each natural family
the integers form an arithmetical progression; however, the
data of the last table are very suggestive of the probable truth
of the following addition to our third result, namely, that the
values of Jº (R) in each family form an arithmetical progression.
   An inspection of the heats of formation of the iodides in
Table V. leads to our fourth conlusion, for it is noticeable
that there is a large range in the values from 742 for KI to
–6, or say 0 for HI. This makes it probable that in

 that  in the halogens as elements, atom is combined with atom
 to form the diatomic molecule, in contrast to the state of
 affairs known for at least the five monatomic metals Na, K,

24              Mr. W. Sutherland               on the Fundamental
passing from the value for Sr to that for #Ba the increase is
only 1-0, but the value for Ba is quite uncertain. The
differences for the three members of the Li family are not
regular, being 7 from Li to Na, and 2-7 from Na to K, the
latter being close to the values 29 and 26 in the Mg family.
Both in the Li and the Mg families (R) increases with
increasing atomic mass; but in the Cu and Ag family we find
a diminution of (R) in passing from Cu to Ag, the decrease
in (R)/3.8 being 3-0, which is close to the 29, 2-6, and 2-7
already found in the other families.  It is interesting to find
on passing from Zn to Cd that the value of (R) is stationary,
 for like Cu and Ag these two metals form a subfamily, and
 might be expected like them to have (R) diminishing with
 increasing atomic mass, but they are much more closely
 related to their main Mg family, which might be expected to
give increasing (R) with increasing atomic mass; the two
tendencies appear to neutralize one another and leave (R)
stationary.    More data are required before the law regulating
 (R) can become clear, and these are specially desirable for
the compounds of the rarer metals of the Li and Be families,
that is for the haloid compounds of Rb and Cs, and of Be and
Ba. Beketoff has made determinations for the compounds of
                              I
Rb in solution, but have not seen any determinations of the
heat of solution of RbCl, RbBr, and Rb1 ; Petersen has also
made some determinations for Be, but not complete.            It can
be seen that the most    important   thermochemical   experimental
work for immediate requirements is the determination of
such hitherto undetermined data as will enable a table to be
drawn up showing the heats of formation of the haloid com
pounds of       all
                the metals, reagents and products being           the       in

not give us any light at present, but it is evident that they
form a very interesting group for thermochemical study. The
oxides, sulphides, and selenides have not been              in
this paper, because their melting-points being unknown it is
not possible to calculate their latent heats.
   In the next part of this paper it will be shown how the
principles ruling amongst inorganic compounds apply to the
organic.

                          ORGANIC CoMPOUNDs.
    The method which it is proposed to pursue in this part is
 simply to follow Thomsen in the successive steps of his gene
ralizations in the fourth volume of his Thermochemische
 Untersuchungen, and to retain the greater part of his con
clusions which are valid, while rejecting a few that are
invalid, or putting a more valid interpretation upon them
than was given to them by their discoverer.     have gathered    I
from abstracts of   papers published  by  Thomsen since the
fourth volume of his great work, that he has himself aban
 doned some of the unsound conclusions.        Armstrong has
supplied English chemists with a sketch of Thomsen's theo
of the thermochemistry of organic compounds in the Philo
sophical Magazine (5th series, vol. xxiii.), along with some
criticism of some of the more extremely heterodox opinions
on chemical constitution advanced by Thomsen.     This second
part of the present paper will form another similar sketch,
the repetition being unavoidable in the interests of clearness
and the new point of view.
   Thomsen confined his attention to the data determined by
himself for about 120 compounds, apparently because he had
taken some trouble to devise a method of determining the
heat of combustion of              all
                               substances   vapours, and wished
                                                   as
to avoid   making    uncertain corrections for latent heat      the               in

calories in the values which they obtain for the heat of
combustion of a gramme-molecule  of the same substance, it
cannot be conceded that Thomsen's values attain an accu
racy warranting the retention of his figures for hundredths
of kilocalories, especially as his desire to obtain heats of
combustion for substances only in the form of vapours con
strained him to use experimental methods liable to greater
experimental error than belongs to other methods. Accord

may be     taken that the heat of combustion of CH2 is constant,
and    therefore the heat of formation and attachment of CH,
to   a nucleus is to be taken as constant.  Let CH, be attached

      H(X, C, H,)=(X)+(C) +2(H)+f(XC) +2f(CH),

nothing, therefore the heat of combustion of OC=CO would
be   121.1.Now this compound may be supposed to be burnt

double the gaseous volume, and then being burnt as 2CO,
which is known to give out 135.9 kcal.    Accordingly, 135.9
minus 58 for the doubling of the volume minus r, for break

The differences in both cases ought to be the same ; with
Thomsen's data it is +3.1, whereas with Berthelot and
Matignon’s it is —11:1.      It is quite clear that none of
Thomsen's   exceptional results for the haloid compounds can
be accepted under such conditions of experimental uncertainty,

  Along with this we had better take the equations for gaseous
 H20 and gaseous H2O2, namely,

2(0)+2(H)+2f(OH)+f(0-0)=45,              or 2f(OH)+f(0-0)=45.       (29)
Now we ought to take f(OH,)=2f(OH), which would give us

therefore from (27)
                         f(CºO) = 15. .   .  .  .   .   .  .   (32)
    Thomsen's second result for the alcohols is that the heat of
formation of a primary alcohol is less than that of the
isomeric secondary and tertiary alcohols; thus for propyl and
                                       j
isopropyl alcohols the difference is 5:3, for isobutyl alcohol
and trimethylcarbinol it is 17:1, and for isoamyl alcohol and
dimethylethylcarbinol it is 9:6. These differences are larger
than those found by Louguinine (Compt. Rend. xci.), namely,
2 for propyl and isopropyl alcohols, and 5 for amyl alcohol
and dimethylethylcarbinol.     Thus the values of the differences
in the heats of formation of isomeric alcohols are too irregular
to encourage any further study of them at present until a
better guarantee of experimental accuracy can be given.
    4. Ethers.-In the simple and               oxides, as in the
 haloid compounds, Thomsen adopts slightly different values
 for his fundamental constants, namely, vi =vs     –  13-9 instead
 of 14.2, and r=1576 instead of 15, and then, as in the ethers
 two carbon atoms are joined by an oxygen atom, he finds for
 the thermal value of such junction 2 x 15-76; the reason for
 adopting different values for the fundamental constants is that
 it gives a greater uniformity amongst the values of this
junction derived from the heats of formation of eight ethers
 in Thomsen's list; but if the old values for v and r are re
  tained the values of the heat of junction of an O atom to two
  C atoms only vary within limits which do not exceed those
 possible by reason of experimental error. In our symbols this
  2 x 15-76, which Thomsen treats as the heat of junction of two
  C atoms by one O, would be f(C-O-C), and taking the old
  values r=f(CH)=15, f(C-C) = f(C:C) = 14.2 we get for
 f(C.O.C) the following values:–in dimethyl ether 35, in
  methylethyl ether 37-7, in diethyl ether 432, in methylpro
  pargyl ether 37-3, in methylallyl ether 37.8, in diallyl ether

acetonitrile, and propionitrile from solid amorphous carbon
are —27-6, -163, and –10.8, so that the values of p + ad
are 10-9, 60-5, and 104.3, the differences between which are
49-6 and 438, the latter is practically equal to the 442 due
to CH, in homologous series, but the former 49-6 is larger by
5.4 kcal., on the strength of which Thomsen proposes for
HCN an entirely different constitution    from that of the
cyanides; thus he treats acetonitrile as H.C.C.; N and pro
pionitrile as H.C.C.. N, but hydrocyanic acid as H-C-N,
and then he assigns the thermal values of the junctions C : N
and C-N as 7-6 and 2:4.      For cyanogen C, N, the heat of
formation is  —65-7,  and p + ad=11:1, on account of which

50           Mr. W. Sutherland              on the Fundamental
   10. Nitro-Compounds. –The values of p-H ad for nitro
methane and nitroethane are 55'8 and 101.9, from which
Thomsen subtracts 3 r and 5 r + r respectively, having as
mean remainder 11-8 for the heat of forming the group NO2,
                          i.
and attaching it to a carbon atom in the CH3 or C, H, but for
the junction of C and N by a single bond Thomsen takes his
former value 2-6, so that 9-2 remains for the heat of formation
of NO, but according to experiment this heat of formation
is really — 84; and            concludes from this discrepancy
that the nitroparaffins cannot contain the group NO2,                                            pro
ceeding to show that according to his thermochemical con
stants the nitroparaffins must be regarded as paraffins in which
two atoms of H are replaced by the two groups NO and OH.
   But we shall see immediately that there is no necessity- to
assign this improbable constitution to the nitroparaffins, for,
accepting the orthodox constitution such as HAC                        -N-3                       We
have in our notation the equation
                     f(CN)          +2 f(N:0) = 11.8;              .        .        .       .   (52)
but in our study of the oxides we gathered that f(N: 0) is
small and might be taken as zero, and in the amines f(C. N.)
was seen to be probably small, say zero ; thus equation (52)
discloses a secondary effect which will be discussed in con
nexion with another to which we proceed.
   For the nitrites of ethyl, isobutyl, and amyl, Thomsen gives
the following values of p + ad, namely, 105-6, 1984, and 236:6;
but for the formation of ethyl, isobutyl, and amyl we have the
expressions 5r-H    v1,
                     9r-H 3vi, and 11r +41.1, whose values are
892, 177-6, and 221:8:            that for the formation
                                      so                    the                          of

                                                to
the alkyl radicals we have the values 16:4, 20:8, and 14.8,
of which the mean       17-3, whence the equation
                          is
                  f(CO)--f(N-0)              +  f(N:0)=17:3,                    .        .       (53)
                                    f(C-0)=17:3,          .    .       .        .        .       (54)
a result    harmony with the values 18:5 and
            in                                  formerly                        15

   Now for ethyl nitrate the value           115:5; sub
                                                      p

and   itsattachment            to   ethyl    the value        26-3,         whence the
equation

and therefore             f(C-0)=263,
which is larger by 9 than the value just found in (54), just
another such discrepancy as we found above in (52). To try
to understand this, let us reproduce side by side equations
(51) (52) (53) and (55) and (43)         :-
  In   the amines with triad    N,
                         f(C.N)=0     nearly ;
in the nitroparaffins with pentad        N,
                        f(C.N) +2 f(N:0)=11.8;
in the nitrites with triad N,
                  f(C.O) + f(N-0) + f(N:0)=17:3;
in the nitrates with pentad N,
              f(C-0)   + f(N-0)+2/(N:         O)=263;
in N2O, with pentad N,
                       2 f(N-0)+4    f(N:0)=0.
  If we  remember that f(CºO) is about 18:5, we see that the
one consideration which will harmonize the five equations is
that the introduction of a second N: O binding into an N
atom connected with C or with O connected with C, is
attended by an evolution of about 10 kcal. Whether this,
besides harmonizing the five equations, is a true phenomenon
would require more experimental facts to decide; but, mean
while, we can claim that the nitroparaffins and the nitrates
agree in showing the mutual operation on one another of
atoms which are not directly connected, and that there is no
necessity to devise a new structure for the nitroparaffins to
explain their thermochemistry, because the nitrates by the
same token would also require an amended constitution, which
is very improbable.
   11. Sulphur Compounds.-Thomsen's data for the heat of
formation of the sulphur compounds relate to solid rhombic
sulphur : the latent heat of vaporization of a gramme-atom of
sulphur, according to Berthelot's table of latent heats, is only
2.3 kcal.; so that it is only necessary to increase Thomsen's
heats of formation by 2:3 per gramme-atom of sulphur to get
                                º
at least approximate values for the heat of formation from
gaseous sulphur.    In the following table are given    p all

                        SUMMARY    of RESULTs.
     The present theoretical analysis of thermochemical data has
been confined almost exclusively to those compounds whose
heat of formation can be separated into parts due to the
mutual actions of atoms which, according to the bond theory,
 are joined by bonds, the action between atoms which, though
 in the same molecule, are not joined by bonds being negligible
 in a first approximation.       Thomsen showed that the great
 majority of organic compounds belong to this class, and his
 method of analysis consisted in determining the value of the
 various bindings in organic chemistry, a binding being a
 pair of bonds which are joined to one another; and in the
 first part of this paper it was shown that in the haloid com
 pounds of the metals the heats of formation are so related as
 to prove that the heat of formation is the sum of two parts,
 one depending on the metal and the other on the metal and
 the halogen.      But there exists another class of compounds, of
 which the ammonium salts may be taken as a type, in which
 the mutual action of unconnected atoms becomes of the first
 importance, for the four atoms of H in NH,Cl profoundly
 affect the thermal attitude of the N towards the Cl from what
 it is towards each Cl in NCls; but this class of cases, which
  is small, has not been discussed in the present inquiry, which
 has been, as far as possible, limited to such thermal relation
 ships of directly connected atoms as show themselves free
 from large perturbations due to other atoms.
      By not allowing for such perturbations Thomsen was led
   ºx
 to assign peculiar and untenable structures to several com
    ounds; but when allowance is made for them and the
               structures are removed, the remainder of his ana
  lysis constitutes a pioneer advance into the region of thermo
  chemical law. Thomsen's method of expressing his results
  was in accord with his discovery, for he assigned to each
  binding a thermal value. In accordance with the results for
  the haloid compounds of the metals      I have adopted a slightly
   different mode of expression, and have separated the heat of
   formation of a compound RS into three parts, (R), (S), and
 f(RS); of which (R) depends only on R, and (S) on S,
   while f(RS) depends on both R and S. In the haloid com
   pounds of the metals     I was led to conclude that (Cl), (Br),
  and (I) are    zero, while the corresponding parameters for the

                               Atomic Laws         of Thermochemistry.                             55
   metals do not vanish.  By analogy it was assumed that (O)
   and (N) are both zero, though from a mathematical point of
   view   it does not matter whether they are zero or not; for in
   (R) + (S) + f(RS), to assume that (R) is zero is the same as
   merging  it in f(RS). The values determined for f(RS) from
   Thomsen's data for organic compounds are as follows:—
fº C)=14.               f(C:C)=14.2.        f(C:C)=0. f(CH) = 15. f(C.O)=185 and                        15.
fº))=53.                f(CN)=0.           f(C.N) =0, f(C:N)=0. f(OH) =29-5.
f00)=–10.               f(0-N)=0.         f(0:N) =0, f(NH) =38. f(SH)=25.
fic S) =0.              f(CS)=9.                            f(N.N)     =0.
      The association of the bindings C-O and C:0 in one atom
   of C causes an evolution of 15 ; and the association of two
   bindings C:0 in one atom of C causes an evolution of 30;
   the conversion of tetrad to dyad C causes an evolution of 15.
   The introduction of a second N: O binding into an N atom
   connected with C or with O connected with C causes an
   evolution of 10.
     The first point to be noticed in these results is that the
  functions f(RS) cannot be taken to have the form V(R)\V(S),
  as we found to be the case when R is a metal and S a halogen:
  in fact the data are too few to give any reliable cue to the
  form of the functions.     But as regards their numerical values,
  the second   point to be noticed is that zero occurs eight times,
  zero  standing   for a value too small to be assigned in the
  present state of thermochemical analysis.         The third point is
  that the value  15,   or  nearly  15, occurs six times; while the
  value 29-5 is  nearly   twice  15, and 53 nearly three and a half
  times 15. Of the remaining values one is 3:8, which is almost
  exactly a quarter of 15 ; another is 18-5, which exceeds 15 by
  almost a quarter of 15; and the rest are          10, 10, 2:5, and 9.–
  Thus it appears that nearly                      all
                                      the values could       expressed            be

As such an hypothesis, if true, would be of fundamental
importance to chemical and physical philosophy, it is to be
desired that it should be thoroughly tested by experiment.
Indeed it appears that the present need on the experimental
 side of thermochemistry is the determination of the heat of
 formation of             all
                  the typical organic compounds, and       the                                      of

therefore                         p+    cºR      = cF       cos   ).
  Solving for           c   we get
                                                                                           -

suspected * that a lower value for the constant would give
more accurate results.       Formulae involving two or three con
 stants have also been proposed and applied in experimental
 investigations    by Robinson,        Dobrandt    (l.c.), Stellingt,
 Dubinskyi, and others, but they have not come into general
use, at least in this country.

meters have been fairly numerous. An account of the principal
ones prior to 1887 is given by Professor Cleveland Abbe in

 complete theory the wind's action on the arms and stays should
 be taken into account.
   The frictional forces are exerted on the supports, the
 rotating vertical axis, and any machinery driven by the arms.
 These forces are of at least two distinct kinds.  Supposing no
 wind to blow,  but the cups rotated by hand, there is a frictional
force such as exists when a heavy body rotates on a horizontal
table.   When wind blows, the rotating vertical axis is pressed
against the surfaces guiding              with force which  it,      practi

presumably       two kinds—tangential viscous action and normal
pressure.          If of
                 the air were         “perfect fluid,” only the latter

experiment can hardly be absolutely conclusive.         The com
parison instituted by Mr. Dines * between the experimental
results he has found for a long narrow blade moving in air
and the formula established by Lord Rayleigh for an infinitely
long rectangular lamina, which a stream of perfect liquid
meets normally or obliquely, shows apparently a pretty fair
               .
qualitativet agreement. But experiments under considerably
more varied circumstances would be required to determine
how closely the one set of results accorded with the other.
   The application of Lord Rayleigh's formula to ordinary
square       rectangular plates, instances of which are recorded
by Prof. Cleveland Abbe (l.c. p. 243),            need hardly be            is,   it

     $4.To get a preliminary general idea of the driving action
of the wind, let us suppose each Robinson cup replaced by a
thin plank, infinitely long in the vertical direction and of
horizontal breadth b, the planes of the planks intersecting—
if we imagine them continued inwards—in the axis of rotation,
and suppose each plank attached to a horizontal         arm of
negligible section.   Let each arm and plank be rotated with
negligible velocity round the vertical axis, while a horizontal
wind blows with uniform velocity v.    Let a denote the incli
nation of the wind to the normal to the plank ; then, treating
 the   air     perfect liquid,

           now propose to look at the matter a little differently.
 The couples acting on the instrument at any instant are
 primarily three          :-A
                       couple such as pu"Rºlf (y) in (b), where
 f(y) may be in reality a function of R, R/l, and v/V.                                        A
 couple –(8+yU*) arising from the friction opposing the
 motion, where y is probably a function of R, R/l, and v/V,
 but not of the mass turning ; 8 is proportional to the mass
 turning. A couple arising from the viscous action of the wind
 which may be taken as opposing the motion.         Provisionally
 it may  be supposed to be of the form
                                            —   KV-K'e,
 where      K and    K" are constants.
      During      a revolution of the cups v is usually nearly con
 stant—more nearly so than V, most probably, as a rule.
 Thus we may expect to approximate closely to the true motion
 by treating the driving force as having at any instant the
 mean value it would possess throughout a complete revolution
 during which V and v retained unchanged their instantaneous
 values". The equation of motion so derived would be

If thewind is high the term c.V* must preponderate, if c2 be
not zero, and v must be positive as the cups always move
convexity first : thus cº must be positive.
  Consider next the equation

approximately deducible from
                c,(W/v)*—2b,(W/r)—a, =0. . . . . (19)
   Now for any given value of V experiment shows that a
steady state is possible. Thus (19) must have a positive root.
Now W/v is certainly not less than 2, and so if b, were nega
tive it would be necessary for as to be at least 4 times the
numerical sum of b, and c, to allow of (19) having a suitable
 Yositive root. , Professor Stokes", however, in treating          of
   r. Robinson's results, decided that they fitted a formula
such as (19) best when in it ag/ha and aa<U+017F>e, were supposed
small or even zero. The alternative that b, is positive is thus
much the most probable.              If
                                   a, b, c, are, as we suppose, all
positive, there is but one change of sign on the left-hand side
of (19), a result in accordance with the observed fact that for
any given wind-velocity there is only one steady state.
      he term —ao in (14) can hardly answer to anything but a
frictional force, presumably between metal surfaces, opposing
the motion, so there can be little doubt ao is positive.
    As to the signs of ai and bi there is more uncertainty.                                       If
ai were a negative quantity, then, supposing as small, the
right-hand side of (16) might become positive when v lay
within certain limits; this would imply that               during            if,                  a
calm, the cups were given        suitably selected initial velocity,

                                      The Steady State.
   § 10. The         first application to be made of (14) is to the
steady state.
   In high winds, as already indicated, a close approximation
to the value of V/v is supplied by (19).    Now for the same
anemometer,    at least when in a                         uniform state of lubrication,
a, b,   c, are constants, so that                         in high steady winds V/v is
practically independent of V.
   Each of the coefficients a, b, c, contains a part arising
from the wind’s driving action which varies with the arm l,
                                                                                     º
and a second part arising from the friction which is associated
with the horizontal pressure produced by the wind’s action;
the latter part is practically independent of l, but varies with
the coefficient of friction, and with the arm d at which the
º
frictional forces act. Thus, if two anemometers in which
the friction and d/l are widely different give nearly identical
values of V/v in high steady winds, then there is a stron
presumption that the frictional forces of the species
are unimportant in both.     The ratios as : b, ; c, do not depend
directly on the weight or inertia of the instrument, so in
high steady winds these factors would seem of secondary
    n light winds -ao—a, v-biV may no longer be neglected.

     From (22) we see the velocity              of the cups has a mean
value     5, and has a harmonic variation of the same frequency
p/2t     as the wind but different in phase.              From (23) we see
                                                     i.
that 5 is the    velocity     the   cups  would have in the steady state
answering to a wind of uniform velocity V.                                Thus the
deduction of the       space    traversed   by  the             in a time large
compared to 27t/p, from the value of \rdt in the ordinary
way is practically as satisfactory in this case as in that of a
steady wind.
    As to the details of the cups' motion, we see from (24) and
 (25) that the phase and amplitude of the harmonic term in v
depend both on the frequency of the harmonic change in the
wind's velocity and the mean value of that velocity.
    If  the frequency be small and the mean velocity great,
then approximately

     To deduce the true physical significance                                      of    (52) we must

Consequently,                assuming ba<U+017F>a, positive, (vº-v")(v;                             –    “...)    has

                                         Summary.
     The principal conclusions to which the formula (14) leads
are as     follows:—
     1.   In steady winds          the     ratio of the true wind-velocity to
that of the cups may, in any given anemometer, be expected
to be nearly constant when the wind is high.          But there is
no reason to     expect  this constancy   when the wind is low,
especially in cases where there is considerable friction owing
to thickness in the lubricant or any other cause.
   2. In steady winds the runs of two anemometers in which
the friction is small may be expected to stand in a nearly
constant ratio so long as the wind's velocity is considerable,
but in light winds this constancy of ratio cannot be expected.
   3. When the wind is not steady, changes in the velocity of
the cups take place much more slowly than the changes   -   in the
wind’s velocity to which they are due.
   4.     If
          the wind's velocity is nearly uniform, but has one or
a series of small harmonic variations, the action of the cups is
conspicuously to smooth down these variations when rapid,
without introducing appreciable error into the estimate of
the mean velocity.
   5.
          If,
           however, the wind's velocity has large and frequent
oscillations, the anemometer       addition      smoothing down
                                                 in             to
the oscillations   exaggerates  the mean    velocity.    This ex
aggeration increases with the extent                       of
                                             the fluctuations                         ;    it
is greater          in
                 case where the interval
                      a                        time between suc

                                                   than       case              in

where the converse occurs.
  The formula (14) from which these conclusions flow                                  is   in
part   least empirical.

IV.    On the Use of an Iodine Voltameter for the Measurement
   of Small Currents.     By E. F. HERRous, F.I.C., Professor
   of Natural    Philosophy,  Queen's College, London".
      HE   instruments in general use for the direct measure
       ment of currents by electrolysis, as in the determination
of reduction factors of galvanometers, comprise the hydrogen,
silver, and copper voltameters: each of these possesses cer
tain advantages, but none is free from defect. When occasion
arises to make a large number of determinations of relatively
small currents, the difficulties attending their use become more
manifest.
    Some of the defects of the ordinary types may be briefly
stated.     The hydrogen voltameter, consisting of platinum
plates immersed in dilute sulphuric acid, has the following
disadvantages:—
    1.  It acquires a large counter electromotive force of pola
rization, so that the current, on first joining up, is very
inconstant.
    2. Its internal resistance is subject to considerable fluc
tuations, according to the rate and mode of disengagement of
the electrolytic gases.
    3. Oxygen present in the dilute acid, or migrating from
 the anode, diminishes the amount of hydrogen collected, and
 so causes the current to be underestimated.
    4. When small currents are being measured, the bubbles
 which cling to the electrodes or sides of the graduated tube
 cause an appreciable error.
     5. Calculation of the current-strength is rendered difficult
 owing to the necessity for correcting the volume of gas for
 temperature, barometric pressure, and for the tension of
 vapour of the dilute acid employed, which last is frequently
  not exactly known.
     In the silver voltameter the foregoing objections do not
  hold, with the exception of No. 3; for dissolved oxygen has
  been found to affect the yield of silver, a greater amount
  being obtained when the electrolysis is conducted in vacuo
  or hydrogen than in air.      But in the silver voltameter the
  experimental difficulties in washing, drying, and weighing, it
  may be only a few centigrammes of silver, involve a large
  expenditure of time ; or if the weight of deposited silver      i.
  increased by prolonging the current, the difficulty of main
  taining it constant is greater.
      The difficulties which exist with silver are still more

able to conduct an extensive investigation on the thermo

low temperature and that of the boiling-point of water ;

The absolute zero of this wire is —283°0 in terms of its own
platinum temperature.
   Platinum temperature as measured by this thermometer
is given by the equation
                            pt = 35.25R-257:42,
where R is the resistance of the wire at pt’.
  The platinum temperature of solid carbonic acid in ether at
760 mm. is —81°3 platinum degrees by this thermometer ;
and the platinum temperature of liquid oxygen boiling under
760 millim. is        –
                193°3 platinum degrees by this thermometer.
   We find that the number representing the platinum tem
perature of liquid oxygen boiling under 760 mm. when taken
by the working platinum thermometer P, is not quite identical
with that given by the standard platinum thermometer P1.

     We propose to reserve for a future communication a full
discussion of the interpretation   of these curves and the
bearing of the facts they disclose on the usually accepted
thermo-electric theory.  Meanwhile it may be sufficient to
note that none of these thermo-electric curves are true
parabolas over their whole extent.     Many of the curves
as drawn in the chart in Plate IV. are curves of double
curvature, and in some cases point to the existence of
more than one neutral point with lead.      We propose to
convert this chart of electromotive forces into a chart of
thermo-electric powers, in which last condition it will lend
                                   ..

                 I. Proof of Van't    Hoff's Constant.
   T is well known that it         was Wan't    Hoff who first drew
       attention to the fact that the        equations     representin
the   generalizations     arrived at   by  Boyle,
Avogadro in the case of gases are equally applicable to dis
solved substances, if the osmotic pressure of the molecules
of the dissolved substance be substituted for the pressure
of the gas.
   Wan't Hoff deduced these laws for solution from thermo
dynamical considerations—a method which gives them                    in
creased validity, and illustrated them from the osmotic
experiments of Pfeffer and de Vries.
   At the same time Wan't Hoff was able to establish a thermo
dynamical relation between the osmotic pressure of a dissolved
substance and the molecular lowering of vapour-pressure;
molecular lowering of freezing-point of the solution thereby
furnishing a rational basis for the empirical generalizations
of Raoult and of Babo and Wüllner, who had previously
investigated the same point.
   In Van't Hoff's thermodynamical argument the solutions
are assumed to be very dilute, and hence their experimental
verification is specially important for the case of very dilute
solutions.
    The   determination of the molecular depression of the
 freezing-point is the safest and most convenient method of
 testing the validity of these generalizations, and this has been
 done for moderately dilute solutions by Wan't Hoff himself

126                       Proof of Van't Hoff's Constant.
   Thus, by this plan, the constant 1:87 or 1.88 appears very
satisfactorily in the case of sugar and urea, and in the case of
alcohol the constant is only about 1% per cent. too small.        The
general run of the values of 8 in the cases of cane-sugar, urea,
and alcohol, shows that in the more concentrated solutions the

values obtained for the molecular lowering of the freezing
        are greater than 1:87, and that it is only as the solutions
  ecome more dilute that the constant 1:87 becomes apparent.
Now Van't Hoff's laws were only deduced for very dilute
solutions, for “ideal” solutions.
   This year          I
                     repeated    the investigations of cane-sugar,
alcohol, &c. under more favourable conditions, where no closed
ice-cap but ice-bands or network of ice are formed round the
Hg bulb of the roooº thermometer, and the convergence tem
perature was under the freezing-point temperature.                The
difference in the   capsules   is conditioned  by the differing of the
ice-crystal, which is brought into the over-cold liquid to crys
tallize    it.When the convergence temperature              under the             is

 132                 Dr. M. Wildermann     on the
 distinguishes    Loomis's method in a great many points, are
 affected  with greater experimental errors than Mr. Loomis
  supposes   to be possible. The results which I have obtained
        ". Tº
 with
                   thermometer by a method which by far sur
 passes Loomis's method in precision, are more or less of the
  same character (see Table II'.).      At the same time with the
  observations recorded above and made with a Tºot,” thermo
  meter on cane-sugar, urea, and alcohol, similar observations
 were made with a rhoº thermometer.           The results obtained
  are affected by experimental errors of from 0°001–0°-002°,
 and even occasionally greater; and that means that we cannot
  use the Tºo,” thermometer for minute readings in very dilute
 solutions.    For with the lºo" thermometer we have to deal
 with experimental errors which cannot easily be removed or
 eliminated.     In the first place it is not easy to avoid errors
 of from 1 to 2 thousandths degree in making the readings,
 even with the use of a microscope and a micrometer-scale,
  although with the method mentioned above we are able to
 observe the obtained freezing-point during the 10 to 15 minutes
 occupied making several readings; the more must that be
 the case with other methods, where the obtained freezing
 point can be observed only a short time. Now even in
 solutions which are only diluted to 25 or ºn molecule-normal,
 an experimental error of 0°.002 makes a difference of about
 3 to 5 per cent. (in the case of non-conductors) in the lowering
 observed, and therefore also in the calculated molecular
 lowering of the freezing-point.       The Tºo? thermometer can
therefore in very dilute solutions only give us qualitative data.
             II.  Proof of Arrhenius's Generalization.
     We proceed to the generalization of Arrhenius. Van't    Hoff
 showed by four different methods, that a law analogous to that
 of Avogadro was valid for solutions of non-electrolytes like
 cane-sugar; it then became of importance to account for
 exceptional cases in which the depression of freezing-point
was abnormal, and in particular the cases of salts, acids, and
bases in aqueous solution.      The explanation was given when
Arrhenius showed that by two independent quite different
methods, the observation of lowering of freezing-point and of
 the electrical conductivity of a solution, the same value would
be obtained for the factor i, which denotes the ratio of the
pressure actually exerted by the substance to the pressure
which the substance would exert if it consisted entirely of
undissociated molecules.
    Arrhenius made determinations on about 40 bodies in mode
rately dilute solutions of various concentrations and verified

                                      Proof of Arrhenius's                                                                Generalization.                                     133
         the law more accurately.                                                                 From the intimate connexion which
         exists between Van't Hoff's laws and the dissociation theory,
         it follows also that the generalization of Arrhenius may find
         a more exact experimental confirmation        in dilute solutions.
         Therefore a more exact confirmation of the generalization of
         Arrhenius in very dilute solutions is not           important on                                                                        ..i.

   In  these Tables are given under a<U+017F> the degrees of dis
sociation as deduced from the freezing-point, when the value
of Van't Hoff's constant is taken to be 1-87; as gives the
degrees of dissociation as determined by electric conductivity
by a careful interpolation.   The result is that the agreement
between the values a' and a, is excellent.   I think, therefore,
that the latent heat of ice is more correctly estimated at 80
than at 79 cal. It appears that the degrees of dissociation
deduced from the freezing-point     under     are somewhat                 all
smaller than those deduced from electric conductivity. Now

 mate connexion which exists between Wan't Hoff's laws and
 the dissociation theory,           follows that the law

    HIS digest of Books and Papers published during the year
      (1893), with an Introductory Review, is a welcome continuation
of three former volumes, already noticed in the “Philosophical
Magazine.' The subjects taken in order from page 1 to page 301
are:— 1. General Geology; 2. Stratigraphical Geology; 3. Palae
ontology; 4. Palaeobotany; 5. Mineralogy; 6. Petrology; 7. Eco
nomical products; 8. Maps and Sections relating to England and
Scotland.     Notices of notes and memoirs on Foreign Geology,
published in Britain, taken in much the same order as the above,
occupy pages 302–353.         Three good Indexes are found at pages
355–365.
   The aim of this work is to provide annually for students of
Geology a condensed account of                  all
                                           that has been done         the               in
science so far as the British Islands are concerned.           For this
purpose the various papers and other publications are classified
under larger and smaller subdivisions,                 so
                                               that the whole work                           is

fully abstracted.      The “Introductory Review” aims          giving           at            a
succinct account          the general progress

between 550 and 740, and the accounts of them, varying in length
from 17 pages downwards, have for the most part been revised by
the respective authors.     While serving as a guide to the original
papers, the “Annals” is primarily intended for those who cannot
see the originals at all, and is therefore planned so as to contain
in itself in the course of a few years the whole body of recent
Geological knowledge in this country.
   We are glad to find that there is an increasing public support
of this useful work; and that, if the present volume proves to be
self-supporting, we may look hopefully to      future.                           its

exception    of those on Dinas Island, and have a general east-to-west
strike with a high dip to the north.            Arenig Slates occupy the
southern     part  of the district.    Typical   Llanvirn Beds with the
Placoparia-fauna occur at Fishguard, and above them the Didymo
graptus Murchisoni-zone of the Lower Llandeilo is found. On this
horizon are the first traces of volcanic activity: acid lavas and tuffs
are here interbedded with the slates. The Middle Llandeilo is partly
faulted out in Goodwick Bay, and near Newport is penetrated by
huge intrusive sheets of diabase. The Upper Llandeilo is marked
near its base by a thick zone of lava-flows, which are overlain
by fossiliferous shales.     Hartfell graptolites have been found in the
overlying grey and black slates.            The lavas and breccias on
Strumble Head are held to be on the same horizon as those
near Newport.
    All the lavas are acid; some are soda-potash felsites. Nodular,
banded, and perlitic structures are sometimes visible.              Crypto
crystalline,  microlitic, and   micropoikilitic types of groundmass are
possessed by these lavas; the latter type is held to be probably
 a contact-phenomenon.         The intrusive masses consist of diabase,
 with important tachylytic and variolitic modifications.

 Lobley, Esq., F.G.S.
    The author submits considerations (chiefly derived from the
characters of the earlier sediments) which lead him to suppose that
crust-folds have not been produced by continuous contraction of
the Earth, and that the planetary heat and mean radius of the
Earth have been practically invarible during the period which has
elapsed since Cambrian times.

Fishes in the Nile and the Jordan Waters.’              By Prof. E. Hull,
M.A., LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    The author summarizes the evidence in favour of the existence
of barriers in post-Miocene times, separating the Mediterranean
area into a chain of basins.          He brings forward arguments in
support of his contention that the waters of the eastern (Levantine)
basin became fresh during a period when the area of evaporation
 was smaller, and the supply of river-water greater, than at present.
Into this freshwater lake the waters of the Nile would flow directly.
He has elsewhere given reasons for believing that the Jordan Valley
 from Lake Huleh to Arabah was the bed of a lake over 200 miles

  150                    Geological Society :-
 long, and at least 1300 feet above the present level of the Dead Sea.
 He suggests that the waters of this lake escaped into the Levantine
 basin through the plain of Esdraelon.       With such physical con
 ditions existing, the fauna of the Levantine basin would have a
 means of spreading throughout the whole system of waterways
 connected with it.
    In conclusion the author adds some observations on the changes
 which occurred in the Mediterranean area subsequent to the post
 Miocene epoch of earth-movement.
    3. ‘On the Loess and other Superficial Deposits of Shantung
 (Northern China).' By S. B. J. Skertehly, Esq., and T. W. Kings
 mill, Esq., C.E.
    The following deposits are described       in the order   of their
 antiquity:—
    1. Recent Fluviatile deposits.
    2. Marine sands with Cardium, Ostraea, and Bulla, extending to
 a height  of 200 feet above sea-level, and indicating former sub
 mergence to that amount.
    3. Old River-gravels, often resting on loess, and possibly contem
poraneous with the marine gravels.         They furnish part of the
evidence relied on by the authors for supposing the existence at
 that time of a climate moister than the present one.
    4. Loess.
    5. Basement-gravels having the same relation to the loess that
the Upper Greensand bears to the Chalk.
   The loess east of the Pamirs is extensively developed over an area
of over one million square miles. It is sometimes over 2000 feet
thick, and occurs up to several thousand feet above sea-level.
   Evidence is brought forward by the authors with the intention
of establishing the absolute want of connexion between the Chinese
loess and the present river-systems, its original stratified condition
(as shown by variation of tint and horizontality of layers of con
cretions), and its subsequent rearrangement to a great extent.     The
absence of marine shells is discussed, and the suggestion thrown
out, with diffidence, that the shells have been destroyed by per
colating water.
   The authors give their reasons for supposing that the loess is a
marine formation, and state that the sea need not have reached to
a higher level than 600 feet above the present sea-level, for the
Pamir region where it occurs, 7000 feet above the sea, is an area of
special uplift.
   They maintain that there are no proofs of the glaciation of
Northern and Eastern Asia, so that the Chinese loess can have no
connexion with an area of glaciation.   They state that the zoological,
ethnological, historical, and traditionary evidence alike point to the
former depression of Asia beneath the sea, and the subsequent

  1.   Contributions to the Palaeontology and Physical Geology of
the West Indies.     By J. W. Gregory, D.Sc., F.G.S.
   The earlier part of the paper is largely concerned with the corals
of the raised reefs of Barbados, and, on account of the confusion in
the synonymy of the West Indian corals, the synonymy of the
species is given in some detail.   A list of the mollusca of the Low
level reefs follows.
   The occurrence of the “Oceanic Series’ of beds over wider areas
than generally recognized is proved by the existence of Radiolarian
Marls in Cuba, as announced in the discussion on Messrs. Jukes
Browne and Harrison's paper (Q.                      J.
                                       G. S. vol. xlviii. 1892).  The
author gives a list of species of Radiolaria from the Cuban deposit,
all of which are also found in that of Barbados.      Additions to the
fossil fauna of Antigua are recorded.
   In discussing the age of the Barbados  rocks, the author states
that there is now no doubt that the following is the sequence (in
descending order):—
    -                           Low Level: Pleistocene.
 Raised Coral Reefs.
                           {{...,    Level   :    Pliocene.
                            Archæopneustes-abruptus-           (Miocene (and possibly partly
 Oceanic   Series ......   limestone.                               Pliocene) and partly   Oli

 Scotland Beds ......... Oligocene (probably Lower).
 The fauna of the Low-level Reefs proves their late Pleistocene age.
Until more mollusca are collected from the High-level Reefs, it will
not be possible to decide whether the whole are Pleistocene, or
whether some must be included in the Pliocene; it is probable that
the latter will have to be done. The Scotland Beds are referred to
the Oligocene.      This narrows the limit for the time of formation of
the deep-sea oozes.        Further light is thrown on this question by
examining the evidence for the period of submergence of the Panama
Isthmus, from consideration of the resemblances of the marine
faunas on either side, and the earliest migrations of terrestrial
animals across the Isthmus since            elevation. itsThe author puts

  2. “The Whitehaven Sandstone Series.                                          By      J.   D. Kendall, Esq.,

with a radius which is greater than half the arc between the
two poles. These circles cut each other.          Let the points of
intersection be joined by the arc of a great circle.      That arc
is the  projection  on the sphere   of the  edge  produced   by the
intersection of the two    particular  faces, the normal radii of
which we have assumed to be equal.
   When the lengths of the radii are taken in any other ratio
than that of equality the position of the edge is shifted, but
its                                        always perpendicular

 projection        of

   By   well-known rule the excess of the sum of these angles

above two right angles divided by four right angles, gives the
area of the triangle as a fraction of the surface of a hemi
sphere. Corners delimited by more than three edges can be
specified in the same way by splitting up the polygons which
subtend them into triangles.             The secondary figures thus
described on the surface of the sphere are always different
from the primary ones.           Thus, the corners of the cube, when

circle No. 2 already drawn.          In actual construction the coin
 cidence was within half a degree. The method just described
 for finding the pole of No. 2 is inconvenient in practice.
 When the quadrant has been clamped at 66; it is slipped
 along No. 0 to what appears to be a likely position, and the
 position of the pole of the meridian corresponding to it is
 marked on the globe.         It is now applied to No. 1 at a likely
 place, and the position of the pole of the meridian corresponding
 to it is marked.              If
                         the first experimental position of the pole
 of the meridian be called a and the second b; then, from the
 pole of circle No. 0 with radius equal to the distance of a
 draw a small circle, it is necessarily parallel to No. 0; and
 from the pole of No. 1 with radius equal to the distance of b
 draw another small circle, which is necessarily parallel to
 circle No. 1. These are the same small circles as those above
 described, and the great circle described from their intersec
  tion as pole is necessarily identical with No. 2 already drawn.
  In making the construction on the globe the pole of No. 2
  was found in this way. Small circles can be drawn with the
  metrosphere, but they are much more easily and accurately
  drawn with a pair of compasses.          The position of the circle
  as drawn was    proved   by  measuring    the inclination of      plane               its

    These constructions were made with no greater care than is
 absolutely essential in carrying out any quantitative graphical
 work, and the plane angles agree within 13° of the theoretical
 values.   With the very greatest care, errors of half a degree
 cannot be insured against with a globe of 22 centimetres and
 a metrosphere divided into whole degrees.       With a larger
 globe and divided circles, especially adapted to this kind of
work, greater accuracy could be obtained ; but when the
errors do not exceed one degree, the angles obtained are
sufficiently exact to be used in the construction of models,
which always forms the crucial test of the student's work on
the globe or in crystallographic composition.
    By an exactly similar construction we lay down circle
No. 3 representing face No. 3, and on measurement we find
for the positions of circle No. 3–(151}*, 65%%), and edge
No. (2, 3) (25°, 61°). When we now come to face No. 4, it
is inclined to No. 0 at 66," and to No. 3 at 53°; we have
therefore to find a great circle which cuts No. 0 at 66% and
No. 3 at 53°.                        -
   The operation presents no more difficulty than when the
angles were equal. The quadrant of the metrosphere is set
to 66%2 and applied to circle No. 0; then it is set to 53° and
applied to No. 3; experimental poles being marked in each
case giving the radius of the small circles to be drawn from
the poles of Nos. 0 and 3 respectively.       The intersection of
these circles marks the   pole  of the great circle sought, No. 4.
The   quadrant  is now set either to 53° or 66;"; if to 53°, then
it is applied to circle No. 3 and slid along it until the pole of
the meridian is in the intersection of the two small circles.
The meridian of the metrosphere then coincides with circle
No. 4, which is accordingly drawn. When the quadrant, set
to 664°, is applied to circle No. 0 and slid along it till the
pole of the meridian is again in the intersection of the two
small circles, the meridian ought to coincide with the circle
No. 4, already drawn. This construction was carried out and
the resulting great circles fell less than half a degree apart.
The coordinates of the plane are (209°, 66°). Circle No. 5
is inclined at an angle of 664° to both                     its
                                               neighbouring faces
and is  laid down exactly      No.   as           2.

172      Use  of the Globe in  the Study of Crystallography.
    Set a pair of compasses to a span of 68°, which is the supple
 ment of 112°, and with this radius describe small circles from
adjacent extremities of the diameters (0, 1) and (0.2). These
circles cut each other in one point in the hemisphere. The
position of this point is found by measurement to be azimuth
 238°, and altitude 48.2. Through this point and the zero of
azimuths (0°, 0°) draw a great circle which marks the position
of the circle representing face No. 1. Also through the
points (238°, 48%) and (11.2°, 9°) draw a great circle which
 is parallel to face No. 2. The arcs intercepted on each great
 circle by the other two are 112°, and they represent the plane
angles of the three faces meeting in the corner; with the
 quadrant clamped at 90°, place the meridian on the points of
 intersection of No. 1 with Nos. 0 and 2, and the altitude of
No. 1 is found to be 54°.       By similar measurement the alti
tude of No. 2 is 54°.         Therefore the faces 1 and 2 make
angles with face No. 0 of 54° or 120°, according as the inside
or the outside of the solid is considered. When the metro
sphere is placed so as to measure the inclination of Nos. 1
and 2, it is found to be 53%".       The azimuth and altitude of
the point of intersection of Nos. 1 and 2, which have been
found by measurement to be 238° and 48%, give the position
and direction of the edge made by Nos. 1 and 2. The alti
tude 48° is also the inclination of the edge made by two of
the faces to the third face.
    Let the plane angle on No. 0 be 120°, and the plane angles
on Nos. 1 and 2 be 108° and 90° respectively. . By exactly
the same construction we find, on measurement, that the faces
which fulfil these conditions are inclined 0 to 1 at 73%, 0 to 2 at
58°, and 1 to 2 also 58°.       The edge formed by Nos. 1 and 2
meets the sphere in 210° azimuth and 58° altitude.             The
plane angles here assumed are those of the square and the
regular hexagon and pentagon.
    If the edge made by Nos. 1 and 2 lies in azimuth 220° and
altitude 50°, the base angle being 120°, to find the inclination
of the faces and the plane angles of 1 and 2. Great circles
are drawn through the points (0°, 0°) and (220°, 50°) giving
circle No. 1, and through (120°, 0°) giving No. 2.             The
angles which they make with each other are then measured and
found to be     :–0   to 1, 61°; 0 to 2, 50°; and 1 to 2, 534°.
The    plane  angles  are:—on No. 1, 118°, and on No. 2, 97°,
the   angle  on No. 0 being given 120°.
    The resources of the globe are inexhaustible ; but the above
examples may suffice for the purpose with which this paper
was written ; namely, to inform some, and to remind others,
of the usefulness of the globe as an instrument of research.

there is only one plait on the surface, the vapour-liquid plait,
which determines the coexistence of a vapour-phase and a
liquid-phase.     The plait, roughly speaking, has the direction
of the   c-axis;  its plaitpoint, which will make           appearance                      its

This was called retrograde condensation                 the first kind               of

condensation,    was explained by retardation", which was
annihilated in   my experiments for the first time by means of
a small iron stirring-rod within the tubes, which was moved
by an electromagnet outside the tubes.
   5.        If
          P lies on the other side of R there are again two
definite critical temperatures, TP and TR, for every mixture;
but the process of condensation between those two will be
different from what it was in the first case.   By compression
a new phase appears of a larger volumet this time, i. e. a
vapour-phase, which begins by increasing, then reaches
                                     ...
a maximum, and then again diminishes and disappears.
This was called retrograde condensation of the second kind
(r.c. II.)f.   Near the plaitpoint-temperature    Tp the liquid
will be very flat and        and more so at the beginning
than near the end of the condensation. Below Te the con
densation is normal.
  6. This second case has never been realized                      till now.      I
have been  considering whether it might be, and the choice of
the subject of this paper is the outcome of my reasoning.
In explaining this 1 shall use a different graphical represen
tation, namely the p—t figure.     In a recent paper § I have
deduced the   general features of the p—t curves in the problem
before us from van der Waals's theory.     The figure obtained
consists of (1) the two vapour-pressure curves of the compo
nent substances; (2) the border-curves | for the mixtures
(a = constant) having the form of loops; (3) the plaitpoint
curre, being the envelope of the border-curves and connecting
the critical points of the two substances. The point of con
tact between a border-curve and the plaitpoint-curve corre
sponds to the plaitpoint P of van der Waals's surface; the
critical point of contact R is the point in which the border
curve has a tangent parallel to the p-axis. When going along
the border-curve,   starting from                       its
                                       lower branch, we may

My attention was at last drawn to ethane, a substance of low
critical pressure (+50 atm.) and a critical temperature of
 +34°C. Combinations of this substance with                  C, H2,
N20, especially the last, promised good results.

                               expected to find a case such as is
represented in fig. 1.   It will appear that my expectation has
 been surpassed in so far as these mixtures happen to offer some
 interesting properties which had never been observed and
 require a more complex representation than fig. 1. At the

still: the increase of pressure was 0.43 atm. at the same
temperature *.
   15. The critical temperature of the gases was determined
very carefully: as with the mixtures, a stirring-rod had been
put within the tube, and so the determination could be con
ducted according to the principles explained in the account of
my observations with CO,t.       The critical temperature for the
two samples of ethane amounted to 31°95 C. and 32°05 C.
respectively.    This would point to a critical temperature of
 +32°3 for     pure  ethane.   By admitting a little air (3 to #
per cent.) into the last tube the increase of pressure at 20°C.
rose to 2-7 atm., i. e. more than six times the former value ;
while the critical temperature had gone down to 31°25 C.
This would point to +32°2 C. as the real critical temperature
of ethane. The admixture in my ethano seems to                    far                 lie
below 0.1 per cent.

 180                Dr. Kuenen           on the     Critical Phenomena of
 from C.H.I.    But the difference may be due to the method
 of determining  the critical state as well. In my experiments
 the retardation is entirely annihilated by carefully stirring
 the gas, which may have lowered the critical temperature.
                        Results obtained with Nitrous Owide.
      18.Similar results were obtained with this gas.        The
increase of    pressure, however,  was still less. At 20°C. it
amounted to 0-15 atm. = 11 cm. of mercury. The impurity
 of the gas may be estimated below 0.0002: for the critical
temperature I obtained 35°95 and 36°05. The true value
will be 36°1 C. probably.
   19. Villard, who has prepared pure nitrous oxide by a
similar process", fixes the critical temperature of his gas at
38°8 C. But this value was obtained by the indirect method
of measuring the densities. The liquid surface disappeared
below 38°C., but he does not mention an exact value. This
gas must have been very pure, judging from the regular
phenomena obtained near the critical point, and the purity of                                .
the carbonic acid prepared in the same manner.           Villard
states that in a U-tube in which two quantities of liquid
N20 were separated by a column of mercury, a pressure of a
few centimetres sufficed to liquefy one of the portions com
pletely.    But this test is not so delicate as the one given
above, viz. the entire increase of pressure from the beginning
to the end of the liquefaction f.
   20. The constancy of my results with the pure substances
and the smallness of the admixture left, justify me in accepting
an influence of the admixture upon the behaviour of the
mixtures of a similar small amount.
     * Villard,C. R. cxviii. p. 1096; Journal de Phys. [3] iii. Oct. 1894.
In  a letter Dr. Villard tells me that his estimation       of the critical
temperature has been too high.    In turning a tube with N2O at 36°-5 C.,
the liquid surface disappeared and the tube filled itself with a blue mist.
Now as stirring comes to the same as repeated turning, it is quite natural
       I
that obtained a value for the critical temperature below 36°5 C.                        I
have not noticed the blue mist more than 0° 2 or 0°3 above 36°0 C.
At any  rate the disagreement between Villard's result and mine has been
reduced to a few tenths of a degree.        But it appears from Villard's
measurements of the densities of N2O, that the behaviour of this substance
near    its
         critical point   less normal,
                                is                    so

figure may be compared with fig. 1, which represented the
curves as they would have been if the phenomena had been

   The curve C2H6–Cl is the vapour-pressure curve for ethane,
N,0–C, the same for nitrous oxide. C, and C, are the
critical points.      C1ABC, is the plaitpoint-curve.     The curves

and others have found the same with different mixtures.

Only, so far as know, a maximum (or minimum) has never
been traced up to the critical temperature.  In Konowalow's
mixtures the maximum appears sometimes to shift with change
of temperature, and accordingly probably to disappear below
the critical temperature.  The above results prove that this
need not be the case at all.   This fact may be expressed in
this manner: the maximum-curve need not reach the vapour
pressure curve of one of the substances. In my experiments
it reaches the plaitpoint-curve, near B.
    27. These results will be much better understood by
 inspecting figs. 3, 4, 5. The curves in these figures give the
 relation between the composition of the mixtures and the
volumes at which the condensation begins and at which it
ends (rid. § 1 sqq.), and may at the same time be considered as
the projection of the connodal curves of the plait in van der
Waals's surface upon the v-v plane. The figures belong to
the temperatures 20°, 25°, and 26°C. respectively.
    28.    If
           the phenomena were such as would correspond to
fig. 1, the plait with rise of temperature would get narrower
near the C. He plane (a = 1). At 32°C. the curve would
loose itself from the v-axis for a = 1, whilst forming a plait
point there ; above 32°C. it would withdraw towards the N2O
axis (a =0), where it would disappear at 36°C. (critical
temperature of N,0).
   29. However, this is not what really happens. With rise
of temperature the plait becomes narrower somewhere near
the middle.     Consequently, at a temperature far below 32°C.,
near 25°8 C., the plait divides into two parts.        At that
moment two     plaitpoints appear (P, and P.) f. The two parts
into which the plait is divided henceforth withdraw towards
r=0 and w=1 separately. At 32° C. the right-hand plait
disappears at r = 1. At 36°C. the left-hand plait disappears
tº
in a = 0. Above 36°C. there is no plait left: the surface is
phases.

188         Dr. Kuenen    on the   Critical Phenomena of
the pairs of coexisting phases being parallel to the c-axis.
The lines on both sides of the maximum line will be turned
in opposite directions (with a minimum the direction in which
the lines turn is the opposite of what it is here).   But the
angles of the lines are very small in the case of C, H, and
N.O. On the right-hand plait the lines differ more: the
increase of pressure is accordingly larger on that side of
the surface.    In the figure the turning of the lines had to be
exaggerated in order to show their direction.
   31. The critical phenomena of the mixtures were much
º
simpler than     I expected to find them. All the mixtures
showed normal condensation up to the critical point, and
a difference between plaitpoint temperature and critical tem
perature could not be determined with any certainty, The
           cause of this disagreement I shall refer to after
 having deduced more completely the theoretical consequences
of the experimental results laid down in fig. 2, and figs. 3, 4, 5
(vid. §§ 43–46).

touches the maximum-curve with both its branches.     This is

a similar meeting of three curves takes place. If the maxi
mum-mixture does not change much with the temperature
(as we found was the case with C, H, and N.,0), the border
curve of the maximum mixture must have nearly shrunk to
on2 curve coinciding with the maximum-curve.
  33. Apparently the p-t figure is not at        all

retrograde condensation is cut off halfway; and if the dis

gests the use of horizontal, or at least nearly horizontal, tubes

   45. Now in this region, where gravitation plays an im
portant part, the stirring of the substance cannot be of any
avail; on the contrary, the equilibrium, which is very much
influenced by gravitation, is spoilt rather by mixing together
the different layers.   So in this region the only thing we can
do     is,   to
           wait    long time, and Gouy's experiments with
                          a                                                                    an

means         of

form a system of E.M.F.'s in equilibrium.
   In fig. 3 let the positive direction of rotation be counter

would make e the     generator.  We  may   notice that the possi
bility of constructing these two parallelograms affords a proof
of the fact that, in general, either of two alternate current
machines may be driven as a motor by the other, irrespective
of their relative E.M.F.'s. An analytical proof of this is
given by the energy equation

The resulting parallelogram OPTIE, shows that the generator
E.M.F. is in phase with the current.
   19. Suppose now that the excitation of the generator field
is kept constant while that of the motor is varied.
   When the motor excitation is small, as Oe (fig. 4), we see
that the current leads over the motor E.M.F. and lags
behind the generator E.M.F.
   When e exactly opposes c, the latter lags behind E.
   When E and c are in phase (minimum current), c lags
behind e.
   When e is still further increased, as Oe', cleads before E
and lags behind e.

       This explains the condenser action                                         of an over-excited
synchronous motor noticed by Professor S. P. Thompson and
others.
    20. It is known that a leading current strengthens the
field of a generator and weakens, that of a motor, while with
a lagging current the reverse is the case.         We therefore con
clude that when the excitation of the motor field is small,
armature reaction weakens the fields of both generator and
motor, and when the motor is over-excited both machines
have their fields strengthened.         When working at minimum
current, armature reaction strengthens the motor field and
does not affect the field of the generator.
    When the motor field is unaffected, the generator field is
weakened.
   21. Now the field of the motor           under ordinary working is,
conditions, excited             somewhat greater extent than
                                         to   a                                                                  is

therefore, the effect                    of

the    hydrogen    thermometer       ;  every   extrapolation   would lead
 to quite false results.
     After failing in my experiments with the thermo-electric
junction,           I
                resolved to measure the critical temperature of
 hydrogen by means of a platinum thermometer based on the
 variation of the resistance of a very thin platinum wire with
 the temperature.        This method for measuring very low tem
 peratures was proposed by Messrs. Cailletet and Collardeau”,
 afterwards also by Dr. Guillaume +, but practically it was used
 for the first time by Prof. Witkowskit.                    His researches
 proved that the platinum thermometer                  after the hydrogen is,
 thermometer, the most suitable for measuring low tempera
 tures.          It
                  true that
                      is            demands     it                   an

                                     to
 and    accurately.      And considering that the curve which
 represents the relation between the temperatures measured
 with hydrogen and the electrical resistance                   platinum               of                         is

first experiments         I
                        used an ebonite frame whose height was
20 millim. and diameter 12 millim. ; the distance between

the whole wire was 2414 ohms at 0°.                 In a further experi

and diameter 10 millim. ; the resistance of the wire, which
was wound also at intervals of 0.5 millim., was 117.5 ohms

respond to 0°, -78°2, — 182°5, and —208°5 respectively,

that the temperature of the carbonic acid mixture (–78°2)

when it has the consistence of butter: as soon as the ether

those given now,       and were based upon many careful expe
riments.       Considering that the temperatures extrapolated
must have been determined a little too low, for the reasons                                        I
have stated above, the numbers previously communicated may
even be nearer the true data.
  I   showed above how the expansion method enables us to
determine the dependence of the temperature upon the pressure
of the gas liquefied, even though the cooling agents do not
allow us to reach the critical temperature of the gas experi
mented with.        It would be possible to make the following
objections.      First, we might ask how it is possible to know
whether the gas, expanded from a temperature higher than
the critical temperature, to a pressure of 20 atmospheres or
of 1 atm., really assumes a temperature equal to the tempera
ture of the liquefied gas, under one or other of these pressures.
And then, if this were granted, whether the platinum thermo
meter described is rapid enough in                indications its  assume           to
and    to  mark the     temperature        the  surrounding
                                                   of           gas     the                   at
moment       ofthe expansion.
    To ascertain whether these objections had any real founda
tion,  I have done just what        did for the determination
                                         I                              the                   of

   This hardly expected agreement of the results obtained
by means of both methods shows that the objections we have
stated above are not justified, and that the expansion method
is quite suitable for determining the critical and the boiling
temperatures of gases.       The agreement of these results was
doubtless also strengthened by the circumstance that the
temperatures of oxygen had not been extrapolated, but were
calculated by interpolation.     The initial temperature of oxygen
was, it is true, only 16° higher than                               its

                  By JoHN       TRowbRIDGE and WILLIAM DUANE*.
         HE
         direct determination of a velocity implies the measure
       ment of a length and of a time. So far as we know, no
direct measurement of the velocity of electric waves has been
hitherto published.     A number of experiments have been
performed on the velocity of single pulses of electricity
travelling over long metallic circuits, by Wheatstone, Fizeau
and Gounelle, Siemens, Blondlott, and others; but the results
obtained are very discordant.      Blondlot's method is not open
to the   objections that have been raised against some of the
others; for his electric pulses theoretically were short, and
had steep wave fronts.     13]ondlot # also described a method of
determining the velocity of a system of electric waves. He
measured the distance between the nodes on a metallic circuit,
but, in order to get the time, he calculated the period of oscilla
tion of another circuit that was in resonance with the first.
His determination, therefore, was not a direct measurement.
   Early last year the following direct method of measuring
the velocity of electric waves suggested itself to us:—Increase
the size, and if necessary change the shape of a Hertz vibrator
until the period of oscillation is sufficiently long to be deter
mined by photographing the spark; measure the length of
the waves induced in a secondary circuit tuned to resonance
with the vibrator; and the quotient of the wave-length by
the time of a complete oscillation will be the required velocity.
   The first apparatus experimented with was that used by
Mr. St. John in investigating the peculiarities of waves along
iron wires. For a detailed description of this apparatus see
the Philosophical Magazine for November 1894.          It has been
assumed by certain writers that the reaction between the
circuits, arranged in the manner employed by Mr. St. John,
of is,
         large extent, what would

212                  Messrs. Trowbridge and Duane on
used so successfully by Blondlot.  The first attempt arranged
on the electrostatic principle proved a complete failure. A
second trial about a fortnight later, however, was so successful
that we fully determined to adopt the electrostatic method.
   The first point in the course of the investigation worth
detailed description is the production of electric waves along
parallel wires in such a manner that they are actually visible
to the eye.   The arrangement of the apparatus to accomplish
this was as follows:—

Every time the primary condenser was charged a spark
passed at C, causing an oscillatory discharge.  A convenient
method of forming a mental picture of the oscillation excited
in the secondary circuit is the conception of Faraday tubes
elaborated by          J.
                   J. Thomson, in his ‘Recent Researches in
Electricity and Magnetism.” The oscillations of the primary
acted inductively upon the secondary and sent out groups of
Faraday tubes which travelled along the secondary circuit,
with their ends on the wires, and lying chiefly in the space
between them.                                  J
                   At the end they reversed their direction
and travelled back along the circuit.   The period of oscillation
 of the primary  circuit was altered, until by trial it was found
 that groups of returning tubes met groups of advancing tubes
between  the points G and H. As the two sets of moving
tubes were oppositely directed, they annulled each other and
produced a node. Thus a system of stationary waves was set
up    with   a node       at   J, another      GH, and a ventral seg
                                                node at
ment at K L.         The method of      discovering    when the circuits
were in tune and of investigating the shape of the waves will
be described later.         The point to be noticed here is that the
vibrations were sufficiently powerful to cause a luminous dis
charge on the surface of the wire where the accumulation of
tubes was a maximum, i. e. at                      KL,
                                             while at the nodal points
J  and GH the wire was entirely dark.             Still further, the wave
formation could be made apparent to the sense of hearing as
well as that of sight : for placing the ear within a few
centimetres of the wire and walking beside                         distinct       it,   a
crackling sound could               heardbe    the pointsat        and              K                  L,

the wave was slightly altered for a metre on each side of         J,
and the bolometer showed a slight accumulation in the
immediate neighbourhood of the spark-gap. This was probably
due to the charging of the spark terminals to a sufficiently
high potential to break through the dielectric.           The fact
that the insertion of a     spark-gap   into a  secondary circuit in
the manner described has no effect upon the length of the
waves set up in that circuit was tested for a number of
different cases (in none of which, however, was the length of
 the waves greater than in the present case), and found to be
 true in each one of them.
     In order to determine the time of vibration we used a con
 cave rotating mirror; and the images of the oscillating sparks
 were thrown on a sensitive plate.           If  the mirror rotated
 about a horizontal axis, the photographs showed bright
 horizontal lines, perpendicular to which at their extremities
 extended two series of dots.      Fig. 2 is an enlargement (about
 ten times) of one of the sparks taken in our final measurement.
 The dots represent discharges from the negative terminals
 only, the positive discharges not being brilliant enough
  to affect the plate. The distance between successive dots
  was the distance on the plate through which the image of
  the spark-gap moved during the time of a complete oscilla
  tion.    Hence by determining the speed of the mirror and
  measuring the distances from the mirror to the plate the time
  of oscillation could be calculated. To measure the sparks we
  used a sharp pointer moved at the end of a micrometer-screw
  under a magnifying-glass of low power. The instrument was
  originally intended for microscopic measurements, and was
  very accurately constructed. The rotating mirror was driven
  by an electric motor by means of a current from a storage
   battery of extremely constant voltage. To give great steadi
   ness a heavy fly-wheel was attached to the axis of the mirror.
   The speed of the mirror was determined to within about one
   part in five hundred by means of an electric chronograph.
   This apparatus, requiring great technical skill, was made for
   us by the mechanician of the laboratory.         The mirror con
   sisted of a thick     piece  of  glass  with a concave surface
   accurately ground for this research by the well-known
   optician Alvin Clark, and silvered by ourselves. For the
   extremely sensitive dry plates which were used we are
   indebted to Mr. Gustav Cramer, of St. Louis, Mo.

   spark rather than the primary. In the first place, to properly

circuit depend to a large extent upon the character of the
 rimary spark, and that the most active sparks are those
     tween metallic     spheres with polished surfaces.           It is true
that waves can be        produced    by  sparks   between   points,  but the
oscillations are not so powerful or well marked.                     In the
second place,       from the results obtained by Bjerknes one
would expect the oscillations in the secondary circuit to be
much less damped than those in the primary.                  This expecta
tion has been fully realized.           Photographs show from ten to
twelve times as       many     oscillations in the secondary as in the
primary.      The longest secondary spark we counted indicated
50 complete oscillations.          In the third, and by no means the
least  important     case,   the question   how close the resonance is
does not affect the accuracy of the results.            By photographing

218             Messrs. Trowbridge and Duane on
plate. The total length of the secondary circuit from one
condenser plate through E, G,         J,
                                      H, F to the other plate was
6338 centim.      The circuit consisted of copper wire (diameter
“215 centim.)  supported   at each end by suitable wooden frames,
and also once in the middle by hard-rubber hooks, fastened by
long pieces of twine to a wooden crossbar above. The dis
 tances from F to E and from K to L were 30 centim., and a
 spark-gap with pointed tin terminals was inserted at          J.
                                                              The
   rimary circuit consisted of copper wire (diameter 34 centim.).
     e distances between the two parts A B and CD were
 45 centim.     The portion B D contained a spark-gap with
 platinum-faced spherical terminals, and was made so as to
 slide back and forth, to and from the condenser.     The motion
 of this movable piece varied the self-induction, and therefore
 the period of oscillation of the primary circuit. By this

means the circuits were brought into resonance. With certain
arrangements of the condensers the resonance was very
sharp, and the position of the movable portion could be deter
mined to within 25 centim.      In the arrangement which was
finally adopted the resonance was not so sharp. Even in
this case the distance of the sliding part from the plate a
could not have been in error by more than 2 centim.         The
length 65 centim. was finally chosen for      value.its
   The automatic current-interrupter that worked         beautiso
fully  inconnexion with the Hertz vibrator would not function
well when used     toexcite the circuits just described.  After
trying many devices,         we
                            finally adopted               an
                                                  ordinary reed

arrangement, which gave little trouble.

                        in

                                                 resonance was
obtained, but nothing        of

mediately the character of the complex wave-formation.     The
secondary circuit could and did oscillate in three different
ways, and the ratios of the periods were those of the notes in
an open organ-pipe, namely 1:2:3.        Usually the lowest or
fundamental oscillation together with one of the overtones
was present; but several sparks were noticed that furnished
unmistakable evidence of the simultaneous existence of all
three.   We have observed in a circuit 10,000 centim. long
the same peculiarities of oscillation, excited by a primary
circuit that, judging from                       its
                                  dimensions, could not have

quoted and 2:998x10", which is generally accepted as the
velocity of light.   Since then we have succeeded in producing
much better waves and much more regular sparks, and have
discovered a phenomenon which renders a measurement on
a photograph over a space where the dots are obliterated a
questionable proceeding.       The new data have given a value
for the  velocity  more in accord with theory.
   Since the waves in the secondary were not well formed
when the spark-gap was inserted, it seemed desirable to try
 i.
to find an arrangement that would produce simultaneously a
       wave and a photographable spark.        A number of con
  ensers with plates of different sizes and shapes and different
substances for the dielectric were tried, and the apparatus to
be described was finally adopted. The difficulties to be over
come were these.      Too strong a reaction between the primary
and   secondary   condensers could not be employed, because the
increase in the damping of the primary due to the large
amount of energy drawn off by the secondary made good
resonance impossible.      The amount of energy in the primary
at full charge must be much greater than that in the secondary.
On the other hand the capacity of the primary condenser must
not be too great; for the self-induction of the primary circuit
would have to be proportionately small, and this, too, means
an increase in the damping. The secondary condenser, too,
must have a capacity of less than a certain magnitude in order
that the node may fall on the circuit and not in the condenser
plate. These points seem to indicate that small condensers
are preferable to large ones; but a decrease in the size of the
plates means a decrease in the light of the secondary sparks,
and the sparks are at best barely photographable.        Practically,
                            -
therefore, our choice was much limited, and the particular
arrangement to give the best results had to be selected by
experiment after a long series of trials. The arrangement and
dimensions of the apparatus finally adopted were as follows:—

222                   Messrs. Trowbridge and Duane on
by several sparks in which           dots made by one spark
                                           the
terminal had the characteristics  just  described, whereas those
made by the other were quite regular.              Following out
this hint, we found that the     particular  substances used for
the secondary spark-terminals had a large effect upon the
characteristics of the photographs. We tried spark-terminals
made of a number of different metals—tin, aluminium, mag
nesium, fuse-metal, &c., and finally adopted cadmium as
productive of the best sparks.         In the case of cadmium the
characteristics described are much less marked, and we have
succeeded even in producing a few sparks in which no differ
ence in blackness could be detected between one dot and the
next.    The photographs from cadmium terminals, too, are
far more distinct and far more easily measured than those
from terminals of any other metal that we tried.
    An interesting question arose here as to whether the dis
tance between two successive dots would depend upon the
period of oscillation of the primary circuit if the secondary
were unaltered.      To test this point the circuits were brought
into resonance and a photograph taken. The self-induction
of the primary circuit was increased by about 20 per cent. of
its  value and     second photograph taken.

and   dividing        by

                                           of         spaces; whereas
in  the second case the measurements               some    ofthe singleof

 should expect from this that the bolometer throws, which
measure the average length                 of
                                      the wave, would not indicate
a  shifting     the node when the circuits are thrown slightly
                 of
 out  of  resonance,   but that the minimum throws would                               be
greater than when the circuits are exactly                             in

 resonance is obtained and the most regular wave-formation
is excited, the distances between the first three or four dots
are slightly greater than the distances between three or four
dots taken farther down the spark. The explanation we offer
 for this is the following, and it applies as a criticism to                                                                   all

ing circuit possessing       much  larger
                                       a   damping    factor.  The
fact that the secondary waves last longer than the primary
oscillations means that the last times that the waves travel
over the circuit they                   do      so
                                 under different end conditions
from the first few times.       The capacity       the secondary                       of
plates is   slightly less after the primary spark has stopped
than  it  was before, and therefore the length           the wires                               of

     With the exception of three preliminary trials, which gave
values differing from the mean by 10 per cent. or by 12 per
cent., these are the only determinations we have made. In
some cases the waves in the circuit were just as good with
the spark-gap as without                           it.

We have now come across the same hydrocarbons, and we
have found other hydrocarbons which fractionation,               prac                           as

     In    our hands fractional distillation furnishes                               liquids which

   The American Petroleum upon which we have operated is
a most abundant commercial article.         We found the sp. gr.
at 18°C. to be 0.7924.    Tested with slightly diluted sulphuric
acid it did not diminish in volume. A preliminary experiment
in the retort showed that     distillation covered great range

  2. “Notes on the Chemical Composition of some Oceanic Deposits.”
By Prof. J. B. Harrison, M.A., F.G.S., and A. J. Jukes-Browne,
Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
  The authors formerly experienced great difficulty in comparing
their analyses of the Oceanic Deposits of Barbados with those of
modern oozes made by Dr. Brazier.         Since then Dr. Murray has
placed samples of recent Red Clay and Globigerina-ooze at their
disposal, and these were analysed by Prof. Harrison and Mr. John
Williams.
   The results of analysis of the Red Clay were arranged as follows:–
Argillaceous  constituent 67.85 per cent., pumiceous matter 23-26
per cent., organic   constituents 5-88, and adherent sea-salts 3-61
per cent.   The authors found that the argillaceous constituent was
not a mixture of an orthosilicate of alumina and hydrated peroxide
of iron, having the proportion of silica to alumina as 14 to 12,
but a more highly silicated compound in which the proportions
were as 33 to 12.     It was in fact a ferruginous earth, such as would
result from the decomposition of palagonite and of a basic volcanic
glass, fragments of which were frequent in the Pacific red clays.
The pumiceous matter was the débris of an acid pumice containing
7 per cent. of soda, and apparently therefore the pumice of a soda
felsite.  Comparing the analyses of the recent Red Clay with those of
Barbadian red clays, they find the differences to be such as would
result from mixtures of the palagonitic earth with various acid and
basic pumices.     A mixture of the palagonitic earth with the
pumiceous        dust which fell on Barbados in 1812 would have a
composition       closely corresponding to that of the Oceanic Clay of
Barbados.
   The recent calcareous ooze closely resembled the more calcareous
“chalks of the Barbadian Oceanic Series, but the latter contained
much colloid silica and fine clay.        The differences between the
analyses of the recent ooze and of English chalk, when certain
allowances    are made, were found to be but small.           The recent
calcareous ooze contained many more Globigerina-tests than Tertiary
or Mesozoic     chalks, but it is suggested that this is due to our
possessing only the surface-layers of the Globiferina-ooze.

    This paper    is   the outcome     of   one    published    in    the “Geological

230                         Geological Society.
Magazine' of January 1894, on the ‘Three Glaciations in Switzer
land, in which the author described various glacial deposits near
 the lake of Zürich.     He now describes a series of fluvio-glacial
conglomerates and interglacial lignite-deposits near the lakes of
Zürich, Constance, Zug, and Thun, which, together with analogous
deposits    at the base of the Eastern, Western, and Southern Alps,
constitute further evidence of two interglacial periods, and therefore of
three general glaciations, the oldest of these being of Upper Pliocene,
and the others of Middle and Upper Pleistocene age respectively.
As regards the origin, age, and the time required for the formation
of several of the Swiss deposits referred to in the paper, the author
arrives in several respects at conclusions differing from those recently
enunciated by others. The author also argues that the first inter
glacial period was probably of shorter duration than the second;
and in confirming his former conclusion that every general glacia
tion marks a period of filling-up, and every interglacial period
marks a period of erosion of valleys, he avers that, if this conclusion
be correct, it must needs be destructive of the theory of glacial
erosion.
    2.  ‘The Bajocian of the Mid-Cotteswolds.          By S. S. Buckman,
Esq., F.G.S.
   The Mid-Cotteswolds     is defined as the district between the valleys
of the Frome and the Chelt.        A description of twenty-five sections
is given, dealing principally with the strata found between the
Upper Trigonia-grit and the Upper Freestone—such strata being
called, for the purpose of present distinction, “the intervening beds.”
Of these twenty-five sections, seventeen, lying between Stroud and
Leckhampton, are discussed in Part I. of the paper to show the
succession of the intervening beds, to point out that Cotteswold
geologists have confounded two distinct deposits, the Lower Trigonia
and Gryphite-grits, to prove that the former, and not the latter, is
 the more persistent stratum, and to give evidence that denudation,
 called ‘Bajocian denudation,' has, prior to the deposition of the
 Upper Trigonia-grit, cut right through the intervening beds in the
neighbourhood of Birdlip, so as to make a shelving trough 6 miles
wide and about 30 feet deep.
   The remaining eight sections are described in Part II. of the
paper.     They lie eastwards of Leckhampton, and are given to show
the   discovery of another ammonitiferous horizon in the Cotteswolds,
yielding angustumbilicate Witchelliar.       It is proved that this bed
is above the Notgrove Freestone and below the Upper Trigonia
grit; so that it is really an addition to the stratigraphical sequence
hitherto recognized in the Cotteswolds.         Its ammonites show it
to have been deposited contemporaneously with the middle of the
Sandford Lane Fossil Bed, and yet it is removed by 10 to 12 feet from
the Gryphite-grit=lower part of that bed.        In the Mid-Cotteswolds
this important Witchellia-bearing bed is only preserved over an area
of about 14 square miles, because it has been mainly removed by
Bajocian denudation; and only one side of one small quarry yields

a favourable exposure.      No other locality showing this deposit has
yet been found   in the county.
   Two plotted diagrams are given to show the developments of the
beds in the different sections, and to illustrate the result of the
Bajocian denudation.      In an Appendix to Parts I. and II. various
notes are given, and attention is called to a remarkable oyster as
a document of historic value evidencing the Bajocian denudation.
   Part III. of the paper gives the chronological sequence of brachio
poda in Dorset and the Cotteswolds in the Inferior Oolite, to show
their value for purposes of exact correlation when ammonites are
absent; and to illustrate that the brachiopods are a good medium of
exchange in regard to the strata of the Cotteswold and Dorset
districts respectively, that in some cases they are such in regard to
the two districts, and in other cases they fail in this respect, so
that ammonites become the only true medium of exchange between
the beds of different basins.

         ON   THE MAGNETISM             OF ASBESTOS.     BY L. BLEEKRODE.
     N the ‘Electrical  Review ' Mr. A. S. C. Swinton * states that
      asbestos is rather strongly magnetic.       As this fact must be
taken into account in constructing certain measuring instruments,
I have repeated the experiments in question, and have found that
in the material at my disposalt the magnetic force is even more
strongly developed than Swinton mentions, in so far that powerful
electromagnets    were not necessary, but an ordinary good steel
magnet was sufficient for demonstrating                  surprising that
                                                        in it.

 could hold about three pounds at each pole, and that the material
investigated was moved easily on the surface of mercury.            He
also observed that the various kinds of asbestos are not magnetic
to the same extent.       He distinguishes “ripe” asbestos, consisting
of short fibres in the same direction and of a straw colour; this is
strongly magnetic and hangs to the poles. Another kind which
he describes as “unripe,” of greater tenacity and prismatic shape, is
feebly magnetic.
    I used a steel magnet which could support 3 kilos at both poles
 together, and found that a variety of asbestos of greenish colour
 and firm texture was only very slightly attracted when it was
 brought in a movable position opposite the poles of the magnet.
 On the other hand, asbestos cloth woven without any filling, of a
 grey kind, was attracted to both poles and held there like a thin
 iron wire. This was still more remarkably seen in a thin strip of
 what is known as asbestos-paper, about 4 centim. long and 0-3
centim, in breadth. This jumped from a distance of 1 centim.
 towards the poles of an electromagnet with a lifting force of 5 kilo.
 This strip showed afterwards (as Brugmans had already proved)
 slight polarity; I noticed at least that the pole of a magnetic
 needle was afterwards unequally attracted by the ends of the strip.
 With an electromagnet of about 100 kilos lifting-power the strip
could also distinctly attract fine iron powder at the end turned
away from the pole.
    A square piece of asbestos paper, 15 centim. in the side, moved
from a small distance towards the poles, and remained there
even against a slight counterpoise.         Of course small fibres of
asbestos and splinters acted like fine iron turnings, and even from
a distance of 8 centim. came in contact with the poles. Most
preparations of asbestos for technical purposes are made with a
packing the composition of which I do not know. I think, however,
that even if iron should be among the constituents it would be in
chemical combination with other elements as it is in the mineral
itself, and, accordingly, could not be considered as the cause of the
remarkably strong magnetism : there are evidently several iron com
pounds which show no attraction, and, as has been already observed,
a preparation without filling was also strongly magnetic *.
    In any case the observations of Swinton must not be disregarded
in practice, since the use of plates of asbestos may give rise to
sources of error in sensitive magnetic instruments.-Wiedemann's
Annalen, June 1895.

   ELENIUM,        which is supposed to be an elementary
      substance, is capable of existing in several distinct modi
fications.  The amorphous variety consists either of a finely
divided red powder, or of a vitreous mass which resembles
black glass in appearance and does not conduct electricity.
Amorphous selenium melts at about 100°C, but at tempera
tures between     100° and 217° the black semi-liquid          mass
gradually hardens into a grey metallic-looking solid.          This
consists of Se in the crystalline form : it melts at 217°, and is
a moderate    conductor of electricity,                  its

                              § 2. Selenium Cells.
   Any device consisting essentially of a mass of crystalline
selenium in combination with two metallie electrodes, and so
arranged as to expose a relatively large surface for light to
act upon is commonly, but not very appropriately, termed a
“Selenium Cell.”        So many inquiries have reached me as to
the construction of the sensitive cells which            have at different  I
times exhibited before this         Society    and elsewhere, that                                       I
venture to think a short account of the process may be use
fully given here.
   A slip of mica about 55 millim. long, 17 millim. wide, and
0.4 millim. thick, is sandwiched between two semi-cylinders
of boxwood about 18 millim. in diameter and of somewhat
greater length than the mica, the ends being held together by
screws. The whole is smoothed down in a lathe until the edges
of the mica are flush with the surface of the wood. A screw of
16 threads to the centim. (40 to the inch) is cut upon the
middle portion of the cylinder for a length of 45 centim. The
mica is then removed from the wood, and two small holes are
drilled near each of              its
                             ends. An annealed copper wire 0.19
millim.    in  diameter (No.        s.w.g.)  36 tightly wound around
                                                           is
the notched portion           the mica, the turns being made
                                  of                                                                     to
occupy alternate notches, and                     its
                                         ends are secured            passing                by
them   through    two        of
                          the drilled holes.         second wireA       then                     is
wound into the other notches,            turns alternating with those

of  the first.   These wires constitute the electrodes, and great
care  is taken that they                do

impossible to spread as if it were mercury.               The Bunsen
flame should be adjusted so that the temperature is only just
above the melting-point, 217°; the selenium then assumes
a plastic semi-fluid condition and can be easily manipulated.
   When a satisfactory surface has been secured, the cell is
immediately removed by means of forceps and placed upon a
thick copper plate to cool quickly. The Se surface should at
this stage be black and lustrous, and the resistance between
the electrodes sensibly infinite.
   The Bunsen flame having been turned down sufficiently to
lower the temperature to about 120°, the cell is replaced upon
the hot plate.     In a few minutes parts of            bright surface        its

occurred to me to use it for an experiment like the following.
   Erp. 10.—A cell made in 1881 had then a resistance of
about 100,000 ohms and was very sensitive to light.            In
 1895     its
            resistance had fallen        ohms and              10

   § 9.   The Effect   of Temperature      upon the Resistance              of
                        Crystalline Selenium.
   Text-books and dictionaries of chemistry appear to be about
equally divided upon the question whether the resistance of
crystalline Se is increased or diminished by rise of tempera
ture. There are high authorities for both opinions.               In a
paper published in 1883* I gave an account of some experi
ments which indicated that the resistance of Se, “ or rather
perhaps of selenium cells,” as I was careful to add, became a
               º
maximum at a certain temperature, which varied a little with
different specimens but was generally a few degrees higher
than the average temperature of the air.              Eight different
cells were           showing well-defined maxima at tempera
tures of 13°, 14°, 22°, 23°, 23°, 24°, 25°, and 30° respectively.
   On further investigating the subject I have traced this
curious effect to the action of the fused-in electrodes. So far
as I  know from a great number of experiments, a piece of
crystalline Se into which wires have been fused always
acquires a maximum resistance at a certain temperature. On
the other hand, the resistance of a piece having external
electrodes pressed into contact with it is always diminished
by a rise of temperature.
   Erp. 14.—A rectangular plate of Se was cast in one of
the white-glazed earthenware “pans” in which moist water
colours are sold. Two platinum wires were made red-hot,
and their ends embedded along the shorter sides of the rect
angular plate a little below the surface. The plate was then
crystallized and annealed and             its
                                           surfaces smoothed with
glass-paper.
                                                .
   The plate was suspended inside           air-bath, the bulb
                                            an                                   of
                                                                                  a
thermometer being        incontact with           it,
                                                  and the resistance
between the    platinum-wire    electrodes was taken          tempera  at
tures   ranging   from —2°      to  12°.   The    results,  which are
given     inthe second column        ofTable II., indicate that the
resistance was greatest when the temperature was 6°.
   The same plate was then placed between two pads               india      of
rubber covered with tinfoil which served               electrodes, and
                                                             as

 Thus with rising temperature the resistance of the same
piece of Se appears to reach a maximum    when measured
between fused-in wires, and to decrease   ab initio when
measured between electrodes which are pressed upon                                              its

disk of crystalline selenium, 11.2 millim. in diameter and
1.25 millim. thick, which was tightly fixed by an indiarubber
collar : to the other end was attached a glass tube which
terminated in an open point about 3 millim. in diameter.
The whole of the indiarubber and the edges of the Se
disk were thickly coated with shellac varnish. The closed
end of the tube was dipped into water and air was forced
into the open end. No bubbles were formed upon the Se:

                        Electrical Properties of Selenium.                               245
   In a former communication                          I
                                          my belief that these
                                                           stated
 polarization effects resulted from the electrolysis of the
metallic selenides contained as impurities in the Se. Whether
this be so or not, the following experiments plainly indicate
that the presence of moisture is necessary for the production
of the phenomenon.
  Erp.     17.— The electrodes of a Se cell were connected first
 with the poles of a battery, and then by means of a “change
 over” switch with a galvanometer: this produced a deflexion
 of 90 divisions, indicating an E.M.F. of rather more than Tºo
 volt.    The cell was then placed in a glass receiver over
 strong sulphuric acid, the connecting wires being passed
through an indiarubber
                                      ..".From time to time it was
 successively joined to the battery and the galvanometer, and
 the polarization     current was observed to be gradually                                di
minishing. After 18 hours the deflexion was only 3 divisions.
The air was then exhausted from the receiver, and 24 hours
later no polarization current whatever could be detected, even
after prolonged connexion with the battery.                A current
                      part of that which occurred in ordinary air
                      <U+017F>º
greater than
º
would certainly not have escaped observation.
    Erp. 18.—The cell was afterwards suspended for an hour
in a receiver over a basin of water and then tested for
    larization.    The spot of light was immediately deflected far
           the limits of the scale.
    Probably therefore the polarization results merely from the
electrolysis of water ; in any case the presence of water seems
to be requisite for             its
                            production.
  It   is  perhaps worth noting that little         any polarizationif                    is

papers had received stains which differed greatly in appearance
according as they were upon the anode or the kathode.
   On the anode papers the stains were scarlet, and       satisfied                I
myself that they were beyond doubt due to red amorphous
Se.    For (1) stains of a precisely similar hue and character
were obtained by electrolysing a solution of selenious oxide
contained in a pad of filter-paper, though of course in this
case the stain appeared upon the kathode.          (2) The stains
turned dark brown when heated. (3)         They  were not affected
by cold hydrochloric acid, as red oxide of copper would have
been. (4) Nor by sulphuric acid.           (5) Nor (unless very
slowly) by cold nitric acid. (6) Hot nitric acid quickly
dissipated them. (7) So also did a mixture of cold nitric and
hydrochloric acids. (8) The red stuff could be volatilized at
a temperature below that at which the paper was scorched.
   On the kathode papers the stains were of a dark brown,

pencil is drawn over the paper, it makes a bright red mark
which is immediately broken off if the current is interrupted
or reversed. If a copper plate be used, the marks will be
brown instead of red.
    The red stuff separated in the foregoing experiments turned
black when heated, and fused and crystallized like ordinary
Se. The resistance of a small cell made from a portion of it
was 65 per cent. lower than the average; the cell was very
sensitive to light, the diminution of          resistance under  its
illumination being              53
                         per cent.

the coating, and soon small bubbles        hydrogen began
rise from the surface, continuing for about         hours. The           5

   This experiment, though not conclusive, tends to show that

Se unmixed with selenide is not acted upon by the current.

the red amorphous form by electrical action, but the question

   Another of the interesting discoveries of Adams and Day
was the fact that an electromotive force could be set up, and
a current started in annealed Se merely by the action of
light". This observation has been fully confirmed by sub
sequent experimenters, and the belief has been expressed that
the phenomenon affords an example of the direct conversion
of the energy of light into that of electricity.    Others have

    The succeeding experiments indicate that at the anomalous
junction the electrical contact between the Pt and Se was
 imperfect, and that the Se contained a certain amount of
platinous selenide.
    Erp. 35.—One part of platinous selenide having been
 incorporated with six parts of Se, the mixture was fused and
 crystallized.  Thus was obtained a button of crystalline Se
 containing about 15 per cent. of platinous selenide.     The
 button and a piece of Pt foil were partly immersed in water
 and their dry ends connected to the galvanometer.   A voltaic
 current was indicated from the button to Pt through the
 water.
  Erp. 36.—The      button was dried and tested for a thermo
current with Pt.    Result, current from Pt to button through
the  junction.  The button, therefore, behaved thermo-electri
cally like ordinary Se.
   Erp. 37.-By means of an adjustable spring a strip of Pt
foil was arranged so as to press lightly on the button. The
two were connected with the galvanometer.
   Touching the button near the junction with a hot wire
caused a current from Pt to button.
   Holding the tip of the finger very near the junction without
actual contact caused a current from button to Pt.
   Blowing air upon the junction from a hot glass tube pro
duced a current from Pt to button when the air-blast was
derived from a foot-blower, and from button to Pt when air
from the lungs was blown through the hot tube.
   Thus all the thermo-effects of the “anomalous” junction
were completely imitated.    Perhaps in the case of that junc
tion good contact was prevented by a film of non-conducting
red Se, or possibly the wire electrode may have been simply
loose.
   These effects could not be produced when using a button
which consisted of Se annealed without contact with a metal
and containing no added selenide, the voltaic effect being
then similar in direction to the heat-effect.
                            Summary.
   1. The conductivity of crystalline Se appears to depend
principally upon the impurities which it contains in the form
of metallic selenides. It is suggested that the selenides
conduct electrolytically, and that the influence of light in
increasing the conductivity    is to be attributed to   its   property
of    facilitating the combination   of   selenium with metals      in
contact with it.

  2. The specific resistance of crystalline Se has no definite
value but is always very high, varying in the specimens tested
from about 30 to 1600 megohms.      It is not in general dimi
nished by prolonged heating unless the Se is in contact with
a metal          (Exps. 1, 2).

    12.  When a current is passed through cuprous selenide
between platinum electrodes which are covered with moistened
paper, red Se is deposited on the anode paper and metallic
copper on the kathode paper (Exp. 21).
    13.  If  cuprous selenide is made the kathode and a strip of
Pt the anode in water, red Se mixed with detached particles
of the selenide is deposited in the water (Exp. 22).
    14. With a mixture of cuprous selenide and Se the quantity
of detached black particles is greatly diminished, but the weight
of the separated red Se appears to be greater than that            re
quired by the law of electrolytic decomposition.          Possibly the
current has the effect of   converting   pure   crystalline  Se when
moistened into the red amorphous variety (Exps. 23, 24).
    15. The hydrogen produced by the action of zinc upon
dilute sulphuric acid has no effect upon the cuprous selenide
nor upon Se in contact with the zinc (Exps. 25, 26).
    16. The photo-electric currents sometimes set up when
light falls upon Se are dependent upon the presence of mois
ture and are no doubt of voltaic or chemical origin. (Exp. 27).
    17. Experiments which have seemed to place well-annealed
selenium above platinum in the thermo-electric series were
vitiated by the presence of moisture.      Dry Se is always below
Pt (Exps. 28–37).
XX.     The Measurement      of Varying     Currents in Inductive
    Circuits.    By ALFRED W. PoRTER,        B.Sc., Demonstrator of

THEoffollowing      paper describes an application of the principle
            the potentiometer to the measurements of rapidly
varying (but not alternating), differences of potential; and
hence, to the measurement of the currents to which they give
rise: a problem which presented itself in the course of an
investigation into the propagation of magnetic induction in
iron which was begun more than a year ago. This investi
gation we hope shortly to publish.
   A non-inductive resistance r (fig. 1) is connected in series
with a magnetizing coil the current in which we desired to
measure ; so that the potential difference between the terminals
of r is at any instant a measure of the current in the coil.
When the current is steady, this difference of potential can

method; but when it is varying a modification of the method
is required. The usual galvanometer is replaced by one pro
vided with stops, so that the needle system is free to turn in
one direction only.    Let now the strength of the current rise
 continuously, the slider C meanwhile making contact with the
potentiometer wire at such a point that “balance” occurs for

in the galvanometer which changes sign at the instant of
potentiometer balance; and if the galvanometer terminals are
so connected that the initial current in it forces the needle
against the stops, the needle will begin to fly off just as this
current passes through zero. Therefore if the galvanometer

the glass vessels, and from the continual ebullition    the liquid                    of

                the globe. The oxygen           the globe was very   in

nearly centrally through the globe. The result was that the
light  ofthe rays observed was cut off, when the glass plates
were turned through the proper angle, much more sharply
than before, and the measures are  much the more trust        so
worthy.
    We found the spark between cadmium electrodes                                           a    con
venient source         of   light, both because the rays are bright, and
because they are dispersed through          considerable range   a                                 in
the visible spectrum, and         was possible it      watch their                to

      Janssen has found that the intensity    these diffuse                      of

                 and Dispersion   of Liquid Orygen.             271
bands increases as the square of the density of the oxygen,
and has recently confirmed this (Comptes Rendus, June 17,
1895) by observations of the solar spectrum in the desert of
Sahara.     This law, as we have already pointed out (Proc.
Roy. Soc. vol. xlvi. p. 228), seems to indicate that these par
ticular bands are due either to complex molecules generated
by condensation, or to the encounters between molecules of
ordinary mass which are more frequent when their free path
is diminished.
   To answer M. Cornu's question, we obtained liquid air
directly from the atmosphere by the cold due to the rapid
evaporation of liquid oxygen under reduced pressure. The
method and apparatus have already been described by Pro
fessor   Dewar (Proc. Roy. Inst. 20th January, 1893).
    The absorption of this liquid air in a thickness of 1.9 centim.
was then directly compared with that of liquid oxygen in a
 thickness of 0-4 centim.      The light which had passed through
 the latter  was,   by means of a reflecting prism, brought into
 the field of view of the spectroscope at the same time with
that which had passed through the liquid air. The positions
                            j
 of the lamps were then adjusted so that the brightness of the
 spectra in those parts where there were no absorption-bands
 was equal in the two spectra.       Under these circumstances, it
was seen     that the absorption-bands were very much more
 strongly developed by 0-4 centim. of liquid oxygen than by
five times that thickness of liquid air.
   The vessels containing the liquids being open, the liquid air
gradually evaporated; and as the boiling-point of nitrogen is
lower than that of oxygen, the former evaporated more quickly,
and the residual liquid contained a larger and larger percentage
of oxygen.      As this happened the absorption-bands became
        intense,  until they exceeded in strength those of the
                                                      ilº
more
thinner stratum of liquid oxygen.
   Another sample of air               as before was rapidly mixed
with an   equal   volume of  liquid  oxygen,  and the            of
this liquid compared, as before, with that of liquid oxygen.     It
was seen that the absorption of 2:4 centim. of the mixture
was much greater than that of 0-4 centim. of liquid oxygen.
The density of the oxygen in the mixture was in fact three
times that of the oxygen in pure liquid air, and by Janssen's
 law the absorption should have been increased ninefold.       Our
 observations accord with this so far as they go. Also these
 observations agree well with the theory of the continuity
 between the gaseous and liquid states.        It must be borne in
 mind that air boils at a lower temperature than oxygen, so that
 the two liquids compared were not at the same temperature

272                     Prof. L. Natanson             on the    Critical
by some ten degrees.    Now if the diffuse absorption-bands of
oxygen are produced by the molecules during their encounters
with each other in the gaseous and in the liquid states, it
might well be supposed that they would be profoundly
modified when the oxygen assumed the solid state.      Hitherto
oxygen has not, when pure, been solidified, but liquid air is
readily brought to the solid state by rapid evaporation under
reduced pressure (Dewar, Proc. Roy. Inst., 19 Jan. 1894)-
Whether the solid in this case is homogeneous or only a
magma of solid nitrogen mixed with liquid oxygen might be
questioned”, but at           all
                             events      must contain oxygen
                                               it                   the                     at
lowest temperature        that can    practically       reached.    We  be
 therefore tried whether we could detect any difference between
 the absorptions       solid and liquid air. There was
                         of                                      differ                no

to be 043                a.        If these     values be adopted as well as that
of p., supposed by Prof. Olszewski to be equal to 20 atm.
(see below),  then equation (3) gives
             t.=41-3, i.e. approximately —232°;
therefore the Law of Thermodynamic Correspondence requires
us to expect the critical temperature of hydrogen to be situated
in the proximity of –232°, the limits which the uncertainty
in the values of b allows for being —229° and -234°C.
respectively.
  If    we assume —232° to be the critical temperature and
20 atm. to be the critical pressure of hydrogen, we may
calculate the boiling-point as follows.      At that point the
“specific” value of the saturation pressure will be ºn or '05 ;

  Now, in order to evaluate the error which the omission of the
absorption of heat may have introduced, it must be borne in
mind, first, that the phenomenon of expansion lasted but one
second or two, according to the                   with which
Prof. Olszewski has favoured us; and, secondly, that the
circumambient temperature was —211°.    Moreover, the                                                   cri
tical temperature of  oxygen may be calculated in the same
way.    With the data
                 to=170°5,          pe=51 atm.,                 po-80        atm.,
which are given by Prof. Olszewski, equation (8) yields the
result –123° for the critical temperature of oxygen, which
is known to be   situated at -118°8.      We should assume,
accordingly, thatthe critical temperature of hydrogen lies at
some few degrees above -231°, at –228° for instance.

   If  certain assumptions be conceded (which have been
advanced by M. Raveau with respect to the specific heats at
constant volume), it may easily be proved, as M. Duhem has
shown, that A will be positive at every temperature.   Taking
this for granted, consider the case of adiabatic  expansion, so
that dV > 0 and d0= 0.      From (2), (3), and (5) we obtain

here A   is some definite function of the absolute temperature, and
l may    be termed the degree of evaporation.     We propose to call
º
those curves on the p V-diagram which correspond to given
constant values of l isops/chric lines. Equation (6) shows that
the isopsychric line l=A is at every temperature a tangent to
the adiabatic line ; and from the same equation the relative
             of other isopsychrics and adiabatics, in the neighbour
  ood of the points of their mutual intersection, may be inferred.
The general nature of the relation between y, T and therefore
A and the temperature is pretty well known : thus at low
temperatures A rises from very small values, possibly from
zero, becomes equal to unity at the first point of inversion,
                                   .

creases, A still increases and attains a maximum An ; then it
 begins to decrease, becomes again equal to unity at the second
point of inversion T^*; lastly, it further decreases and at the
 critical point becomes probably equal to #, since          shown              (as                    by

to be accompanied by evaporation ; but since for the masses

value of the ratio 601/80, is equal to –1, but that at lower
temperatures it rapidly decreases and becomes zero at the

                                         thus in the neighbourhood
of the    temperature    T^* the differences 80, must infinitely
surpass in value the correlated differences 801. This result
furnishes us,       I
                   think, with a satisfactory thermodynamical
explanation of the phenomena which Prof. Olszewski observed
when he submitted to adiabatic expansion hydrogen cooled to
 –211°. The pressure he evaluates to be about 80 atm. is
evidently what we have called R.; and 20 atm. indeed is the
critical pressure 8 or Q. In order to obtain a numerical
illustration, let us assume that the intersection points of the
two adiabatics R1 = 90 atm. and R2 = 70 atm. with the line of
saturation are comparable with one another ; further on T/y
to be equal, say, to —-05 at the temperature of intersection.
Then, 80, being 2 atm., we obtain 80 = –078 atm., and
 this, as Prof. Olszewski has been kind enough to inform us,
is much below the minimum change accessible to observation.
    Another point of interest is the following. From what has
 been said above, it will be seen that at the second point of
 inversion T”, (or        II
                          in fig. 1) the adiabatic curve is tangent
 to the line of saturation, and therefore does not penetrate
into the domain of vapour and liquid coexistence of which
 that line constitutes the boundary.         Adiabatics them, which
 begin with smaller initial pressures than the particular adia

 *    For permission                  to   use the compensators (the invention     Mr. Cal      of

   As the working stroke in the Otto cycle only occurs once in
four strokes of the piston, and as the temperature had to be
measured at particular parts of that stroke, it was necessary
that the galvanometer           only be in circuit at the right
moment, otherwise the galvanometer swing would not give
an indication of the true temperature of the wire.      During
each explosion stroke the measuring-wire goes through the
whole cycle of temperature and, in order to secure a parti
cular epoch of this stroke, the following arrangement of con
tact makers (shown in fig. 3) was designed. The galvanometer
circuit was broken in two places, one of which was made
during every working stroke, and the other at a definite
epoch at every revolution; thus the galvanometer circuit was
only completely made at one definite point in every working
stroke.   At any required point in the stroke of       piston,i.
                       º
contact is made every revolution by a cam (C) on the crank
shaft of the engine lifting one end of a vibrating lever, de
pressing a wire (B), fixed to the other end, into a mercury
cup D, and thus making a galvanometer contact for a
definite time (about 30 of the stroke) at a certain fraction of
the stroke.     This, however, makes contact once every revo
lution, while the temperature is measured only during an
explosion stroke. To ensure that the galvanometer circuit shall
only be made                    working stroke, it is again broken
and   only  made at the     proper  time by a relay. This relay is

engine indicator (P), whose pencil is replaced by a metal

makes contact on a     strip of brass Q, thus completing  the relay
circuit.    The   electromagnet    is excited and the beam de
pressed, completing the galvanometer circuit through the
mercury cups R and S. As soon as the relay has moved
through a small distance, the indicator break is short-circuited
by the mercury cup T, and thus the relay circuit remains
closed until broken by a contact on the exhaust-valve of the
engine.      Although somewhat complicated this relay was
found to work well, but great care had to be taken that the

balance was then found by putting a suitable resistance in
the box and adjusting the position of the slider on the wire.
If   the temperature had been the same at the same point in
the stroke in every working stroke, an accurate balance could
have been obtained by shifting the slider till the deflexion of the
galvanometer      was reduced to zero, but this, however, was not
the   case, and no attempt        in the later work was made to obtain
an accurate balance on the bridge-wire. The slider was set
in such a position that the galvanometer threw about six scale
divisions to one side of zero, and ten successive throws
observed. The slider was then moved until the galvanometer
threw about six divisions on the other side, and ten throws
observed.      By taking the mean of these and interpolating,
the true reading on the bridge-wire was obtained.
    The gas-pressure was rising towards the end of the experi
 ment from 1:6 to 1-9 inches of water.

    Taking the throws at 500 and 300 we obtain, by inter
 polation from the throws, a bridge-wire reading of 407, and
 taking those at 500 and 300 we obtain a reading of 411.
    One division on the galvanometer-scale corresponds to
 from 15 to 50 divisions of the bridge-wire scale, the former
 figure being for points towards the end of the stroke, and the
 latter for points towards the commencement of the stroke of
 the engine.      As a check on this method,            I  have taken the
 bridge-wire reading from three points or more instead of two,
 and have found the results obtained agreed within a few
 scale-divisions of the bridge-wire.              To be accurate, this
 method    presupposes     constancy      in the testing    battery, and in
 the earlier work considerable trouble was found from the
 variation of the battery, which was two Leclanché cells.                   In
  the later work, both in the determination of the fixed points
  of the thermometers and for the experiments in the gas
  engine, a single Daniell cell with an added resistance of

   The ice points call for no special remark beyond the fact
that, in spite of considerable care in ensuring a mixture of
finely crushed ice and water, they were by no means as satis
factory as the steam points.        The average resistance of the
0.003, 0.0025, and 0.002 inch diameter wires was 0.3, 0:55,
and 0.75 ohm respectively.        The steam points were obtained
in a double-jacketed hypsometer of the ordinary form, and
were corrected for barometric pressure when necessary.
When working with these very fine wires, it is imperative to
guard against the heating effect of the battery current, other
wise discrepant and inaccurate results are obtained.        I have
found that the Daniell cell, mentioned above, with resistance
in the external circuit gave no appreciable heating unless the
observations were made too rapidly. (This of course only
applies to the ice and steam points; when in the engine battery
heating is of no importance.)
   Two methods were used to obtain the quantity 8. The first
method was a comparison of the fine-wire thermometer with
a standard Callendar         platinum thermometer, both being
placed in a tube heated to a high temperature, thus getting a
third point on the curve connecting the air and platinum
scales.
   The standard thermometer consisted of a spiral of platinum
wire of a diameter of 0.008 inch wound on a flat plate of mica
and enclosed in a porcelain tube 50 centimetres in length,
the flat spiral
                 "...#       a length of about 7 centimetres from
the closed end of the platinum tube. The fixed points of this
thermometer were determined many times in ice and steam,
and several times in sulphur and aniline vapours.              The
values were
                         Ro–2.936 ohms,
                         R1 =4,080 ohms,
                           S= 1°52.
    I have  not been able to detect any change in the zero,
although this thermometer has been raised to a bright red
 heat several hundred times during the last two years.
    For the comparison of the two thermometers an ordinary
 gas-furnace, such as is used for combustion work, was first
 used, but was abandoned owing to unequal and unsteady
 heating.    After some trials I adopted a tube-furnace heated
 with gas-coke; from end to end of the furnace (about 2 feet
 in length) was placed a cast-iron tube 2% inches diameter
                                -

 outside and # inch thick.          This tube could be rotated in
 bearings, and thus the temperature could be kept steady
round the circumference.        Inside the cast-iron tube, and   in
dependently supported, was a thick copper tube in which
were placed the two thermometers for comparison, the fine
wire of the steel-tube thermometer nearly touching the
porcelain tube of the standard.         Owing to the great mass of
the metal, the temperature in the inner tube changed very
slowly, and by regulating the draught a temperature of 500°
to 600°C. could easily be obtained. Although this was much
better than the gas-furnace, as regards an equal temperature
circumferentially, still it could not be assumed that the whole
length of the coil of the standard thermometer was at the
same temperature as the fine wire on the steel-tube thermo
          During any comparison the standard did not show a

variation of more than 2°C.           Unfortunately the fine wire
having such a small thermal capacity as compared with the
standard, may not be at quite the same temperature as the
standard if there is even the slightest change in the tempera
ture. For these reasons the values of 8 as                  by this
method are not so satisfactory as might be wished.
    In the second method the resistance of the steel-tube ther
mometer was determined in sulphur vapour as well as in ice
and steam.     The sulphur was boiled in an apparatus similar
to the first form used by Callendar and Griffiths in their
determination of the boiling-point of sulphur *. This con
sisted of a boiler and condenser made of iron tubes.         While
this method gives very accurate and satisfactory results, it
requires extreme care and takes several hours to obtain a
steady temperature.

    It was not until the summer of 1894 that was able to
make any proper experiments with the wires in the cylinder
of the gas-engine.       directed my attention at first to the
determination of the best speed for the engine, and to find
what conditions were necessary to obtain regularity and to
ensure that the measuring-wire should follow the temperature
of the expanding gases.        I  found that to obtain regular and
perfect combustion of the gases, the water-jacket of the
cylinder had to be kept at a temperature of from 50° to 60°
C., otherwise abnormal explosions were frequent. The speed
of the engine was kept constant at about 120 revolutions per
minute, and the wire was found to follow the cycle at          |.
speed except at the beginning of the stroke.        The number of
explosions per minute was from 12 to 14, each explosion being

thorough “washing-out” of the products of combustion from
the cylinder and of the hot                     jacket was to produce a
temperature in the cylinder as high as, if not higher than, if the
engine had been working at full load. The small number of
working strokes per minute enabled observations to be made
with the galvanometer which would not have been possible at
much closer intervals of time.                The wear and tear on the
measuring-wire was reduced, it being a matter of consider
able importance to expose the wire to as few explosions as
possible.
    In all the following     experiments the thermometer measuring
wire was       placed    on the axis of the cylinder and in the centre
of the    compression      space.
     Two thermometers were used, both practically of identically
 the same      construction as described above. The results of a
 number of experiments are given below ; I have selected
 those which I have reason to believe are the most complete
 and accurate of the number which I have made.                  Wherever
 I have been       able,  I have    given  the constants of the thermo

   It will    be noticed     that the second           set show     considerably
higher temperatures than the first ; this is due to the fact
that the former set were taken just before darkness came on,
and the second after the gas-pressure had risen considerably.
                    I
Owing to this have generally worked in the morning, when
the gas-pressure is generally steady except when there is a
sudden fog.

  The temperature was variable throughout this experiment
and the wire fused during the observation at 40 per cent.
  I consider these experiments to be the most accurate of
the whole series.
  Towards    the end of February                   I
                                     determined to find 8 by
means of an observation in sulphur vapour; and as some
                                  ...]
question had arisen as to the action of the high-temperature
gases on the platinum wires, more especially as to the variation
of the quantity 8,           I         a platinum wire 0.002

engine.          In
              every other case the wires had been exposed to
the action of the cylinder gases for about half an hour before
the determination of the fixed points.       In this case the wire
had  only  been exposed  to the flame of the blowpipe used in the
soldering.    The fixed points were Ro-0-7596; R1 = 1.0536;
                      R1–Ro-0.294            ; 8 = 2.93.

  This value of 8 seemed so high that I repeated the whole
of the points without detecting any error in the previous
work.        The low value         of
                                           |   together with the high 8 seems
to indicate that a gold-platinum alloy formed at the junction
of the main lead to the fine wire and on the surface of the
latter.  The thermometer was then placed in the engine on
March 16th and gave the following results:—

After running in the engine some time the fixed points were
re-determined with the results given below:—
                Ro-0-786.          RI-1075.               RI-R,-0-289.

   From this it will be seen that the action of the gases on
the cylinder had been such as to bring the wire into a normal
condition, most probably by sweeping off any alloy which
had been formed.

                                hope to make further experiments
bearing on this matter, and to obtain more data on the subject.
The results of the experiments of Jan. 31 to March 7 are
chiefly interesting as showing the close concordance of tem
peratures registered by wires of such different thermal
capacity, especially when it is remembered that the source of
heat used was a very variable one, the pressures, as shown on
the indicator cards, varying from day to day, and also during
the day, owing to the varying gas-pressure and quality.
   I would also point out that a difference of 100 degrees
shown on the thermometers corresponds to a distance of about
l's inch      on
              the indicator cards.

    The doubts we expressed in our former communication in
connexion with the series beginning with 7065 have been
confirmed.       The two lines there indicated as of questionable
origin belong to hydrogen, and the lines 7065 and 5048 be
long to two distinct series, which with four others now em
brace all the lines of the spectrum.
    The following list (see Appendix) contains the newly
discovered lines, and those of which the connexions with
them have now been ascertained.
    The other series of lines can also be traced farther in the
new tubes.
    We have, accordingly, here to do with six series, among
which it twice happens that two series converge towards                                                             the

 Series diverging from the same situation, of which the
 brighter is the more closely spaced. Moreover, each system
 contains a Principal Series whose lines are stronger than those
 of the Subordinate Series, and which extends to shorter wave
 lengths.
    From the similarity of the two systems to the spectra of
 the alkalies, we do not mean to infer a chemical relationship.
 But we seem justified in ascribing the two systems of series
 to distinct constituents in the gas. Following the astronomers,
 we should give the name of Helium to that constituent only
 which emits the yellow line Ds.
        If
       these views are correct, we may venture a further con
jecture (based upon the analogy of other spectra) as to the
place of the two constituent gases in the series of chemical
elements.      Since the gas is always present in the sun's
chromosphere, it is at        events        all

the two lines 5016 and 5876 belong          different elements,    to                                    on

It  must be admitted that the inference resis on the sup
position that we are right in regarding the hydrogen series
as a Principal Series, and this is so far hypothetical, that
no Subordinate Series have been found.             ut if we may
assume this, the four Principal Series in the diagram seem to
proceed by equal steps towards shorter wave-lengths, from
element to element, from hydrogen to lithium.           We may
  erhaps infer similar differences between the atomic weights.
  his would assign an atomic weight of about 3 to the lighter
constituent, and an atomic weight of about 5 to helium ; and,
if the two constituents are present in nearly equal quantities
in the Clèveite gas, this would agree with the determination by
which Clève found the atomic weight to be 4.
   We are quite conscious that this conjecture about the
atomic weights has not yet a satisfactory foundation.      Never
theless we believe that it merits some consideration.  Inferences
from the spectrum of an element to           chemical properties        its

    Amongst other specimens a wire was pressed from some
commercial bismuth, supposed to be fairly pure, which
will be distinguished by being called Griffin's Bismuth ; the
diameter of this last wire was about .066 centimetre. The
diameters of these wires were carefully measured with a
microscope-micrometer in about twenty different places, the
lengths of the wires used being about 30 or 60 centimetres.
The sample of pure bismuth prepared for us by Mr. George
 Matthey will be distinguished by speaking of it as Matthey's
 bismuth, the thicker of the two wires being called A and the
 thinner B.     The dimensions and mean diameters of the
 pressed wires, which were used just as they came from the
 press, were as follows:—

of rods slowly cooled, and for temperatures between 17°2 C.

with these    investigations      whether the  is   specific  resistance
of  bismuth always presents minimum value, and whether the

                                                                     the                             of

wire, was no doubt also different. Hence although both these
wires present a point of minimum electrical resistance, the
temperature at which this occurs is not identically the same.
Another point of interest is that the temperature at which a
discontinuity was found by us in the thermo-electric line of
the pure bismuth, and which was found to be about —80°C.,
                                                                            º
is also approximately the point at which the resistance-tem
perature coefficient of the same bismuth becomes sensibly
negative. It is therefore clear that at this temperature a
critical point    is reached for this particular sample of bismuth,
and below this point the bismuth undergoes a                      change
which affects its thermo-electric value as well as its resistance
temperature coefficient.         These investigations indicate that
the electrical behaviour of bismuth in certain states at and
below particular temperatures is irregular, and that further
study is necessary to arrive at a complete explanation of the
facts.     It has been pointed out by one of us (see Friday
Evening Discourse at the Royal Institution, by Professor
 Dewar, “On the Scientific Uses of Liquid Air,” Jan. 19,
 1894) that the tensile strength of very many metals is greatly
increased by cooling them down to                               i.
                                                   temperature of liquid
                                                                                                  \
oxygen, but that there is a very marked decrease in the tensile
strength of bismuth as well as of antimony and some other
metals when taken down to the same low temperature. It
is interesting to note that bismuth, which, at any rate in
certain states, presents the anomaly of a discontinuity in                                       its
curve of thermo-electromotive force                   certain low tem
                                                                 at   a
perature, has also         about the same temperature
                               at                             change             a               of
sign    of the  temperature    coefficient,  and becomes        addition             in
exceedingly brittle below that temperature.

310    The Variation in the Electrical Resistance             of Bismuth.
  With the object of ascertaining this we have also tested
some very pure bismuth kindly sent to us by Mr. Edward
 Matthey, and which was prepared by the reduction of the
 oxychloride.     This being pressed into wire was found to give
 a resistance-temperature     curve very similar in general form to
 that marked Griffin's Bismuth in Plate W. The resistance
 decreased down to about 0°C., and then increased again when
 cooled to about — 160°, and finally decreased again.          It is
 clear, therefore, that the specimens of bismuth, viz. that pre
 pared for us by Mr. George Matthey from the oxide and that
 prepared by Mr. Edward Matthey from the oxychloride, and
 which are both very pure, behave quite differently at very
 low temperatures with regard to their electrical conductivity.
 We have also examined the variation of a sample of bismuth
 prepared electrolytically, but the result of this examination we
 reserve until the observations have been confirmed on other
 samples of electrolytic bismuth.        One fact of considerable
 interest has presented itself in studying the action of a mag
 netic field on the electrical resistance of bismuth cooled to low
 temperatures.     It is well known that the electrical resistance
 of bismuth is increased by being immersed in a magnetic field.
 Taking a sample of the pure (Matthey) bismuth wire, we
 measured its electrical resistance at 18°C. in the earth's field
 and when placed transversely in the field of an electromagnet,
 and found an increase of resistance due to the field in the
 ratio of 1:361 to 1:434, or about 5 per cent.           The same
 sample was cooled in liquid oxygen, and measured again in
 the same fields. The resistances were then in the ratio of
 1478 to 1858. The increase in resistance in this last case is
 nearly 25 per cent.       Hence the cooling of the bismuth to
 —182°C. increased the effect of a given magnetic field in
altering     its
              resistance about five times.
    Another experiment was made           toascertain whether               in
                       a on
creased pressure         the surface     of
                                          the bismuth affected              its
resistance.    When sample           pure bismuth wire was sub
                                    of
jected  to     an
                external surface-pressure           of
                                                  300 atmospheres,
a  very slight but definite increase         resistance was found,
                                              of
which disappeared instantly         on
                                    removing the pressure.
   The above described observations show that there         very    is  a
marked difference between different samples          bismuth  of            as
regards electrical resistance when subjected      very low tem
                                                         to

magnetic fields      also abnormal.      We propose      reserve   to
further remarks     on is
                     this  subject until     have  we

experiments       in progress on electrolytic bismuth.      We expect
then to be able to state the results obtained for specimens of
bismuth of known chemical purity, and to distinguish between
those effects which are due to physical condition and those, if
any, arising from the presence of minute traces of impurity.

A     Geological Inquiry respecting the Water-bearing Strata of the
     Country around London, with Reference especially to the Water
     supply of the Metropolis; and including some Remarks on Springs.
     By Joseph PRESTwich, F.G.S. 8vo, ix & 238 pages. Gurney
     and Jackson : London, 1851–1895.
      HIS    useful work was first published in 1851, and is now
       re-issued, for reasons given in the Preface, with some additions,
 by the energetic author Dr.     J. Prestwich, F.R.S., &c. &c., who has
 greatly enlarged his experience in this and other branches of Geo
 logy during the long interval of forty years, occupied with active
 research, including the work of his Professorship in the University
 of Oxford. The large plate engraved in 1851 was accidentally
 destroyed before a sufficient number of copies were printed for the
 book; and the remainder of the work was put aside, and the plate
 not reproduced, because one of the sections of the plate (No. 1, from
 Sussex to Bedfordshire) was proved to be incorrect, the palaeozoic
 rocks having been discovered to be within reach under London.
 It was thought, too, that this error affected the long section (No. 2
 from Wilts to Essex); but these old underlying rocks are really
 so much limited in area that the western portion of the district
 traversed by the section is properly represented in it; and the
  inference as to the possibility of a considerable supply of water
  being obtainable from the Lower Greensand there still holds good.
 For this reason the remainder of the printed matter of the book is
  now issued, without the plate, but with a few new pages (pp. v.
 to ix).
      There is now proved to be a belt, variable in width, of water
  carrying Lower Greensand encircling the area of underground
  palaeozoic rocks, over which borings do not give so large a water
  supply as the Lower Greensand can give. These sand beds extend
   under the Chalk and Tertiary strata and beyond their outcrop;
   thus receiving the necessary rainfall. Their exact yield of water,
   however, has not been yet ascertained. A certain amount bas been
   obtained by boring in the Lower Greensand, eastward of London,
   at Shoreham, Strood, Frindsbury, and Loughton.         In the western
   division of the London Basin the recent boring at Wingfield, not
   far from Ascot, affords ample proof that there exists a large under
   ground supply, as indicated by nearly 3000 gallons in the 24 hours,

            “Physical Features and Geology of Mauritius.'    By Major
H.    de Haga   Haig, R.E., F.G.S.
    The greater part of the surface of Mauritius is composed of a
volcanic breccia; here and there lava-streams occur in the sections
exposed in ravines, and sometimes on the surface.       The commonest
lavas are dolerites.
    In at least two places, sedimentary rocks occur at considerable
elevations; in the Black River Mountains at a height of about
1200 feet a clay-slate is found, and near Midlands in the Grand
Port group of mountains a chloritic schist is found at an elevation
of about 1700 feet, forming the hill of La Selle; the schist is much
contorted, but seems to have a general dip to the south or south
east.
     Evidence of recent clevation of the island is furnished by masses
 of   coral-reef and beach coral-rock standing at heights of 40 feet
 above sea-level in the south, 12 feet in the north, and 7 feet on the
 islands situated on the bank extending to the north-east.
     The author gives full details of the physical geography of the
 island, including the nature and composition of the mountain
 ranges, the depth of the ravines, the occurrence of caverns in the
 lavas, and the character of the coral-reef surrounding the island.
 Information is furnished concerning the neighbouring islands, and
reference made to the possible former existence of an extensive
 tract of land at no great distance from Mauritius.

  1. ‘On the Shingle Beds of Eastern East Anglia.’                             By Sir Henry
H. Howorth, K.C.I.E., M.P., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   The author has carefully examined the country around Southwold,
where the beds known as Westleton Beds (which might well have
been associated with the name of Southwold) are developed.          He
alludes  briefly to the recent shingle, whose pebbles are derived from
the ancient shingles of the cliffs; the formation of this shingle, he
maintains, may belong to a time not far removed from our own day.
   Turning to the Westleton Beds, he notices that they are essentially
“drifts,” the component pebbles not having been shaped on the spot,
but brought as pebbles from elsewhere; and he gives reasons for
supposing that they were derived from pebbly beds in the Lower
London Tertiary group and in the Red Crag. He also maintains
that the shells of the Westleton Beds and Bure Valley Beds are
derived from Crag deposits.       Reasons are given in the paper for
supposing that the pebbles of the Westleton shingle of East Anglia
came from the west, and that this moved eastward from the plateau
of Suffolk towards the sea. It is considered that these beds can
only be explained by a tumultuous diluvial movement.

   The author, recognizing that it is by a knowledge of the laws of
viscous flow that we must seek to extend our information concern
ing the movements of flowing ice, conducted an experiment, the
details of which are described in the paper, with a model of a glacier
composed of the modification of pitch usually known as ‘cobbler's
wax.’    In the model the pitch moved under                          its

  The following communications were read:—
   1. ‘The Stirling Dolerite.” By Horace W. Monckton, Esq.,
F.L.S., F.G.S.
    The rock described in the paper forms a mass about 8 miles in
length, with an average width of about a mile ; it is intruded into
the lower part of the Carboniferous Limestone series. There is
little doubt that the Abbey Craig rock, N. of the Forth, is connected
with the Stirling rock; and there is reason to think that the
igneous rocks of Cowden Hill and of the hills around Kilsyth are
outlying portions of the Stirling rock, being connected with it
underground.
  All these patches, as well as the main mass, are for the most part
composed of a more or less coarse-grained dolerite, the marginal
part always becoming finer-grained, whilst the actual edge has
apparently been a tachylyte now devitrified.
   The author gives the results of his macroscopic and microscopic
examination of the rocks from various parts of the mass.         He
describes rocks from the centre, and also towards the bottom and
top of the main mass, including actual contact-specimens from
the bottom at Sauchie Craig and from the top at Sauchieburn
as well as contact-specimens from minor sheets ; and he infers
that the sequence is somewhat as follows (beginning from the
centre):—
   (i)   Coarse-grained         ophitic dolerite, forming the greater part                     of
           the mass.
  (ii) Fine-grained ophitic dolerite, say            10    to       20 feet from the
           margin.
 (iii) Basalt with very little augite, and with rods
                                                                     in of

Postlethwaite,     Esq., F.G.S.
  Several      cuttings     have recently been     made        on   the Cockermouth,
Keswick, and Penrith Railway, chiefly through drift, though                               some

occur in the Skiddaw Slates, and in one case a diabase dyke (much
decomposed) was met with.          It is similar in character to a rock
exposed about 3 mile west of Troutbeck.
   The author describes the drifts as blue clay beneath, and brown
clay above, and considers that these two clays were produced during
two separate periods of glaciation, with no long interval between.
In some places near Keswick water-borne gravel may be seen
surmounted by blue clay; this gravel is considered by the author
to be of fluviatile origin. A section at Keswick Station is described:
it is 130 yards in length, with a slight break in          50 yards      the   it,                  of
western end being cut back           feet     the north.

   2. “Geological Notes of a Journey round the Coast of Norway
and into Northern Russia.’      By G. S. Boulger, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S.
   The author accompanied the Jackson-Harmsworth Polar Expe
dition as far as Archangel, and returned by way of the River Dvina.
His observations relate mainly to four points:–the origin of the
foliation of the Norwegian gneiss; the question of raised beaches on
the North-western      coast of Norway; the boulders and boulder
formation of Northern Russia; and the Trias of the Dvina valley.
   Between Christiansund and Tromsö the author was struck with
the wide-sweeping folds of the foliation-planes       of the gneissose
rocks, which appeared to him more readily explicable on a theory
of dynamo-metamorphism of rocks originally in part igneous, than
by any process of diagonesis.    He notes that the terraces observed in
the transverse fjords would be perfectly explained by the formation
of ice-dammed lakes, though the terraces of the Gulf of Omega
seemed less dubious raised beaches than those of the North-west of
Norway.       He confirms the views of previous writers that many of
the boulders of the boulder-formation     of Northern Russia are of
 Scandinavian origin. The beds on the Dvina consist of sands and
loams, often coloured red, with bands of alabaster and anhydrite.
The strata are horizontal or inclined at a low angle.         North of
Ustyug Veliki the strata are marked as Permian on the Russian
maps, and those to the south as Trias, but the author saw no per
ceptible break in the succession.

   1. ‘On a well-marked       Horizon of Radiolarian Rocks in the
Lower Culm Measures of Devon, Cornwall, and West Somerset.”
By George Jennings Hinde, Ph.D., F.G.S., and Howard Fox, Esl.,
F.G.S.
   In    the Lower Culm Measures the basal Posidonomya-beds and
the Waddon Barton beds with Goniatites spiralis consist of fine
shales with thin limestones, and above these are the beds which
form the subject of the present paper. The Upper Culm Measures
consist of conglomerates, grits, sandstones, and shales, with occa
sional beds of culm. There is evidence of the partial denudation
of the Radiolarian rocks during the accumulation of the Upper
Culm beds, as indicated by the presence of pebbles of the former in
the latter.
   The Radiolarian Beds consist of a series of organic siliceous
rocks—some of a very hard cherty character, others platy, and yet
others of soft incoherent shales. They are spoken of as the Codden
Hill beds—a name applied to them by previous writers, though the

                  -
3.18                         Geological Society:—
 authors do not include in this series all the beds which have been
 referred to it by others. The term ‘Grits, which has been used in
 connexion with these beds, is a misnomer; there are beds which
are superficially like fine grits, but they are found to be radiolarian
 deposits.
    The Codden Hill Beds occur along a comparatively narrow belt
of country, a short distance within the northern and southern
boundaries between the Carboniferous             and Devonian systems.
 Starting with the northern exposures, the authors give a descrip
 tion of the beds as developed in various localities from the neigh
bourhood of Barnstaple (Codden Hill itself, situated 3 miles S.E.
of Barnstaple, being a convenient starting-point), past Dulverton,
to Ashbrittle in West Somerset. On the south the beds are
traceable from Boscastle to the neighbourhood of Tavistock, and on
the east side of the Dartmoor granite they are found near Chudleigh
and Bovey Tracey.
    At present there are not sufficient data for estimating the
thickness of the radiolarian         deposits;   but they are probably
some hundreds of feet       thick,  though   the whole does not consist
of beds of organic origin. In a quarry in the Launceston district
50 feet of radiolarian cherty rock are seen without admixture of
shale.
    A detailed description of the lithological characters of the rocks
of the series is given, and analyses by Mr. J. Hort Player; a
marked feature of their composition is the very general absence of
carbonate of lime. The microscopic characters of the rocks are also
described, and the small amount of detrital matter in the beds of the
series is noted.
    Forms belonging to 23 genera of radiolaria have been recog
nized, included in the orders Beloidea, Sphaeroidea, Prunoidea,
Discoidea, and Cyrtoidea; in addition a scanty but significant fauna
of corals, trilobites, brachiopods, and cephalopods is present in
some thin shaly beds near Barnstaple.                                  H. all

   2. “The Geology of Mount Ruwenzori and some Adjoining
Regions of Equatorial Africa.’ By G. F. Scott-Elliot, Esq., M.A.,
B.Sc., F.L.S., and      J.
                    W. Gregory, D.Sc., F.G.S.
  Ruwenzori     is a mountain between the Albert and Albert
Edward    Nyanzas.    Topographically it is a narrow ridge which
extends for about 50 miles in a direction from N.N.E. to S.S.W.
Its summit attains a height of 16,500 feet.               The western
slope is at an angle of 22°; the eastern slope at about one of 4°.
The authors describe sections across the ridge at right angles to
its trend. These show that Ruwenzori is not volcanic, nor is it
a simple massif of diorite.       Epidiorite occurs only as banded
sheets in the schists on the flanks of the mountain, and is not the
central rock of the ridge. The strike of the flanking schists seems
to run concentrically round the ridge as though the central rock
were intrusive into them. The highest rock collected, a coarse
grained granite or granitoid gneiss, may be an intrusive igneous
rock, but it may be part of the old Archaean series faulted up;

the Archaean   rocks, and the authors think         probable  that this it

   ‘    On Overthrusts            of   Tertiary Date          in   Dorset.             By    A.     Strahan,
Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
   The results given      this paper were obtained during
                             in                             re-survey                       a
 of   South Dorset on the 6-inch scale. The disturbances can be
 divided into two groups,    the one being mainly   Miocene date, and        of

 320                       Geological Society.
 the other of intra-Cretaceous (between Wealden and Gault) age.
 The former includes the Isle of Purbeck fold (which is the continua
 tion of the Isle of Wight disturbance), the Ringstead fold, the
 Chaldon and Ridgeway disturbances, and the Litton Cheney fault.
 In the latter are placed the anticline of Osmington Mill, the syncline
 of Upton, and a part of the anticline of Chaldon ; farther west the
Broadway anticline and Upway syncline, a fault at Abbotsbury,
and many other folds come into the same group.           These earlier
movements led to the well-known unconformity at the base of the
 Upper Cretaceous rocks.
    The Isle of Purbeck fold is accompanied by a large thrust-fault,
by which the uppermost zones of the Chalk have been pushed in a
vertical position under gently inclined lower zones. On the same
line of disturbance at Lulworth Cove, the squeezing-out of plastic
strata from a part of the fold where compression has been great, and
the folding and packing away of such strata in a part where there was
a tendency to gape, is described.       Farther west the same disturb
ance is accompanied by inversion of a great thickness of beds, great
compression, with vertical crush-planes and nearly horizontal slide
planes. The latter slope southwards, and the roof has moved north
wards and upwards over the floor; these slide-planes have accom
panied the phenomena of inversion.
    The Ridgeway fold and fault resemble those of the Isle of Pur
beck, but for some distance the thrust-plane has split, a part of it
cutting into the Oolitic floor on which the Upper Cretaceous rocks
were laid down, and causing a wedge of Oxford Clay, Cornbrash,
and Forest Marble to be thrust over Wealden, Purbeck, Portlandian,
and Kimmeridge Clay.
    The Litton Cheney fault is connected with an anticline in the
Chalk and Greensand which has been superimposed upon a syncline
in Kimmeridge Clay and Corallian.
    The intra-Cretaceous disturbances have been distinguished by the
fact that Upper Cretaceous rocks rest undisturbed upon them, the
difference in inclination amounting sometimes to 40°. This move
ment may have commenced before the Lower Greensand was laid
down, but took place principally between the deposition of that
formation and the Gault.
    The features produced by the earlier movements were planed
down before the Gault was deposited, and have had no share in
 producing the existing physical geography.      The later movements,
 on the other hand, have determined the lines of drainage and the
great physical features of the region.

   3. It is true (or a very close approximation) in the case of
dissolved salts, especially in dilute solution.
   4. It is a less close approximation in the case of simple
liquids undergoing thermal expansion.

     Itis at once apparent that the introduction of 8 tends
 to remove the anomalies, and also evident why cases 1, 2,

 formulae.
    In 1 and 3, that is in the case of gases and dissolved salts
 respectively, the value 3 is negligible compared with r.

     5. The value of 8 given by a liquid enables us to apply
         the Gladstone formula (amended) during the transition
         from the liquid to the gaseous state.
     6 . There are grounds for believing that the value of 8 is
         related to other volume-relationships of the substance,
         as, for example, the specific volume at the boiling
            oint.
     7.    }. some cases there may be a connexion between                                          8    and
           the coefficient of thermal expansion.
   A further argument for the introduction of the quantity 8
is the fact that it will remove certain anomalies in molecular
refractions, bringing the value for hydrogen, chlorine, &c.
into harmony wi<U+017F>h that given by the gaseous elements.     This
point, together with others of a like nature, is reserved                                                for

            The Gladstone    “Law"   in Physical Optics.      341
    On examining this table we find that the new expression
gives results which very fairly agree with those derived from
Lorentz's formula.      The average difference between the two
is about 5 per cent., a difference not greater than that which
would be yielded by the expressions of Clausius and Maxwell.
So far as this agreement goes we may regard
                            *E*@-8)
as a fair approximation to a volume quantity, which I may
be allowed to call “molecular domain.”
   The value, as given by either formula, increases with the
temperature.      The highest increase by the u” expression is
about one   per  cent. in the case of aniline.  Whether such an
increase could be attributed to the molecule proper, is an
unsolved problem.       It is usual to regard the values yielded
by the Lorentz formula as more constant than here appears,
but the figures are too numerous and too reliable to leave any
doubt about the magnitude of the change.
       I
    As have already said, it seems probable that domains will
change in the same ratio between the same temperature limits.
This can be tested for the new expression by the figures in the
last column, which gives the ratio of the two values for
                 (-)-º
found at two temperatures.
                                  or “..."(…B)
   To facilitate comparison, the substances are arranged in
groups, marked off by a line.     The members of each group are
heated between     approximately   the same temperatures.    Thus
thymol is heated between 24°4 and 77°, cinnamic alcohol
between 24°8 and 77°. The domain of the first increases
                                                             |.
in the ratio 1:01:54, that of the second in the ratio 1:0152.
    The members of the large group beginning with heptane
 and ending with ethyl cinnamate are heated between
 the lower of which lies between 4° and 12°, while the upper
 limit lies between 87° and 90°. The new domain rises
 generally in this group by 3 per cent. Out of the ten sub
stances, seven give a ratio of increase very near to 1:030, the
 other three are near 1:027.
    The next group includes eight substances heated between,
 say, 12° and 100°. Three give ratios close to 1-033, two yield
 1-027. The last group is heated from 10° to 20° only, and
 gives ratios close to 1:004, except in the case of alcohol.
    These results seem to afford a reasonable presumption in
 favour of the figures being regarded as a measure of domain.
 There is evidently a tendency for the ratio of increase to be
 the same for the different liquids, although their densities vary

in the ratio of 5 to 1. It is surely improbable that molecules
of very varying atomic structure should have the same tem:
perature increase, but the same improbability does not attach
to “domain.”

   column 4 gives the ratio of the two indices, which are slightly
   corrected in column 5. This is done by calculating from
   columns 2 and 3 the average change in the index per degree,
   as shown in column 6. The figure thus obtained is used to
   calculate the change of index for 80° exactly, which means
   an alteration of only a degree or two for most substances.
   The ratio in column 5 is calculated then for a common interval
   of 80°, and will be somewhat nearer the truth than the un
   corrected ratio in column 4.

     aken   altogether,   the table affords   ground   for believing

    The question then arises, whether this last relation is direct,
or arises from some material property changing with the
temperature? Is it possible that the velocity of light may
vary with temperature, apart from any relation to material
substances, or is the foregoing relationship dependent upon
some molecular function like that suggested, that is “mole
cular domain P’’
    It seems impossible to answer the first part of this question.
The second part can be judged by analogy, which would
appear to suggest that a molecular function is more probable.
Thus, one might expect that the kinetic energy of the particles
 is the property directly increased by rise of temperature, and
that many or           all

that I have seen, bearing on the result found by Joule.
Shelford Bidwell*, while investigating the subject, obtained
results the converse of Joule's, indicating that not only
hardening but also annealing the iron diminished the elonga
ting effect. He mentions one specimen that, when annealed,
contracted in length instead of elongating upon the applica
tion of the feeblest magnetizing force.
   Barretti in 1870 discovered that nickel, when magnetized,
contracts instead of elongating.     Three years later A. M.
Mayerf    published an account of his experiments on this
subject.   His results, in the main, verified Joule's observa
tions, with the exception of the action of hard steel. This
discrepancy was shown some years later by Bidwell to follow
from their different methods of experimenting. Joule applied
a current of the same intensity but once, and both on making
and breaking the circuit observed an elongation ; while
Mayer used specimens already permanently magnetized, and
on observing the temporary magnetization found a contrac
tion on making circuit and an elongation on breaking                                       it.
   Mayer also observed hysteretic effects; that    the elonga                  is,

     Soft iron elongates when   magnetized.   The elongation
attains       a     maximum,
                         and then            with increasing

        its               Further increase    field causes the                      of

  Tension also diminishes the       elongation  and increases the
contraction of the rod.
   For sufficiently great tension
              a                            elongation occurs, the   no

 if the  magnet is cut in two the ends are held together by a
 force Bº. 87 per square centimetre, showing that this force
 must always be present when a rod is magnetized.                     The
 agreement between the theoretical value BºST and the expe
 rimental law for the lifting-power has been recently shown
 by E. Taylor Jones”. This effect for high intensities of magne
 tization is a large one, and becomes one of the most important
 factors in the observed changes in length.              The second of
 these mechanical stresses is the effect due to the change in
 Young's Modulus when the rod is magnetized.                    That the
 elasticity is influenced by magnetization was shown theore
 tically by   J. J.   Thomson }. and the phenomenon was observed
 last  year   in some experiments made by the writer; but no
 quantitative results could be obtained beyond the fact that
 the elasticity for soft iron was slightly diminished.         A. Bocki
 concludes from his work that the decrease in elasticity must
 be less than one-half per cent.          If the wire is not stretched
 by weights, this decrease in the elasticity will affect only the
 contraction due to the BºST force. This decrease in the
elasticity, according to Bock, is very small and less than one
half per cent. On the other hand, if the wire is loaded with
weights this effect becomes very marked since a large quan
tity, the stretch of the wire by the great weight, is altered.
This question will be more fully discussed later in the paper.
    If  these two indirect actions were allowed for, there would
remain only the direct action of the magnetism upon the
metal under a constant tension.             This latter relation would
evidently furnish comparable results, and may in the future
throw some light upon the action of magnetism on matter.

observe the effects of mechanical stress, it was convenient to
experiment on thin long wires of the metal placed in a vertical
position.     To magnify the phenomena, a system of levers was
used involving the tilting of a mirror mounted on three legs
very close together; a method first invented by Professor
Rowland. The general plan of using levers and a jacket

   The core of this coil was made of two co-axal brass cylinders
fastened together by the end plates of the coil. The space
between these two cylinders was filled with water, which
proved to be an excellent way of retarding the heat-effects
produced by the current.
                                               Method.
    I at first intended to measure the elongation and the corre
sponding induction simultaneously, but found this difficult,
and so adopted a more convenient and apparently as accurate
a method. This was to first measure                               l.
                                                    current used to
produce a given intensity of magnetism and the consequent
changes in length, and afterwards to get the relation between
the strength of field and the intensity of magnetism in the
iron, the apparatus in the meanwhile remaining untouched.
As the laboratory is situated in the city, the work had to be
done late at night after traffic had stopped, for, in spite of                                 all
the precautions that could        thought          be

elongation-curve, but was done the next morning.                   The

a   m.  The galvanometer was calibrated         means         by

  vary by more than one per cent.                The current was applied
  suddenly, and as soon as a reading was taken the contact was
  broken.      This operation was then repeated, the current being
  increased each time, and readings taken until the maximum
  current was reached.            By this means temperature-effects
  which are relatively slow to act were avoided.

   curve   is seen to closely resemble in form those given by

            produced in Iron Wires by Magnetization.                                355
Shelford Bidwell. When the relation is expressed between
change of length and intensity of magnetization, the curve
takes the very different form given by fig. 3, B. The wire
slowly increases in length until an intensity of about 800 is
reached. From that point until a maximum length is attained,
at an intensity of 1200, the elongation is more marked. After
reaching this maximum it rapidly contracts; the last portion
of curve being approximately a nearly vertical straight line.
The figure also shows that the point of maximum length does
not correspond to the point of greatest permeability of the
iron, as is seen by comparing this curve with the curve for
permeability plotted on the same figure.
   It is now necessary to make correction for the contraction
due to the Bº/81r force. This contraction is obtained from
                              2

elasticity. My apparatus was well fitted for measuring the
latter quantity.     A weight of about five kilograms was hung
on the wire and the elongations due to the additions of weights
of 20, 50, and 100 grams were read. From these Young's
 Modulus was calculated in the usual manner. It was found
 to be 2.2 x 10” for the specimen used.                The contractions due
 to the Bº<U+017F>&m force were then calculated                  and are given              in

  The last column               of this table was found by taking the
difference between the observed elongation and the BºST
contraction.   The relation between this corrected elongation,
due to what has been called the direct action of the magnetism,
and the intensity of magnetization is graphically shown by
fig. 3, A. The effect of this correction is to make the elonga
tion much greater for a given intensity.   The maximum value
of the elongation is more than twice as great as the observed
maximum. And the greatest intensity employed, 1300 C.G.S.
units, produces an elongation and not a contraction as ob
served.
    No correction for the change in elasticity was made. For
the present case it would be insignificant. See discussion of
errors at end of this paper.
                                 Effect of Hardening.
   The effect of hardening the wire was next considered.      A
piece of the same quality of iron was heated to a bright red
by passing a current through                          it,
                                    and then suddenly cooled.
After the operation the wire was much harder and only slightly
burnt        on
          the surface.   The observed changes      length, those                 in

  To find the effect of strain the wire was loaded with                          a
weight    750 kilog. per square centimetre, and the relation
            of

358              Dr. L. T. More on the Changes in Length
between the elongation and the intensity of magnetization
obtained as in the previous cases.        The wire was then loaded
with a   weight   of 1750   kilog.  per  square centimetre and the
same relations found.        The values are given in Tables III.
and IV. The effects of strains are also shown graphically by
fig. 5, for the observed and corrected value. On consult
ing the figure, it is seen that straining the wire produces the
the same change that hardening it does.             The values are
reduced, and the maximum points occur with less intense
magnetization.       The curves in this figure, as well as in the
two former figures, marked no load, have an inaccuracy due
to the strain caused by the weight of the jacket cylinder, and
should have ordinates a trifle greater.
    Although the change in elasticity has hitherto produced
little effect, as soon as the wire is much strained this cor
rection becomes very important and will modify the curves
materially.     This alteration in the curves it has not been
possible to make, as the relation between the change in
elasticity and the intensity of magnetization is unknown.
However, from Bock's results some approximations may be
             in at,
arrived       and these will      considered when the errors likely
                                   be
to  occur      this investigation  are discussed.

                                       Possible Errors.
   It   has been shown that the change  in elasticity occurring
when an iron wire is magnetized will modify the relation
between the intensity of magnetization and the elongation,
and it has been assumed that, except for heavily loaded wires,
this effect will be very small.  Bock” found as a result of his
experiments that magnetizing soft iron made it more incom
 ressible, and that the change in elasticity was less than one
   lf per cent. He could not find any relation between the
intensity of magnetization and change in elasticity, so that it
is impossible to give more than a probable maximum to the
correction it is necessary to make in the curves given in this
investigation.

affected by the correction, but probably the correction             in
creases with the intensity of magnetization.
   Changes in the length of the wire due to variations in
temperature are another possible source of error.        These
changes take place more slowly than the elongation produced
by the magnetization, so that the two effects may be separated.
To retard them still more the core of the solenoid was made of
two co-axal cylinders and the space between them filled with
                        ...
water. With this arrangement the current could be applied,
the reading taken, and the current shut off before the gradual
change of the zero point due to the heating of the wire by the
current could be               Changes in the temperature of
the room when      they did occur were too slow to noticeably
affect the results.
                                    Summary.
     The following is a summary of the results obtained by
this investigation      :-
   1. A relation has been obtained between the elongation
due to magnetization and the intensity of magnetization of
soft iron. When the elongation has been corrected for the
contraction caused
expressed
                         by the      #.  force, the relation may be
              thus:–A rod of iron elongates slowly until an
intensity of about 800 is reached. After that point the rod
elongates more rapidly and attains a maximum value of about
60 x 10-7 part of       itslength        at   an
                                           intensity     1200. With
                                                         of
greater intensities the elongation diminishes, the curve being
approximately       anearly vertical straight line.
     2. Hardening the wire diminishes the corrected elongation,
and the wire attains          its
                                maximum length          in less intense
                                                             a
field.
     3.    has been shown that when the wire
          It                                           stretched, the
                                                        is
                                                                     of an
change         elasticity due
               in                   to
                                    the  magnetization    produces
important effect.        Neglecting   this correction, the effects
stretching are similar        to
                               those caused        by
                                                  hardening the wire.
   Before    concluding  I    would  acknowledge     my indebtedness

tion      me, but also for his assistance and kind consideration

XXX. Of the         Kinetic Theory of Gas, regarded as illustrating
     Mature.      By GEORGE JohsstoNE STONEY, M.A., D.Sc.,
     F.R.S.,     Vice-President, Royal Dublin Society”.
     CIENCE     may be defined as the investigation of how
       nature  works, of how and why events in nature occur.
   This investigation is best carried on by employing the
Physical Hypothesis, viz., that the objects of nature act on
one another, either directly (action at a distance), or through
intervening media (which by many is supposed to be an
essentially different kind of action).     Now, the objects of
nature, in the more strict sense of that phrase, are syntheta
of human perceptions and ultra-perceptions; and syntheta of
perceptions cannot be what really act. Nevertheless, it is emi
nently useful to carry on our investigation under the physical
hypothesis that it is they which act, and to confine our efforts
to tracing out what effects this action must be supposed
capable of producing, and under what laws it must operate,
in order that it may account for what occurs in nature.
This, however, is felt by many persons to be too abstract an
attitude of mind; and to satisfy them, and create the plausi
bility which they demand, by relieving the fundamental con
ceptions of what is oppressively felt as the absurdity of
supposing that syntheta of perceptions act, it is usual to
supplement these syntheta by piling an aérial Pelion upon
this solid Ossa, and by supposing that in addition to the
sensible object which occupies any portion of space there is
what is called         its
                       material substance occupying the same
position, which, partly directly and partly             motions,      by   its
                                                                                           is of
acts      other material substances [the aether being one
           on
these material substances].        According      this, which    to
the   prevalent  hypothesis    among   both scientific and non
scientific men,        it these substances which travel about
                             is
through space; and the sensible objects, which are what we
see and feel, are supposed           accompany them
                                                to          their                in

will    do well * to eschew this somewhat convenient, but by no
means necessary, encumbrance upon the unadulterated pro
cess of physical investigation which treats the sensible objects
themselves, the bare syntheta of perceptions and ultra-per
ceptions, as though they were what brought about the changes
that occur in nature ; and which exclusively occupies itself
in tracing out the laws that must, under this hypothesis, be
in operation in order that the effects may be what they are.
     Another and a very useful scaffolding which helps us in
building up our investigation, is the introduction of forces
between the physical cause (which is always the vicinity of
some natural object) and the effect to be attributed to it
 under the physical hypothesis.          We are thus enabled to speak
 of the acceleration of a stone in its fall towards the earth
 either as being due to the neigbourhood of the earth, or as
 being caused by a force of gravitation which acts on               which                              it,

those which are consequences of such general facts as that
the molecules spend most of their time in travelling about
in straight lines like missiles, without a preponderance of
the kinetic energy of the motions in any one direction ; and
the further fact that the interchange of energy which occurs
    ring the encounters, and the immense number of these
encounters, lead to a rapid distribution to other motions of
any excess of energy which any one motion of any one
molecule may possess, and thus both equalize the pressure
throughout the gas and establish the prevalence of a con
stant average ratio between that portion of the energy which
manifests itself in the journeyings of the molecules, and that
which is occupied in internal motions of the Ba class.
    In order to make this language intelligible, it is necessary
to explain that in treating of gases it is convenient to use the
word motions in a generalized sense, so as to include both
                                       to all

  freedom ; but it is between certain quasi-groups of these
  degrees of freedom that the partition takes place under the
  Boltzmann-Maxwell Theorem.       These quasi-groups, like the
  momentoids which define  them, are of the same number as the
  degrees of freedom.
     n most cases, where the only forces intervening are inter
 actions between parts of the system, the energy can be ex
 pressed in the form required by the theorem.          But this is
    t the case when certain external forces * come into opera
 tion, as, for example, when the aether acts on molecules as
 well as the molecules or parts of a molecule on one another.
    Nevertheless, the theorem is of value in the interpretation
 of nature, because in many cases the aether intervenes some
 what as perturbating forces do in the case of the planets,
 modifying but not annulling the dynamical condition which
 would prevail if the sun's attraction alone exercised dominion
 over them.
    On the other hand, it must be remembered that such a
 vast number of molecular events are crowded together within
 a duration that appears very short to us, that small effects

v/  1. On the small volume and the short time, as estimated by
 what are involved in human experiments, which suffice for
 the requisite averages—since each cube of a micron (the
 thousandth part of a millimetre) in the volume of the gas
 contains about 1000 millions of molecules * if it be under
 the same pressure and temperature as atmospheric air, and
 each of these molecules meets with about seven million
 encounters within the thousandth part of one second.

    time-integrals of the several terms of this expression are equal,
    and that the average value of T is 1/Nth of the total energy
    in the gas, N being the number of molecules; in other words.
     that the molecule exhibits one-sixth of its share of the total
     energy in each of the following ways, viz.:-1°, in its
    journeyings east and west; 2°, north and south ; 3°, up and
    down ; 4°, 5°, 6°, in spinning on each of        three principal                      its
         s. To simplify the conception as much as possible, we may
         e
         pose our model of a molecule to be a smooth ellipsoid of
     uniform density.
        Let us next represent the molecules by ellipsoids of revolu
     tion. The full expression for the energy of such a body is—

    Postponing for the present the observations which the
d;fails of this table suggest, and taking a general survey of
it, it was difficult to see how the small number of degrees of
freedom suggested by the Boltzmann-Maxwell Theorem, as
shown in the last column of this table, could be reconciled
with the known great complexity of the molecules of which
real gases consist, until Professor FitzGerald pointed out
 (Proceedings of the Royal Society for February 14, 1895,
p.      312) that
                       *...*.*.*.*.*.*.*.
are intimately connected with the ponderable matter of the
molecule, must perform the function of a more or less perfect
linkage between molecules, compelling them, so far as some
of their motions are concerned, to move together in swarms.
This follows at once from the circumstance that the electro
magnetic waves, in which radiant heat and light consist, are
hundreds of times longer than the average intervals between
molecules in gases at the pressures and temperatures at which
the gases in the table were when experimented on to deter
mine the value of y.
   There may be a hundred degrees of freedom in a molecule.
Of these the three which are concerned in                power                     its             of
travelling about between          encounters are not affected by

                                                                as                       97

             or           Accordingly,     regards any one mole as

     376                          Dr. G.          J. Stoney                   on the
     or in some other form through the aether, or in some other
     way, as, for example, from a disruption of chemical bonds.
     But though the encounters would be unequal to the task of
     arousing them from a state of quiescence, they, on their side,
     if brought into a state of activity by some other agency may
     be able to impart energy to A and Ba events, which are the
      roximate dynamical cause of the ordinary gaseous laws.
     This peculiar behaviour, whereby energy passes more freely
     one way than in the opposite direction, is a dynamical conse
     quence of the linkage between molecules to which Professor
     FitzGerald has called attention.     Owing to this linkage the
     encounters may have to produce an effect on a platoon of
     molecules in order to affect the Bl, motions of any one of
     them ; and as these encounters are many and irregular their
     aggregate effect can be but small wherever the linkage is
     effective ; while, as regards the reaction, the body of linked
     Bb motions act in each encounter on the A or Ba motions of

    In chemical reactions, if the product is       gaseous, and if the
electrons which are set swinging are associated              with Ba
 events, the most obvious       effect  is a sudden increase of tem
perature and pressure ;         if associated with Bb, events the
 most obvious effect is a flash of light; and if associated with
 Bb, events both effects will be conspicuous: and this, in ac
 cordance with what we learn through the phosphoroscope,
 would seem to be what most frequently happens.
    It seems probable that it is when excited by chemical reac
 tions that electrons produce their most conspicuous luminous
 effects, whether in flames or in so-called incandescent spectra.
 It should be remembered that as electrons are for the most
|.      associated with Bb motions within the molecule, it may
   appen that they but slowly influence the temperature of the
gas as indicated by the thermometer, and that accordingly
 the luminous effects may be greatly in excess of what a mere
incandescent body at the same moderate temperature could
produce.       Hence the phrase incandescent spectrum is not
           }.
always appropriate, since the supposition that the temperature
inside a           er tube must he high is erroneous.
    These inferences are entirely borne out by the recently
published observations of Professor Lewes upon gas-flames
(see Proceedings        of the Royal Society for March 7 and
March 21, 1895).          He finds that the first group of chemical
changes which the issuing gas undergoes are brought about
by radiant heat; in other words, by electromagnetic waves
in the aether acting on those electrons which are concerned
in the chemical changes, and which, from their not being
affected by convected heat, must be associated with Bb, and
not with Ba events.         In this way

are produced.        Of  these, acetylene is the one that, on decom
position, emits almost all the light.          Professor Lewes finds
that, on attaining a situation where the temperature is suf
ficient, the acetylene resolves into carbon and hydrogen,
which subsequently combine with oxygen ; and that in the
brief interval one or both of them emit more light than belongs
to the temperature of that situation ; in other words, that one
or more electrons associated           with Bb motions have been
roused into great activity by the decomposition, and have
time to radiate abundantly, probably a long time from the
molecular standpoint, before either they have expended their

whichever event comes first.
   The summary of the results of this recent investigation
have been here translated into molecular language, to serve
as an example of the additional insight which we may already
hope to gain into the chemistry of nature by adopting                                                             the
molecular standpoint; and whenever the secret       the motions                            of

from the swiftest of them to the slowest.       On the same
immense time-scale the duration of the journeys of the mole
cules of ordinary air would average about one day each, while
the encounter which closes each journey may last some 20
minutes". The motions of the limbs of animals are able to
accomplish a good deal in a struggle lasting 20 minutes. On
the same scale, the ten-thousandth of a second of time grows
to be an immense duration, extending to 1900 years.      The
number of struggles to be encountered by each molecule in

number of days in the whole Christian Era, from the birth of

myself, for the same concentrations of some or                these                       all    of

more work            on
                 this problem was necessary was further shown
 by  the fact, that       two   no               of

                                                        to
our knowledge seems            far more satisfactory.

gleichen Resultate führen.” The authors recognize that this

Abbot conclude, “Die Veraligemeinerung dieses Resultates

berechtigt.”    We have then the three methods—conductivity,
lowering      the freezing-point, and solubility—having

385        Mr. H. C. Jones       on the Cryoscºpic    Relations
to the most dilute solution.         Had the series been extended to
any very considerable dilution (say 0 005 n), with the same
rate of increase molecular lowerings would have been found
differing uninistakºy from the calculated constant.                 This
can be seen most     accurately     by  plotting the results in a curve.
    While the correction-term for ethyl alcohol was small
enough to be neglected, with cane-sugar it assumed consider
able dimensions, amounting to 0-006, where the quantity
measured was only 0-0277, being thus somewhat more than
one fifth of the whole.            Unless a correction-term enjoys
mathematical exactness, its introduction, when amounting to
more than 20 per cent... would not tend to increase our con
fidence in the final result.            The results throughout with
cane-sugar are not very convincing, being only very rough
approximations      to the theoretical value 1:87.           It further
seems desirable to know how Nernst and Abegg assured
themselves of the purity of the compounds which they
employed, since one searches their paper in vain for evidence
that this, the chemical side of the problem, has received any
attention.
   The experimental work of Nernst and Abegg as recorded
in the paper in question", as it appears to me, may be fairly
summarized thus.         When measurements were made of the
lowering of the freezing-point of water by dilute solutions of
cane-sugar and ethyl alcohol, and when the former were cor
rected by a term amounting to as much as 22 per cent. of
the quantity measured, and the latter not corrected at all,
values were obtained for molecular lowerings which were not
more than 6 per cent. greater (1.97 for ethyl alcohol) than
the theoretical, 1-87; nor more than 7.5 per cent. less (1:73
for cane-sugar).      From their results the authors concluded
that  non-electrolytes     give theoretical results.
   A valuable suggestion, however, which can be tested expe
rimentally, has been made in this paper by Nernst and Abegg;
and the object of the work herein described is to study the
effect of the temperature of the freezing-mixture on the
results. The authors thought that the difference between the
results found by the different experimenters, working with
cane-sugar for example, was caused by the use of freezing
mixtures of different temperatures.              How far this was of
influence will  appear     from the    following  work.
   In this investigation cane-sugar solutions were used for
the most part, since with this compound so many have worked
and have obtained such widely different results; and, further,
it was with this substance that the above-mentioned correction

was considerable.       few solutions of ethyl alcohol were also
                          A
investigated under the same conditions as those employed for
cane-sugar. To the results obtained for this compound Nernst
and Abegg introduced no correction.
   The cane-sugar used was a beautifully crystallized sample,
which was shown by analysis to be free from inorganic matter
and from dextrose.     A one-half normal solution was prepared
each day from a carefully dried specimen, and in no case was
a solution used which had been made up more than twenty
four hours.
.  In the first series of measurements, a freezing-mixture of
such temperature was employed that the air-bath surrounding
the solution whose freezing-point was to be determined was
at no time colder than –5°. The apparatus used was essen

       that already described.  The stirring was carried on
very slowly and regularly, and a comparatively large amount
of ice    was allowed     to separate from the solution                      before the
reading was taken on the thermometer.

388              Mr. H. C. Jones on the Cryoscopic Relations
agree to within experimental errors, and are in all cases
much greater than the theoretical value.
   These results do not differ to any considerable degree from
those which were found when cane-sugar was first studied *.
   It was then decided to make some determinations in which
the temperature of the freezing-mixture      differed from the
freezing-point   of the solution under    investigation  by an
amount so small that the latter only just froze.                     The
freezing-mixture       used was prepared from alum and ice.
But on account of the large volume of the solution used
(1100 cubic centim.) and the large air-space which se
rated this from the freezing-mixture, it was found that the
time required to cool the solution even 0°-5 was so great as
to be impracticable.          A freezing-mixture which answered
the   requirements    satisfactorily  was prepared as follows:—An
intimate mixture was made of powdered ice and alum, then a
very small amount of common salt was added. This mixture,
when used in my apparatus, gave a temperature in the air
bath around the solution of never more than 0°5, and usually
less than 0°4, lower than the freezing-point of the solution.
The solution was cooled down to within a fraction of a degree
from       its
           freezing-point          colder bath, and was then placed
                                          in
in   the bath surrounded           the mixture just described.

ring. The water containing the ice was allowed to remain in
the bath until the thermometer rose to a point at which it stood
constant for from five to ten minutes.     About half an hour
elapsed from the time that the first ice separated until the
final reading was taken on the thermometer.           A second
determination of the freezing-point of the water was then
made, just as the first had been. The thermometer used in all
of this work was the one already described * as of the Beck
mann type, and divided directly into thousandths of a degree.
Knowing the freezing-point of the water on the thermometer,
the vessel containing it was removed from the bath, the ice
melted, and then a measured volume of the water pipetted
off. An equal volume of a one-half normal sugar solution,
which had been prepared only a few hours, was then added.

its freezing-point determined in      respects    that     all

somewhat lower for the more concentrated.        Since this work
was  undertaken,   Raoult has  kindly  informed me that he has
repeated his work with cane-sugar, using an improved cryo
scope f, constructed so as to prevent direct radiation from
the freezing-mixture to the bulb of the thermometer.        This
was accomplished by interposing a sheet of platinum, which
served at the same time as a stirrer.     Results were obtained
which  agree well with those found earlier by himf, strengthen
ing him in the belief that the molecular lowerings of cane
sugar in dilute solution are greater than the calculated, and
that this increases with the dilution.            I
                                              take the liberty to
quote a line from the letter of this distinguished authority, on
problems of this character : —“Pour conclure, je reste con
vaincu que les abaissements moléculaires de l'alcool en dissolu
tion aqueuse, comme ceux du Sucre, deviennent de plus en plus
supérieurs à la valeur normale à mesure que les liqueurs
deviennent plus étendues.”    And who deserves to be heard
in reference to the freezing-point method if it is not Raoult?
since it was he who showed, by his extended investigations S,
the significance of “molecular lowerings,” and gave us in
this method the means of determining the molecular weights
of substances in solution i. What has been done subsequently
in this line either bears an evident theoretical relation to the
work of Raoult, or consists in devising better apparatus and
more accurate methods for carrying out the measurements.
 To summarize:—In the above tables are recorded the results
of measurements of the freezing-point lowerings of water by
solutions of two non-electrolytes.  The work was not extended
to dilutions greater than 0-01 normal, since for greater dilution
the experimental errors necessarily increase.       But for the
dilutions used molecular lowerings were found, which rise
very appreciably above the theoretical value.        Methods of
work were employed which seem to eliminate experimental
errors arising from too cold a bath, too vigorous stirring, or a
failure to establish equilibrium in the solution, and still the

                                 I
of this new work, do not see a sufficient justification for the
conclusion that non-electrolytes,  in fairly dilute solution,
give lowerings which conform to the equation t=0.02                                                     A

very satisfactory agreement for more concentrated solutions
has been shown by others and confirmed by myself".            That
such a   discrepancy  should exist for very  dilute solutions does
not appear to me to be a priori impossible. Take the case of
dilute gases. The law of gaseous expansion with temperature
is fairly well established as an approximate expression of the
truth, yet Ramsay and Balyt have recently shown that it
does not hold when the gases become very dilute.               The
coefficient of   expansion for dilute gases is not a constant,  but
is sometimes greater, and at times less, than the normal. To
illustrate this,            I

ment on the north side of the central valley, though it is noted on
a more limited scale in a few localities farther south.                It is well
exposed in the cliffs 3 miles north of Peel, but the finest sections
are in the interior in Sulby Glen, where the structure has a
thickness of some hundreds of feet, and runs continuously about
north-north-east for 5 miles, with a probable extension southward
for 3 miles farther, and also eastward for other 4 miles. It is
usually flanked by gritty flags on one side, and by dark clay-slates
on the other.         It is affected by a strain-slip cleavage later than the
brecciation, and several igneous dykes which intersect it are affected
by the same cleavage, though not by the brecciation-movement.
     East of Sulby Glen the structure extends towards Ramsey, at
first in a horizontal spread over a mile in width, and afterwards in
 a series of comparatively narrow subparallel bands, and it is sug
 gested that we are dealing here with the emergence of a deformed
 plane.      The structure is continued eastward into the hill overlooking
 Ramsey, beyond which it is cut off by the sea.               In this locality, as
 elsewhere, the sections show the gradual smashing into fragments
 of highly contorted strata until every trace of the original bedding
 is lost, and a ‘crush-conglomerate' with lenticular and partly
 rounded inclusions is formed.
     The rocks described in Mr. Watts's Appendix are grouped in four
 classes.      Firstly, the grits and slates which have been crushed
  but have not been converted into crush-conglomerates;                  secondly,
 the    crush-conglomerates        themselves,  and the   fragments  which they
  contain; thirdly, the dykes of decomposed dolerite (greenstone)
  and fresh later dolerite which penetrate the conglomerate;             fourthly,
  a portion     of the crush-conglomerate         metamorphosed by these       in
  trusions.
      The chief point of interest is brought out by the examination of
  the fragments in the conglomerate.            All stages of crushing may be
  traced, until the grit-fragments have a structure which is a mere
  miniature of the crush-conglomerate itself; that is to say, if the
  crush-conglomerate be regarded as made of “fragments’ of hard
  rocks enclosed in crushed ‘matrix’ of soft rocks, a host of inter
  mediate varieties with varying resistances will occur.                  Whether
  any particular one of these varieties shall pass into ‘fragments’ or
   ‘matrix’ under the crushing will depend upon the amount of the
   crushing force and upon the association (paragenesis) of the material
   brought together to be crushed.

        A SIMPLE METHOD OF DETERMINING THE DURATION OF
                TOIRSIONAL OSCILLATIONS.            B.Y. R. W. WOOD.
      N what follows       I wish   to describe a method by which the time of
       torsional oscillations     may be conveniently observed, for instance
   that of a magnet in determining the horizontal intensity of terres
   trial magnetism.        The usual methods labour under the drawback
   that the watch and the oscillating body cannot be simultaneously
   observed.      In the present method the watch is brought into the
   field of view of the telescope with which the vibrations are observed.

396                      Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
     A small light mirror is fastened with wax to the vibrating body
 in the usual way, and a telescope is sighted at a distance of about
 two metres. Between the telescope and the mirror is fixed near
 the latter a thin plane glass, silvered by means of Böttger's solu
tion, making an angle of 45° with the vertical. This must reflect
more light than it transmits.
    A watch is placed on a table below the mirror so that its image
reflected from the silvered surface is distinctly visible in the field
of view of the telescope. The watch must be brightly lighted by
a lamp, and another lamp so placed near the telescope that                  rays                                    its
passing through the transparent coating are reflected                  the small                          by
mirror into the telescope. On looking through the telescope after
the body has been made         oscillate, we see the second-hand strongly

several mixtures of different composition in each case.   But
the results, as well as those of Wüllner on alcohol and water,
are not expressible by equation (18); that equation is repre
sented by a simply-shaped curve, not possessing the most
characteristic  features of some of Konowalow's curves—
notably those of propyl alcohol and of formic acid.
   Brown, as previously mentioned, gives both vapour-pressure
and composition of vapour ; the two quantities should, of
course, give the same value of r.      He used, however, only
one mixture at   any  particular temperature—viz.,  that whose
vapour-pressure was 760 millim. Moreover, he states that
the vapour was cooled in the upper part of his distilling-flask,
so that the vapour which came over was presumably in equili
brium with a liquid of somewhat lower boiling-point (and
therefore containing less benzene) than that in the flask.
   It will be seen from the form of the equations, that when
t is given r can at once be found.   For

  In   order to test the theory developed in the foregoing
sections, and especially the accuracy of the expression adopted
for the relation of the composition of the vapour to that of
the liquid, experiments were undertaken.          The mixtures
chosen were of benzene with ethyl acetate and benzene with
methyl acetate, as those three liquids can be obtained with
ease in a reasonably pure state, and their physical properties
—such as vapour-pressure and vapour-density—show             no
abnormalities.  The constituents of the first pair have nearly
the same  vapour-pressure, so that their mixture is well adapted
to show the phenomena attending the existence of the maxi
mum of the curve connecting vapour-pressure with com
sition: while benzene and methyl acetate, on the other hand,
have widely different boiling-points, and a corresponding
wide difference between the composition of the liquid mixture
and    its
         vapour.

quantities of liquid, and at the same time to work very expe
ditiously, consisted in determining the refractive index by a
Pulfrich refractometer. This instrument—of the usual type
—was of sensitiveness enough to give the refractive index to
about 00005 (corresponding to about half a minute in the
angle reading).    Now, for benzene u = 1:50, while for the two
esters it is about 1:37; hence a change of composition of 'o
per cent. would cause a change in the refractive index of
'00013, and could quite well be detected. To attain that
degree of accuracy it was necessary to know the temperature
to about "o degree; as the temperature-coefficient is .00052
to 00065 per degree. The measurements were carried out
ina room that rarely differed by one degree from 18°, and it
was therefore thought sufficient to interpolate the temperature
coefficients of the mixtures from those of the pure substances
given in Landolt and Börnstein's tables, and reduce         the                         all

as giving q the composition of the distilland.                   Of the distillate
three samples were usually taken ; the first occasionally con
tained a slightly lower percentage of benzene, owing to the
 greater condensation of that liquid—the less volatile—on the
 º:
delivery tube ; the others usually agreed to within one or two
           per cent. The results are given in the following

XXXVI.        An Improved Calorimeter for the Application of the
          Method    of Mirtures. By F. A. WATERMAN".
     HE    determination of the specific heat of solids by the
        Method of Mixtures, as employed by Regnault, is
especially subject to error arising from the determination of
the radiation correction.         For the purpose of avoiding this
source of error, Mr. M. N. Hesehusf has suggested that the
calorimeter-cup be introduced           into the bulb of an air-ther
mometer and maintained at a constant temperature by the
introduction of a sufficient amount of cold water, of known
temperature, immediately after the introduction of the heated
solid. By this means both the radiation-correction and the
“water equivalent” of the calorimeter-cup are avoided.
    The heat received by the cold water being equal to that
given out by the heated body, the following simple equations
may be used :—
                         MS(T-6)=ms(6–t),
in which
     M= mass of      substance, the specific heat of which is to be
             determined.
     m= mass of cold water introduced into the calorimeter
             Cut).
     T=temperature of the heated body.
     6=initial temperature of the calorimeter-cup.
      t=temperature of cold water introduced into calorimeter
             cup.
     s= mean specific heat of water at the temperature used.
     S=specific heat sought.
    From this equation we have
                              S=   ms  (8–t)
                                T M(T-6).
the working equation used.
    The results obtained by this method, as submitted                by
Mr. Hesehus, do not appear to be as accurate, however, as
those obtained by the Method of Mixtures as practised by
Regnault. The ten determinations given of the specific heat
of brass varied from 0821 to '0969, or, omitting the result
 '0821, which was apparently erroneous, nine determinations

 414    Mr. F. A. Waterman on an Improved Calorimeter
 varied from 0908 to 0969, the probable error of the mean
 of the whole being much higher than is usual in the case of a
 similar series of results obtained by Regnault's method.        As
 the above method    appeared  to be a desirable one for some
 work in hand,    I have endeavoured to perfect a calorimeter

    The form of apparatus which
 very satisfactory after repeated trials, as is shown by the
 results here submitted.   It consists essentially of the following
 parts (see figure):—
   A  glass jar which supports, by a wooden cover, the bulb R
 of a glass air-thermometer, the manometric tube M of which,
in the form of a capillary U-tube, is supported in a vertical
position.    The manometric tube is supplied with a stopcock
 S. The glass jar is kept nearly full of water for the purpose
of maintaining the thermometer-bulb constantly at room
temperature and preventing any su den variation of tempe
rature due to air-currents. For the purpose of increasing
the sensitiveness of the thermometer, the liquid selected was

             for       the   Application of the Method of Mictures.                                                   415

made by Mr. H.                  J. Green, of Brooklyn, N.Y., and were
standardized by comparison with Yale Observatory Standard

ness of the calorimeter in measuring small quantities of heat
and the range of temperatures throughout which an investi
gation might be carried.
     This calorimeter,              as now made, enables the                             experimenter
of ordinary skill in manipulation      to obtain results which
are comparable in accuracy and         consistency with those
obtained  by  any  calorimetric method in use ; ordinary care in
weighing and in reading the thermometers used being the
most important considerations to be observed. For these
reasons it is well calculated for student use as well as for
research-work, for which        wide range       its

layer at a. . Of course the average effect of the collision is
largely to destroy the two small relative velocities lar/D and
—le/D,      and to convert the energy associated with them into
energy of agitation.       This is easily proved in the theory of
viscosity, and then it is assumed that on the average a single
collision suffices to bring a pair of colliding molecules both
into the permanent state characteristic of the layer in which
they collide. But, as will be shown below, a single collision
does not on the average suffice to bring about this state; and
the difficulty of defining in a simple manner the state of the
molecules in any layer at any instant, makes the relation
between viscosity and the constants of the molecules not so
 definitely specifiable as in the numerical relations hitherto
 given. w hat appears to me a better statement of the motions
 of the molecules in each layer will be given below, though
 the matter is really of slight importance in the case of a
 single gas; but when it comes to a question of a mixed gas,
 then a correct specification of the state of each layer becomes
 the essence of the problem.
     In the theory of the viscosity of a single gas, then, it is
 customary to regard only those molecules which collide in a
 layer as being characteristic of that layer, those molecules
 which are passing through it without collision being taken
 account of in some other layer where they do collide.               An
 approximate expression for the viscosity of a single gas can
 be very easily established; for if A is the mean free path,
 then, as the mean paths have their directions evenly distri
 buted in space, the mean projection of the free paths on the
 axis of a is the mean distance of a hemispherical surface of
 radius A. from the diametral plane, which is X/2. Thus                                       all

does not concern us in our present problem, which is to de
termine the viscosity of a mixture of gases in terms of the
viscosities of the pure gases and not absolutely. Accordingly
we can avail ourselves of the above easy and convenient
method of evaluating the viscosity of a mixture.   With r the
mean velocity of the molecules of the single gas, and v the
average number of collisions experienced by a molecule in a
second, then A= r<U+017F>y, and our result for a single gas becomes

rest, the effect of collisions between the two sets of molecules
would be to keep mixi”= max,”.       If one of the solid planes is
set in motion with velocity w, then on the average a molecule
of 1 and a molecule of 2 coming from opposite sides of the
layer at a to collide in it will, in addition to the velocities of
agitation, have velocities (a +A1/2) w/D and (ºr-A2/2) w/D.
And the velocity of the centre of mass of the two molecules
is not wr/D, characteristic of the layer at w; so that to assume
that a single collision between a 1 and a 2 suffices to bring
both to the state characteristic of the place where the collision
occurs is much less justifiable than in the case where 1 and 2
are identical.    It is true that, corresponding to the pair we
have just considered, there is another pair whose relative
positions are the reverse, so that the velocity of the centre of
 mass of the four molecules both before and after their col
lisions is the wa<U+017F> D characteristic of the layer where they
collide; but it is quite evident that there must be further
collisions before the four molecules can be treated as typical.
    It simplifies the course of the work if for the moment we
ignore this difficulty and push on for an expression for the
viscosity of the mixture on the assumption that             collisions                     all
are  as effective         single gas: the result will

   The only pairs of gases for which Graham's data have not
been given are N2O and H, and NO and H2, but the physical
constants for N2O are almost identical with those for CO2, and
the viscosities of its mixtures are almost the same as those of
mixtures of CO, ; for NO some of the data necessary for the
calculation are lacking.
   Puluj measured the viscosities of a large number of mixtures
of CO, and H, by the method of the vibrating disk (Sitzb.
Akad. Wien, lxxix.), giving the absolute values at 14°7 C.;
thus mi is 000147 and ma is 000089; the other constants
required in the calculation remain as above, and we have the

432                        Mr. E. H. Griffiths              on
due in some measure to a comfortable belief in the validity
of any conclusions arrived at by Regnault.          The disciples of
science are often accused     by the  public  of a lack of reverence
for tradition and authority, but my own experience leads me
to the belief that no class is more conservative.          the name         If
of a master of our craft is at any time associated with some
conclusion or numerical value, even his own subsequent cor
rections and amendments are liable to pass unregarded.
Numerous instances could be cited : as, for example, the
result of Joule's own comparison of his thermometer with
 Rowland's ; or, again, Regnault's statement of his doubts
concerning his conclusions as to the Latent Heat of Evapo
 ration of Water at low temperatures.
    Our feelings of veneration for great men and our admiration
of their work are, however, carried to harmful excess when
they act as a check on the criticism and revision of the nume
rical results of their experiments.      Since the year 1879, when
Rowland     published   his monumental work on the mechanical
 equivalent, there can,          I
                               think, be no doubt in any                                     un
biassed mind that Regnault's expression for the capacity
for heat of water is inaccurate at temperatures below 30°.
 Yet we find the most recent books of reference ignoring the
researches of Rowland, and still reducing                        .."quantities
to that impossible unit “the capacity for heat of water from
0° to 19° by means of Regnault's formula.
   My object in the first part of this paper will be to show how
vague and uncertain is our knowledge of the changes in the
capacity for heat of water as              its
                                      temperature varies.        shall            I
not attempt      to consider     any length the work
                                     at                            the           of    all
investigators who have attacked this problem, but shall                                      be
guided   by  one general principle         my selection; viz., that
however admirable the methods                       of in

sound the theories          on
                            which they are based, the numerical
results are useless unless the observer has devoted sufficient
attention  to the measurements         temperature.

thermal standard, except the capacity for                                    heat of water, has
been     adopted.            Its capacity at 0°, 4°, 15°, and    mean                          its

100709 and 1.00890 times that at about 14°C. His prin

438                      Mr. E. H. Griffiths on
this question of the capacity for heat of water as the thermal
                                                                            .
standard.   His answer was to the effect that the French
physicists did not feel that the problem could be profitably
attacked until some general agreement was arrived at with
regard to the scale of temperature to be adopted.
   The determinations of the capacity for          of water at
higher temperatures are still more uncertain than those below
30°. Many attempts have been made to solve the difficulty
by the use of Bunsen's calorimeter. Concerning these experi
ments Dieterici writes as follows”:-‘‘The great differences
which are shown by observations carried out in this manner
render it probable that this instrument is unsuitable for the
purpose.”    Now no one has been more successful in the use
of this apparatus  than Dieterici himself (vide his determina
tion of L and   J  by such means), and his opinion therefore
carries great weight.
   For example, Weltent, who performed a very elaborate
series of determinations with Bunsen’s calorimeter, finds a
maximum in the capacity of water between 0° and 7°; from
7° to 10° a decrease, from 10° to 20° an increase, then a
decrease to 40°, where it reaches a minimum, then rises to
70° and remains constant to 100°l
   Difficulties with regard to the measurement of temperature
are, however, much diminished by the use of Bunsen’s calori
meter, and the conclusions of different observers as to the
amount of mercury drawn into the instrument by unit mass
of water when cooling from 100° to 0° are in fair agreement.
For example:–
              Bunsen            .      .          .      .        .   .   15:41
              Schüller and Wartha                                 .   .   15:442
              Welten           .      .           .      .        .   .   15:47:
and hence     Bunsen, Schüller and Wartha, Wüllner, and
Dieterici  strongly  advocate the adoption of this “mean
calorie” as the thermal unit $.
  With regard to this proposal      would remark that the     I
discrepancy    between the above standard determinations
amounts to 1 in 250, and further, that even if the relation
between the heat developed and the weight of mercury is
capable of exact determination, the unit thus adopted would
be useless unless we knew its relation to the thermal unit “at
a temperature tº ;” for               all
                               thermal determinations cannot

difficulty in which we are placed by the existing uncertainty

    The value of the “mean calorie” in terms of a “thermal
unit at t?” has been indirectly investigated by Dieterici.
His determination * of the value of has, think, received           J            I

His value is 4.2436 x 10' f in terms of the “mean calorie”                                              f;

    We thus      see that the determinations of this ratio vary
from       1:013 to 19957, a difference of one part in 60, and an
additional uncertainty is introduced by the differences of 1 in
250 above referred to in the determinations by Bunsen,
Schüller and Wartha, and Welten, as to the weight of mercury
corresponding to the “mean calorie.”
    I think the considerations adduced in the preceding pages
are sufficient to justify the statement that our endeavours to
establish the capacity for heat of water as the standard of
calorimetric measurements have, so far, not met with success.
Nevertheless progress is essential.        Whatever may be the
calorimetric standard adopted, it will still be necessary to
obtain more exact information concerning the changes in the
capacity for heat of water, otherwise the reduction of the
results of different observers to some common standard will
remain an impossibility. I believe that the obstacles are now
not insurmountable.        Recent advances in the methods of
calorimetry and thermometry have placed more efficient in
#.
struments at our disposal. For example, the use of differential
  latinum thermometers does away with many of the difficulties
           connected with the measurement of small changes of
temperature, and, I would venture to add, the method which
I  found efficient when tracing the changes in the specific
heat of aniline is mutatis mutandis applicable in the case of
water.
    It is now chiefly a financial difficulty which blocks the way,
for the apparatus would have to be on a large scale and
necessarily expensive.
    If this Association        could     see   it,its   way    provide that apparatus

mensurable     with any other definite physical          quantity.

   In “Nature,” May 23, 1895, Mr. Spencer Pickering
advocates the adoption of the latent heat of fusion of ice as
the unit.   He writes as follows:—“A unit of convenient
magnitude         would              be one            equivalent              to     about           100   small

the value         of
                   this “fusion-unit’        with sufficient accuracy.
Mr. Pickering says “it should              determinable with quite

 time may have arrived for           consideration   a  Mr. Pickering's
 suggestion.      Both the “fusion-unit” and the “vaporization
 unit” would, however,                          be
                                  purely arbitrary, and,       repeat the                        to

 I     now pass       the consideration
                         to                   what appears         of

444                      Mr. E. H. Griffiths on
and more markedly by Professor Schuster and Mr. Gannon
when they entitled their recent communication to the Royal
Society “The Specific Heat of Water” ". Several objections
to this proposal of course immediately present themselves, of
which the most important is the want of agreement amongst
different observers as to the capacity for heat of water at any
given temperature when expressed in terms of such a unit.
The divergence is not, however, so great as is usually
supposed.
    I  will not enter at length into my reasons for especially
                                                     id:
selecting the work of certain observers; but the principle by
          I
which have been guided is the same as that                   influenced
my choice of experiments on the changes in water, viz. the
attention given to thermometry.
    I  also consider it necessary to reject results obtained by such
electrical methods as are dependent on the measurement of
resistance, if the observer has neglected the change in resist
ance of the conductor consequent on the rise in temperature
due to the passage of an electric current.
    I  propose to select the following:—
    (1) The results of the later experiments of Joule, as con
            sidered in the light of Professor Schuster's recent
            exhaustive re-standardization of Dr. Joule's thermo
            meters, Phil. Mag. June 1895. (Mechanical.)
     (2) The determinations of Prof. Rowland, 1879.                (Me
            chanical.)
    (3) The work of Miculescu.          (Mechanical.)
     (4) The work of Dieterici.       (Electrical.)
    (5) My own experiments of 1892. (Electrical.)
    (6) Prof. Schuster and Mr. Gannon's results in 1894.
            (Electrical.)
    Joule.—The        results of Joule's later experiments as an
 nounced by himself were 772:55 ft.-lbs., i.e. 4:162x 107 ergs at
 61°7 F. Joule's own comparison with Rowland's thermo
 meter raised this value, after certain corrections by Rowland,
 to 4.182 x 107 ergs. During this summer Professor Schuster
 published an account (Phil. Mag. June 1895) of his elaborate
comparison of the Joule thermometers with the nitrogen-scale
 of the Bureau International.        His conclusion is as follows:–
“Joule's equivalent of heat resulting from his own investi
 gation and reduced to the nitrogen-thermometer of the Bureau
 International, when expressed in ergs, becomes 4-173 x 10'.”
 (Temperature 16°5 C.)

remarked that Prof. Rankine had made a similar suggestion.

Rowland’s    work, and were it not for some doubts regarding the
                         I
thermometry should accept his results as conclusive. The                                                     in
vestigations by Professor Schuster above referred to “open out
the possibility that Rowland's value might have to be reduced
somewhat when referred to the Paris air-thermometer.”
   Professor Schuster's tables, however, indicate that any such
possible change would be very small, and the further com
parison (already mentioned) by Messrs. Bartoli and Stracciati
between Rowland's thermometer and a Tonnelot thermometer
from the Bureau International shows the agreement between
the two standards to be very close. The results of these
investigations modify my previously expressed apprehensions
regarding Rowland's thermometry, although             join with                           I
Professor Schuster in his desire that more Tight should be
thrown on the matter by a direct comparison of a Rowland
thermometer and the International         Standard.   Rowland's
value at 15° is 4:1895 x 107, and at 10°, 4.2 x 107.
   MICULESCU.-The following is a quotation from Professor
Schuster and Mr. Gannon's paper :-‘‘We now turn to an
investigation of Miculescu (Annales de Chimie et de Physique,
vol. xxvii. 1892), in which the mechanical equivalent of heat

series of experiments.     Its result is 4, 1857 x 107. He does
not state the exact   temperature  to which this applies, but                                                 all

    DIETERICI.-These experiments are characteristic examples
of the care and accuracy by which Dieterici's work is distin
guished, and possess one great feature of excellence, i.e. their
results are much less dependent than in previous cases on the
thermometers used by the observer, since no change of tem
   erature takes place during an experiment.           One correction,
   owever, is necessary in his value of       J  (4.2436 x 10'). The
resistance of his conductor was measured in terms of a legal
ohm, and the correction to the Board of Trade or “true ohm.”
reduces this value to 4.233 x 10', expressed in terms of the
mean calorie.      It must be remembered, however, that Bunsen,
Schüller and Wartha, and Welten differ by 1 part in 250
regarding the value of a constant on which the numerical
value obtained by Dieterici is dependent.
    My own ExPERIMENTs.--Naturally               I  can here say but
  º                                     I
little regarding   my   own work.         would,   however, venture to
        out in what I consider the strength of that determination
  ies. Two entirely different systems of thermometry were
used, viz.: a platinum-thermometer scale (the reduction to
the air-thermometer being based on the previous observations
by Professor Callendar and myself); also the thermometers
thus standardized were compared, under the conditions in which
they were used, with the nitrogen-scale of the Bureau Inter
national, when the range-value was found to be practically
identical and the actual elevation, as determined by the two
methods, differed only by 0°005. When it is remembered how
extremely dissimilar were the two methods of standardization,
the close agreement between the results greatly strengthens
the conclusions.      Again, the nature of the experiments enabled
me to vary the conditions to a greater extent than was found
possible by other observers, and thus any constant errors would
probably have been detected. That this was the case was
shown by the persistent failures (during the years 1888 to
 1891) to obtain consistent results when the conditions were
thus altered. The weakness of those experiments was that
 small masses of water were used. These masses were, how
 ever, chosen deliberately, as any increase would have led to
the accumulation of other causes of error *.                The value
 resulting from these experiments was given as 4,198 in terms
 of a thermal unit at 15° C.f Professor Schuster has since
pointed out a necessary correction of 1 in 4000 due to the
 specific heat of the air displaced by the water. This would
 give 4,199 × 107. In my original paper Mr. Clark and I stated
 our impression that in assuming the mean E.M.F. of our cells
 as 1:4344, instead of 1:4342, we were possibly in error, as there

were reasons for suspecting that the temperature of the
Cavendish Standard, at the time of comparison, slightly
exceeded that of our cells.
    In   “Science Progress, April 1894, I entered fully into this
matter, and a recomparison with the Cavendish Standard made
during the spring of this year (when greater attention was
paid to securing the equality of the temperature) confirms
my opinion that 1:4342 was            the more probable mean value          of
my Clark’s cells. This would diminish the value of by 1 in
4000, and it would thus remain 4:198x 107*.

     SCHUSTER AND GANNoN.— I regret that at the time of
writing I have only been able to obtain an abstract of the im
 portant investigation by Professor Schuster and Mr. Gannon.
This abstract, however, is sufficient to indicate the value of
    * There is one criticism of Professor Schuster and Mr. Gannon's
regarding my work to which I am glad to have this opportunity of
replying. The following is a quotation from the Abstract of their
paper:-"We may reasonably estimate the uncertainty due to the
cooling correction by calculating what the observed rate of cooling,
either at the beginning or the end of the experiment, must have been in
order to produce a difference of one part in a thousand in the final
                          .
results.” They remark later: —“In the experiments quoted by Mr.
Griffiths at p. 482, the loss of heat due to radiation and conduction
at the end of his experiments amounts to about 9 per cent. of his
heat-supply. If such           had been wrongly estimated to 1 per cent.
an error of one-tenth    per  cent. would result in the final value.”     This
criticism may be just when the rate of rise at the exterior temperature is
determined by the time of rising over the whole range, as was the case in
                                                              .
Professor Schuster and Mr. Gannon's experiments; in my own, however,
the rising rate at each part of the range was determined
                     º
                                                                 separate and
independent observations.      If their criticism were sound, the uncertainty
as to the rate of rise at any given temperature would depend on the
temperature-range of the experiments, whereas, had I doubled the ranges
my conclusions      as to  the value    of   .  when the temperature    of the
calorimeter crossed the exterior temperature, would remain unchanged.
True, the rate of change in the heat-capacity of water would be affected
by errors in the                   at the extremities of the range, but my
resulting value of   J  would remain unaltered when expressed in terms of
the heat-capacity of water at the exterior temperature.
    I  think, therefore, that Professor Schuster and Mr. Gannon over
estimate the possible errors in my results due to errors in the deter
mination of the “cooling rate.”          With regard to this “cooling cor
rection   ”I am in agreement with their conclusion that it probably varies
with the rate of rise, and I had, before the publication of Professor
Schuster and Mr. Gannon's work, expressed my views on this point in a
  aper on the “Specific Heat of Aniline" communicated to this Section in
  8941.    I have there shown that p (the “cooling coefficient") is a
function of the rate of rise in temperature, and           I  described some
experiments which led to the conclusion that the error, under cir
cumstances similar to those prevailing in my          J  experiments, was of
small importance unless the variations in the rate of rise were extreme.

448                           Mr. E. H. Griffiths                on
their work. It is unnecessary to say that in this case there
is not the usual doubt as to the thermometric data. In the
absence of further details I feel that it would be unbecoming
on my part to venture on a criticism of the experimenti
methods.    The result is 4, 1905 x 107 ergs, expressed in terms
of “a thermal unit at 19°1.”
   In endeavouring to make a comparison of the above results
the usual difficulty presents itself, viz., the impossibility of
expressing them with certainty in terms of any common
thermal unit.    This does not apply to Rowland’s deter
minations or to  my  own, since the observations extended over
temperature-ranges of 5° to 34° and 14° to 26° respectively;
whereas the other observers contented themselves with obser
vations grouped closely about some particular temperature.
Fortunately, with the exception of Dieterici's, the difference
between the mean               temperatures is comparatively small,                                  ex
tending from 11°5 in the case of Miculescu to 19°1 in the
case of Schuster and Gannon.     For the reduction of the obser
vations of   Miculescu, Joule,  and Schuster and Gannon to
some common standard, I propose to take the mean of the
conclusions of Rowland, Bartoli and Stracciati, and my own
as to the changes in the specific heat of water over the range
15° to 20°, and the mean of Rowland and Bartoli and Stracciati
over the range 10° to 15°, as mine do not extend much below
the latter temperature.   The results may be expressed as
follows:—

    In   addition to the above we have Dieterici's value after
correction to the “true ohm,” viz. 4-233 in terms of the “mean
calorie.”       No purpose would be gained by endeavouring
to express Dieterici's results in terms of the same unit as the
others, for, as       I  have endeavoured to show, the evidence
regarding the relation between the “mean calorie ’’ and the
“thermal unit at 15°'' is unfortunately so contradictory that
no comparison is possible until further light is thrown on the
subject.
     Plate VII.    shows, more clearly than the table, the relation
between      the    different determinations.           The dotted lines
indicate the values deduced             by  the above assumptions with
regard to the changes in the specific heat of water.
    I  quite agree with Professor Schuster’s conclusion” that
greater value should be attached to results based on mechan
ical rather than on electrical methods. He thinks it pro
bable that the correct value lies somewhere between Joule
and Rowland.          When we remember, however, the very small
rises of    temperature      on which the conclusions of Joule are
based, and the inevitable uncertainty connected with the re
standardization of his thermometers after so great a lapse of
time, we should,         I  think, give far the greater weight to
 Rowland’s conclusions.
     Many arguments can be adduced in support of the elec
 trical method of investigation.            The experimental difficulties
are less than when other methods are adopted, but on the other
hand the results are dependent on the validity of our values of
the electrical units.      I   felt this so strongly that I endeavoured
 so to   phrase   the title of my own paper on this subject as to
 show that I     regarded     that work as an effort to “establish the
 relation between the electrical and mechanical units,” and to
 trace the “changes in the capacity for heat of water,” rather
 than as a direct determination of         J.   I trust that I shall not be
 considered too      presumptuous      if I state that some doubts exist
 in my own mind as to the absolute accuracy of the electro
 chemical equivalent of silver.           A change of 1 in 1000 in that
 constant would       bring   into   very  close approximation the re
 sults obtained by Schuster and Gannon, Rowland, and my
  self; for, as a consequence, the number representing the
  electromotive force of a Clark’s cell would be also changed.
  No such alteration, however, could make the agreement abso
  lute owing to the different rate of change with temperature
  indicated by the experiments by Rowland and myself; our
  differences, therefore, must be partially due to thermometry,
  for no alteration in the constants involved in the work of
                        * Phil. Mag., June    1895, p. 501.

either observer could secure identity at more than one
temperature.
   An inspection of Plate     VII.   at temperature 10° will show
that the agreement between the values of Rowland, Schuster
and Gannon *, and my own is there very close.              Rowland’s
result at that   temperature   is 4.2 x  10', and if we assume that
value at 10° it is probable that our error will be of small
dimensions.
                              PART    III.
                       Practical Suggestions.
   The ideal thermal unit should
      (A) be a natural, not an arbitrary, one, and have some
           real relation with other units of energy.
               (In absence of further reasons the educational
           value of such a relation is sufficient to establish this
             roposition.)
      (B) It should not be dependent on the observations or
           conclusions of any one investigator.            Any such
           dependence must certainly result in future correc
           tions and changes.
      (C) It should be of a convenient magnitude, and should
           cause as little disturbance as possible in the nume
           rical values resulting from our present system of
           thermal measurements.
   We cannot, I think, do better in this matter than follow
the principles which have governed the choice of our elec
trical units.     Let us consider for a moment the steps by which
we have arrived at our present value of the ohm. The value
of the ideal unit was first defined, that value being some con
venient multiple of an absolute unit. The first attempt at the
practical standard, whose resistance should be that of the ideal
 one, is that of the B. A. Committee of 1863, and, as is well
known, their conclusion, expressed in terms of the length of
 a column of mercury a square millim. in section at temperature
0°, was                   104.83 centim.
    The work of Rayleigh and Schuster, Rowland, Glazebrook,
and others clearly demonstrated the existence of error, which
led to a redetermination by the International Congress of
 1881, when the value was increased to
                           106-0 centim.
    Lastly, we have the (so-called) final determination       of the
          * Assuming the validity of the reduction to 10°C.

                                the Thermal                Unit.                     451

Trade (July 1891), when the length was increased to
                                     106.3 centim.
  I have recalled      familiar facts in order to show how
                            these
great has been the advantage of proceeding on a sound
theoretical basis. We have here a change in the practical
standard amounting to 1% per cent, but the disturbance
caused by the successive corrections has been small, for the
fundamental basis of the whole system has remained unchanged.
Had the unit of resistance been arbitrarily selected and de
pendent on the behaviour of some particular conductor, which
further was subject to changes with whose nature we were
but dimly acquainted, each successive alteration would have
damaged the whole superstructure, and the progress of elec
trical science would have been hampered and retarded. Why
not proceed in an analogous manner with regard to a system
of thermal measurements P viz., first define an ideal unit
based on a system of absolute measurements and of a con
venient magnitude for practical use, bearing in mind condi
tions (A) and (C) supra.
    Let us next apply the information we already possess for
the purpose of making a first approximation to the physical
measurement of the unit thus selected, and, to use the words
                                                                 É.

    It would, think, be advisable to give the ideal thermo
dynamic unit some distinctive title.                       the most
appropriate one (a Joule) has already been annexed f, and
such being the case the ideal unit might with great propriety
 be termed a “Rowland” f, at           events proposeall    make     I         to     a

                                 of

  If  this last suggestion was generally adopted we should                                          be
able, when our knowledge                        of

   If it
believe
             be thought that the advantage of adopting what
            is termed a “round number" as a multiple of the
                                                                          I
absolute unit is more than counterbalanced by the selection
of   so low a temperature as one near 10° for the STANDARD
THERM, I would suggest the following alternative proposals:—

       (II.)    That (pending the results of further investigations)
                  we assume that a therm at 15° is a STANDARD
                  THERM.
      (III.) In     order to enable observers to express their results
                  in terms of a STANDARD THERM, we                      the
                  results of further  investigations)  assume the  validity
                  of the following expressions over the temperature
                  ranges indicated:—
                Range 10° to 15°,
                      Q.-Q41+000414(15–1)};

                      Qis-Q,41–'000284(t–15)}.
     I  think it improbable that the error introduced by propo
  sition II. exceeds 1 in 800 in either case ; at all events 1
  believe   it  to be as close an approximation       as the present state
  of our knowledge permits.
     An inspection of Plate VII. will          show that the actual mean
  of all the selected observers at 10°         and at 15° is as follows:—
                                     At 10°.                      At 15°.

  but   I  repeat that greater importance should be attached to
  the results of Rowland's experiments than to those of other
  observers.       Hence   I   selected 42 at 10° and 41.89 at 15° as
  the most probable values.
     With regard to proposition (III.) our position is more un
  certain, but when we remember the entirely dissimilar method
  of experiment adopted by the observers upon whose results
  these formulae are based, the comparatively close agreement
  over these ranges carries weight.
     Another subject to which the attention of the Committee
  should be directed is the determination of the relation between
  the mean calorie and the STANDARD THERM, suggested in pro
  position (II.).      Until this is accomplished we shall be unable

   I have brought this matter before your notice at the request
of the Officers of this Section, and, while sensible of the honour
thus conferred upon me, I regret that they did not entrust so

ments brought forward may stimulate discussion, and thus
accelerate our progress on to firmer ground.

necessary is the decision of some body having authority, whose
conclusions will command the respect and assent of the

measure such    temperatures; in consequence of which, for
instance, the temperature —207°2 of the hydrogen-thermo
 meter was only —200°4 according to the thermoelectric
junction; these differences changed irregularly with the
 temperature.   The measurements by means of a hydrogen
 thermometer have not yet been systematically carried out.
    We have no reason to suppose that the hydrogen-ther
 mometer fails at very low temperatures* ; Prof. Olszewski's
 experiments with thermometers filled with nitrogen, oxygen,
 and nitric oxide f, as well as Dr. P. Chappuis's with a
 carbon-dioxide thermometer f, showed that gas-thermometers
 give temperatures in agreement with true data, even at
 temperatures which are much lower than the critical tem
 perature of the corresponding gas. Moreover a comparison of
 the hydrogen-thermometer with an electric thermometer based
 on an increase of electrical conductivity when the temperature
 is diminished, shows that both are pretty well in agreement;
 the line representing the variation of electrical resistance with
 the variation of temperature is nearly straight $.            we use                      If
 Wróblewski's determinations         (taking   his results to — 193°
 to be in agreement with the hydrogen-thermometer)                  to
 draw the line of resistances, on approaching —200° we see an
 inflection of the line down towards the axis of temperatures,
 contrary to            its
                    whole course      far    this temperature.

difference afterwards decreases, and amounts to 7° at the ther
moelectrical temperature —200°4; Wróblewski did not go
further. Besides this irregularity, Dr. Ch.-Ed. Guillaume *
proved that we have no reason to distrust the hydrogen-ther
mometer at the lowest temperatures hitherto reached, and that
if we were obliged to extrapolate temperatures, it would be
better to do so by measurements of the variation of resistance
rather than by the electromotive force of the contact; that the
formula by means of which Wróblewski calculated the tem
peratures was badly deduced, and, as a necessary sequence,
that his results do not agree with fact.
   For these reasons, Prof. Olszewski directed me to measure
the temperatures of saturated vapour of oxygen by means of
a hydrogen-thermometer.       In the present state of our know
ledge we might hope to obtain more positive results, were it
but for this reason, that the manipulation of liquefied gases in
quantities incomparably larger and under conditions much
more convenient than was possible a few years ago, now
presents neither great difficulties nor dangers in practice.
   Oxygen was liquefied in the apparatus of Prof. Olszewski's
construction f, which served to obtain large quantities of
liquefied gases under atmospheric pressure.        From the steel
cylinder, in which oxygen was liquefied, it was poured out
into the glass vessel a, surrounded by three others in
order to isolate liquid oxygen from the influence of ex
ternal heat, and to prevent the vessel from freezing on the
outside, which would render it impossible to observe the
liquid oxygen within ; for the same reason there was at the
bottom of the outermost vessel b a layer of phosphoric anhy
dride.   The second vessel had a brass setting above, to which
a cover c, also of brass, to be fixed on it by means of four
screws ss', was closely adapted. In this cover, four openings
were made : the central one, which was the largest, was
destined to receive a little hydrogen-thermometer t; round
about it were three openings: the first served to                                 let   in

 engine, at the other end v with vacuometers, so that it was
 possible at any time to read the pressure the liquid was under.
 Between this apparatus and the air-pump there was placed a
 screw-cock, so that by turning it more or less it was possible
 to regulate very precisely the pressure of the oxygen, and to
 keep up at will and for a long time the pressure we required.
    As Prof. Olszewski pointed out some years ago, liquid oxygen
 can be preserved for a long time under the usual pressure";
 when the vessel described is employed, liquid oxygen may be
 preserved for hours; the triple air-layer and the quadruple
 glass walls isolate it perfectly well from the influence of
 external heat.    By pumping in order to lower the tempera
 ture, we obtain round the liquid oxygen a vacuum, by which
 a vessel of the sort approaches the principle of the “vacuum
jacketed vessels” of Prof. Dewar.        Whether such a vessel is
 in practice better than one surrounded by three layers of dry
 air, seems to me not certain ; at                     all

be explained by errors of observation.   The reason lies else

        Illumination of a Plane due to Small Source of Light.                                                     463
    From the foregoing numbers we       see that the value of
f always              with increase of temperature, both for
                  decreases
associating and non-associating bodies.     The only exception
is the value off for carbon bisulphide at –10°. The oscilla
tions off for oxygen and ethylene are simply due to diffi
culties in executing the experiments at such low temperatures.
The difference between the highest and the lowest value for
oxygen           is,
             however, not      great—it does not reach

Runge further observed that the less refrangible of the two
lines was much weaker than the other, and he found the
difference in the wave-lengths of the lines to be 0.323 tenth
metres.
   The doubleness of the yellow line of the cleveite gas led
directly to a closer observation of the chromospheric line by
Huggins*, Lockyer, and Professor Hale of Chicagot. Each
of these       observers has found that the solar helium line is also
double. Mr. T. Thorp of Whitefield, the inventor of several
valuable spectroscopic appliances to the telescope, has also,
by means of a Rowland grating of 14,438 lines to the inch,
and a fourth-order spectrum, divided D3.         Through the
kindness of Mr. Thorp,  I have been able to confirm the obser
vations which have, up to the present time, been made on the
doubleness of the yellow line of solar helium.
   Not only is the doubleness of the chromospheric line
established, but             its
                      components are       unequal width, and the
                                                            of

                    is                             the spectrum           of                     as
in  the  gas from cleveite.     Prof. Hale has determined the

 be 0.357.   Moreover, Lockyer has observed that five other
prominent lines        the new gas coincide with the chromo
                              of

          Natural Classification of Elementary Substances.                                              469
4472 of helium become visible.     As the heat and pressure
increase, the lines of hydrogen and helium widen out, till at
a pressure of 15 to 26 inches the helium and sodium lines
are nearly of equal width and appear as single lines in the
spectrum.
   This experiment shows that, within certain limits, the dis
tance between the components of Ds is not to be taken as
the criterion of the identity of chromospheric and terrestrial
helium.
   As solar temperatures are much too high for the formation
of  chemical compounds, the coincidence of the characteristic
lines of chromospheric and terrestrial helium clearly estab
lishes the elementary nature of the gas or gases producing
these lines.      Lockyer has indicated in several papers" that
the new   gas  obtained from uraninite by his distillation method
is a  mixture,   and that some of the spectral lines common to
the chromospheric and terrestrial gas may belong to two or
more elementary substances.             Profs. Runge and Paschen
have made further       progress   in this direction by showing that
the gas from cleveite, after being diffused through asbestos,
gives two different spectra and            consequently,          is,
                                                               mixture                   a              f.
One       of
           these   gases,   from       more    rapid   its

sidered        to   be
                 less dense than the other.        From       comparison             a
of  these spectra, the German physicists further conclude that
the denser        the two gases, producing Da,
                    of                                   helium proper,        is

between the spectra of the odd and even series, taken hori
zontally, that the spectra of members of the third series shift
in the same relation to the second as the spectra of Li, Na,
K,   Rb, Cs, i.e. to the less refrangible side of the spectrum
with increasing atomic weights. The same inversions of dis
placement are also observable in the spectra of the odd and
even members of the vertical series Hn, H2n, H3n as are
found in the horizontal series; the spectra of the heavy
elements, like Cu, Ag; Zn, Cd, shifting to the more refran
gible side of the spectrum in relation to the alkaline and
alkaline-earth metals on each side of them.
    The spectra of members of the highest series of elements,
 both vertically and horizontally, shift, on the whole, towards
 the less refrangible side of the spectrum with increase of
 atomic weights, like the spectra of the alkaline metals.
    Mendeléeff and others have pointed out the greater re
 semblance of chemical and other properties which odd or
 even series of elements have to each other than to the imme
 diately adjoining series.     Hence the spectra of Ga, In, Tl,
 in the third series, have a greater resemblance to the spectra
 of their homologues of position, K, Rh, Cs, in the first series,
 than they have to their homologues Ca, Sr, Ba, in the second
 (even) series. The chemical and other properties of hydro
 gen and the two constituents of reputed helium (H., H2, H3)
 may therefore be expected to stand in the same order to each
 other as their homologues of position in the first, second, and
 third vertical series of elements, Hn, H2n, H3n.
    Profs. Runge and Paschen, in their endeavour to bring
 the two new gases into a classification in accordance with the
 requirements of Mendeléeff’s so-called periodic law, have
 placed them in the first series between hydrogen and lithium,
 notwithstanding that they, at the same time, show that the
 spectra of these gases shift in the opposite direction to the
 spectra of the alkalies Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs.
    The German physicists can hardly have realized the con
 sequences to Mendeléeff's system by placing the two gases
 between hydrogen and lithium.         In the paper which       I
                                                             read
 before the Society in December last I gave a demonstration
                               º:
 of the confusion that would be brought into the so-called
 periodic system by the discovery of a new element a in the
 particular series where these               propose to place the
 new   gases".    There is   absolutely  no place in Mendeléeff's
 system for elements with atomic weights between lithium
 and hydrogen, as the Russian chemist never contemplated
 the existence of elements with properties and cosmical rela
tions such as the new gases have been found to possess.

  XLII.        Self-recorded Breaks in the Properties of Solutions.

WHEN
                investigating the properties of solutions           was                           I
  desirous          of obtaining some method by which the more
or less sudden changes of curvature noticed when these pro
 perties are plotted against strength might be made to register
 themselves automatically.         Other work has prevented me
 from   following   up  this  subject;   but the method which was
 obtained seemed to be so satisfactory, that, although it may not
be applicable in               all
                          cases,    brief note a     some preliminary    of

 changes    more easily discernible.    To ascertain the strength
 at which any change in the upper                   has occurred, it
 is  only  necessary  to take the   reading  of the lower curve for
 the same time.      The temperature-readings form five lines
 which within experimental error are absolutely straight, and
 owing to the well-marked angles at which these lines meet,
  and to the large number of experimental points on them (as
  many as 55 in one case), there can be no doubt as to their
  real nature.    Of the four changes which this figure exhibits
  two are incontestably breaks :     §  is the point at which the
  stream of acid was started, and D that at which it was
  stopped ; yet these are no better marked than those at B
  ...] C, which, therefore, must equally be admitted to be
  breaks.
     Looking at the changes near A and D it will be seen that
  these occur about one minute after the stream of acid was
  started and stopped respectively; this represents the time
  taken by the acid to get mixed with the water, and the lag of
  the thermometer behind the temperature of the liquid.
     The break at C was not so well marked as it might have
  been had the experiment been continued for a longer time.
   Another experiment illustrated in fig. 2 shows it better.
   Here, however, the stream of acid being faster, there were
   not sufficient observations with the weakest liquid to show

       lines inthis figure are straight lines also, except the portion

   Although these determinations were only of a preliminary
character, and the bottle from which the acid was supplied
was graduated but roughly, yet the breaks shown by the
results are in perfect agreement with those indicated by my
former work.     Fig. 1 shows breaks at 0.08 and 0.38 per cent.
of acid  (allowing  for the one-minute lag of the thermometer),
and fig. 2 places the latter at 0:33 per cent., mean 0-355:
whereas my heat of dissolution determinations gave breaks at
0-1 and 0.4 per cent. (loc. cit, p. 127), and the most probable

obtained on the principle there established that in (Mal); the
atoms have the values Li 2-4, Na 3-5, K 4-6, Cl2:1, Br 2:7,

the  guess  that as for the types NaCl and   MgCl,  the ratio is
8:5, and for the type Na2SO, it is 4.4, so for the type MgSO,
it is 2:2, we should not involve ourselves in an error greater
than the experimental ones, but the final decision of the point
must rest with special experiments.     It is obvious that we
can hardly draw any reliable inferences from experiments on
the surface-tension of dilute solutions of compounds of the
type ZnSO, unless they are of a very high degree of accuracy,
because c being small and pºº small, the value of ap”—a, p.”
 is small.
  When we come to treat of solutions of organic compounds
we have to separate them into two classes, the exceptional and
the normal.   Traube's experiments (Ber. d. deutsch. Chem.
Ges. xvii.; Ann. der Chem. cclxv.) show that mixtures of water
 with   the alcohols and fatty acids are exceptional,                   the most
 pronouncedly exceptional case being that of water and amyl
 alcohol, for 2.5 per cent. of amyl alcohol in water reduces the
 surface-tension to 2:8, that for the pure alcohol being 2:4 and
 for water 7-3. The probable cause for the exceptional be
 haviour of these mixtures is a difference of composition in the
 surface-layers from that in the body of the liquid.     Certain
 other solutions of organic compounds appear to behave nor
 mally as regards surface-tension, and for them Traube's data
 (Journ. f. prak. Chem. cxxxix.) are given in the following
 table.   The values of (M.A.)" have not been directly deter
 mined for any of these substances, but they can be estimated
 according to the values given for the different atoms and
 radicals on pp. 4 and 7 of “Further Studies,” although on
 account of the exceptional nature of the alcohols and fatty
 acids it has not been possible hitherto to get a satisfactory
 value for the characteristic OH group, but if provisionally we
 take    1:3   as
              the increase     (Mºl.)", when

near one, of needle and turn, this integral will be made up of two
parts of opposite sign, the change of sign occurring at the
point where 6–90°, i. e. where the field is tangent to the
needle. Denoting as positive the total moment from the centre
to that point, the value of the integral will have the positive
sign when this part numerically preponderates, the negative
sign when the moment due to the field beyond that point is
the greater.    The balance will depend on the diameter and
distance of the turn relative to the needle-length. For a turn
in immediate proximity to the needle, it is obvious that the
moment will be nil when a is somewhat less than half-way
from o to n, i.e., when the turn-diameter is somewhat less
than l, half the needle-length.        Rough experimental trial
confirms this deduction.     The further removed the turn is
from the needle, the less becomes the negative part of the
integral relative to the positive part.     Hence the bounding
surface for null effect would have a diminishing vertical
diameter, and the volume would presumably be not far from
that of a sphere of diameter 21, as above stated.
   In deciding whether it would effect any sensible gain to
wind this space and connect it in reverse order, it may be
noted that a shell of a thickness of nearly half the radius of
the sphere extending from the null surface inward would
have almost no effect one way or the other.       Moreover, some
space immediately about the needle must unavoidably be left
vacant.    The remaining space would thus be so small that
the gain would be almost insignificant. The answer is thus
clearly in the negative.
   The null bounding surface deduced by Professor Ayrton
and others was the locus of the turns whose diameter and
distance from the needle were such that the field of each was
tangent to the needle at the poles, as it would be for the turn
an as with the needle at the position n’s'.         The deflecting
moment at this   position  is not      nil
                                      but decidedly   positive.

   2. I prepared my gratings by first coating a flat wooden
block with tinfoil and then cutting
on it a number of fine parallel slits                                                            H
with a sharp knife (see the annexed
figure).
     and B are binding screws

which are fixed in the block and
facilitate the connexion of the grat
ing with a Wheatstone bridge.

were as follows:—

the margins come in contact with one another and thus cause
a diminution of the total resistance of the grating. Especially
the fact that the spacing of the strips should have so large an
influence as to reduce the effect almost to nothing seems to
me to favour the above supposition.      Also the fact that the
change of resistance depends upon the orientation of the strips
seems to point in the same direction.    Still another fact which
is  equally important   from the above point of view is that
the resistance of the tinfoil grating once diminished by an
exposure to the action of electric waves can be restored nearly
to the original value by tapping the grating.         It may be
pointed out that Prof. Minchin's experiment * on the action
of electromagnetic radiation on films containing metallie
powders may stand in close connexion with the present
subject.

             By Prof. John      PERRY and Mr. H. F. Hu NTf.
     TUDENTS        at the Finsbury Technical College have for
       some   years  carried out the Fourier development idea of
the late Professor Clifford by practical Geometrical methods.
The curve which graphically represents the function is sup
posed to be wrapped round a circular cylinder, and the areas
of    its
        projections upon two diametral planes enable the coeffi
cients      to    be
               found.               In

idea of a curve being wrapped round a cylinder.
   To develop any arbitrary function of a (let us call it y) in
normal forms, the real difficulty consists in finding the value
of   an integral such as

    restrict themselves to charges of one sign, there are many

    phenomena which prove that even in this state the atoms of
    the different elements behave differently with respect to
              and negative charges.   v. Helmholtz explained this
      ehaviour of the elements by supposing that there is a specific

                                               charge; that the zinc
    atom, for example, attracts     positive charge more powerfully

valent to a couple tending to diminish the moment of
momentum of the fluid in the tube, and thus to diminish the
pull exerted by the tube on the atom. Thus                            before,            if,   as

        We                of these lines of flow in the neighbour
                  see that some
  hood of the column are closed curves ; now the liquid inside
  any one of these curves will always remain in the neighbour
  hood of the column, and if the column is moved will move
  with it : thus the effective mass of the column will be that of
  the column plus that of the liquid enclosed by the largest of
  the closed lines of flow. The linear dimensions of the curve
 are proportional to m/u, where u is the velocity of the fluid
 at an infinite distance from the column, and m the strength
 of the vortex ; (the equation to the bounding line of flow is
                                               _uw
 easily seen to be               r=              m), thus the area enclosed by the line
                                        **
 of flow, and consequently the                           mass     of fluid inside             a   cylinder of
 which it is the cross section, is proportional to m”/u”; thus, as
 the effective mass is increased by this mass of fluid, the expres
 sion for the effective mass of the vortex column will contain
 a term proportional to the square of the vorticity.          Hence,
 if we  regard  a Faraday   tube as a bundle of vortex    filaments,
 we can by this analogy see that     effective inertia might         its
 involve term proportional
                  a          the square     the polarization.

conducting circuits, able to connect atom with atom, were
present, the circumstances would be much more favourable to
the formation of hydrochloric acid.       For if the conducting
circuit stretched from a positive hydrogen atom to a negative
chlorine one, these atoms would retain their charges; whereas
when the circuits stretched from a negatively electrified
hydrogen atom to a positively electrified chlorine one, the
atoms would interchange their charges. Thus the effect of
these conducting circuits would be to cause all the hydrogen
atoms to be positively electrified, and        the chlorine ones               all

These experiments showed that when        mixture         and       a                  of   H              Cl
was combining     did not possess any conductivity, thus proving
                              it
that     in
         these cases                    no
                         charged atoms were set free during
the combination.     Some other cases of chemical combination
gave the same result;                        on

 whilst chemical combination was going on. The experiments
thus proved that          many cases
                                   in                      of

enters into chemical combination an atom                chlorine must be of

that       onthe electrified zinc atom. Thus,               this case the     in
charge would leak from the metal into the gas and the latter

the six quantities, so that they can be determined.       To calcu
late  C, however,   we should require to know the distance between
the plates of the condenser, that is the distance between the
              and negatively charged zinc atoms.         We do not
 tnow this distance, but if we had a series of measurements of
V we should by the preceding equations be able to calculate
ms, and hence the capacity of the condenser, and from this
capacity the distance between the two layers.
    The preceding expression gives the potential difference
between the zinc and the electrolyte on the supposition that
these are not connected by an external conducting circuit; the
presence of such a circuit might, however, so modify the con
ditions as to render the preceding considerations quite         in
applicable.     Thus, take the preceding case of zinc immersed
in dilute HCl, if the solution is exceedingly dilute, we have
on the surface of the zinc a number of positive hydrogen
atoms.      If the Volta effect could come into play there would
be a diminution in the potential energy of the whole system,
if the –zinc and the + H interchanged their charges: in
the absence of the external circuit this on our hypothesis is
impossible, but it would take place if such a circuit were
present.      In this case the negative charges on the zinc
atoms would be replaced by positive, the potential of the zinc
instead of being lower than that of the electrolyte would be
higher. This illustrates the principle that the two causes
which tend to produce potential differences between sub
stances in contact, viz. direct chemical combination and the
interchange of charges on the atoms, tend to establish potential
differences of opposite sign.      Chemical combination tends to
make the      electropositive substance negative to the electro
negative one, since the positive atoms combine while the
negative ones are left, while the interchange of charges tends
to make the electropositive substance positive to the electro
negative.      Thus, when two substances are placed in contact
 under varying physical conditions, the sign of the potential
 difference will depend upon the relative intensity of these
two effects.     Observation seems to prove that a difference in

          Atom and the Charge                     of Electricity carried                  by   it.        535
the   sign      the contact potential difference between two sub
                 of
stances does take place when the circumstances are altered                                                 in
such way that we might expect great changes
       a                                                           the relative          in
importance            of
                     these effects          occur.     Thus there are cases
                                                      to
where, when the substances are cold, when we should expect
the chemical action                   sluggish, the electropositive sub

           is

 when chemical action              presumably more vigorous, the sign
                                      is
 of the potential difference              reversed. Thus, for example,

  that, if the transition from A to B, instead of being abrupt,
  takes place through a thin layer (whose thickness need
  only be commensurable with molecular distance) whose
 properties are intermediate between A and B, the potential
 energy due to surface-tension will be diminished.                  This dimi
  nution in the potential energy will produce a tendency for
 such a transitional layer to be formed, even though the
  formation of the layer is accompanied by a double layer
  of electrification.    The energy rendered available by a sen
 sible diminution in the surface-tension will be more than
pº
 sufficient to charge the double layer of electrification up to a
              difference amounting to a large fraction of a volt.
    or if the distance between the electrified layers is 10
 centim., and their potential difference 1 volt, the energy per
 unit area of the condenser formed by the double layer will be
 equal to 10", St x 10-5 x 9 x 10", or about 44 ergs. If the
 surface-tension were the same as that of water, the energy due
 to it would be 78 ergs per square centimetre, so that if any
 sensible diminution in this, took place, the energy rendered
 available would suffice to charge up the layer to a potential
 difference comparable with a volt.             Even if the formation of
 this layer required as a preliminary chemical decomposition to
 liberate the charged atoms forming the layer, and this decom
 position required a supply of energy, there would still be
 plenty available for this purpose. The thickness of the layer
 is comparable with the range of molecular forces; thus the

gas are negatively electrified, they may combine with positive
atoms of the metal to form a neutral compound, leaving an
excess of the atoms of the metal negatively electrified.     Or,
if the atoms of the gas are positively electrified, then, if any
substance is present which can form conducting chains be
tween the atoms of the gas and those of the metal, the atoms
will interchange their charges, the positive charge going to
the electropositive substance and the negative to the electro
negative.     Those atoms of the gas which were positively
charged might unite with those negatively charged to form
molecules, so that the gas itself would emerge electrically
neutral after contact with the metal.
   It will be seen that each of these methods requires some
thing more than mere contact of the gas and metal, this seems
borne out by the phenomena exhibited by electrified gases.
It was shown by Giese that electrified gases from a flame
could pass through wire gauze connected with the earth, and
yet retain their charges: this fact is exemplified in a very
striking way by Lord Kelvin's electric strainers, as he finds
that electrified gases still retain an appreciable fraction of their
charges after passing through these strainers which consist of
 many layers of wire gauze placed one behind the other. In
an experiment I described in the B. A. Report for 1894
 (“The Connexion between Chemical Combination and the Dis
charge of Electricity through Gases”), an electrified gas re

            charge though enclosed                              large pool

Thus the potential gradient will vary inversely as the pres
sure of the gas, and the ratio of the pressure at the positive
electrode to that at the negative will depend upon the square
of the reciprocal of the pressure.

place in sporadic lines diverging from the Wash and the Fens.             He
appeals to the amount of disintegration that has taken place to furnish
the material for the Clay, the shape of the stones in the Clay, and the
distribution of the Clay itself, as evidence against the action of land
ice or icebergs, maintaining that there is no evidence of submergence
at the time the Clay was formed ; and criticizes the attempts made
to explain the formation of the Clay by water produced by the
melting of ice.

    2. ‘The “Schistes Lustrés” of Mont Jovet (Savoy).           By  J. W.
Gregory, D.Sc., F.G.S.
    The author gives a history of the controversy as to the age of the
‘schistes lustrés” of the Western Alps, making special reference to
the views of Zaccagna and Bertrand concerning the schists of Mont
Jovet. Of these writers, the former maintains that the rocks of the
summit of the mountain are old rocks on which the Carboniferous
and Triassic strata were deposited unconformably; while, according
to the latter author, the rocks forming the top of the mountain were
laid down after those which flank it.
    In the present paper the author gives the results of an examina
tion of the rocks of Mont Jovet recently made by him.        He contends
that Lory and Zaccagna were correct in identifying the central rocks
of Mont Jovet as ‘schistes lustrés,’ for this conclusion is supported
by their lithological characters and the occurrence of basic igneous
rocks of the ‘pietre-verdi’ type associated with them, and is not
opposed to their stratigraphical relations.     It is further maintained,
as the result of the evidence collected by the author, that the schists
in question are older than the Trias; for fragments of the schists
occur in the Trias, there is a discordance of strike between the two
series, masses of dolomite rest unconformably upon the flanks of the
schists, and the Trias has escaped metamorphism which the schists
have undergone.         The probabilities are in favour of the schists
occupying the same relation to the Carboniferous as they do to the
Trias; while the      close approximation   of the schists to the former
shows that the schists are not the altered representatives of the
 neighbouring Carboniferous beds, and it is therefore concluded that
 the ‘schistes lustrés' are pre-Carboniferous, but evidence by which
 finally to assign them to any exact horizon before this date is still
 wanting.

          oN THE WAVE-LENGTH OF THE Da HELIUM LINE.
                      BY A. DEFOREST PALMER, JR.
     WING      to the recent increased interest in the wave-length of
        the helium lines due to the discovery of terrestrial helium,      I
 have been led to calculate some observations on the D, chromo
 sphere line carried out by myself at the Physical Laboratory of the
 Johns Hopkins University during February and March 1893.
    The measurements were made on the large fixed telescope
 spectrometer, used by Dr. Louis Bell” in his determination of the
 absolute wave-length of the D solar lines, with a plane speculum
 metal grating having about fourteen thousand lines to the inch and
 5 inches of grating-space.        The telescopes of this instrument
 are 16:4 centim. clear aperture and about 2.5 metres focal length;
 and with the grating used      I obtained good dispersion and excellent
 definition in the first spectrum to the right of the normal to the
