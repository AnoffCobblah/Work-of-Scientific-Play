 I.  Description    of a new Eudiometer, invented by H. Davy,
    Esq., S. R. S., for (he Combustion of Oxygen and Hy
    drogen   Gases.      By R.  Knight, Esq.
                            To  Mr. Tilloch.
     SIR,
 J. he enclosed drawing (Plate I.) represents a eudiometer
we lately made on the suggestion of Mr. Davy, for the
more commodious display of the formation of water, by the
combustion of the two gases, oxygen and hydrogen, by
means of the electric spark.
    The instrument consists of a strong cylindrical glass tube
A, to receive the gases ; open at the lower end, of the capa
city of two cubic inches*, and graduated into decimal parts ;
and a stand to     which   the tube is attached, by a clasp    B, and
screw S. The stand is composed of the clasp and           screw B, S,
and an iron cylinder      C, containing   a strong spiral spring, on
the principle   of    the pocket steelyard, the spindle or central
bar  of which      is fixed on the three feet     D, in order  that  it
may be secured firmly on the side of a mercurial bath, with
the mouth of the tube immerged in the quicksilver.
    By this arrangement, the sudden and violent expansion
which   takes place at the moment        of the combustion of the
gases is relieved by the elasticity     of  the spring, which, by
yielding,   allows the glass tube to be heaved up a little way,
                                                *
without being driven from its situation.          The  success  of the
experiment is       thus  secured, and   all danger   of accident to
the apparatus    is effectually prevented.

  when his taste for clock- and watch-work first showed itself.
  His hours of recreation were constantly employed in finish
  ing some pieces of mechanism, and in reading with avidity
  all books relating to that subject and natural philosophy.
  About the age of thirteen, he constructed some small pieces
  of clock-work        ; and   rinding the day not sufficiently long for
  him,    he sat up during the         night, to study how he might im
  prove their motions.
      With so remarkable          a desire   to increase his knowledge in
  this art, which his parents lost no opportunity of improving
'
  and applying to the best advantage, it was impossible for him
  not to make       a very    rapid progress. At the age of 17, he
  went to Paris, and was admitted in 1/13 into the company
  of watch-makers of that city.
      His merit -having introduced him to the acquaintance and
  esteem     of the most distinguished men             of his time,      he very
  shortly became celebrated for the excellence of his work?

  has since been improved and applied    with such  success by our English  artists.

almost incredible       :  so much so,      that he very soon left all
his masters far behind him.
    It   is well   known that        the  English, on account of their
numerous discoveries in this art, had enjoyed such a repu
tation for the excellence of their clocks and watches, that
they universally found a market in preference to any others
in all parts of the known world ; and that the French them
selves     were    obliged to purchase theirs in England. Julien
Le Roy had the honour of removing part of this pre-emi
nence, and of transferring it to the French artists. We
must refer to the account itself given of him for the various
means which he employed to effect this, as they would be
superfluous here ; and it will be sufficient to mention in a
few words the principal discoveries which he made : — His
repeating clocks and watches : his improved seconds and
horizontal clocks : his universal compass card with a sight ;
 an extremely useful and simple contrivance for drawing a
 meridian line, and          finding   the declination  of  the needle  :
 his clocks and watches of three parts, and his new universal
 horizontal dial.         It is to him also that watch-makers are
 indebted for the method of compensating for the effects
 of    heat   and   cold in the balances of chronometers,         by the
 unequal expansion of different metak;                a discovery of the
 greatest      importance, which has been           brought by our En
 glish    artists to a state of perfection hardly credible, although
 it had been condemned and thrown aside by the inventor's
 son,     M. Pierre Le Roy.         See vol.  xxvi. p. 200, of  the Phil.
 Magazine.
     Such a number         of things     so happily invented,  and  exe
  cuted, procured him the reputation of the first artist in his
  profession.       The celebrated Graham once paid him the fol
  lowing compliment before several persons, when a repeater
  of Le Roy's was shown him by lord Hamilton. After having
  examined it for some time, he said, " I could wish I were
  younger, that I might work from this model."                    Which
  justice done to his merit by the first watch-maker in Europe
   at that time, was afterwards universally rendered him by all
   artists  who had arrived to any degree of excellence in the art.

6                          Life of M. Le Roy.
   The general eagerness to obtain watches of his invention
soon became so great, that the watch-makers of Geneva en
graved his name, instead of those of Tompion and Graham,
on the common watches made at that place*.
    It was not among foreigners only that he enjoyed so flat
tering   a  consideration.       In his own country         he was  distin
guished as he merited. He obtained in 1739 apartments in
the galleries of the Louvre, and the title of clock- and watch
maker to the king.            Cardinal Fleury, when he sent him
this title, told him that his majesty, pleased with his services,
might hereafter add to this favour by granting him a pen
sion.     Our artist, however, thought that a sovereign, like
the father of a family, could not settle one of his children
above the level of the rest, without altering in some degree
the patrimony of the others ; and therefore, that the wishes
of an honest man and a true patriot ought to be satisfied
when he has obtained some mark              of esteem    and benevolence
from his sovereign.
   " If this    celebrated   artist,"  adds his son,       "  has enriched
clock- and watch-work          so much by his discoveries and work
manship,      his generous conduct to those who, under his
direction,    cultivated this art, has not less contributed to its
perfection.       I  appeal to all those who were acquainted          with
him,    to prove the truth     of this assertion. Never      was any man
more accessible, more communicative,                 or more prodigal of
his knowledge.          Has he not taken as much pains to place
his work before the eyes of the gentlemen of the art, as the
English took at first to hide theirs ? What artist is igno
rant of the trouble which he gave himself to expose new in
ventions, when they were as rarely known as they are now
common ? Who does not know that he sacrificed a part of
his fortune     ?   that he did not confine himself merely to the
encouraging        of them   by his example, but that he even added
   •  I met with the following aneedote lately in a French work :
   Voltaire called one day on Pierre he Roy the son, and the conversation
 happened to turn upon the father's improvements in watch- and clock-work.

recompenses, as far as his circumstances would permit? After
a life so spent, can we be astonished at the concourse of
workmen who followed his funeral ? Can we be surprised,
at their expressing with sorrow, that they had lost their sup
porter   !   their friend   !   their father ?"
   After having considered the good qualities for which
Julien Le Roy was so much admired and cherished as an
artist by all who were intimate with him, let us turn to a
few traits in his life, from which we may judge of those that
distinguished him as a man and a member of society.       He
had been very intimate with Henry Sully ; and the pleasure
which these two celebrated men found in discoursing together
of their art, so far from exciting envy, had formed between
them the bond of the closest and most sincere friendship.                                  t
When       watch -manufactories of Versailles and St. Ger
             the
main were broken up, Sully tried to persuade his friend to
accept a pension from            the    English ambassador,               and to go
            London : but it was to no purpose; he never
and reside in
would consent to expatriate himself, and carry his discoveries
and knowledge out of his native country. When Sully died,
which    happened     in October        1 728,   Julien Le Roy was          pressed
to solicit the     pension from the              king, which Sully          had re
ceived  but he constantly refused
         ;
                                                   it,
                                   because madame Sully
had requested the king to continue     to her. The same  it
zeal engaged        undertake every thing that could do
                   him   to
honour to the memory of his departed friend and      to              ;      it   is
him we are indebted for the little that                    is known of Sully's
life.    Notwithstanding his continual                     occupations, Le Roy
undertook the reprinting one of his works,                      and      enriched     it
with every thing that could recommend it.                           He might     have
intermixed    his own subjects with Sully's but he chose        ;
rather to brine: forward his name and writing's after those of
his deceased friend, and to print    part of his Memoirs at

   different Nations; with         some     Hints, which     the   Writer
   thinks   would    tend    greatly      to -the Advantage of every
   Country.     By Mr. James            Graham,      of Berwick-upon-
   Tweed*.
Commerce        has long heen the distinguishing           characteristic
of this coilhtry: it    is the great source      of our national wealth
as well as individual     riches.    It  is commerce that rouses and
calls forth the adventurous spirit of our merchants and the
persevering industry of our manufacturers.                 To carry the
various produce of our country to the remotest part of the
earth gives employment to our sailors, whose valour and
intrepidity are the admiration of Europe, and give to Britain
that preeminence amongst the nations which she now pos
sesses. — If such are the great advantages derived from com
merce to this country, it surely ought to he the study of
every individual,     as far as his abilities, situation, and cir
cumstances in life will admit, to be acquainted with its na
ture, and to trace its various connections.

trade, or the beginning of commercial intercourse with dif

likely    means   of bringing commerce to       its highest   degree   of
perfection, is the design of this essay.
     If we  take a survey   of this earth,   even those places where
nature seems to haVe been most bountiful, and to have
poured out her whole luxuriance, even there we shall find
some wants, some articles or produce, which, if obtained,
would add either to the ease or comfort            of the inhabitants.
If we cast     our eyes on the more northerly climates, where the
 sterility of the soil is rendered more barren, from the small
 degree of that solar warmth which gives life to the whole cre
 ation, yet even there we find a superfluity of some articles
 extremely necessary to the inhabitants of more favoured si
 tuations. Such indeed is the diversified nature of the earth we
 inhabit,    that there is no country,     however highly it may be
 favoured, which can produce all that is necessary for the
 comfort, health, protection, and security of its inhabitants.
     From these causes commerce is certainly nearly coeval
 with man : and if men had duly observed these immutable
  laws of their Creator, and regulated their conduct accord
  ingly, all intercourse would         have  been so reciprocal,     that
  both national and      individual interest,   as  well  as social hap
  piness, would long have continued to bless the w#rld. — But
 jealousy, envy, and ambition, the most dangerous passions
  of   the human breast, soon made man lose sight of his true
  interest. When kings, governors or rulers, by whatever name
   they are called, once turned their attention to raising a re
  venue, whether for the support of their own kingdom, or to
  gratify their own ambition,        and increase   their greatness,   the
  idea   of taxing  the produce   of neighbouring     states seems very
   soon to have engrossed that attention. To a weak short
   sighted politician the idea is no doubt flattering : he vainly
   thinks he-shall raise a revenue and increase the resources of
   his own people by taxing his neighbours, not recollecting
   how soon and how easily all will be retaliated. Whoever may
   have had but small opportunities of observing the intercourse
   of different nations,   and comparing the commercial laws and
   regulations by which they are governed, will easily see with
   what exactness they endeavour to counteract each other.                I
   could illustrate this in   a variety  of instances, but it would
                                                                   .  lead

  lead me to too great a length for what I intend, viz.— only
  a short essay.    Let one observation suffice : Compare the
  duty on wine in this country with the duty on English
 malt liquor in some others. The people in foreign countries
 are as much astonished to hear the low price at whicli our
 ale and porter can be made, as we are to hear the price at
 which   the cultivator  of the  grape can sell his wine. One can
 scarcely be prevented     from thinking that it is surely a mis
 taken, not to say a     cruel, policy, which thus prevents thi
 great bulk of the people from enjoying those bounties of
 Providence which the earth sends forth in such abundance.
 If   my memory is to be trusted, it is to this commercial
jealousy we owe most of the wars which for more than a
 century past have tormented mankind, and destroyed mil
 lions of the human race : and, what yet is a more melan
 choly reflection, this daemon of discord seems only to be in
 creasing in strength and plotting fresh inroads on the hap
 piness of mankind.       I will, however, beg leave to observe,
 that the idea    of universal empire, encouraged by successive
 victories, and of commanding the trade of the world into one
 emporium, however flattering to the conquering hero ox
 adventurous merchant, both alike are destructive to the gene
 ral happiness of mankind : and I. am persuaded, that as soon
will the immutable laws of the universe be changed, — the
 different climates of this earth send forth the same produc
 tions, — as either will be realized.  A small recollection of his
tory will fully convince us, that ambition had no sooner
 supposed thai her wishes were to be gratified, than the
mighty fabric has tumbled in pieces, and brought the vain
 projector to   a premature death, or to linger out a few years
covered    with shame, disgrace, and remorse. Such, I am
 persuaded, will be the natural         consequence of all over
 strained ambitious speculations.      I make no doubt but many
 *will recollect several instances  of some persons in this coun
try, of large fortunes, extensive credit, and wide-spread con
nections; who, not satisfied with all these, but prompted by
ambition,     wished to bring all under their grasp ; and in the
pride of their hearts have declared, My warehouses, or my
granaries, shall be the general depot of such or such an

from every quarter. How few, very few, of such have succeed
ed, but brought ruin on themselves, and misery on all their
connections           !    I   am apt to       think, that what          is the case            of in
dividuals          will in      a   certain degree be the case with                         nations.
I am persuaded that God, in pity to mankind,                                      has set some
bounds to ambition which it cannot pass.
      I   must here            beg leave to make one observation,                            to pre
vent my being misunderstood ; and that           not my in             is,   It   is
tention to argue in the smallest degree against duties                                          :   it   is
likewise           highly    expedient to tax some articles more than
others; —          it
                   is     only the extreme to which many duties are car
ried that         I   would          combat,    together with that ambitious
monopolizing spirit,                     whether in an individual or nation,            a
which wishes to counteract        very laws of nature, by
                                                      the

of its inhabitants into the vortex of their own power. -                                              I

 great        a   length. Suffice   to observe, that smuggling and

    illicit   trade are carried to            a    greater extent in almost every ar

    temptation   and of all the evils which can afflict

shrink with disgust, if not with horror, from the perusal :—*
and, as if all were not enough, oaths are introduced as an ad
ditional barrier.     A recourse to them is most alarming to
every serious mind ; it is sapping the very pillars of virtue,
and with gigantic strides rendering the mind indifferent,
if not callous, to the most serious and the most useful of all
appeals  —I     mean the solemnity of an oath.
   The closest politician may please himself with framing
additional laws and more severe restraints, but all will be
found ineffectual while the present system is pursued : the
more timid or conscientious will be restrained, and all their
exertions of industry paralysed,; but the daring and adven
turous will spring up in every direction. This, however, with
some other particulars to prove and illustrate the proposition      I
have here laid down, may be the subject of another essay,
if this should be thought worth the attention of the Society.
I will at present only mention one instance, which must be
in the recollection and knowledge of many — I mean thesmal^
amount of the revenue on tea before the reduction of the duty
took place    :  and yet,  to secure the revenue,   every law and
regulation which human         ingenuity   could contrive were put
into practice.
   It now only remains for me to say what is the line of con
duct, or plan, which a wise statesman and true patriot ought
to pursue. A thorough knowledge of his country is certainly
the first and most essential      requisite; to be well acquainted
with all  its more natural productions ; and to bring these to
the highest possible perfection, his constant aim and study.
I do not mean to say that any check should be given to the
experimental agriculturist, — quite the reverse, — but only that
the principal concern of the government should be to give
the greatest encouragement to the productions which, by
observing the laws of nature, there is reason to believe can
be brought       to the highest degree of perfection. The next
and most essential,     I conceive to be, To study the genius of
the people; carefully to observe their natural disposition ; to
note their turn of mind and principal propensity, with all the
anxious concern with which a wise parent would watch and
study the rising dispositions, the natural talents and various
                                                       inclinations

inclinations of his children, and put them to such profes
sions as there is good reason to think they would most excel
in. I am fully persuaded that it is as impossible for the in
habitants of any country to excel in the manufactory of
every article, as it would be by any degree of cultivation to
cause the earth in any one country to produce or bring
forth the various productions of other climates. To inquire
 into the cause of this is not the design of the present essay ;
 I only    mean to state facts.      The gin in Holland, the brandy
 in France,       the rum in the    West Indies, occur to my mind,
 at present,     as  in point.   Notwithstanding the great capital
 pf the English distillers, their- persevering industry and
 diligence,       aided by every chemical knowledge and im
 provement, — how different are our productions from those
 mentioned       1   Yet in France, Holland,       and   the  West In
 dies,   these,    operations   are   often carried on by mere      no
 vices (if I may so speak) in            the profession.    I will now
 contrast English malt liquor wiih what is made any where
 in Europe.         I believe it will be generally found that our
 ale and porter as far exceed those of all other countries, as
 the brandies in France and the gin           in Holland excel ours.
 I   would likewise mention our excelling in almost every arti
 cle in the manufacturing of iron : I might contrast some of
 what may be called the loom manufactory. I am well aware
 that in many of these we either excel or have arrived at a
 great degree of perfection : still in many others we fall far
  ghort.     I have, however, at present only mentioned those
  which    I  think    are almost    generally known and       acknow
  ledged.
      From    a review   of the whole, it appears to me self-evident,
  that the true interest and real riches of every country consist
  in having     a  reciprocal intercourse with each other ; to have
  no prohibitory duties, nor any so high as to create too great
  a temptation to illicit trade. By these means the whole re
  venue or duty could be easily collected, and with less than
  half  the present number       of officers. Traders and merchants
   would then be mueh          more upon an equal fooling in regard
   to  excise     regulations; the more timid and conscientious
                                                                  would

 14              Analysis      of the  lately discovered
would rejoice under the protection of the law, and the more
daring and adventurous would feel little temptation to trans
gress its boundaries.     The   present code   of excise laws,  at which
the most resolute shrink back with disgust, and which cause
 the more serious to heave a sigh at the inroads they are mak
ing on religion     and morality,      would assume all the mildness
of the jurisprudence of the English constitution. The wise po
litician would feel no anxiety at the prosperity of any neigh
bouring state : the more they cultivated the natural production
of their soil or climate, and the higher degree of perfection
to which they brought some branches of manufactory,— on
the more easy terms could His people be supplied ; and as they
increased in riches, so much the more would be the demand
for  the natural productions        of his country,    as well as for al!
the articles of manufactory in which his people might ex
cel. Pursuing this plan, every nation would see its true
greatness   and   real   riches so connected with that of others,
that it could not hurt another without the greatest injury
to itself.   Jealousy and envy would find no place in the
human heart;       trade would be found only in its        infancy; its
extension,    I am persuaded,       would be far more than we are
apt to conceive ; and          peace    might   continue   to bless the
world.
    But I must   here suppress my feelings, as my design is only
to use fair reasonings, and to draw just conclusions.

IV. Analysis of        the   lately   discovered   Mineral Waters at
    Cheltenham    ; and    also  of  other Medicinal Springs in its
    Neighbourhood.       By Frederick Accum,                M.R.I.A.
    Operative Chemist, lecturer on Practical Chemistry and
    on Mineralogy and Pharmacy           , &c.
Uf all the      mineral    waters    which    have  acquired celebrity
within our own times, the springs of Cheltenham holi a
most distinguished rank.            Their fame is the more solid,
and their character      will  be the more permanent and flourish
                                                                    ing,

                     Mineral Waicrs       at Cheltenham.              is
ing,    as   they owe their reputation less to the caprice of
fashion, patronage, or popular opinion, than to their own
intrinsic properties.
     Here at first the afflicted     resorted in search of health. They
found the goddess propitious to their prayers ; they returned
again to pay their vows, and brought beauty and elegance
in their train.          The lately discovered mineral springs of
Cheltenham belong to those few fountains of health met
 with in Great Britain, which have not been discovered by
 accident     :   our knowledge respecting them being the result
 of  actual     labour, undertaken with a view to remedy the pre
 vailing scarcity of the waters of other springs, which have
 long given celebrity to the town of Cheltenham, and which
 scarcity is said to have prevented many invalids from visiting
 that place.        These complaints no longer exist. The exer
 tions of several         individuate    have  completely remedied   this
 evil ; — to     Dr. Jameson,     a resident  physician of Cheltenham,
 is due the       honour of having discovered, in the year 1804, a
  saline spring near that town ; and to the spirited exertions
 and indefatigable enterprises of Henry Thompson, esq., of
 Tottenham, the public will for ever remain highly indebted
  for the discovery of the mineral springs which form the
  chief subject of this       paper ; and who has also spared no ex
  pense    and     labour    to  improve the natural beauties of the
  place, so as to render the accommodations of these wells
  worthy of the company who visit them from all quarters.
"lt   is under the direction         of this gentleman, likewise, that
  baths,    both cold and         warm, have been erected in a style
  guperior to those usually met with, which do signal honour
  to the town of Cheltenham.
      Before I proceed to state the result of the analyses of the
   waters   I   was called upon to undertake at the fountain        head,
   I beg leave to remark, that I do not mean to exhibit invi
   dious comparisons, nor do I contend for superior medicinal
   properties which they may be found to possess, when com
   pared with other springs of a similar nature, which have
   long   gained     a distinguished place in the catalogue of medi
   cated   waters, and the efficacy of which long experience
   has permanently fixed and sufficiently established. Unbiassed
                                                                        as

16                 Analysis of I fie lately            discovered
as I stand, a humble labourer in the field of chemical
science, it is merely my wish to furnish a clear idea of the
nature and composition of those fountains of health, so as to
present    truth insimple form, and to establish it upon le
                       a
gitimate foundations ; in order to enable the medical prac
titioner to select in a judicious manner the springs so
bountifully given to the spot by the hand of Nature, and to
apply them with advantage in the routine of his profession.
Should the following pages, therefore, prove useful, by col
lecting under one point of view the leading features of these
springs, my view will be amply fulfilled, and I shall flatter
myself with having contributed to the improver.ient of the
science of medicine, as well as to the progress   chemical                 c.,'

                  I.    Situation of the Spring.
  The spring known                   by   this name   is   situated    in    a    dry ver
dant and gently-rising field, called Montpcllier Ground,
600 feet from the centre of the town. The site of this spring

that of skimmed milk.                                                 0,

                   Mineral Waters at Cfiellenham.                  17
appears   to be one     of  those   choice and suitable spots that
are said to be particularly      favourable to the curative effects
of medicinal waters. The dryness and gradual elevation of
the land around this spot as it recedes from the town, the
uncommon fertility of the soil, with its multifarious produc
tions and romantic scenery which are equalled by few in
the kingdom, present a picture dear            to the   man of taste
as well as to the invalid.
   The upper stratum of        the soil to   a  considerable distance
from the well is      a sharp fine sand, and the heaviest rains
that fall   here   seldom prevent the exercises of walking or
riding for    any length   of time after they have ceased ; a cir-
cumstan e certainly not unworthy of regard in a place fre
quented y valetudinarians of leisure and opulence.
   The n dd and genial breezes which constantly prevail
here,   an  1  which are doubtless owing to the disturbed equili
brium    oi the air passing through the funnel-shaped and
craggy openings of the opposite bills, cause the atmesphere
of this spot to be considered equally salubrious with, and not
unlike, that which prevails in the south of France. It is the
totality of these circumstances that has induced several per
sons of distinction to fix their residence in this neighbour
hood; ana hence Cambray, which was known not four years
ago as a mere pleasure meadow,           is now covered   with villas
and houses, that in point       of taste and elegance   may vie with
any modern buildings whatever.
   The country round these springs consists of fields of every
shape, mostly open and uninclosed, here and there inter
spersed   with gardens, orchards, and cottages. It produces
plenty of wood, both for timber and fuel.                And as the
Cheltenham waters professedly sharpen the appetite, it may
perhaps be pleasant for visitors to know, that the rearing of
poultry of all kinds is carried on with particular assiduity
and success, and that the town is supplied with all kinds of
provisions of excellent quality, and on much more moderate
terms than in some places of resort, less fashionable, for
 pleasure and health.
    The geological constitution       of this part of Cheltenham
is alluvial lar \, composed on one side        of the town of a tena-

 cious blue clay, which, as it deepens, passes into a foliated
 argillaceous marl ; on the other a stratum- of sand prevails.
     In the former the spoils of organized beings of the ocean
 arc found in great abundance,            and in a high state     of preser
 vation.    And although         the   remains of these animals have
 strikingly changed their       state   of existence, their      shape    and
 structure are so well preserved, that the species to which many
 of them originally belonged may still be pointed out among
 the living inhabitants of the sea; whilst others again, which
 have long disappeared,        (or are perhaps removed beyond the
 sight of men, by inhabiting the greatest depths of the ocean,)
 have thus their memory preserved in those archives, where
 Nature has recorded the revolutions of our globe.                     Inter
 mingled    with   the  wrecks       of   these  creatures,   are  here   and
 there found the trunks,          branches, and roots        of trees,   with
 layers of reed, and timber of every kind, wholly converted
 into clay, and easily separable from their beds.
    These awful memorials clearlv announce that this spot was
 once deeply submersed under the waters of the ocean, or
 that it formed perhaps part of the bottom of the sea ; for
 wherever we dig into the ground, marine shells which are
 known    to belong to shores under climates extremely remote
 from each other, are found promiscuouslv mingled together.
 The mineralogical constitution of the Coteswold Hills,
 which take their rise within half           a mile from this well, and
 which they surround like         a brow, give ample proofs of this
 suggestion.   The  beds  of  these    hills, which are all of secondary
 formation, furnish abundance of lime-stone, often wholly
 composed of gryphites, entrochites, nautilites, ostracites, be-
 lemnites, &c. The rest of the strata of these eminences, the
 highest of which does not exceed 500 feet, (where the spec
 tator should pause to contemplate the surrounding country,)
 are composed of secondary lime-stone resting on red sand
 stone, free-stone, and grit. In the northern horn, red clay
 slate  and  foliated chlorite       slate  abound.      The speculative
 geologist will find many of             these   and   other    individuals
 worthy   of research.
    The country      around the town of Cheltenham is known
 to be uncommonly       prolific    in natural     beauties.     In  the vi
                                                                       cinity

 cinity of   the town, which stands on the north side of a high
 ridze of hills in the vale of Gloucester, are many handsome
 and pleasantly situated villages, picturesque landscapes, and
 solitary richly variegated hills, which render Cheltenham an
 object of attraction, even to those who cannot be biassed by
 native partiality.
    Nothing can be affirmed with certainty in regard to the
 derivation of the name of this town.             According to some,
 it is from   a brook which rises in the parish of Dowdeswell,
 and takes its course on the south side of the town.               It long
 flowed    "  unknown     to fame,"   but is supposed to have ori
 ginally been called the Chelt.        Others again find the origin
 of Cheltenham in the Saxon word Chill, which signifies an
 elevated place, and ham, denoting a farm or village.                  It is
situated   94f miles    W.N.W.      from London.        Its population,
according to the late survey taken by            order of parliament,
amounts to 2,639 inhabitants, which number is increased
during the summer           season by an almost equal number             of
 transient visitors.
    Cheltenham and its neighbourhood              (indeed Gloucester
shire in general) is said to be famous for the healthiness of
its inhabitants and the longevity they reach.               In the reigu
of James I., eight old men, all belonging to one manor in
that county,       whose ages added together made as many
centuries, danced a morrice-dance. That several neighbours
should reach the age of a hundred is nothing very wonderful
in several situations and countries, but that they should be
able to dance is certainly a singular circumstance.
    About two miles north of Cheltenham lies the delightful
village of Preslury, a place secluded hy orchards and trees
of every kind, so as to form a sylvan scene round almost
every house; and about April and May, when the fruit-
trees are in blossom, no situation in the neighbourhood can
afford a richer prospect than this.
    At  a distance of about three miles and       a half  is the famous
Seven     Wells Head, or the source of the Thames,                  which
being the highest point      of the most illustrious British streams,
will infallibly   attract  the notice  of every person     of  taste who
visits the neighbourhood.

 most elegantly and pleasantly situated villages in the king
 dom, sheltered by lofty and venerable trees.
    At  a  distance of ten miles stands Tewkesbury, where lies
 buried the ill-fated Edward              prince of Wales, son of
 Henry    VI.,    who was cruelly murdered a few days after the
 battle which decided the fortune of his house. Many other
 charming situations and remarkable places of this neigh
 bourhood might be pointed out, were this a topic on which
 we meant to treat ; but as it is not, we shall hasten to the
 subject more immediately under consideration.
        II. Physical Properties of the Water.
    The water of       the Chalybeate Strong Saline         Well, taken
 fresh from the pump,        has a   distinct saline taste with    a slight
 impression of bitter.        It is colourless, perfectly transparent^
 without smell, and possesses          a strong refractive power.        Its
 temperature was 53° at 29'5 barometrical pressure, the tem
 perature of the air being 65° Fahr. Its specific gravity was
 as 2-039 to 2-036.         On pouring     the   water at the fountain
head from one vessel into           another, and leaving it exposed
 to the air, it emits     a  multitude     of exceedingly minute air-
bubbles, which firmly adhere to the inner surface of the
 vessel. Exposed to the open atmosphere for eight days, it
suffered no material change.              This spring yields upwards
 of 800 gallons of water in         24 hours in every     season    of  the
year.
               III.  Examination          ry Re-agents.
    Experiment       I.— To    15  cubic inches      of distilled   water,
contained in      a glass vessel,   tincture    of  cabbage    was   added
sufficient to impart to it the slightest tint of blue that could
be distinguished when the vessel was placed between a sheet
of white paper       and the eye.
    Experiment      II. — A   like portion of the same tincture was
dropt   into   15  cubic  inches   of the saline water taken fresh
from the well, and contained in a similar vessel. On viewing
both glasses by reflected light against a sheet of white paper,
the latter appeared distinctly red, the former blue.

                      Mineral Waters    at Cheltenham.               21
       Experiment III. —The same experiment was repeated
  with saline water of the well that had been boiled, but no
  such effect took place.
       Experiment IV. — One cubic inch of concentrated sul
  phuric acid, mingled with six cubic inches of the saline
'
  water, occasioned        a copious disengagement of air-bubbles,
  and a slight      turbidness  ensued.
       Experiment V. — To 130 cubic inches of the water intro
  duced into      a  tubulated retort, the neck of which terminated
   under    a wine-glass filled with strontia water, and standing
   inverted in the same fluid, were added 36 cubic inches of
   sulphuric acid. A disengagement of air-bubbles took place,
   which rendered the strontia water turbid.           The cloudiness
   disappeared      by the admixture    of muriatic acid.
       Experiment      VI. —Six   cubic inches of fresh prepared lime-
   water, mingled at       the fountain   head with ten of the saline
   water, formed a cloudy mixture, which again was rendered
   transparent by a few drops of nitric acid.
        Experiment VII. — Papers slightly stained with carmine,
    with   an  infusion of rhubarb,    and  with turmeric,  suffered  no
    change when immersed in the water of this well.
        Experiment VIII. — Two grains of crystallized hydrate of
    strontia, dropt into three cubic inches of the saline water,
    produced an abundant precipitate,          both in the water taken
    fresh from the well, and in such          as   had been  previously
    concentrated by boiling;        Muriatic acid did not redissolve
    the precipitate.
        Experiment IX. — Concentrated nitric acid, and muriatic
    acid, did not produce a change when added either to the
     fresh or to the boiled water.
        Experiment X. — Two grains of oxalic acid, dissolved in
     one cubic inch of water, either fresh, or concentrated by
     boiling, occasioned a considerable turbidness : the same
     effect took place, when five grains     of oxalic acid  were added
     to three cubic inches of water previously mingled with two
     grains   of potash.
         Experiment     XI. — Fluate of soda   and oxalate  of ammonia
      produced a copious precipitate, both in the fresh water and
      such as had been concentrated by evaporation.

 52                 Analysis of the lately   discovered
    Experiment        XII. — One   cubic inch of   a solution of fresh
 prepared green sulphate of iron,           obtained (according to
 Davy) by boiling sulphuret of iron in dilute sulphuric acid,
 when added to 12 cubic inches of water kept in a corked
 phial,   exhibited the following properties :
    1. In 6 hours the mixture acquired an opal colour.
    2.  In  12, it was sensibly turbid.
    3. In 24,     a  coloured precipitate ensued.
    4.  In  36,,  it  became again transparent, having deposited
 a yellowish brown precipitate.
    Experiment XIII.-^20O grains of fresh prepared white
 prussiate of iron, (not dried, but still wet,) on being diffused
through 20 cubic inches of water at the fountain head, ac
quired    a blue colour after having been kept in a closed phial
for    24   hours.      Water that had been previously boiled,
changed the colour of the white prussiate very slightly.
    Experiment XIV. — Silver leaf, gold leaf, and copper leaf,
did not lose their lustre on being immersed in the water.
   Experiment XV. — Two grains of nitrate of silver, dissolved
in five cubic inches of the water, either fresh from the pump
or concentrated by boiling, produced a copious white pre
cipitate, which retained its colour in the dark : the same
effect took place      with water previously mingled with a few
drops    of nitric acid.
   Experiment XVI. —Two grains of sulphate of silver oc
casioned a dense cloud in two cubic inches of fresh, or in a
like quantity of boiled water: nitric acid did not restore its
transparency.
   Experiment        XVII. — Five   cubic inches of liquid ammonia,
added to 15      of water highly concentrated by boiling, effected
much     turbidness    after suffering the mixture to stand for 24
hours.
   Experiment XVIJI. — Seven grains of muriate of barytes
dropt into six cubic inches of the saline water, produced an
abundant precipitate, which was insoluble in muriatic acid :
the same      effect   ensued   when   nitric or muriatic    acid had
been previously added to the water.
   Experiment XIX. — Ten drops of acetate of barytes ren
dered two cubic inches of the saline water turbjd.

     Experiment      XX. —The     water which had been acted on
  by acetate of barytes in the preceding process, after having
  been filtered, became strongly milky on letting fall into it a
 few drops of acetate of silver : the precipitate was soluble n\
 liquid ammonia.
     Experiment      XXI. — Acetate    and nitrate of lead, added in
 the proportion     of one grain  to the   cubic inch   of the  saline
 water, occasioned      a white cloud.
    Experiment XXII. — Five grains of phosphate of soda pro
 duced no change in two cubic inches of water highly con
 centrated ; but an abundant precipitate ensued when one cubic
 inch of   a neutral solution of carbonate of ammonia was added.        •
    Experiment XXIII. — One cubic inch of fresh prepared so
 lution of hydro-sulphuret of strontia, agitated with ten of
 water highly      concentrated,   instantly occasioned much pre
 cipitate.
    Experiment XXIV. — Twelve grains of crystallized acetate
 of lime effected no change in four cubic inches of saline
 water.      If the same quantity    of nitrate of lime    was added
 to three cubic inches of the water concentrated by boiling,
 a copious white powder fell down.
    Experiment XXV. — Five cubic inches of alcohol, min
gled with ten of strongly concentrated saline water, occasion
ed an abundant crystalline precipitate.
    Experiment XXVI.-»Four grains of arseniate of potash,
dissolved in four cubic inches of the water, produced no
change after having been suffered to stand 24 hours.
    Experiment XXVII. — Five grains of crystallized potash
rendered three cubic inches of the water turbid ; a floccu-
lent precipitate floaied on the surface, after suffering          the
mixture to stand, undisturbed for six hours.
    Experiment XXVIII. —Tincture of galls, either prepared
with or without alcohol, produced no sensible change, whe
ther in the fresh or boiled water ; but if to one cubic inch of
water, concentrated       by  evaporation, three grains of oxy-
muriate of potash and six of nitrous acid were added, tine-            ,
ture of galls and succinate of soda then produced a dark-
coloured precipitate.

84                  Analysis of ike lately                discovered
prussiate of lime produced any change when added to the
water ; but when a few grains of nitrous acid and oxy-mu-
riate of potash were previously dissolved in     blue preci        it,   a
pitate was then obtained.
     From       preliminary observations we are led to be
            these
lieve, that this water contains carbonic acid, oxygen gas,
salts with  base of lime, salts with
             a                       base of magnesia, with
                                                       a
oxide of iron, with sulphuric acid, with muriatic acid, &c.
     Examination           op   the Gaseous Contents of the
                                     Water.
   924 cubic inches of the saline water, fresh taken from
the spring, were introduced into   retort connected with
                                                       a
the mercurial trough. The water was made to boil, and the
gaseous     products collected over mercury.         After the appara
tus had again acquired the           temperature which prevailed at the
commencement of the operation,                       it   was found, by the addi
tion of barytic water, that 48-28 cubic inches of carbonic
acid gas had been disengaged, of which 12-7, therefore, are
contained in one gallon of water.     The residuary gaseous
fluids,   on being examined                by       the test   of phosphorus and
by          of hydrosulphuret of lime, were found
     the action                                                                      to be
composed of 4-84 parts of atmospheric air and 16, 12                                 parts
of oxygen gas.    Hence the gaseous contents                             of   one gallon
of the saline water are          :

                                  ANALYSIS.
     Experiment     I.  — 924 cubic inches of the saline water being
evaporated     in   retort to eight cubic inches, were re
                    a   glass
duced to dryness in glass bason at
                            a         temperature of 224°  a
Fahr. The mass was of      brilliant white colour;

strongly     saline and         bitter.     Its weight amounted                 to   2296
                                                                                 grains,

                    Mineral Waters at Cheltenham.                          25
grains, which, divided by four, gives 574 grains                     of solid
 matter for every gallon of the water*.
     Experiment       II. — This  product, being levigated with alco
 hol, was digested in that fluid in the cold for six days. The
 solution was decanted, fresh portions of alcohol were added,
 and the operation repeated successively.                The insoluble    re
 sidue was laid aside for further examination.
     Experiment III. —The alcoholic solutions being mingleG
 with a small quantity of water, were rendered turbid by
 acetate of ammonia and sulphate of silver; phosphate of
 soda employed (according to Wollaston) in combination
 with carbonate of ammonia, produced much cloudiness.
     Experiment IV. — The mass which was not soluble in
 alcohol (Experiment II.) was digested in eight times its
 own weight of distilled water, suffered to boil, and filtered.
     Experiment V. —The insoluble residue of the preceding
 process was boiled in 60 times its quantity of water; but
  as no complete solution could be effected, it was filtered,
  and the insoluble part collected.
     Experiment VI. —'This insoluble              powder, which resisted
 .the  action    of boiling   water,  being dried, was covered with
  muriatic acid, which speedily effected a solution. The fluid
  was decomposable by gallic acid, and by                 succinate   of am
  monia it was evaporated to dryness ; over the dry mass,
  nitrous acid was abstracted repeatedly, and lastly the whole
  was re-dissolved in muriatic acid.
      Experiment VII. — The obtained muriatic solution, being
'concentrated to the consistence of oil, was mingled with
  liquid ammonia until it ceased to produce a precipitate.
  The oxide of iron thus obtained weighed 19 grains, which
  indicated /• 15 carbonate of iron in each gallon of the
  water.
    ExperimentVlll. — The alcoholic solution (Experiment II.)
  being suffered to stand exposed to the air in an open vessel
   for six days, was covered with a multitude of crystals ; it
  was evaporated till no more salt appeared, and then suffered
     * If the same  bulk of water was evaporated in   a glazed bason of Wedge*
  wood-ware,    the product was seven per cent. less.
                                                                             to

 to cool.     The crystallized               muriate    of    soda weighed seven
 grains.
   Experiment IX. —The fluid from which this salt had been
 removed, being concentrated, was covered with sulphuric
 acid    and evaporated      to dryness.            The      glass     bason with its
contents was lastly heated un'il the colour of litmus paper,
employed for covering             it,
                           remained unaltered.
      Experiment       X. — The solid residue, being triturated,                        was
transferred into aFlorence flask, and digested in four times its
quantity of water, and the insoluble part collected on the filter.
      Experiment       XI. —The
                         saline liquid which passed the                                 fil
ter having been highly concentrated        evaporation, was  by
mixed, boiling hot, with      solution of sub-carbonate of
                                        a
potash until no further precipitate fell down.
   Experiment XII. —The carbonate of magnesia produced
being dissolved in muriatic acid, and the solution evaporated
to dryness, yielded 160 grains of muriate of magnesia   40                          :
grains of muriate of magnesia had therefore been contained
in one gallon of the water.
  Experiment XII I.-— The insoluble part left   Experiment X.     in
was boiled with six times its quantity of sub-carbonate
of potash, which rendered      soluble in nitric acid
                                        it              the ni             :
tric solution was decomposed      sub carbonate
                                              by  of  ammonia,
and the produced precipitate converted into muriate of lime
in direct manner.
  a                      yielded 144 grains of muriate of
                             It
lime, which gives 36 grains of muriate of lime to each gaK
Ion   of water.
   Experiment.     XIV. —To      render the nature and presence of
the substances         so far detected as certain as possible, an
alcoholic solution equal to that operated on was evaporated
to dryness, covered with sulphuric acid, heated, and again
evaporated    to dryness.
   Experiment XV. —The dry mass being digested        water,               in
the fluid filtered and evaporated, yielded sulphate of mag
nesia. The remaining insoluble substance was dissolved in
boiling water,  and decomposed                     by
                                      nitrate of barytes    and                 ;
lastly, another portion of the substance extracted      alcohol           by
was digested     muriatic acid decomposed
                  in                            sub-carbonate   by
                                                                                        of

                 Mineral Waters at Cheltenham.                     27
ef potash,    and   the product heated to redness.         Thus the
presence of the obtained carbonate of iron, of muriate of
lime, and muriate of magnesia was established.
    Experiment XVI. —The aqueous              fluid left in Experi
ment IV. being concentrated, did not disturb the solution
of muriate of platina, nor was it       rendered   turbid by oxalate
of ammonia:       it was therefore mingled       with alcohol till no
more cloudiness ensued, evaporated till a strong pellicle ap
peared, and the crystalline mass dried.              The remaining
fluid was again evaporated and suffered to crystallize ; the
salt produced being muriate       of  soda,   could not be obtained
free from sulphuric acid ;     it was dissolved in water, together
with that portion obtained in Exper. VIII., and then de
composed by nitrate of silver.            The precipitate produced
taking 235 grains of muriate of silver to be equal to 100 of
muriate of soda, indicated 219"75 muriate of soda in each
gallon of the water.
    Experiment.     XVII. —The      fluid   being completely freed
from muriate of soda was highly concentrated, and mingled
whilst hot with a solution of sub.carbonate of potash ; a
copious precipitate fell down, which, being thoroughly ig
nited, indicated 93.25 sulphate of magnesia in each gallon
of water, taking 136.68 of magnesia to be equal to 100 of
sulphate of magnesia.
    Experiment     XVIII. — .The   fluid left in the preceding ex
periment was again evaporated, the sulphate of potash in
troduced separated, by causing the whole to crystallize into
a solid mass, heating it slowly, and decanting the liquid
 sulphate of soda by adding a few drops of water. On re
 peating this operation for several times successively, the
 sulphate of soda was obtained pure from the sulphate of
 potash  ; it amounted to 80.01 in the gallon of water.
    Experiment XIX. — The fluid left in Experiment V. was
 rendered   turbid by nitrate of barytes and oxalate of ammonia,
 which, together with its great insolubility, proved it to be
 sulphate of lime; it was decomposed by barytes water : the
solution (taking 100 parts of sulphate of barytes to be pro
duced by 71 of sulphate of lime) indicated 85.01 sulphate
of lime to be contained in each gallon of the water.
                                                                  The

 V. Essay       upon  Machines         in General.        By M. Carnot,
           Member     of the French Institute,           &c. &c.

                       Fourth Corollary.
 XXVI. 1 have          proved (XIX) that the indeterminate
 equation (F)     contains    all the laws of equilibrium and of
 movement in hard bodies : I now go further, and I say
 that this equation agrees equally with bodies which are not
 so, and consequently this general law extends indiscrimi
 nately to all bodies in nature.           In fact, when       several bodies,
 which    are not hard,     act upon each other, in any given
 manner,     if we conceive the movement that each particle
 would have taken,       if it   had been free,        as  decomposed into
 two, one of which is what it would have really taken, the
 other will be destroyed ; whence it evidently follows, that
 if  the bodies had been hard,           and had not      had    other move
                                                                           ments

ments than the latter, there would have been an equilibrium :
these destroyed movements are therefore subjected to the
same laws, have the same relations to each other, and, lastly,
may be determined in the same manner as if the bodies were
hard, i. e. by the general equation (F). This equation (F)
is not confined therefore to hard bodies, it also belongs to
all the bodies in nature, and consequently contains all the
laws of equilibrium and of movement, not only for the first,
but even for all the others, whatever may be their degree of
compressibility : but the difference consists in this             ;    that we
may, ,with respect to hard bodies, suppose u =            V;           in such
a   manner that   smVU     cosine   Z =   0 becomes one           of    the de
terminate equations of the problem, whereas this does not
take place when the bodies are of a different nature : it is
therefore this determinate equation, which is the same with
the first fundamentalequation (E), it         is,
                                           say, this deter
                                                I
minate equation which characterizes hard bodies, and con
sequently   itabsolutely necessary to employ
                 is                            at least im
                                                         it
plicitly in all questions concerning these bodies and with    ;
respect to any other kind of bodies, we must, besides the de
terminate equations, which We may obtain            by
                                               ascribing to                   u
in the indeterminate equation (F) different known values —
we must,   I say, also extract from   one which
                                         it         analogous
                                                          is
to the equation (E), and which expresses in some measure
the nature of these bodies, in the same way as the latter
                                                          (E)
expresses that of hard bodies. But as this inquiry has but                    a
very  indirect relation to machines properly so called, \vc
shall at present confine ourselves to examining the case
where the degree of elasticity  the same with respect to all
                                    is
bodies,     e. Let us suppose, that in virtue of elasticity
           i.
the bodies exercise upon each other, pressures       times as n
great as    the bodies were hard, n being the same for all
           if
the bodies of the system   let us next suppose that the pres
                            ;
sure and the  restitution are made in an indivisible instant,
although in strictness  that would be impossible.  This beinc
done   :
    The reciprocal  pressures    F becoming n            F,
                                                   will have
among   them  the same  relations as   the
                                         ifbodies were hard                  ;
therefore their results m U will not have changed their di~
                                                                      rections.

rections,but will merely have become n times as great aS
they would have been if the bodies had been hard : this
being done, since W is the result of V and U, we have V
cosine Z = W cosine Y — U: thus the equation (E), for
which   we are seeking one analogous,may be put under this
form.   s m   WU            cosine    Y — s m U*
                                      0.   Now, according
                                                      =•
to what has been said, we must, in order to apply this equa
tion to the case in question,               place   — in   place   of U, without
any change upon             Y:
                      therefore in the case we are examining
                      ...TIT U                    U1
                                                       Y
                  .                 .
the equation
      1      will be 5 m vv — cosine      — s.771    = 0 ; or                         .
                              n                 n 2
by multiplying          by    re1,    \V U cosine Y — s m U1 = 0 ;
                                     n sm
or on account of               W cosine Y = V cosine Z + U, we
shall have
                  — n
                            sm   VU     cosine      Z =    s m   U":   thus this
              1
equation will be, with respect to the bodies in question,
what the equation (E) is with respect to hard bodies ; and
even the latter is the particular case where we have n = I,
as is evident.
   When n =2, it is the case of bodies perfectly elastic, and
the equation becomes 2 s TO V U cosine Z + f m U1 = 0 ;
but this equation relative to bodies perfectly elastic may be
expressed in a known and more simple manner, as follows :
    W is the result of V and U, we have by trigonometry
Since
W1 = V» + U1 + 2 VU cosine Z ; and therefore s m W1=
jmV1 + sm U1 + 2 swiVU cosine Z. Adding to this
equation 'that found above, and reducing, we" have s wzW1
= s m V1, which is precisely the principle of the preserva
tion of active forces, i. e. this preservation with respect      is,
to perfectly  elastic bodies, what the equation (E)                      is   with
respect to hard bodies, as we uudertqok to prove.

  XXVII.          I    shall     not dwell on    the particular conse
quences which      I        might   draw from  the  solution of the pre
ceding problem        ;     but shall merely remark, that the velocities
W, V, U,          being always in proportion to the three                     sides
                                                                                 of

                                  On Machines in General.                                SI
.of              trigonometry may furnish the means of
       a triangle,
giving a great number of different forms to the fundamental
equations (E) and (F) ; and I shall content myself with
indicating one of them, which is remarkable on account of
the method contrived by geometricians, of referring move
ments to three plans perpendicular to each other; which
gives          a great deal       of   elegance   and simplicity to the solutions.
   Let us imagine, therefore, at pleasure, three axes perpen
dicular to each other ; and let us conceive that the veloci
ties       W, V, U            and u, are each        of them decomposed into
three others parallel to these axes.                           This being done, let
us call
        Those which answer to W,                               w     W" W'".
                Those which answer to               V,         V     V"    V".
                Those which answer to               U,         U'    U"    U'".
                Those which answer to                u,         u\    u\   tf".
      Now           if   we pay a little attention, we shall easily see that the
first fundamental equation (E) may be placed under this form,
j m U' + s m V" U" + s m V" U'" = 0; and the second
           V
(F) under the latter smu-V + sm u" U" + sm ii" U'" = 0 ;
because in general                        quantity which is the product of
                                      every
two velocities               A    and B, by the cosines of the angle com
prehended between   them, is equal to the sum of three other
products A' B' + A" B" + A"' B" ; A' A" A", being the
estimated velocity A of these three axes, and B' B" B-" being
the estimated             velocity B in the ratio of these same axes                          :
i.    e.       A'    being the velocity A, and B' the velocitv B, esti
mated   parallel to the first of these axes ; A" and B'.the same
velocities A and B' estimated       parallel to. the second axis,
A"' and B"- the same velocities estimated parallel to the third
axis       :    this is easily proved by the elements of geometry.
      In       the case of equilibrium,   the first of these transformed
equations is reduced to 0 = 0; and the second, because in
this case W = U, becomes s m u'       + smu" W"        m  W                        -f-   s
u-"W"=0; which expresses all the conditions of the
equilibrium.
      When               the movement changes             by   insensible degrees,       we
have found                 (XXV.)         that the fundamental equations become
smV            pt        cosine   R   —   smV     a"V = 0, and       smupdt        cosine
                                                                           f   —   smuu

 r      —   smud (V cosine y) = o          ; therefore by decomposing p
 into        three      other forces parallel to the three axes, if these
 component forces are designated by p', p", p"', the preceding
 equations will become, the first, s m                   V
                                         p' d t + sm V" p" d (
 + 5 m V" p'" d t = s m       d          V V
                                     + s m V" d V" + s m V"
 d V'";           and  the second, smu'p'd t + s                   m u" p" d t +
s m u'" p'"          dt = smu' dV + smu" dV"                      + s m u'" d V":
 finally, in the case of equilibrium,                        the first will vanish,
 and the  second will be reduced to s m u' p' + s m u" p"                                +
s m u'" p'" = 0.
                      Second Remark.
        XXVIII.  Hitherto I have regarded wires, rods., levers, &c;
as      bodies making of themselves part of the system.        And
this hypothesis entirely conforms to nature; but one thing
indispensably necessary to observe                    is,
                                     that, strictly speaking,
there   probably no absolutely fixed point in the universe,
             is
no obstacle absolutely immoveable     the fulcrum of    ;lever                 a
        not so, because          supported upon the earth, which
is is
                               it   is
        not fixed itself; but the mass of which   almost infinitely
                                                                is
great   comparison of those the action and reaction of
              in
which upon each other we generally consider in machines                                  :
in order           to move the     hypomochlion of     lever, we must
                                                               a
also put in motion              the globe of the earth   and     so in
                                                                   ;      it   is
fact, however feeble be the powers which act upon the ma
chine * the quantity of movement which they produce upon
              :
it,   equal to the resistance of the hypomochlion
        is                                        but this                ;
finite quantity of movement distributing itself into     mass                  a
almost infinitely great, there results to this mass   velocity            a
almost infinitely small, and this  the reason why this move
                                                is
ment         is   not sensible, and may be neglected    practice.    in
        Hence      it follows, that what we call immoveable obstacles
in mechanies,               are nothing     else     than bodies the mass                of
which         is   so considerable,  consequently the velocity so
                                          and
small,        that their movement cannot be observed. We shall
therefore approach nearer nature,                  by   consideringtheobstacles,
   * M. Carnot docs not exhibit here his usual accuracy. If the power ap
plied to the lever belonged to any other system than that of the earth, the
earth would be moved; but in the case of the fact here assumed,         not    it   it
moved, even in an infinitely small degree, — Edit.
                                                                                         01

or fixed points, as moveable bodies, as well as all the others ;
but of a mass infinitely large, or, whit comes to the same
thing, as bodies of an infinite density, and whith do not
differ from all the other bodies of the system except in this
point.    Hence a considerable advantage will result, as we
shall be able to make             the   system        into which these bodies
enter, take anv given geometrical movements; for the instant
we suppose these obstacles moveable like all other bodies,
they      will become susceptible of assuming                   any movements,
and the       general    system    must be regarded             as an assemblage
of bodies perfectly moveable : consequently, the quantities
of movements absorbed by the obstacles may be estimated
as with respect to all the oiher parts of the system ; in such
a manner, that if we call R the resistance of anv given fixed
point, this quantity R will be in the equation (F), with re
spect to the point in question, what m U is with respect to
the body m : we shall therefore find           by this equation, this
same quantity          R like all the other forces m U, which could
noi be the case by considering the obstacles as absolutely im
moveable, without having recourse to some new mechanical
principle, which we must have made concur with the general
equation (F), in order to attain the complete solution of each
particular problem.   Thus this method of considering the
fixed points is not only the most conformable to                          nature,      as
we have said before, but also the simplest and the easiest.
     As   to the wires, rods, or any other portions               of   the system,
the    masses      of which       may be supposed               to 'be        infinitely
small,     we may neglect, i. e. suppose                 each    of their mole
cules m equal to zero, or, what comes to the same thing,
regard their density as infinitely small, or as nothing : our
equation (F) will therefore become independent of thrse
quantities, e. the same as
                 /'.                        if   we     had     abstracted          these
masses from the bodies; and                 it   is   thus that we shall easily
find the mathematical theory of each machine,                       i.   e.    by   mak
ing the abstractions spoken of (VIII.)
   XXIX. From this remark results, that although there
                                        in it
is only single kind of bodies
          a                       nature, we distinguish them
however, for the facility of calculations, into three different
classes, which are, 1st. Those which we consider as what

they really are, and as nature presents them to us, t. e.
which are of a finite density. 2d. Those to which we ascribe
a density infinitely great, and which, for this reason, must
be regarded as sensibly fixed           and   immoveable.        3d. Those
to    which    we   ascribe    a density     infinitely   small,    or null,
and which, consequently', by their inertness,                oppose no re
sistance to their       change of state. In practice we generally
regard    as  such,   wires,   rods, and generally all bodies which
do not influence sensiblv, by their proper mass, the changes
which happen in the svstcm            ;  but which are solely regarded
as means of communication                between the different agents
 which compose it.
                              Third Remark.
     XXX. After       having treated of equilibrium and of move
ment in general, as much as my principal object permitted,
 I shall pass to what regards more particularly what we com
 monly understand by machines ; for although the theory of
every kind of equilibrium and movement always enters into
 the preceding      principles, since there are only, according to
the first law, bodies which can destroy or modify the move
ment of other bodies ; nevertheless there are cases where
 we make abstraction of the mass of these bodies, merely
for the purpose of considering the effort they make : for ex
ample, when a man draws a body by a wire, or pushes it
by a rod, we do not introduce into the calculation the mass
of this man, nor even the effort of which he is capable, but
solely that which he exerts upon the point to which he ap
 plies it ; i. e. the tension of the wire, if it is by drawing that
it acts,   or the pressure, if it be by pushing ; and without
considering whether it be a man, an animal, a weight, a
spring, or a resistance occasioned by any obstacle, or by the
vis inertice of   a moveable body*, a friction, au impulse caused
                                                                             by
   * Any body which we force to change its state of repose, or of movement,
resists (XI.) the agent which produces the change; and it is this resistance
which we call vis inrrliee. In order to find the value of this force, we must
decompose the actual movement of the body into two, one of which is that
which it will have the instant afterwards ; for the other will be evidently
that which must be destroyed, ill order to force the body to change its state;
                                                                       i. f. the

by a current of air, or water, &c. We give in general the
name of power to the effort exerted by the agent, i. e. to
that pressure or tension by which it acts upon the body to
which it is applied; and we compare these different efforts
without regarding                       the agents which produce them, because
the nature of the   agents cannot change the forces which
they are obliged to exercise in order to fulfil the different
objects for which machines are destined : the machine itself,
«. e. the system of fixed points, obstacles,    rods, levers,
and other intermediate bodies, which nerve to transmit these
different efforts from one agent to another; the machine,
itself, I say, is considered as a body stripped of its inertness :
its proper mass (when it is necessary to have regard to                                                          it,

that different external agents,    the number of which we        in
comprehend   the mass of the machine, are applied, and trans
mit their reciprocal action                        by   the intermedium              of this machine.
It    is   the pressure or other effort exercised                              by   each agent upon
this intermediate body, which                                   we call force or power                  ;     and
the relation                which            exists between

forms the subject of the inquiry, which has for its object the
theory of machines properly so called.     Now,             this                              it   is   in
point of view that we proceed to treat of equilibrium and

  which,    excepting the want of proportion in his horizontal
  distances and some few mistakes, into which he was led by
 too great a dependence on his favourite theories, are by far
,the best views of the structure of the cmst of the earth
  which I have any where seen. The romantic valley in which
  Matlock baths are situated, was one which Mr. White-
  hurst examined ; and he has given a section crossing the
  same at the     High Tor,      a stupendous rock, rising almost
  perpendicularly from the river Derwent, which hurries along
  at its foot.     Mr. W,., as will be seen by the copy of his
 «ection   in the upper part of the drawing which accompanies
  this (Plate II.) considered the strata under the Derwent
  in this place to have been broken, and those on the west
 side as sunk down      ;  thereby  occasioning that great difference
  in the height of the rock, on the east and west sides of the
  river, which strikes every beholder with astonishment.               On
  extending my examination of the strata of Derbyshire into
  this neighbourhood, I saw abundant reasons for concluding,
  that the rocks facing Matlock High Tor are not materially
 disturbed from their original position, (except that the dip of
  the whole is much greater than formerly,) by the violent
 action from above, which has torn up, and completely car
  ried away, the superficial strata, and denudated all the strata
 now to be seen in this part of Derbyshire, and part of Staf
  fordshire adjoining, a fact which did not escape the sagacity
  of Mr. Whi'tehurst — (page 193 and others of his Inquiry)—
  had   he but hit on     a. cause more    adequate    than the one he
  mentions,    for the removal and       disappearance     of such    vast
  masses    of matter,     as  are here   wanting, to complete the
  known order and      arrangement      of the British strata ; which
  1  hope in due time to be able to show to         be as    regular and
 certain, in this dislocated and broken country, as in any
 other part of England.
      Messrs. John and George       Nultall, land-surveyors of this
 place, to whose extensive and minute acquaintance with the
 soils and circumstances of the county I have been much
 indebted, having furnished me with the exact horizontal di
 stances    across  this extraordinary      valley, in   a  straight line
                                    C 3                             from

from the     small clump of firs on Riber Hill, (situated about
200 yards N.VV. from the hamlet of that name,) to the
clump of firs on Masson Low, at the edge of the parish of
Borsal, I have been at some pains to ascertain the extent
and  position of the strata in this line, which fortunately
passes just over the High Tor, and is sufficiently near to the
line which Mr. Whitehurst describes across the Tor, to
admit of        a   fair comparison therewith.                     My section, in               the
lower     part       of
                   drawing (Plate II.) will show, that the
                          the
strata preserve an exatt parallelism, in rising from under
Riber Hill to form Masson [fill ; a:;d that the latter would
have been of a height unequalled by any hill in this part of
the country,          but for the denudation which                       it has suffered.
The lime-stone   shale seeming to form the point of separa
tion between the carboniferous strata and those which soma
have denominated primitive,                     1   have made this my point                          of
comparison, for naming the principal Derbyshire strata, and
have denominated the lime-stones and toad-stones, the first,
second, third,            &c,    in order below this           ;   and the grit-stones
and     coal-shales        the    first, second, third,                &c,        above       it,    in
the order in          which they occur.    The extent of the present
section    is       not sufficient towards the east, for showing the
first coal-shale,

     Although I differ from Mr. Whitehurst as to the fissure
under the face of the High Tor, and as to valleys being ge
nerally so broken ; yet I doubt not but this county furnishes
numerous instances of valleys so broken, in places where
the plane     of   the strata takes a new direction or dip,         as Mr.
 W.    supposed them to do on each side of the Tor (H) in his
 section. — The front of the High Tor is in the range of the
 Seven    rakes    Mine    ;  and almost the whole       of the perpendi
 cular rocks therein are covered with spar, and other matters
 peculiar to the skirts of veins, or are of the nature of riders,
 which    I  find, not to consist of fragments of the adjoin
 ing rocks,      as most authors have described them to be, but
 confusedly crystallized masses, occupying and filling the
 cavities left between the skirtings of spar and ore, which
 the sides     of  the    vein had in the wider parts thereof pre
 viously     received.        A large portion of all the lime-stone
 cliffs which        I  have      examined    in  this county,    seem   to
 owe their        origin     to  rake-veins   running parallel to their
 faces,    and    to have       had  their perpendicular facades pre
  served to the present time, by the facing of vein-stuff and
  rider, with which they are coated.
      Allow me, sir,         the liberty here to notice the opinions of
  Mr.    Hume, on the identity of silex and oxygen, which I
  have read in the 20th and 30th volumes of your useful
  work,    for the purpose of mentioning, that however far his
  doctrines may be repugnant to those, which chemists are at
  present disposed       to treat as orthodox,     yet that such must,     I
  think,    have to prepare themselves for still greater innova
  tions, on their lists of supposed elementary substances, when
  the operations of Nature in her grand laboratory, wherein
  the strata    of the earth were formed,         and were, by their mu
  tual action, reduced to their present state, come to be more
   closely and minutely examined.
      The transmutation either of lime into silex, or silex into
   lime, can, I think, be doubted by no one, who will atten
   tively examine and           consider the    surface, of either   of the

                                   rocks
    which compose the lime-stone soils of this county.    Mr.
    Hume (vol. xxx. page 273 and 276) would contend    for the
    last of these changes ; but I conceive the evidence here to
    be strongly in favour of a change of the lime-stone into
    rotten-stone, chert, and other siliceous substances, and even
    into vegetable mould containing a large portion of silex ;
.   for here      fragments of lime-stone, the fourth in parti
                      the
    cular, assume that blunted nodular shape, when exposed
    on the surface (often surrounded by a coating of rotten-
    stone), which               Mr. Hume            (page 276)           considers     as evidence
    of   "     loss in the primitive                mass."           The lower        beds    of   the

    /beautiful     assemblage            of entrochi which they contain, when
    exposed  on the surface by the oblique fracture of the strata

    near to Salter's             Way in this parish,   among the      are found
    vegetable soil converted into masses of chert, with the shells
    also changed to that substance : how much more probable
    is   it,   that              blocks on the surface are changed
                        these chert
    from        lime, than that the whole mass of lime-stone (in
    which        state          these    entrochi        beds        are   alw.ivs,    I     believe,

           VII.    On Malting.         By    John Carr, Esq.*
                              Theory   of Malting.
 J. he    interior of a barley grain consists of two distinct parts,
a  minute germ, destined to elongate into the future plant,
and a portion of farinaceous and mucilaginous matter, stored
up expressly tor its future conversion into saccharine, as the
pabu'um of the germ in the earliest stage of its vegetative
existence.
    The germ itself consists of two               very different parts, the
 plumula (acrospire          in  malting)   and  the  radicle or root: both
 are united at the same end of the grain, but in germinating,
 the radicle very soon pierces the husk, and separating into
 several fibres elongates         downwards,       while the acrospire, but
 much more slowly,             advances   through the body of the grain,
 and piercing the opposite end, soon shoots up into a green
 blade, leaving the husk of the corn empty, and perfectly
 exhausted      of  its former contents.
     The radicle         is much more rapid in its formation and
 growth     than    the    acrospire, because, as it is destined to pre
  pare and transmk to the stem nearly all its pabula, it is ne
  cessary that it should be sufficiently matirred            to perform this
  office by the time the acrospire- has consumed the store
  which provident Nature had laid up for it in the grain.
      There is no difficulty in comprehending the first dawnings
  of   vegetative      life in the germination of barley ; the grain
  placed under favourable circumstancesof moisture and warmth
  imbibes both, and swells much ; the radicle, lying nearest
  to the    exterior, is the most susceptible of these, it swells

 most and first, and under its new combination                           of moisture
 acquires an attraction for the oxygen of the atmosphere.
. The oxygen,    as it becomes   fixed, produces two powerful
 effects, it gives up that portion of latent heat which held it
 in   a gaseous    state,    and    by    its fixation         enters    into a new
 combination with the farina of the grain, converting it into
 an oxide, or in other words into a saccharine.
      The   stem part of the germ, previously swelled by the
moisture,     and now invigorated by the heat produced from
 the fixation of the oxygen, acquires an attraction for the
 newly-formed saccharine, assimilates it to itself, and in the
 chemical action of union                which       ensues,     vegetative      life is
developed.
    Such simply is the natural process of germination in every
 species of seed, though here restricted to barley ; and it is
 important to remark,             that the heat arising from the fixation
of    the oxygen is the same             which       first becomes        sensible in
 the couch,       and afterwards continues to show itself in diffe
 rent degrees amongst the corn on the working-floors, and
 in the nice adjustment and due regulation of this heat con
 sists the most important part of the manipulations of malting.
      The formation of        the saccharine in the grain is slow and
progressive as the acrospire requires        and hence    it,
                                                         may                    it
easily be conceived that between its first formation and final
 consumption,        there    must be       a    period    of time when               the
 largest proportion abounds in the grain, and this                               is   the
 proper time for throwing the corn upon the kiln.
    Mr. Reynoldson, in his evidence, states that the saccha
 rine previously exists in the barley, and that the process of
 malting only develops       substance which was already pre
                                   a
 sent   in the grain   ;    but this, like several other                of his philo
 sophical assertions,      so contrary to the natural fact, as ob
                             is
 viously to refute itself.   The chemical and natural characters
 of malt differ     so essentially from          those    of barley        as   clearly
 to prove that there                 mere development of
                             has been not        a                                         a
 thing present, but an entire change  of the original substance
 into another.
                     Practice    Malting, of
      Malting then     is    nothing      more than the promotion                     of   a
                                                                                healthy

healthy germination of the barley up to that period when
the largest proportion of saccharine has been formed ; nor
can any thi"g he more obvious than that in a variety of
motles to accompli.sh this, one must be superior to all the rest,
and that not locally, but every where, because nature is
every where     the same.     In  every natural process, a varying
of the  means will necessarily produce a difference in the end;
and iu the two modes       of malting, by watering on      the floors,
or omitting   to do so, there is so      material  a difference, not
merely in the use or disuse of the water, but in the time,
management, and other circumstances, that the one cannot
but be superior to the other in the quality        of its respective
commodity.
    A single instance, I believe, cannot be produced of any
natural process whatsoever, wherein Nature permits the em
ployment     of two different means        to produce precisely the
same end.      The application of this     to the question   of mall-
ing will, I humbly presume,         be sufficiently obvious,   by  se
parately considering the different branches of the case.
                             The Radicle.
    This is by much the most        important organ in malting:
without   a root the grain will never germinate, and with too
much, the substance of the com will be exhausted, and the
malt on that account will       be light and unproductive.        This
 has hitherto, I believe, either not been sufficiently known
 or attended to ; — in this, as in every other natural process,
 Nature herself affords    the best explanation.
    On the richest and     best lands the roots of barley are short,
 and the plant large and strong ; but on loose and poor soils
 the roots are long, and the stem small and weak.               In the
 one case the root, having readily found what it was in search
 of, stops ; but in the other, Nature is compelled to expend
 much of the pabulum on the more ignoble part of her pro
 duction.    On    the  floor of   a malt-house the grain is worse
 situated than on the loosest       and  poorest land ; for it con
 tains no aoil at all, and    if permitted, the root there would
 run out to some       inches in length, and almost wholly ex
                                                                 haust

haust the substance of the corn.    To prevent this is one of
the principal objects in the manufacture of malt) and hence
too a just criterion is afforded for estimating the merit of
different methods of working                           ;    for that method which will
accomplish the            full malting of                  the barley with the least pos
 sible root is so far unequivocally the best, because such
 malt will have expended the least portion of itself on an ob
ject entirely unproductive.    Now there is perhaps no one
circumstance wherein the Hertfordshire    method of malting
differs so distinctly from the watering system, as in its short
and comparatively small radicle.     This may be very clearly
collected from many parts of the evidence, for the watering
party even seem to have made a merit of      endeavouring                      it,   by
to show that their own steepings, from the larger quantity
of root which they contained, approached and even ran into
floor charges far beyond the Hertfordshire steepings   and                                       ;
they thence endeavoured to infer that   larger opening was                a
                                               It by
left in the latter for fraud,                              the introduction               and   mixing
of corn privately              steeped.                    iscertainly true that
                                                                indeed
the Hertfordshire               mode      of working    gives the floor gauges
low,   and the other high              ;     but with this the question of fraud
has very little to do, for mixing                               is   seldom      if   ever practised
in whole floors           ;    but the short and small radicle of the one,
and long bushy root               of   the other,                 are decisive            characteris
tics which are admitted                   by   themselves, and which would, in
my humble judgment,                     stamp          a        decided        superiority on the
Hertfordshire malt.
     That   the radicle         is   actually formed from the body of the
barley     is   too obvious to require any                            proof, and indeed
                                                                                                     it

universally admitted to be                  so;   and as             it  afterwards burnt off
                                                                          is

forcing system of watering the floors is lighter and less pro
ductive than the malt made by the Hertfordshire mode,
without watering.
                      The Acrospire.
   In the malting trade a great diversity of opinion prevails
as to how far the vegetation of the acrospire should be car
ried. This arises from a notion, very general among malt
sters,    that    just     so far as        the acrospire penetrates             the grain,
it becomes  malted, and that the impenetrated part remains
unchanged barley. I trust, however, that I shall soon show
there is nothing either of truth or nature in this notion.
The      evidence    of Messrs. King             and Clough          sufficiently esta
blishes that the best malt is made when the acrospire pro
ceeds only two thirds through the grain, and it is my present
purpose to prove that their opinion and practice are sup
ported by the natural reason of the case.
   I   have      already    stated that it is the radicle which first ac
quires an attraction for the oxvgen                     of   the atmosphere, com
municating it progressively to the interior substance of the
barlev, and forming by its fixation and union with the fa
rina the first saccharine; and that afterwards the plumula,
or infant stem, requires an attraction for the newly formed
saccharine, and by its chemical action is pushed into vege
table life.
   In this       statement       a   solution     is given     of        the question    of
the acrospire, and  the truth really is, that the radicle is the
only  natural  organ  wh.ch malts the barley, or, in other
words, oxidites the interior substance, apd forms the whole
of the saccharine, while the acrospire is simply employed in
feeding upon         it,   and       from thence acquiring its growth and
bulk.
   This obvious,  and   trust just and natural distinction
                                 I                                                       in
the offices which Nature   assigns to each of those different
members of the plant, sufficiently explains why the barley
may be, and actually      perfectly malted
                                     is        the Hertford         by
shire method, though the acrospire has proceeded only two
thirds through the grain, because     the more slow and na
                                                      in
tural growth of the acrospire, the root has had time to malt
the interior substance               beyond     it,   and    even    to    the    extreme
                                                                                       end

end   of  the corn,    whereas    in the more unnatural     forcing  of
the watering mode, the acrospire is driven forward as rapidly,
though without having any immediate connection with the
oxidation ; and thus an accidental occurrence has been er
roneously mounted up into a cause.             It is material to re
mark,    that   in  brewing,   the   acrospire is insoluble, and al
ways appears so among the spent grains ; hence the larger
it grows the more it contributes to waste.
    The preceding account of the radicle and acrospire so far
simplifies the question of malting as to concentrate it to this
limited rule, that that mode of working will necessarily be
the best which can accomplish the full malting of the barley
with the smallest radicle and acrospire; for both, as I have
already^ shown, are supported from the interior substance,
and just in proportion as they are advanced in bulk, that
portion of the malt which yields the fermentative extract
will be diminished.
    On page 40 of the printed evidence Mr. Delafield states,
that he has      found malt, made by sprinkling, to vield from
 15  to 20 pounds weight in four bushels less than an equal
quantity of malt which had not been watered ; and on page
43 Mr. Martirrena declares, that sprinkled malt affords only
64 pounds of extract, when a like quantity of unwatered
malt gave     as  high as  84 pounds     : other passages of the evi
dence also     prove, that watered      malt is lighter, and on that
account less       productive,   than the Hertfordshire malt ; but
no explanation of the immediate cause of so materia!             a dif
ference is      any where attempted here : however, I would
humbly submit the true cause to lie in the comparative
smallness both of the root and acrospire in the Hertfordshire
malt, whereby less of the substance of the grain is con
sumed, and that it is the long and bunchy root and large
acrospire of watered malt that render it so light and unpro
ductive.      "
              Temperature    of the Floors in Malting.
    There   is no one circumstance         in the manufacturing of
good malt that merits so constant and careful an attention
to the working floors as this temperature. There is a certain
maximum of heat that is the best adapted to malting,               and
                                                                   with

                                On Malting.                               47
with which the vegetation will proceed in the safest and
most natural order; either above or below this temperature
is   disadvantage, but an excess and fluctuation of heat are
     a
highly injurious in a malt-house.      In whatever way the
floors are worked the temperature will continue to rise in
proportion to the time they lie undisturbed, and the only
method of checking the rise is by turning them.
  Moisture is the remote cause of all heat in vegetable sub
stances,    heaped     together, and containing a farinaceous or
starchy matter.        This matter passes into a state of fermen
tation, attracts oxvgen from the atmosphere, which in its
fixation parts with the latent heat it was before combined
with, and this accumulating in                  will frequently rise
                                          the heap
to inflammation.   The heat of          a dunghill, moist hay-rick,
wet barley, and all         other similar heaps of wet vegetable
matter, originates in one and the same natural cause.                     In
floors of malt the heat         is always   in proportion       to the quan
tum of moisture and repose of the floor.
  The chief object in a well regulated                     malt-house is not
only to preserve the floors in one equable state of tempera
ture from the cistern to the kiln, but more especially to
preserve every part of the same floor in an equal warmth.
A departure from this produces an unequal vegetation. In
the Hertfordshire      method of working, as there never is any
increase    of    moisture after the corn leaves the cistern, an
equable and        steady           in both of the preceding
                            temperature
cases can be preserved with much certainty ; but under the
practice of watering the floors it is not practicable to main
tain the same equal degree of temperature either in the pro
gress of the'floors to the kiln, or in the different parts of
the same floor      ; and the   consequence     is,    that forced,
                                                            a        fluc
                                                                      a
tuating, and an unequal vegetation             is     induced in the same
steeping, and the malt thereby becomes greatly injured.                   It
is heat in the first instance that dissipates the water which
the grain had imbibed in the cistern, and renders subsequent
watering necessary.   The floors cannot be heated without
an expenditure       of moisture, for       the warmth sweats the wa
ter out    of   the corn,   and when the floor        is   turned, the mois
ture on the husk flies          off by evaporation         :   hence, though
                                                                          the

  48                           On Malting.
  the water is at first the cause of the heat,                the heat again
  renders more water indispensable.              The floors in Hertford
  shire are never watered,      simply because they are never heat
  ed; and it is the cool slate in which they are kept in the
  early stage of malting that preserves the original moisture,
  and   induces that slow and natural vegetation so necessary
  to prevent   the substance of the grain from being run out.
     Mr. Reynoldson, in his evidence, states that the water
  imbibed in the cistern is employed in forming the root, and
  that the root afterwards is employed in supplying the grain,
  and hence he infers that         fresh   water     is necessary     on the
  floor3.   This description     is tolerably      just when      applied   to
  the watering practice, but by no            means    so   in  that   of  the
  Hertfordshire.      In   the former the       cistern water,     as  I have
  already stated,   is nearly all    expended      in the first five or six
'
  days by the employment         of  heat to drive out a rapid vegeta
  tion  of the root, but in       the   latter, seven or eight days are
  employed to vegetate a       less root.      It is in this that the two
  practices differ from each other.
     Mr. Reynoldson      also states     that  the    water received      into
  the grain   becomes decomposed, and after such decompo
  sition exudes from the grain in a staie unfit for vegeta
  tion, and hence he again infers the necessity of fresh water
  by sprinkling. This is another of that gentleman's unphilo-
  sophical assertions which is without foundation : in the
  chemical analysis of water only two products are obtained,
  viz. hydrogen and oxygen ; and these, when separated, have
  never   yet appeared    in any other form          than that     of   gases.
  The decomposed       water  of Mr. Reynoldson           is nothing more
  than the pure water imbibed in the cistern, and injudiciously
  sweated out on the surface of the grain.
                               Flinty Malt.
     Much is said in the evidence about flinty malt, and the
  agents of the watering party insinuate that watering the com
  on the floors will best prevent it ; I have however much
  reason for believing the contrary.           Flint is allowed to differ
  essentially from   the  original    substance     of the barley, and its
  formation in the malt is therefore unquestionable.                  It con-
                                                                          sisu

 sists  of little hard knobs or      ends   in the grain, which      are
 insoluble,     and so far impoverish the malt.      Its natural cause,
 I  am well convinced, resides in the heat improperly             given
 to young floors, more- especially of watered malt.                This
 heat occasions the glutinous mucilage of the barley to run
 into a clammy substance, somewhat like birdlime, envelop
 ing part of     the farina,   and inspissating first on the   working
 floors, and afterwprds on the       kiln, hardening into that     sub
 stance called in the trade flint      ; and   as  heating  the young
 floors is  a common practice with the watering party, and can
 only happen in Hertfordshire from the neglect of the work
 men, it is surely reasonable to conclude that the watering
 system, amongst its other evils, will be the principal source
 of flinty malt.
                            Flavour of Malt.
    A  great deal is said by the agents for watering, on the sub
ject of their being enabled to make their malt of a superior
 flavour by sprinkling ; but the question of flavour, when
 applied to pale or common malt, resolves itself into this
 simple fact, that that malt which is worked in the most pure,
clean, and natural manner, will he the most free from all
adventitious and improper flavour.
    While pale malt is working on the floors, all that can be
done is not to give, but to guard it from any peculiar flavour.
On    the kiln the case is widely different ; there, just in pro
portion    as   the fire is urged, slowly or rapidly, less or more
of flavour    and colour    will be given to the malt : it re in this
way only that all malt, expressly intended for the brewing
of porter,     has its peculiar flavour and colour given to it :
but the flavour of ale, generally speaking, is derived from a
different source ; this latter arises from the union of a pe
culiar oil of a greenish colour, naturally abounding in hops,
with a portion of the unfermented wort, and the mucilage
and alcohol     of the fermented part    ; these, judiciously blended
together in a due proportion, give to ale all its agreeable
taste  ; but the palate being an arbitrary organ, and differing
widely in different places, no established rule can be laid down
for adjusting the flavouring of ale : in some places the sweet
taste of the malt is required to be pretty full in the mouth,

by leaving a larger proportion of the unfermented wort ;
while in others it is required to be almost entirely dissipated
by a more complete fermentation, and between these a va
riety of flavour may easily be imagined.
   What has been said will be sufficient to explain the case
as far as regards   that flavour which it is desirable to obtain               :
but there is another point of view in which it is to be con*
sidered, and that    is,
                      those bad flavours which malt acquires
in its progress through      manufacturing state, and which
                               a
greatly depreciate its value. The principal of these, and in
deed the only one with which the present inquiry        imme      is
diately connected,     that
                         is of mouldy malt,  arising from  the
vegetation ceasing after having made some progress      most       ;
of the grains which are bruised    being   by
                                           trodden under the
feet of workmen or others while in    state of malting, pass

                                                a
mouldy malt, and the more moist the grain was when in
closed under the glass, the sooner    will become mouldy.

VTII.      Chemical Examination          of the Pollen or the feamda-
     ting Dust     of the    Date Tree of Egypt — Phoenix dacty
     lites.    By A. F. Fourcroy*.              -
                            § I.    Introduction,             •i
 .ftcl.  DELtLLfi, one of the          learned men who accompanied
 Bonaparte in his expedition to Egypt, sent me a quantity of
 pollen or the fecundating dust of the date tree (phoenix
 dacty/ferahm.).          This dust escapes from the antherae, or
 small sacs, which contain, it so easily, and in so large a quan
tity, that whenever seen at sun-rise, at a distance it resem
bles a mist which surrounds the date trees.               M. Delille col
lected    it by causing    some    branches     of male   date trees to be
shaken in      a room hung round with napkins, to which the
 pollen adhered.
    I   ought here to mention a very remarkable fact published
by    M. Michaux, on        the subject    of the fecundating principle
of the palm       date tree.   This naturalist travelled in Persia,
when several usurpers were in arms contending for portions
of that vast empire. The different parties, alternately victo
rious, penetrated into the provinces ; and in order to reduce
the inhabitants more speedily, they burned all the male in
dividuals of the date tree.          The most dreadful famine would
have desolated      these unhappy countries, if the Persians had
not    taken  the  precaution to keep in reserve the pollen of the
antherae, and to use it for fecundating the female individuals.
This observation proves that           the dust of the phoenix dacty-
lifera preserves      its fecundating property for a long time.
It seems they kept it eighteen years without its having lost
this virtue.      I am therefore of op nion that the pollen of the
date tree, brought by M." Delille, and contained in thick
paper parcels, has undergone no alteration.
    Upon opening the packets, 1 found the fecundating dust
dry, of a sulphur yellow, sufficiently compressed to have
been neither moistened nor heated, and well enough de
fended from the external         air to prevent all bad influence.

     There was a sufficient
to make a very extensive chemical examination ; and it
was the first time that a similar occasion in modern che
mistry had occurred of analysing this interesting substance.
It brought to my recollection what I had seen sixteen years
ago, in consequence of the kindness of M. Tessier, who
then sent me a small quantity of the pollen of flax. I re
member that the experiments made in my laboratory at this
period, when the means of analysis were not so perfect as
they are now, had been so unsatisfactory that I did not
think it worth while to publish them. On the present occa
sion every circumstance concurred to induce me to profit by
the opportunity : — the zeal and attention of M. Delille, who
had furnished me with a rare and well-preserved production,
and which had never been analysed            ;   the hope     of discover
ing, with the help of well-known reagents, properties en
tirely unknown hitherto in a substance so important in its
effects   ;             of the quantity, which admitted of
              the abundance
my multiplying   and  varying the experiments in order to
ascertain its chemical nature ; and, lastly, the perfection
which we have attained in the analysis of organic com
pounds.
   I could not be guided in my experiments by any preceding
analysis, because from what we formerly knew of the pollen of
the antherae we were forced to consider           it,
                                          according to some
ideas  of Reaumur, as    kind of concrete oily substance like

which nothing could induce us to foresee or suspect.

     Before proceeding to the exact analysis of this dust, we
thought     necessary to try some preliminary experiments,

more certainly our progress in the details of the analysis.
The following are the first general properties which present
ed themselves       :
                                                                   l.The

            or the fecundating Dust       of the Date Tree.         53
    1.  The pollen of     the   date tree has an acidulated and dis
 agreeable   taste.
    2.  When mixed with the tincture of turnsole it         reddens   it
 perceptibly.
    3. When washed with warm water, it communicates to
it a  yellowish colour, and a very sensible acidity.
   4. This infusion is precipitated in a canary yellow by
lime-water and ammonia ; the liquor which swims above
the precipitate is of a golden yellow.
    5. Solution of acetateof lead, of nitrate of mercury, and of
silver, is precipitated in yellowish white by the same liquor.
    6. Alcohol forms a white deposit, which is flaky and very
light.
    7. Heat renders     the solution turbid,     and occasions a   se
paration of white concrete flakes.
    8.  The solution of sulphate of lime undergoes no change
from the infusion      of pollen.
    9. The oxalate of ammonia instantly produces a pulve
rulent precipitate, which has all the properties of the oxalate
of lime.
   These experiments show that the pollen of the date tree
contains a free acid ; that this aeid, very soluble in water, is
accompanied by a calcareous salt, which, being insoluble of
itself,  is only dissolved by the intermedium in question,
and that this calcareous salt is the cause of the precipitation
of the solution of the nitrates of mercury and silver, by the
infusion of    the fecundating dust.
         § III.   Washing     of the Pollen with cold Water.
   The most sensible and the most remarkable                matter in
the pollen being the acid exhibited upon the first experi
ments, we endeavoured to obtain it separately, in order to
ascertain the nature of it.          For this purpose, we washed
124 grammes       of pollen (about four ounces) with a sufficient
quantity   of   cold  distilled water. The washings had a red
dish colour, and an acidulated taste and smell similar to that
of beer.
   By evaporation, this liquor gave a matter of a reddish
brown colour, the consistence and smell of which were like
                                   D 3                     molasses ;

54               Chemical Examination efth» Pollen
molasses     ;  its taste was sourer, and at the same time nau
seous.
    The matter produced from           the evaporation of the washing
of  the pollen,      agitated   with alcohol,   did not communicate
any colour to it in the cold, although left a long time in
contact with this liquid : but on the addition of heat, a part
of this substance       was combined       with the alcohol,      and gave
it a very deep co'our.
    The part of      the residue insoluble    in alcohol then     appeared
less coloured,       and was thicker than before; it was easily
dissolved in water, and at the same time deposited a grayish
matter in abundance ; its taste was much less acid, and had
a kind    of putridity and mucilaginous viscosity.               The pro
duce of the aqueous ley of the evaporated                    pollen was
jthertfore separated by the alcohol and water, applied suc
cessively in three substances ; the one soluble in alcohol,
the other soluble in water, and the third not soluble in either.
We chiill resume the examination of these substances, in
order to determine their nature.
    The alcoholic solution evaporated            to the consistence    of a
soft extract, had in this state a fine red colour,              a  smell of
boiled apples, a taste strongly acid, but scr.sioly disagreeable
latterly.
    It was easily and        abundantly dissolved in water; it red
 dened turnsole tincture, made an effervescence              with solu
tions of the alkaline carbonates, slightly precipitated lime-
 water in yellowish white flakes, which were dissolved in a
new quantity of the acid liquor. It must be observed that
this matter thus separated by the alcohol, precipitated lime
much less than the first aqueous ley of the pollen ; but uni
 ted to lime-water        to the point   of saturation,  the  liquor pre
 sented   in   a tew days at its surface a considerable quantity of
 insipid   prismatic     crystals soluble without effervescence in the
 muriatic acid.
    The solution of the alcoholic residue in water precipitated
 also the acctite of lead in yellowish flakes which are dissolved
 in the acetic acid ; nitrate of mercury a little oxygenated
 experienced the 3ame effect.
    Although       tbe  preceding experiments        seem to prove tbat
                                                                        the

              or the fecundating      Dust  of the Date Tree.         53
the acid contained in the pollen of the date tree was malic
acid, in order to obtain a more rigorous demonstration of it
we submitted it to the following test.
     A portion of the solution of this acid, mixed with nitric
acid, produced a great deal of nitric gas, and furnished upon
cooling crystals of oxalic acid floating in a mother-water of a
yellowish red colour and of a bitter taste.                This experi
ment, as we see, confirms what the rest had announced, viz.
that the acid of the pollen of the date tree is undoubtedly
malic acid ; for no other vegetable acid is changed so easily
into oxalic acid by the nitric acid. It also resolves the ques
 tion whether this acid existed naturally in the pollen, or if
 it be the result of a fermentation occasioned by the humidity
 on the voyage from Egypt. We know that in fact the malic
 acid never      proceeds from a similar operation, and on the
 contrary, it is itself destroyed, in order to give rise to the
 acetic acid.
      A portion of the matter soluble in alcohol having been dis
 solved in a small quantity of water, we mixed carbonate of
 soda with      it ; a very brisk and frothy effervescence was pro
 duced; and when the saturation appeared complete, we con
 centrated the liquor by evaporation to the consistence of a
 clear syrup     : in this state it furnished in seven or eight days a
  quantity of small transparent crystals : there still, however,
  remained a great deal of matter which had not crystal
  lized. The crystallized salt, mixed with lime-water, precipi
  tated it but feebly; but some time afterwards new crystals
  were formed in the liquor.
  §    IV.  Examination       of  the  Portion   of the   Extract of  the
        Pollen which was insoluble in Water and in Alcohol.
       We   have said     that the extract   of the  pollen obtained by
  the evaporation of the water with which this pollen had been
   washed, was not entirely dissolved in the alcohol, even with
   the   assistance    of  heat ; and   that  this residue   had a brown
  colour, and       a taste less   acid than formerly, but nauseous.
   This portion      insoluble in the alcohol was subjected to the
   following experiments, in order to ascertain its nature.
        Upon dissolving in water it precipitated a matter of a yel-
  .  -                                  D  4                       lowish

36                 Chemical Examination                  of the Pollen
lowish white,          weighed when dried two grammes
                         which
and   quarter,
      a                              to one gramme and a
                         and which was reduced
quarter by calcination ; it was then black like charcoal
dust.       This      substance       exhaled    while on the fire the smell                     of
burnt horns             mixed with that              of ammonia,           but without
softening or melting like horn. When exposed to the blow
pipe it first became black, afterwards white, and melted at
last into     a   brilliant white globule, of              a very lively phosphoric
lustre.
     This   same matter not soluble                  in water was dissolved in
the nitric and muriatic                acids without effervescence                    ;    lime-
water and ammonia gave precipitates from these acidsin white
gelatinous. like flakes. Oxalate of ammonia produced in
the acid solutions a pulverulent and gramilous precipitate.
Sulphuric acid decomposed                       the same       matter without dis
solving it : after having boiled it for some time with this acid
diluted in water we filtered the liquor, and washed the solid
mass      with cold water         ;    we afterwards boiled            ii with            a great
quantity of water, which produced the complete solution of
it;         of ammonia formed oxalate of lime with
      oxalate                                          and                                it,
muriate of barytes formed sulphate of barytes.
  Thus one of the elements of this substance treated with
sulphuric acid was in reality lime.                        The acid        to which this
earth was united was ascertained                         by   the    following experi
ments     :   ammonia formed in                 it  gelatinous precipitate in
                                                     a
abundance         ;    and lime.water,          when poured into the liquor
decanted from off this precipitate, produced                               a    new one in
every respect resembling phosphate of lime.                                It   is   therefore
certain that the lime found in this substance                              by   the prece
ding experiments was united to phosphoric acid. The pollen
of the date tree, therefore, contains phosphate of lime, which
was dissolved in water.  We shall presently see that  con                                 it
tains (ven more than the quantity mentioned, and that                                           it   is
accompanied             by
                 another phosphoric salt.
§     V. Examination              of   the Portion   Extract
                                                          of   the                   of    Pollen
              lwt soluble     in Akoiu.L and soluble in Water.
     It   has been remarked, that the portion                         of   the extract               of
pollen not soluble            in      alcohol was separated into two                       by    the

            or the fecundating    Dust of t lie Date Tree.           57
water, that the portion not dissolved in this liquid was phos
phate of lime.       It became necessary to know the real nature
of the portion dissolved by       the water   in the experiment last
described.       This aqueous solution,       mixed   with ammonia,
gave a very abundant precipitate of a yellowish white colour,
like gelatine, which, when well washed and dried, weighed
one gramme and one-        fifth, or twelve decigrammes.
     This precipitate was melted into a transparent pearl hy the
blow- pipe ; it exhaled a strong smell of ammonia, and spar
kled during its fusion with a very distinct phosphoric light.
A boiling ley of caustic potash liberated trim it the smell
 of ammonia, diminished it in volume, and gave it the form
 of   a light flaky substance: the filtered alkaline liquor, satu
 rated with nitric acid and boiled for a few minutes, gave by
 means of lime-water         a very abundant        precipitate, which
 was recognised to be calcareous phosphate. Thus the pre
 cipitate formed in the aqueous solution by ammonia con
 tained phosphoric acid : we afterwards ascertained the base to
 which this acid was united, by the following experiments :
      The light flakes, separated by the potash which had
  taken up the phosphoric acid, were of a yellow colour,
  of the consistence of paste, and became hard when dried.
  Sulphuric acid dissolved them almost entirely, excepting
  a little sulphate of lime which was formed ; and this solu
  tion filtered, and left to evaporate, spontaneously presented,
  in a few days, prismatic crystals, the taste, solubility, and
  properties of which were perfectly similar to those of the
  sulphate of magnesia. The pollen of the date tree therefore
  contains magnesian phosphate, like several other animal
  substances.
   §  VI.   Examination of    the  Matter from which      the Phosphate
               of Magnesia was separated hy Ammonia.
       The aqueous solution of the extract of pollen           treated at
   first by alcohol, deprived by the addition of ammonia of the
   magnesian phosphate which it contained, having been eva
   porated to the consistence of a clear syrup, furnished, upon
   cooling, a granulous mass filled with small transparent and
   prismatic crystals.      This salt was a combination of malic
                                                                     acid

 $8                   Chemical Examination             of the Pollen
 acid with ammonia,                since lime and           a   caustic      alkali    extri
cated   from it extremely sharp ammoniacal vapours.        In
truth  it precipitated but very slightly by means of lime-wa
ter, because it no longer contained phosphate, which former
ly thickened the volume of the precipitates ; hut after having
                       of lime-water, there were formed in
added a certain quantity
a few days large crystals of true malate of lime.
    But the liquor now under consideration was not entirely
formed of malate of ammonia; for upon exposing it to the
fire it exhaled an odour of burnt animal matter, in place of
a smell of caramel like pure malic acid ; besides, the in
fusion of gallnuts formed in its solution an abundant brown
and viscous precipitate.  Thus water applied to the pollen
of    the date tree dissolved this animal                       matter by the inter
medium           of    the   malic    acid; and what proves this is, that
when once the greatest part of the malic acid was taken up
by the alcohol, the phosphate of lime by being precipitated
took a great quantity along with                        it,
                                       which put this salt
nearly in the same state with that which forms the saline
earthy calculi of the bladder, or the matter of the bones.
§    VII.  Remarks upon the Presence    the Phosphates  Lime
                                                       of                          of
     and Magnesia        Ike Pollen
                             in      the Date Tree, and upon
                                                  of
     their Solution in the Aqueous Ley    this Pollen.  of
   The preceding experiments prove that phosphates of
lime and of magnesia were held in solution in the water
with which we had washed the pollen of the date tree never                         ;
theless      we       know that       these     salts, and        particularly that of
                                                                 it by
lime,     are not soluble in water solely and                       themselves but     ;
as they are accompanied                   by   malic acid,               appears   certain,
that   it   is   to this acid they owe their solubility.                    Thus, when
we wash with alcohol                 these     matters, separated from                 water
and thickened          into an extract by evaporation, this liquid
takes up     a    great quantity of the malic acid, and the residue
deposits         as we have       seen,    on being dissolved
                                                     water,                  in            a
portion of these salts, and particularly phosphate of lime,
which no longer finds sufficient quantity of acid for being
                                  a
soluble.  Nevertheless    seems that it portion of malic acid
                                                       a
is combined intimately enough     with   the phosphates, and
                                                                              particularly

            or the fecundating Dust          of the Date        Tree.             5Q
particularly with that of magnesia, to prevent the alcohol
from separating it.  Hence it follows that the phosphate of
magnesia seems to have more affinity for (he malic acid than
the phosphate of lime ; for there is no reason to doubt that
these sails are rendered soluble in water by their combina
tion with the malic acid, as we have observed. We now see
therefore why the alcohol takes up a portion of malic acid
from the mixture of the substances of which the extract of
pollen is composed ; also the reason why the residue depo
sits phosphate of lime when we dissolve it in water; and,
lastly, why the phosphate of magnesia remains in solution
in the water, and requires, in order to be separated from                          it,
the addition     of ammonia, or of any other alkali.
§   VIII.   Examination       of    the    Pollen washed and            exposed to
                                    the   Air.
    After having found                   up malic acid from
                           that water takes
the date tree, besides phosphates of lime and magnesia, and
a  matter analogous to that furnished                  by
                                           animals, we pro
ceeded to examine        that   part       of the pollen which              is   com
pletely insoluble in water.               The pollen, well washed, was
placed to drip upon blotting paper               having been eight days
                                                 :
upon   ashelf in the laboratory,            in place of being dried, and
resuming its natural form of powder, its parts were softened,
glued together, and formed      kind of paste,
                                      a          which    fer   ip            a
mentation took place which made         contract    smell ex
                                                     it               a
tremely fetid, analogous to that of old cheese.    This smell
had attracted the flies tor we found plenty of larvae of these
                          ;
insects which are nourished there.
    This matter thus altered,         assumed        when completely dried
a semitransparence, and   hardness
                                a                    which approached those
of strong glue. Before being entirely dried                    it   was easily di
luted in water, where   remained suspended
                           it                                   for   a    long time
and gave    it   the property   of frothing like soap.                    The water
in which    we had thus diluted the mashed
                                         pollen was coagu
lated  bythe acids and the calcareous salts, which proves
that there was formed    kind of soap during the fermenta

 above described,              submitted to distillation,       furnished at first
 a white liquid which gradually became coloured ; some time
 afterwards there passed over a red fetid oil, and some car
bonate of ammonia, one part of which was crystallized upon
the sides of the receiver, and another remained in solution
in    the   liquor.        A
                    portion of the oil was in the state of am
moniacal soap ; for the acids separated a great quantity of
this oil from the filtered liquor.
     There remained in the retort                a   voluminous charcoal shining
and difficult         to    burn    :    after some time, however, and with
a sufficient heat, we reduced it entirely to a white cinder,
which was dissolved completely, and without effervescence,
in the nitric acid, from which it was afterwards precipitated
by ammonia.      This precipitate, washed and dried, weighed
0-36 parts of a gramme ; it was phosphate of lime.        We
must conclude from this latter fact, that the quantity of
malic acid existing in the pollen of the date tree is not suf
ficient to render soluble the whole                    of the phosphate of lime
contained in          it,   and that       in spite    of the manifold washings
which this pollen               had undergone,          there remained       a   portion
of    the calcareous salt which the incineration
                                             had developed.
Thus      pollen contains
        the                greater quantity
                                          a of phosphate of
lime than that which has been announced above.
        IX.     Treatment           of   the unwaslied Pollen      with Acids.
  A §
     gramme of unwashed pollen put into muriatic acid
cold, seemed at first as combined with and dissolved
                                         if                   it                            :
eight days afterwards the filtered liquor had greenish yel      a
low colour, as welT as the undissolved pollen. This liquor
became very yellow with ammonia, and deposited     powder                a
of the same colour. This experiment proves that the pollen
takes       with muriatic acid            a   deeper yellow colour     than       it   has
naturally,      and     portion of this substance

    A   gramme of the same substance put into nitric acid
immediately assumed     yellow colour, and seemed to be
                                   a

                            a

its nature was the same with that of the precipitate produced
by   the ammonia         in          experiment.
                                the preceding     The pollen
thus treated, when washed with distilled water assumed upon
drying    very intense yellow colour, and the form of soup,

ness.  Placed upon burning charcoal,                            softened, and an oily

charcoal behind it.           The pollen had therefore undergone                                 a
commencement             of alteration on account of the nitric acid,
since   it   presented      after being subjected to its action pro

                                                       ;   it
quired     a   greasy character,          like the animal substances                    treated
by   the   nitric acid.
    This alteration indicated                  by    the preceding experiment,
having appeared deserving of being better known, we re
peated the experiment in the following manner   Sixteen                        :
grammes of unwashed pollen were put into          glass retort            a
with nitric acid diluted to 30 degrees of the areometer. An
action between the substances was manifested upon the first
contact,       and without the assistance       of fire. The pollen ap
peared to be softened             and dissolved in the nitric acid itl                      ;
dust formed      homogeneous mass, semitransparent, and
                    a
presenting the consistence of soup.   Soon afterwards, and
always    the cold,
           in         gas was developed, which, slowly ex

beer-yeast when the process                        of fermentation

This gas was in great measure azotic gas, mixed only with
                        a

   This mixture subjected to the action of slight heat soon         a
boiled,   produced
           it         large volume of gas, which was, from

 oily substance was formed of a yellow colour, which swam
on the surface of the liquor. The quantity of this fatty
matter seemed        to increase as the     ebullition went on, but      il
seemed to decrease la'terly        ;  we   then removed the mixture
from the fire.       When it was cool the fat.ty substance be*
came    fixed, forming a thick coat on the liquor, which was
of  a very deep     yellow, similar to the colour communicated
by the nitric acid to all animal substances treated in the
same manner.
    This liquor    had a very bitter taste,     and a smell     like that
of prussic acid, although it         was impossible to ascertain the
presence     of this acid.
    The colouring matter thus formed by the nitric acid ad
hered strongly to pieces of cloth, and particularly to fabrics
of  an animal      nature, and was extremely fixed.
    The nitric solution mixed with the alkalis until           the excess
of acid      was   saturated, assumed        an  orange yellow colour,
much deeper,        and    precipitated earthy phosphates and ox
alates, charged with a portion of the colouring matter ; an
excess of alkali makes the orange colour change to a blood
red.
    This   same liquor left,     upon being properly evaporated, a
reddish yellow substance, very bitter, tenacious, and gluey,
perfectly soluble in water, to which it communicated a ci
tron shade,      giving   a precipitate   of oxalate of lime upon the
addition of ammonia,          and ammonia by its mixture         with the
caustic alkalis.
 *  The action of      the  nitric acid upon    the pollen   of   the date
tree had therefore formed, 1st, ammonia;             2d, carbonic acid;
3d, oxalic acid;       4th, a yellow matter, bitter, and soluble in
water;     5th,  a kind of suet or fat matter.          This last, when
washed several        times with warm water, was of a greenish
vellow colour,      a  bitter taste, weaker, however, than that of
the liquor from which it had been separated           : it became white
upon being dried in the air.
    It became      soft in the      fingers, to which it stuck like
liquid    and   tenacious resins.        By heat it was melted into a
yellow liquor, at the bottom of which there were some solid
                                                                    bodies

    bodies which must have escaped the effects of the nitric acid.
    When put upon burning coals it was dissipated, after being
    fused, into a pungent smoke like that of fat ; but it left a
    more voluminous                   charcoal than the latter.                 When retained
    some time in the    mouth it produced at first a sensation of
    bitterness, and then of rancidity, like common fat, when
    treated    in the       same way.                It no longer             gave    ammonia in
    any perceptible quantity upon distillation, which seems to
    prove that all the azot had been separated ; cold alcohol
    did not dissolve              it,   but only took up   small portion of
                                                                     a                                 it

                                              Putrefaction.
         The caustic alkalis              acted upon the produce                 of   the date tree
    in                  upon some dry, pulverulent, or animal
          the same way as
    matters. This pollen when, shaken with     ley of very caustic        a
    potash, seemed to be dissolved even     the cold    and   be     in               ;          it

    exhaled    a    distinct ammoniacal smell when filtered after;                                     a

    the characters          of    a     soap.
          Thirty-two grammes of   the seminal powder of the date
    tree, not  washed, were  put into   flask with an equal quantity
                                                        a

                                  ;                              or                              in

    derwent during this period.

 64              Chemical Examination        of the Pollen
 which communicated its peculiar smell               to the whole mass       :
 we could distinguish, however, through this mouldy smell
 that of new cheese, or the disagreeable kind of acid which
 we meet with in dairies.
    When      we proceeded     to take the matter out        of the bottle,
 we found that it had formed        a  homogeneous mass, tenacious
 and gluey.       It had a very pungent        taste, like that of old
 cheese,    but by no means acid, as it was before undergoing
 fermentation.
    It had not contracted any fetid or ammoniacal                  smell, as
 happens     with  animal   matters  in  putrefaction ;      we  shall  soon
 see that this difference may be easily explained.                Its colour
was a whitish gray ; but         when we diluted          it in a   solution
of caustic alkali, it immediately          assumed     a  very fine yellow
colour, and exhaled a sharp ammoniacal smell.
    It is evident that a good deal of ammonia was formed du
ring    the putrefaction undergone by the pollen, and' that
this ammonia proceeds from the peculiar combination of
azot with hydrogen, both contained in the fecundating
dust.     But how does it happen that the matter thus altered
exhales no fetid smell, and does not give out an ammonia
cal odour    ?  The   cause  of these phaenomena        exists in the pre
sence    of the malic acid in the pollen       of  the palm tree.       This
acid is combined       with ammonia,       at least partly so, in pro
portion as it is formed ; while the otherpart of the ammonia
which the malic acid cannot saturate is united to the oily
matter, the formation of which is the necessary consequence
of that of ammonia.          Thus   there result from this putrid de
composition,         malate   of ammonia,         and    a   kind of    am
moniacal soap.         Nevertheless the vegetable matter was not
entirely    transformed     into soap, for it was not totally dis
solved in water ; but the portion which was dissolved, formed
instantly with nitric acid a coagulation like that which
takes place with a weak aqueous           solution of soap.

  of which is taken up by the washings at the same time with
  the malic acid,     which renders them soluble.
     3d,   An animal matter which is dissolved in water with
 the assistance of the acid, and which, being precipitated by
 the infusion of gall-nuts, shows itself as a kind of gelatine.
     Lastly, a pulverulent substance which the preceding bodies
 seem to cover,      which    is insoluble  in water, susceptible of
 giving ammonia, of being converted into an ammoniacal
 soap by putrefaction, by the fixed alkalis; and which, on
 account of its properties, seems to be analogous to a dry al
 buminous or glutinous matter. This singular composition,
 which presents a very remarkable resemblance between the
 pollen of the date tree and animal substances, is still more
 singular on account of its resemblance to the seminal fluid.
We      are already acquainted with the striking analogy be
tween the smell in particular of the seminal fluid and the
 fecundating dust of the chesnut, poplar, &c. The rela
tions which a simple sensation had permitted us to discover
between two substances of different kingdoms in nature, are
found stronger and more intimate, after analysing both the
one and the other       of these substances.     It  seems that in de
stining them to the same uses, Nature had wished to con
stitute them of the same elements; or rather, that, in order to
make them fulfil the same functions, it was necessary to
infuse into them the same principles.               It is true, that in
Spite   of  the discoveries  in chemistry, in spite of the precise
knowledge       which  it furnishes  upon the comparative compo
sition of.the fecundating substance in both kingdoms of or
ganized bodies, we are scarcely further advanced as to the
mysterious property which distinguishes this matter; and
we have not thrown any better light upon the relation which
exists between its composition        and its fecundating    quality.

      SIR,
In  your Magazine of last month, I observed a very inge
nious suggestion for an improvement in the nomenclature
of metallic salts, signed E. B.
     Following the modern system of nomenclature,                           the name
of   the metallic salt should show in the most concise manner,

excess  of acid or excess of base; as the same oxide some

      SIR,
 J.  he singularity of the following circumstance (observed
when preparing for a public lecture) induces me to believe
that its communication will be acceptable to many readers of
your valuable publication.           Should     you entertain the same
opinion, its insertion in         the   Philosophical       Magazine       will
much oblige                                yours respectfully,
                                                         G.   J.  Singer.
    When      the brilliant experiments of the deflagration of
metals by the Voltaic battery were first published, it was
observed, that silver burned with a bright emerald green
light ; and this observation has been repealed by mo3t sub
sequent writers and          experimentalists.       In   the   lectures    re
cently delivered at the Royal Institution, when this experi
ment was repeated, the green flame did not appear, the de
flagration of silver leaf being attended by the emission of a
brilliant white light. Mr. Davy attributed this to the great
purity   of the silver employed      ; and  conjectured, that the green
flame usually observed, arose from the admixture of copper
                                    £  9                                  with

   with     the silver, as usually practised in the manufacture of
   that metal. Having, however, uniformly observed the green
   light, from the purest silver leaf I could obtain, when defla
   grated either by an electrical or Voltaic battery, I did not
   feel inclined to assent to this conclusion without further
   trial  ;  and was     rather disposed to attribute the phaenomena
  then observed        to some other cause.       The construction of a
  large     Voltaic  apparatus    for the Lectures at the Scientific    In
  stitution,      soon afforded     me an opportunity     of verifying the
  opinion      I  had   formed.    Having    observed   that Mr. Davy's
  conducting wires were terminated by charcoal, I employed
  a similar arrangement ; and applying the charcoal to pure
  silver leaf, it immediately burned with a beautiful white
  light. Some of the same portion of silver having been be
  fore employed, when the green flame was produced, it be
  came evident that the white light in this and in Mr. Davy's
  experiment proceeded from the charcoal : and that this was
  really the case, appeared from the immediate evolution of
-green light when the contact was made by a metallic wire.
  By the application          of charcoal to    the extremity   of a wire,
  so    bent that either the wire          or charcoal may touch the
  fcilver at pleasure,      the white and the green flame may be
  alternately produced; and a conclusive demonstration of the
  fact, with a pleasing variation of a brilliant experiment, will
  be   thus at once afforded.

 JL   have      sent you the inclosed for a place in your work, if
 you     think   fit. An idea has struck me of a mechanical union
 of gas, which will not be liable to any of the objections
 raised against Mr. Dalton's, and which, I believe, will apply
 to every phaenomenon. The principle is this, that from the
 laws of elastic fluids, it will be found to follow, that if the
particles of one be larger than the particles of another ; or
 father, if the repulsive sphere of one be greater than the re-
•     •                                  •                         pulsive

 pulsive    sphere    of another,      the particles of any        two (or
 more) elastic fluids will arrange themselves at the greatest
 possible distance from each other.            This, I think, would
bear issue with mathematical demonstration, which is what
Mr. Dalton evidently shrinks from : —but I                 am almost sa
tiated with hypotheses,         there are such shallow ones, and in
vogue too : — we       need no more     of them, till  those we already
 have be more      justly appreciated.

    In Mr. Dalton's new Treatise on Chemical Philosophy
just published, it appears to me, he assumes this principle,
That two gases, each pressing on the containing vessel, with
a  force as 1- from every particle, and having no repulsive
 action on each other, the joint effect of this pressure will be
 equal to the individual effect of a single gas with a similar
 pressure   of 1-26; which cannot        be the case.     For suppose a,
a repulsive force       that has the power of extending a certain
quantity of gas A, under a given pressure, a certain space s ;
and suppose b another repulsive force that has the power of ex
tending another quantity of another gas B, under the same
 pressure,- the same space s       ; — neither of  these two forces can
extend these gases to greater space than s (the contrary is ab
surd). And these two gases will conjointly, if put together on
these    principles,    only occupy the same space s, that each
would individually.          But the repulsive power of gases under
the same circumstances is as the space occupied : consequent
ly,  the powers of expansion in two gases with no repulsive ac
tion on each other, cannot act conjointly, but must be equal
only to the expansion of a single gas whose power is as great
as either   of   these supposed conjoined       forces  ;  and,    as it has
been generally inferred, two measures         of gas combined on this
theory ought only to occupy the space of one before admix
ture.     Mr. Dalton admits, that if an equal quantity of two
gases be combined according to his principles, in one vessel,
the repulsion of their particles from each other, being T2fi

  he, the pressure upon the vessel will still be the same as be
   fore. But I have endeavoured to show that nothing can be
  derived     from a supposed conjoint action of the repulsion of
  the gases.       From whence, therefore, must half the pressure
  proceed ? The number of particles is the same before and
  after admixture : there is in one case n particles pressing
  upon the vessel       with   a force    = 1-26;        and in the other n
  particles pressing with       a   force =    1- only: — How can the ag
  gregate    of  these forces be equal      ? And again, for every action
  there must be     a corresponding reaction: the particles of a gas,
 therefore, cannot press upon a vessel in a greater degree than
  they react upon themselves. And as Mr. Dalton supposes
 that gases under this combination have nothing to react
  upon but particles of their own species, How can he recon
 cile the pressure upon the vessel as being 1-26 for each par-
 ticje of gas, whilst he himself supposed the utmost reaction
 of each particle      as !•  only    ?

and     lotions ; but the breast remained somewhat enlarged,
apparently from a tumour, which was entirely neglected, as
it did not produce much inconvenience, only occasionally
 some darting through the part.
     In October, 1806, she received         a second blow while play
ing with      a   child, who threw its    head back with     great force
on the same breast, which was then exposed : — this produced
exquisite pain at the instant.            The tumour was now more
 evident, and excited greater attention from the darting pain,
 which was become severe, returned at short intervals, and
 was accompanied          with  a sensation  of heat.
     She was now         placed   under the care  of  a physician, who
.directed that from eight to twelve leeches should be applied
 to the breast ; and, after the bleeding had subsided, that the
 whole be covered with the emplastrum thuris compositum, and
 that the most abstemious regimen be enjoined. More leeches
 aud another plaster were applied at about the end of eightdays.
     This mode of treatment was persevered in till April 1 807,
 when     I first saw her. The tumour was large and irregular on
 its surface, exceedingly painful ; the dartings, always accom
 panied with a sensation of heat, extended through the nipple,
 which was retracted,           and the integuments somewhat puc
 kered    : a  considerable enlargement had also taken place in
 one of the lymphatic glands on the lower edge of the pecto
 ral muscle,       towards the axilla.
     During the above plan of treatment by depletion, the pe
 riods of the catamenia were protracted, and became more
 painful; the general health and strength of the body were
 much reduced, and little calculated to bear             up against the
  increasing degree       of pain produced by       each application  of
 the leeches ; the disease assumed its true character, and was
 now making rapid advances.
      A  generous regimen was immediately ordered, and the
  breast covered with the emplastrum ammoniaci cum hydrar-
  gyro.     At the end of the first week it was evident that she
  had experienced great benefit from the change in the plan of
  treatment     :  the diet was now directed to be      of the most nu
  tritious kind     ; some alterative medicines were prescribed, and
  the plaster continued.

   pain was reduced so as to give but little uneasiness ; the tu

 A   new System     of Chemical Philosophy      .  Part I. By John
                        Dalton,   Bvo. pp. 220.
    The intention of this small but interesting volume is to
 exhibit and elucidate the author's ideas relative to those pri
 mary laws which seem to obtain in regard to heat, and to
 chemical combinations.         Some of the doctrines         which he
 maintains   will occasion discussion and investigation, but
 they are of so interesting a nature as to promise an ample
 recompense in the elucidation of chemical truths, which
 may be expected to be the result. — The author expects to
 publish Part   II.  in about  a year  hence.
    In the course    of next month will be published, a supple
 mentary   volume     of Birds, to Barr's Edition of Buffon. — The
proprietors of that work have engaged a literary gentleman
to collect all that has been discovered in ornithology of an
interesting nature since the death of the illustrious Buffon ;
and for that purpose procured the splendid edition of his
works lately published by Sonnini, in 114 volumes.                From
this has been selected every      article of  importance, or of cu
riosity, from the additions of Sonnini and J.          J.  Virey.
   Several new plates will accompany the volume; the con
tents of which will bring down the aera of discovery in this
interesting branch      of natural history   to the present day.
   Mr. Accum, lecturer on operative chemistry and mine
ralogy,   &c, has in the press A System of Mineralogy and
Mineralogical Chemistry, with applications to the Arts. The
work will be formed chiefly after Haiiy and Brongniart, and
will be published in three octavo volumes, with fifteen cop
per plates.

                 Wernerian Natural History Society.                  75
occupied the Society.           The general result of the numerous
and accurate experiments performed by these philosophers
prove, that the quantity of carbonic acid produced in respira
tion    is always equal to the quantity of oxygen consumed,
and vice versa; that a healthy man, whose pulse is 70 in a
minute, will consume 3400 cubic inches of oxygen gas in
eleven     minutes    ;  that the same man will emit in the course
of    24 hours,     calculating the quantity of gas which always
remains       in the lungs after every respiration, 18000 cubic
inches of carbonic acid, which yield 10 oz. 2 grs. of solid
carbon.        It also appeared that no combination takes place
between oxygen and hydrogen in the lungs, and that they
do not form water in the process of respiration.               The au
thors were assisted in the accuracy of these results by the
great perfection to which they have brought their eudiometer.
     June ts. The president in the chair. — A paper by Dr.
Henry of Manchester was read, On the instruments of ana
 lysis of carbonic acid, and the gases emitted by coal in de
 structive distillation.        This paper chiefly consisted of tables
 of the relative quantities of gas contained in coals, and of the
 tests and means of measuring their qualities and quantities.
      Mr. Home furnished the society with a sketch of the na
 tural historv of the trombac and caudivolva of New South
 Wales and Bass's Straits. The trombac was domesticated by
 him two years, is about two feet long and one thick, with
  round ears and        a head resembling a pig, and without a tail.
  It burrows      in the   earth and climbs trees ; it suffered itself to
  be nursed, and when it bit any thing it was without ill-na
  ture.      On dissection it was discovered to have two uteri.
  Mr. Bell,      a  surgeon in New Holland, dissected one in a
  pregnant state, aud found the uteri containing a gelatinous
  substance conveyed in two tubes, instead of a placenta. It
  is of the same genus (Didelphis)         as the American opossum
  and the kangaroo.

      At   the last meeting      of the Wernerian Natural History
   Society, (June 11,) Dr. Thomas Thomson, one of the vice-
   presidents, read a very interesting and valuable paper on the
                                                               chemical

 per on the Pinna ingens of Pennant. From his observations it
 appears, that the Pinna ingens of Montagu, Pinna borealis of
 Stewart, and Pinna ingens of the Linnaean Transactions, are
 the same species,      and identical with the Pinna ingens          of Pen
 nant. — At   the same meeting,        Charles Anderson,          esq.   read
 some observations on the geognosy          of  the island    of Inchkeith,
in the Frith of Forth. It appears from the interesting details
 which he communicated, that the whole island is composed
 of rocks belonging to the independent coal formation                  ; and
 that the green-stone which there occurs, is traversed by true
 veins filled with quartz, chalcedony, calcspar, &x. ; and also
 contains numerous contemporaneous veins of different kinds.
Mr. Anderson intimated his intention of laying before the
Society, at a future meeting, a more particular description
of the island, illustrated by drawings and a series of speci
mens.
          XV.   Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
                   CALCULUS IN THE BLADDER.
JYl. Vurzer,        a French    chemist, has published the follow
 ing analysis in support of Messrs. Fourcroy and Vauque-
lin's discovery of silex in urinary concretions * : '
    " I received the calculus, of which the following is the
analysis, from M. Michaelis, who extracted it by an opera
tion from a patient.
    " Physical Properties.     — It   was    nearly oval, but a little
compressed ; brown externally, and of a yellowish white in
ternally. It weighed exactly 870 grains ; its specific gravity
was 1-572 ; its surface was irregular and uneven.                  It was of
the consistence     of   hard  chalk,   was entirely without          a nu
cleus, and was composed of layers.
    " Chemical Examination. — 1. I macerated                 300 grains of
this concretion      (after having pulverised them) for two days
in distilled water, at a temperature of 12° (Reaumur).                      I
then filtered. The colourless liquor presented by the reagents

the following phaenomena : the nitrates of mercury and of
silver. — The muriate of baryles — the water ofbarytes — lime-
water — oxalic acid — potash and ammonia produced no pre
cipitate nor any sensible change.        It is clear, therefore, that
the distilled water employed contained none           of the  consti
tuent particles of this urinary concretion.
    "  The dried powder was of      the same weight as before.
    "  9. I  next treated  this powder with, muriatic acid, (the
specific gravity of which was l'ISt,) keeping the mixture
for two days at the temperature of 15° of Reaumur.               I af
terwards added distilled water. After having filtered the resi
due, when well dried it still weighed 2-18 grains, and was
of a reddish-brown colour.
    "  3. The filtered liquor precipitated by lime-water gave
a deposit     which, when collected and examined, was found
to be phosphate of lime : it weighed 52 grains.
    "  4. The 948 grains which remained after the second ex
periment were put into a solution of potash a little diluted,
and left for two days at a temperature of 18D of Reaumur.
I afterwards filtered ; and the liquor decomposed by the
acetous acid furnished a precipitate weighing 230 grains,
which, when examined with care, consisted of 226 grains
of uric acid distinctly characterized, and four grains of ani
mal matter.
    "  5. The weight of what remained upon the filter was 18
grains ; I heated it in a silver crucible until red-hot. During
 this operation, there was a very disagreeable fetid odour
disengaged, like that of burnt horns or hair.            The residue
 weighed     scarcely three grains.
    "  6. These three grains were not dissolved in the sulphuric,
 the nitric, or muriatic acids, even when heated successively
 with these acids to ebullition.
    "  7.  I  then mixed it with four parts of potash, and melt
 ed it in a suitable fire. The whole was dissolved in water, and
 I precipitated, by an excess of acid, pure silex.
    " This    substance has only been found twice in the urinary
 calculi   by Messrs. Fourcroy and Vauquelin, although they
 have analysed an immense number         of them. This induced      me
 to  recommence my labours with the 570 grains which I             had
                                                                   laid

no mistake had crept into my former analysis.

       From the above experiments it results that 300 grains
of the above calculus contained

widow of John Ching, late of Cheapside, apothecary, for
certain improvements in a medicine nowcalled Ching's worm-
destroying lozenges, for which her late husband obtained
letters patent bearing date the 28th  of June   1796.    May  7.
    To John Harriot, of Wapping, in      the county   of Middle

cases of fire.   May 10.
    To William Hunt, of the Brades, in the parish of Rowley
Regis, in the county of Stafford, iron-master, for a method
of rolling moulds, or plates of trowels, from pieces of either
blister, sheer or cast steel, of a square, or nearly square, or
oblong form.      May 10.
    To John Watson, late of Bury-Place, Bloomsbury, gent.
for certain improvements in the art of soap-making, by
which the article is in several respects ameliorated. May 10.
    To Chester Gould, of Old-Street, gent., for certain im
 provements in the construction of a machine for washing
or cleansing linen and various other articles. May 17.
    To William Congreve, of Garden-Court, Temple, esq.,
for a gun-carriage of the simplest construction, either for
land or sea service, calculated    to reduce very considerably
 the labour   of working the guns, to produce a smooth and
 even recoil, and to prevent the violent action that takes
 place in common carriages when the gun is fired. At the' same
 time, the carriage is of much lighter and less expensive con
 struction, and less liable to be struck and splintered by the
 enemy's shot, as presenting much less surface when applied
 to the sea service : it allows moreover of a very considerable
 reduction in the size of the port.   May 24.
    To John Stedman, of Horton Kirby, in the county of
 Kent, farmer, for a patten and clog, of infinite utility and
 ease to such persons who may wear them.         May 24.

 ANALYSIS OF THE SPRING CALLED THE CHA-
              LYBEATE WEAK SALINE WELL..
          I. Physical Characters of the Water.
 J. he   taste   of this water is slightly saline and soft.        It is
 perfectly limpid, and destitute of smell. It sends forth         a few
air-buhhles,     but not in any remarkable quantity.          Its tem
perature    was 54° Fahr. ; the surrounding        air being 80°, and
the barometrical pressure      29' 7.   Its specific weight at that
temperature     was as 28<)*4 to   289.     The spring which fur
nishes this water rises in the area on the east side of Hygeia
House. Its bed is a stiff blue clay, abounding with extra
neous fossils, chiefly of the bivalve kind, wholly converted
into clay.     The depth of this well is 36 feet. It yields 150
gallons    of water  in 24 hours.
               II. Examination ry Re-agents.
    Experiment     I.— Tincture of    cabbage    is reddened    by this
water.
   Experiment II.— Tincture        of galls produced no effect. A
slice of a nut gall suspmded        in the    wat^r    highly concen
trated and previouslv mingled with a        few drops of nitric acid,
occasioned a purplish hue.
   Experiment III. — Succinate of ammonia and prussiate of
potash when applied in a similar manner occasioned a pre
cipitate.     Water that had been boiled and suffered to stand
undisturbed and then decanted, when treated with the same
tests remained unaltered.       •
   Experiment     IV. — Lime-water      mingled with this water in
equal quantities became      cloudy j muriatic acid rendered the
mixture transparent.

   82             Analysis of the lately     discovered
      Experiment V. — Sulphate, acetate and nitrate ofbarytes
   occasioned a milky precipitate both in the fresh and in the
   boiled water.
      Experiment VI. —A crystal of muriate of barytes, or ni
  trate of strontia, rendered the water cloudy.            The admix
  ture of muriatic acid had no effect.
     Experiment    VII. —Acetate     and nitrate   of lead produced      a
  cloudiness.
     Experiment   VIII. — Sulphate,      nitrate and acetate     of silver
  effected a white   precipitate.     The   same    effect  ensued, al
  though a few drops of sulphuric,         nitric, or acetic acid      had
  been added.
     Experiment IX. — Phosphate of soda assisted by carbonate
  of ammonia when added to a portion of the water highly
  Concentrated, did not occasion a precipitate.
     Experiment X. — 231 cubic inches of the water                of the
  Weak Chalybeate       Saline    Well boiled down         to five cubic
  inches after being mingled        with muriatic acid, yielded a
 brown flocculent   preci pi tate when poured into     liquid ammonia.
     Experiment    XI. — Solution of    soap in water becomes de
 composed by this water.
     Experiment XII. — Oxalate       of ammonia and filiate of soda
 occasioned an abundant precipitate.
     Reasoning on these preliminary experiments,            which were
 undertaken at -the fountain head, we are led to believe that
 this medicinal water contains carbonate of iron, salts with
 earthy bases and with muriatic and sulphuric acids.
     The gaseous contents of the water of this spring                col
 lected and separated in the       usual manner,     amounted in one
 gallon to
             7£ cubic inches carbonic acid gas, and
            4£                   atmospheric air.
                            ANALYSIS.
     Experiment I. — One thousand eight hundred and forty-
eight cubic inches of the water of the Chalybeate Weak Sa
line Well evaporated to one half were suffered to cool,
filtered, and the insoluble part collected.
                                                           Experiment

                 Mineral Waters at Cheltenham.                   83
   Experiment II.— The powder thus separated by evapora
tion  was dissolved in muriatic acid.      The usual tests, viz.
fluate of soda, oxalate of potash, and succinate of ammonia,
showed that it contained lime and iron.       Phosphate of soda
with carbonate of ammonia proved that it was free from
magnesia. The solution was therefore evaporated to dryness,
and the residue redissolved in dilute nitric acid.
   Experiment     III. —Into    the nitric solution      previously
highly concentrated by evaporation, liquid ammonia was
poured.     The precipitate being collected was redissolved in
muriatic acid, and the obtained solution decomposed by suc
cinate of soda.     The succinate of iron being redissolved in
muriatic acid, the solution was decomposed by carbonate
of potash.     The obtained carbonate of iron weighed .four
grains ;  which give9 half a grain of carbonate of iron to each
gallon   of the water.
   Experiment IV. — Into the muriatic solution, highly con
centrated, sulphuric acid was dropt, and the whole evapo
rated nearly to dryness ; the mass being softened with water
and the sulphate of lime c    >llected. The product, taking 100
grains to be equal to 70      of carbonate of lime, proved that
1848 cubic inches of this water contained          24 '-
                                                         grains of
carbonate of lime ; which gives to each gallon of the water
3-tV of a grain of that salt.
   Experiment V. —The fluid from which these salts had
been obtained (Exper. I.) was evaporated         to perfect dry
ness, reduced to an impalpable powder in a warm mortar,
and digested repeatedly in alcohol.
   Experiment VI. —The alcoholic solution diluted with a
small portion ofwater became turbid by sulphate of silver
and oxalate of ammonia; but phosphate of soda with carbo
nate of ammonia effected no change when added to it.              It
was therefore evaporated to dryness, and yielded four grains
of muriate of lime ; which gives half a grain of this salt to
each gallon of water.
   Experiment    V IK —The    mass left from  the   alcoholic   so
lution (Exper. V.) was repeatedly digested in small quanti
ties of cold water, till the fluid that had been suffered to be
                                  F  2                           in

 64              Analysis of the lately discovered
in contact with it for six hours did not disturb the solutions
 of sulphate of silver, nitrate of barytes, and other tests. On
 evaporating this fluid, muriate of soda was obtained, which
gave J 6$ grains to each gallon     of the water.
    Experiment VIII.— The fluid freed from muriate of soda
became turbid by phosphate of soda and carbonate of am
monia, by muriate of barytes, but not by muriate of platina.
It  was concentrated and decomposed by sub-carbonate of
soda;- the carbonate of magnesia was dissolved in sulphuric
acid, and the sulphuric solution, when highly concentrated,
was mingled with alcohol.        The sulphate of magnesia thus
obtained weighed 40 grains.
   Experiment     IX. — On   examining the solution it was found
that sulphate of silver -occasioned a precipitate.        This salt
was therefore added.      The precipitate produced by means
of it weighed \5\ grains, which are equal to six grains of
muriate of soda, that must have escaped the process of cry
stallization before mentioned.       This portion of salt added to
that obtained already gives 16^ to each gallon of the water.
   To facilitate  the conclusion   of the analysis, the residue of
23 1 cubic inches    of  water of the Chalybeate Weak Saline
Well obtained by evaporation, being previously digested in
alcohol,   was repeatedly   digested  in small quantities of cold
water till this fluid dissolved no more.        Into this solution
muriate of barytes wasdropt, till it produced no further cloudi
ness. The precipitate being collected and weighed, and the
sulphuric acid deducted     which    belonged to the sulphate of
magnesia,    taking   100 to be equal    to 52-11 of sulphate of
magnesia, there remained eight grains of sulphate of barytes
originating from the decomposed sulphate of soda ; which
are equal to 5f- of that salt.
   Over the insoluble residue left a large quantity     of boiling
water being poured which dissolved the whole — Muriate of
barytes produced 105 grains of sulphate of barytes, indica
ting 72 of sulphate of lime; which indicate nine grains of
this salt in each gallon of the water.

   ANALYSIS OF THE STRONG SULPHURETTED
                          SALINE WELL.
  Situation of the Spring, and Physical Properties
                           op the Water.
   The spring called the Strong Sulphuretted                    Saline    Well
is situated   about 90 feet        distance from the last described
spring.     The water of this well          has a strong odour,        resem
bling sulphuretted hydrogen          gas.      Its taste is saline.    It is as
transparent    as  rock    crystal, and perfectly colourless.               Its
temperature was 51°-7 at 29 barometrical pressure; the

   Experiment    II.— Tincture of turmeric    suffers no change.
   Experiment I I. — Silver leaf acquired a slight iridescent
tarnish, after having been immersed in this water for three
da\ s ; the boiled sulphuretted water did not affect the lustre
of this metal.
   Experiment IV. — Quicksilver exposed to the action of
this water retained its brilliancy, but being suspended in a
muslin hag in the covered reservoir of the well, it acquired a
tarnish within 24 hours.
   Experiment V — -Bismuth, disposed in alike manner, lost
its lustre, and became brown.
   Experiment VI. — White oxide of bismuth, fresh prepared,
and still moist, diffused through the sulphuretted water be
came black in    12  hours.
   Experiment    VII.—Arsenious      acid and muriate     of arsenic
suffered no change.
   Experiment VIII.— Acetate of silver, of the usual strength,
yielded a white precipitate, but when diluted it produced
an orange-coloured cloud.
   Experiment IX. — Crystals of acetate of copper became
black, after having been covered by the water for a few
minutes.
   Experiment X. —-Paper moistened with nitrate of mercury
acquired a brown colour when kept immersed for three,
hours in the water.
   Experiment XI. — Succinate      of ammonia, prussiate of pot
ash, gallic acid, and tincture      of galls. Neither of these
re-agents produced a change in the fresh water, or in such
as had been concentrated by evaporation.
   Experiment    XII. — Lime water produced a cloudiness.
   Experiment    XIII. — Crystallized hydrate of haryles and
hydrate of strontia occasioned much          precipitate, both in
the water at the fountain head, and in such as had been con

     Experiment XVI. — Acetate and nitrate          of lea d produced
 the same effect.
     Experiment      XVII. — Concentrated szdphuric and nitrous
 acid, added in large quantities to the water taken fresh
 from the pump, caused a copious disengagement of air-bub
 bles. The same acids mingled with water highly concen
 trated by boiling, occasioned the development of a sulphu
 reous odour.                                                           .,

   super-natant    fluid  being  decanted,  the powder separated by
   the filter, and washed by the affusion of small portions of
   distilled water, was suffered to dry spontaneously.
       Experiment XXIII. — The decanted fluid, together with
    the water employed for washing the powder, being again
    concentrated to 50 cubic inches, a pulverulent precipitate
    ensued ; it was made to subside by the admixture of alcohol
    collected,  dried, and added to that obtained in Experiment

part, separated by the filter, had a crystalline appearance.
The muriatic solution became turlnd by the admixture of
fluate of soda, by oxalate of ammonia,                     and by other tests,
indicating the presence of lime.
   Experiment XXV. —The substance which resisted the
action of muriatic acid in the preceding process, was com
pletely soluble by ebullition in 600 times its quantity of
water, the solution was decomposable by oxalate of ammonia,
by fluate of soda, and by barytic water.
  Experiment XXVI . — To learn whether the lime detected,
was present in the water in combination with carbonic acid,
or with sulphuretted hydrogen, a narrow.mouthed jar con-
taining a determinate bulk of the sulphuretted saline water,
and furnished with a crooked glass tube, terminating under
a cylinder       filled    with lime water, was gradually                made     to
boil,   the     lime-water      became        turbid,    and a copious precipi
tate    appeared.         The obtained     precipitate effervesced with
muriatic acid, emitting            at the same   time a strong odour of
sulphuretted hydrogen gas.              The solution diluted with water
occasioned a brown precipitate when mingled with nitrate                          of
bismuth or nitrate of silver.

it turbid.   From these preliminary inquiries      became evi     it
dent. that both carbonate and hydro-sulphuret of lime exist
in the water, the first and part of the latter being precipi
tated     the action of lime water, though
         by                                      considerable     a
portion of the hydro-sulphuret remained  solution   hence    in           :
lime water could not be employed to separate the rarbonic
acid from the sulphuretted hydrogen gas contained in the
sulphuretted saline water           of Cheltenham.

    Experiment      XXVI II. —To      ascertain the respective pro
portions of these gases contained in a given bulk of water,
924 cubic inches or the sulphuretted water taken fresh from
the spring head, were introduced in ajar, connected with a
Woulf's apparatus in          the ordinary   manner;      the first   of the
three necked bottles of the apparatus was filled with a solu
tion of acetate of lead ; rendered acidulous by the addition of
acetic acid ; the second contained lime water                On applying
heat to the water in the jar, a precipitate was soon deposited
in both the bottles : the solution of acetate of lead acquired
a velvet black colour; and the lime water in the second bot
tle became milky.         The sulphuretted hydrogen gas was thus
made to combine with the oxide of lead ; and the carbonic
acid being prevented       from forming a carbonate of lead on ac
count of the excess       of acetic acid, it passed through the me
tallic solution unaltered, and united with the dissolved lime
in   the second bottle.       Thus both      gases   were    distinctly ar
rested by different agents, and in different vessels.              To    ren
 der this experiment as conclusive as possible, like quantities
 of sulphuretted water were treated jn the same manner, with
 the exception of substituting only one Woulf 's bottle instead
 of two in the arrangement of the apparatus, the bottle con
taining acetite of lead with excess of acid, and 'ime water
 alternately. T\m production of hydro-sulphuret of lead, and
 carbonate of lime was uniformly the same with variations not
 amounting       to the T-J-jdth part of   a grain.    924 cubic inches
 of  the sulphuretted water treated in this manner,              yielded 78
 grains    of hydro-sulphurct      of lead, which     are equal (accord
 ing   to  Westrumb) to 40 cubic inches of sulphuretted hy
 drogen gas*.         The carbonate of lime obtained from 231
 cubic inches of water, calculated in the usual manner, indi-
  cated.7 -fe cubic inches of carbonic acid gas. One gallon of
  the sulphuretted saline water therefore contains

    Experiment    XXIX. — 1848 cubic        inches of sulphuretted
 saline water having been slowly evaporated, yielded a grayish
white powder, which, when dried over a lamp in a sand
bath, at a heat of 225° Fahrv exhaled a peculiar fetid sul
phureous odour.
    Experiment XXX. —This powder was levigated with al
cohol, and digested in that fluid for four days. The alco
holic solution, when filtered, was of a pale amber colour : on
being evaporated     to dryness, and redissolved in water,     it de
posited a pearl-coloured powder, which effervesced              with
muriatic acid, and diffused a smell of sulphuretted hydrogen
gas. The quantity of this powder obtained not being accu
rately appreciable, on account of portions of it having been
employed     for various experiments,        1848   cubic inches   of
water were again evaporated       to dryness ; the residue obtained
was treated     with   alcohol as before, and the insoluble part
put aside. The product weighed 262 grains. The repeated ap
plication and abstraction of nitric acid converted it into sul
phate of lime, which, together with the development of
the sulphuretted hydrogen gas, which it emitted on the affu
sion of acids as stated before, proved it to be hydro-sul-
phuret of lime, of which 32^ grains are contained in 231
cubic inches, or one gallon of this water.
   Experiment XXXI. — Into the fluid freed from the hydro-
sulphuret of lime, fresh prepared lime water was suffered to
fall till no more cloudiness ensued : muriate of magnesia had
therefore been dissolved by the alcohol. The obtained mag
nesia weighed 58 grains after having been slightly heated ,
which gives 29 grains of muriate of magnesia to 231 cubic
inches of the sulphuretted saline water.
    Experiment XXXII. —The liquid left in the last process
was concentrated to dryness in a glass capsule, and redis
solved in as little water as possible.         On pouring into this
concentrated fluid a solution of neutral carbonate of am
monia, a precipitate ensued, which being dried, weighed
 189 grains.    Heuce 24£ grains of muriate of lime are con
tained in 231 cubic inches of the water, deducting the lime
                                                              which

-experiment.
    Experiment XXXIII. —The residue which had resisted
the action of highly rectified alcohol (Experiment XXX.)
 was transferred into a flask, containing a mixture composed
of one part ot alcohol and three of water, digested for six
hours,     filtered, and evaporated to dryness.
    Experiment XXXIV. — Upon the dry mass four parts of
 cold water were affused, and suffered to stand for two days ;
 which dissolved         the whole, except four grains which were
 found to be sulphate of lime ; this was added to the inso-
Juble residue left in Experiment XXXIII.
     Experiment      XXXV. —The          watery solution obtained in
 the preceding       experiment     became milky by lime water : it
 was therefore concentrated          by evaporation as much as pos<-
 sible, and then decomposed whilst boiling hot, by a solution
 of carbonate of ammonia. The precipitated magnesia weighed
 764 grains,       which are equal to 31 72 grains of sulphate of
 magnesia;       of which salt 48-j- grains exist therefore in S3 1
 cubic inches of the sulphuretted water.
     Experiment XXXVI. —The fluid left in the last process
 having been again concentrated, was mingled with nitric
 acid in excess, and then decomposed by a solution of ni
 trate of barytes : the precipitate (taking 170 grains of sul
 phate    of   barytes    to be equal    to 100   of sulphate of soda,)
 proved that      53 grains    of sulphate of     soda    were  present in
  S31 cubic inches        of the sulphuretted Water     ; allowance being
 made for that portion of sulphuric            acid which belonged to
  the sulphate of magnesia decomposed in Experiment XXXV.
     Experiment XXXVII. — Into the fluid freed thus from all
  the salts, with a base        of sulphuric    acid, sulphate of silver
  was dropped, till no further cloudiness ensued : the obtained
  precipitate being weighed, indicated the presence of 133^
  grains   of muriate of      soda in 231 cubic inches of the water;
  taking 235     of muriate of silver to be equal to 100 of muriate
  pf  soda.
     Experiment      XXXVIII.-— The insoluble         residue of Experi
  ment     XXXIII       was   repeatedly   boiled  in  large quantities of
  distilled water, until this fluid ceased to become turbid by
                                                                   hydrate

 hydrate of barytes : the solution being evaporated to dryness,
 indicated (with that obtained in Experiment XXXIV.) 66-b
 grains of sulphate of lime in 231 cubic inches of the water.
    Experiment XXXIX. — The residue left in the preceding
process was lastly digested in nitro-muriatic acid, com
posed of equal parts of nitric and muriatic acids evaporated
nearly to dryness, and re-dissolved in the least possible
quantity of water : the fluid did not yield a precipitate            by
liquid ammonia, nor by succinate of soda, or tincture                 of
galls ;  lime water rendered it turbid,       and fluate of soda pro
duced much cloudiness.
    Experiment XL. — To effect the decomposition of this so
lution, it was evaporated to dryness, and the dry mass redis-
solved in the least possible quantity of water previously min
gled with one part of alcohol. Into this fluid, when heated,
a mixture of equal parts by bulk, of sulphuric acid and al
cohol, was poured, till it produced no further cloudiness.
The sulphate of lime obtained proved that 18 grains of car
bonate of lime were present in 231 cubic inches of water;
taking 100 grains     of the precipitate        to  be equal to 64   of
carbonate of lime.
   Experiment    XLI. —The    fluid separated by the filter, being
again evaporated to dryness and redissolved in distilled wa
ter, was made boiling hot, and then mingled with a solution
of sub-carbonate of potash. The sub-carbonate of magnesia
produced, indicated 5- 75 grains of this substance to be pre
sent in 231 cubic inches of water.

                           IFeight of Malt.
Oeveral      erroneous opinions are delivered in the evidence
given    before   the committee respecting the goodness of
malt being determined by its weight.                  Abstractedly con
sidered, weight indeed          does     not   afford    any certain data
for estimating the worth of malt,           because      bad malt may be
either heavier or lighter than that which is good.                If the ve
getation  of  the  grain  has   been    imperfect,     or  not  carried    suf
ficiently far, the product will be part malt and part barley,
and of course heavier than good malt: but if on the other
hand the vegetation has been carried too far, too much of
the substance, and of course weight, of the grain will have
been driven out, and the malt will be light in proportion as
the injuring cause has been allowed to operate : in this way
malt may be rendered light and unproductive to any extent
at the discretion of the maltster.
    But notwithstanding       all this, in every instance where the
grain has been      perfectly malted, weight is the only certain
standard now known for determining the value of malt; and
 this is now so well understood in the markets, that it is not
 unusual for the buyer of malt to be provided with a pair of
 scales and a small measure, and to govern his opinion of
 the price by the weight which his measure of the sample
 yields.   In all malt, therefore, which has been perfectly
 malted, there can be no question of the heaviest being the
                                                                          best,

  best, and in this respect    the Hertfordshire     malt   preserves a
  distinguished superiority over all watered malt.
                          Varieties   of Malt.
     Strictly speaking, there are only three varieties of malt,
 viz. brown, amber, and pale malt. The first two are pe
 culiar to porter, and have special reference to its flavour and
 colour; the third    is the general basis as well of all porter as
 of every other species of malt liquor; and it is the only one
 which merits any consideration in the general question of
 malting. Brown malt receives all its peculiar qualities in
 the kiln, by an operation called blowing : it is spread there
very thin, and a very quick and active heat is passed through
 it from naming faggots : the sudden application of the heat
converts the moisture in the grain into vapour, which blows
up the husk, and the heat catching it in its distended state
hardens and prevents it from collapsing ; hence the grains
 of such malt are large and hollow, and increase the. measure
from one to two bushels in        a.  quarter.    The saccharine of
this malt is nearly all destroyed by the        operation of the fire,
and its sole object in porter is to communicate flavour and
colour ; but as these qualities are probably ta be obtained
from other materials than malt, some porter-brewers are not
using it at all, and the making of it is very rapidly declining.
Amber malt is a species between brown and pale, and is also
made on the     kiln by giving it    less fire than the  former,   and
more than the latter ; it is still generally used in porter along
with    pale mail, but the quantity made is inconsiderable.
    As bad flavour in malt subtracts from its value, and the
charge    of producing   was  strongly shifted by the watering
party from themselves to the Hertfordshire maltsters, the
present portion of the subject is material in the inquiry ; and
from what has been said it may be readily understood that
flavouring, when applied to the working floors, can only
mean manufacturing the different steepings there as sweet
and clean    as possible, and thereby not giving but guarding
against any peculiar flavour.

                             On Malting.                              Q&
the watering party have set up a very material distinction
between what they call heavy and light land barleys, and
they appear to have laid much stress on this distinction, and
to have considered it as one of the chief supports of their
case   :   to me, however, it seems no other than one            of those
artful subterfuges so commonly resorted to by artful and in
terested traders in revenue questions, merely to obscure and
disguise the true state of the matter at issue.
   On all the numerous gradations of soil, from the lightest
down to clay itself, barleys are produced, varying in every
degree, chiefly as to colour and thickness of skin; but
this variety is not, as is attempted to be set up, a local cir
cumstance.      It abounds every where, because light and
heavy soils do every where abound ; and it is only to the ex
tremes, and not to the multitude of intermediate gradations,
that any thing advanced before the committee can fairly be
referred.  Certainly to mix the very coarsest with the very
finest barleys in the same cistern would be improper; but
each sort can be well malted separately without any aid from
watering on the floors, which is in no respect more necessary
for what is called the heavy than it is for the light land corn.
   The several witnesses who have spoken to the case have
advanced   that more water is required for the coarse than the
fine skinned grain, but the fact is probably the contrary.
The thin skinned barley, being the largest and plumpest
corn, will certainly require the most water for its vegeta
tion, but on account of its more pervious husk, it           will sooner
imbibe its proportion of the fluid.    Hence it is           that thick
skinned grain does not actually require a larger             proportion
of water but only of time in the cistern to absorb           its propor
tion;      and having accomplished that, it is equally, and perhaps
better, fitted      for going through the subsequent process of
malting without        a further supply, as its thick husk is more
likely     to retain the moisture which it has got.
   If, however,       the reason   of   the thing   did not sufficiently
prove      it,
          the testimony of Messrs. Clough and King fully
establishes that better malt can be made from coarse barleys
without      than   with watering upon the floors      ;   and   in every
                                                                    place

  place where I have been, except giving the thick skinned
  com a few hours more of time in the cistern, no further at
  tention is pad      as to  treating them differently from others.
     It   has    long   been a pretty generally received opinion
 amongst        farmers   and others, that barleys grown on heavy
 lands contain a larger proportion of earthy matter than those
 produced .rom light lands; but from the chemical analysis
 of both kinds it has been found that there is no truth in this
 opinion,      and that the      proportion of calcareous and other
 earths is the same in light as in heavy land barley, and that
 the real difference between the two lies merely in the husk:
 all therefore that we are authorised to conclude on the sub
ject is, that in equal weights or measures, the coarser skin
 ned erain contains a large          proportion of waste, and on that
 account only is less proper for the purpose of malting.
    There is another distinction of barleys which the agents
 of the watering party         have advanced in support of their case,
 and    that  is,  that though the large fine barlevs of Hertford
 shire and in the southern parts of the kingdom are malted,
 without watering upon the floors, yet that the inferior corn
 more northwards does require and cannot be malted without
sprinkling: no« I am well convinced the case is directly
 contrary to their statement. It is a well-known fact that the
thinner,      lighter,   and more inferior the barleys are, the more
 api are thev to run themselves          out in   a  too quick vegetation ;
 and having of themselves but             little substance, the less of it
can be paned with in the process of malting ; whereas the
 larg* fine plump barleys of Hertfordshire both require more
 waitr to malt them, and could much better admit a portion
of their substance to            be  wasted     in the process ; and such
barleys actually having a           less aptitude to run out in vegeta
ting, they would require and would stand watering much
better than the others: the conclusion therefore is just, and
 the fact really is, that as the finest barleys in the kingdom
 are actually best malted by not being watered               on the floors,
so the inferior kinds would be benefited               in a higher propor
tion by being restricted         to the same process, for      which they
are naturally better adapted.

                Frauds    of Watering on the Floors.
   There are   no frauds of any extent practicable        at a  malt-
house except those which are immediately connected with
and entirely depend on the practice of watering on the floors.
These last are three in number, viz. draining the cistern
before the time prescribed by law, in order to keep down the
gauges in    the couch ; wholly emptying the cistern to be
fraudulently worked as a distinct floor ; and privately plun
dering the cistern of parts of the corn in order to be mixed
with the youngest floor; as the grain in each of these frauds
is short wet in the cistern, it would be impracticable to
carry it forward in a sufficiently malted state to the kiln
without watering it upon the floors.         Of the first I shall say
nothing, as it explains itself. Instances of both the others         I
have myself detected ; and what is more, an instance of the
second was in     a  foot walk, and had been practised to a great
extent.    But it is in rides where it can be pursued almost
with impunity,      from   the officer's visits at the malt-house
being only two or three times a week, and I am inclined to
believe that it is followed in such situations to a degree much
beyond what has yet been discovered or even suspected. It
requires indeed the use of a large kiln ; and where that has
been provided it is only necessary      to get the oldest floor'there
immediately before the cistern is fraudulently emptied : and
though it must, like every other fraud, at particular stages
of its practice, afford indication of what is doing to a vigi
lant and intelligent officer ; yet, for the most part, an officer
may survey in the usual manner for a length of time without
observing any thing to call forth his suspicions. I can even
readily believe that a cautious and artful malt3ter may defraud
the revenue of half the duty which he ought to pay, by means
of this fraud, and yet incur in the practice of it but very little
risk,  provided he is indulged     with watering     the  short wel
corn on the floors.
   The third fraud of robbing (or as it is called in trade geld
ing) the cistern, and mixing the plundered corn with the
youngest floor, certainly has been, and there is reason to
fear it is yet, practised to a most injurious degree, as the
present restriction against watering on the floors does not

 extend to   period sufficiently late to exclude its practica
                 a
 bility, and which indeed may be equally said of the pre
 ceding fraud. The one, however, of which I am now
 speaking is too well known at the board, from the numerous
 detections which have been made of                              it,   to require any par
 ticular description or comment from me.
                  Present Restriction against Sprinkling.
      When       the       present    restriction         against watering on the
 floors was           established,     a    very    material    circumstance, inti
 mately connected with                it,
                            was probably   some degree over        in
 looked, or at least not sufficiently advened to. This cir
 cumstance           is,
               that in every instance where short wet corn
isfraudulently laid upon the floors, does not take the true it
age when     was actually removed out of the cistern, but
                 it                                                                           a
false age    of      the same date          of
                                   preceding steeping. This
                                                 the
arises from its being either mixed with and of course be
coming part of the youngest floor, or taking its place in the
officer's account, and passing for   through all the subse
                                                       it
quent stages of malting. The regulation of this false age                                     is
very much within the power of the fraudulent maltster; for,
as he        when he pleases, he can determine the day
          steeps
and hour when he will empty privately the cistern, and he
can keep back the youngest floor from growing    spreading                        by
it   very thin.            In this way       three     days       of    false     age   can'be
readily gained, and              such corn   will come    course         in              to be
watered      on       the    seventh, instead of the tenth day,                         as   in
tended     by    the restriction       :    but had the maltster
                                                   discretional               a
power of watering, he would not do      sootier than about the

sixth day: hence the present restriction against watering, as
far as regards fraud, cannot be considered as, gyrating to
any very useful purpose;                   and     even     in    cases where no fraud
is   practised       its operation     is   very feeble indeed, and the great
extent to which watering                   upon the floors     still followed,
                                                                        is
sufficiently proves the inutility of the present restricted period.
   The former restriction of twelve days was much more effec
tual, as short wet corn could not be worked up to that period,
even with the false age already spoken of, without watering
it; and     by   watering       it   illegally, the penalty for doing so was
                                                                         not

 not only risked, but, what is much more, great hazard was
 incurred of disclosing the fraud itself, the very circumstance
 of watering being matter of suspicion sufficient to direct
 specially the officer's attention to the state and condition of
 the particular steeping    which he found illegally watered.
    The restriction of twelve days also took away from the
 interested    maltster the mischievous means of wasting the
 substance of the corn, by throwing out too much vegetation,
and making that light unproductive malt which actually is
 at tlris time so abundant in the market.         I would therefore
 humbly submit it as a matter of much importance, and as a
case resting upon grounds       which   cannot fairly be contro
verted, that the revenue on malt can only be protected from
very    extensive depredation, and the quality of the com
modity manufactured in the greater part of the kingdom
 preserved from a most improvident waste, by the restriction
against watering the grain upon the floors being extended
from its present period of nine to its former of twelve days.
    What     has hitherto been stated in  this report is the result
of my own previous experience and knowledge in the survey
and manufacture of malt; but I have now to detail the va
rious practical      facts and  circumstances' collected      on my
 journey through many of         the most    considerable malting
places, and from which I am but just returned.
    My first progress was into Hertfordshire, and into the
north-eastern       and western directions from London, where
the practice     of malting prevails without watering upon the
floors.     I visited 115 different malt-houses of this descrip
tion, all in full work. The periods of steeping were generally
twice a week, and the time of keeping the corn under water
varied from 48 to 56 hours.        This period was shorter than
had usually been employed, owing to the barleys          of  the last
year being lighter and thinner than in former years, from a
want of rain at a particular period of the crop.        As the bar
leys, however, were hardening by longer keeping, they
would take more water in the cistern.
    In my inspection of the numerous makings, I paid every
attention to the state of the corn in its progress through every
stage.     The   same process uniformly   prevailed  at all, and the

only discoverable difference was readily to be traced in the
conduct of the workmen ; for where the most industrious
and     steady      men         were    employed,         the corn was           in   the best
condition; but the management                  and object of the process
were at every individual              house the same.
  The       system        of   malting pursued through this part of the
country is simple and obvious,                       and contains            nothing of se
crecy or difficulty that can form an obstacle                               to its adoption
in any other pan of the kingdom.      It consists, in the first
instance, in giving the corn a due proportion of water in
the cistern, according to its condition. The thinner and
lighter the grain              is,
                     the shorter its period of steeping and
                                                     is                                 :
the larger, drier, and bolder the barley is, the longer                                        it
continued under water.     When thrown out of the cistern                                   it is
remains in the couch from 26 to 30 hours, and
                                                                                it
                                                                                is      kept   a
day longer at          a   depth of from J0 to 16 inches, varying with
the state      of   the    weather. In this situation    very moderate a
rise of     temperature              comes on,       which
                                        carefully watched,      is
and checked            by
               turning the grain.   By the fourth day the
root has come freely out, and the corn    spread abroad in        is
the floor very thin.     At this time its temperature   very                          is
little above that of the air              in
                              the malt-house, and the steep

riod   is   laid   a   little deeper,     and        so   gradually increased           up to
the    kiln.       The completion of             the process         is   judged of     by

and in an evident state of healthy vegetation ; and in some
instances where the grain had been some time on the kiln,
the quantity of moisture, which was flying off in a thick
dense vapour,'     afforded   satisfactory    testimony,     that barley,
when    properly     treated   through the      working     process, can
carry along with it      a sufficiency    of the cistern    water for all
the necessary     purposes   of malting.
    So very evident indeed was this, that it would only have
been requisite to allow the oldest floors to have lain for a
proper time undisturbed, in order to their springing up into
a  thick  green bed     of living plants.       I was especially atten
tive to this circumstance,        and   can  now confidently declare,
that the statement of       Mr.  Reynoldson before the committee,
wherein he affirms, in such express terms, that the putre
factive fermentation formed a part of the Ware process of
malting, has, in fact, no foundation whatsoever.
    I conversed with a gentleman who examined the same
three floors on the following day after Mr. Reynoldson's
inspection of them, and who declared, that though the corn
was not in good condition, owing to the warm state of the
weather, and advanced season, (they were the last stccpings,)
yet that the vegetation was completely alive on all of the
floors, and     that   there  did not exist   a  single fact or circum
 stance  in  the case,    which    could authorise the strange ac
 count given of them.         All   the maltsters also with whom I
 conversed on the subject, ridiculed the notion that putrescence
 could have any share in their process, and expressed their
 surprise, that so wild an opinion could have been advanced
 or encouraged     by any one.
    Most of    the malt-houses consist       of   a  ranije   of building
 three  stories in    height, of which the two uppermost are
 commonly      boarded,    and the lower one plaster. Each steep
 ing is divided into three parts, and worked on a separate
 floor.   The   boards   are warmer than the         plaster, but being
                                      G  3                        higher,

higher,    the grain is situated      cooler on them.          This, how
 ever, contrary to what is stated against it in the evidence by
 the watering party, produced no             irregularity in the vegeta
tion, for   the corn situated the coolest is worked the deepest ;
and in this way, the workmen,              from practice, can keep the
pieces very nearly at the same temperature.                 I paid particu
lar regard 'to this fact, and being provided with a thermo
meter, it enabled me to determine it very exactly.
    The malting rooms were kept remarkably open and airy,
by throwing all the doors and windows open, and allowing
the wind freely 10 blow over the corn.                 In several houses,
even flocks     of sparrows      were    feeding upon the floors, and
so tamely as to show that they were familiar with the place,
and visited it without interruption,            I was already well aware
of  the great importance       of fresh air in malting, but did not
imagine that it could be so freely admitted in the process
where watering upon the floors was not practised, without
inducing a too great expenditure of the cistern water by
evaporation.

Hermbstadt,      and   Westrumb,          appears     to   have    been   dis
covered by Scheele ; but it is           to   Bergman       that we are in
 debted for the first account of        its properties.       He published
his dissertation on it in 1776,         and since that time very little
lias been added to the facts contained in his valuable treatise.
 Chemists have chiefly directed their attention to the forma
tion of   that acid, and much curious and important informa

properties    of   the .acid    itself   have     been   rather neglected.

the result of a set of experiments, undertaken with the view
of ascertaining different particulars respecting     which                       it,              I
conceived to be of importance.
                      I.    Water       of   Crystallization.
  Oxalic acid     usually obtained in transparent prismatic
                     is
crystals more or less regular these crystals contain
                                            ;        portion                       a
of water, for when moderately heated they effloresce and
lose   a   part   of their weight, which they afterwards                                 recover
when left exposed           inmoist place. When cautiously
                                 a                                                       heated
on asand bath they               fall to powder, and lose about                          a   third
of their weight.           But     as the acid   itself volatile,
                                                          is                           it   is   not
probable that the whole of this loss  water. To ascertain      is
the quantity of water contained in these crystals had re                           1
course to the following method                    :
   1.  Seventy 'grains of crystallized oxalic acid were dis
solved     600 grains of water, constituting
           in                                 solution which           a
weighed 670 grains.
   Fifty grains of         pure carbonate             of lime, in        the state       of cal
careous spar,        were dissolved in- muriatic acid;                        this solution             -
was evaporated        to dryness t« get                rid of the excess of acid,
and the residue redissolved in water.
   Into this muriate of lime                    the   solution        of oxalic acid             was
dropt by little and little as long as any precipitate fell, and
the oxalate of lime thus formed was separated        the filter.              by
Pure oxalic acid      not capable of precipitating the whole
                           is
lime from         solution      of muriate of lime,                   the    muriatic            acid
evolved      being always sufficient to retain the last portions in
solution.
   It   was necessary           to    get   rid of this excess               of    acid     ;     the
method which appeared the least exceptionable was to sa'u-
rate the muriatic acid with ammonia: accordingly, when the
oxalic acid ceased to occasion any further precipitate,                                           I
 cautiously        added     pure      ammonia,           till      the liquid         ceased      to
 produce any effect upon vegetable                        blues.
                                                 copious addi           A
 tional precipitate of oxalaie of lime was thus obtained. Ox
 alic acid was now added again as long as          rendered the             it
 liquid muddy.             By thus alternately having                      recourse         to    the
                                                 G    4                                          acid

acid solution,       and to ammonia,          and by adding both with
 great caution to avoid any excess, I succeeded in separating
 the whole of the lime without using any sensible excess of
 oxalic acid.
     558 grains    of the acid solution        were employed, a quantity
 which is equivalent to 58-3 grains of the crystallized acid.
     2. The oxalate of lime, after being well washed and
 drained, and exposed for a week to the open air, at a tem
  perature of about 60-, weighed 76 grains; but upon being
 left on the sand bath for some hours in a temperature be
 tween 200° and 300°, its weight was reduced to 72 grains.
     3* These 72 grains of dry oxalate of lime were put into an
 open platinum crucible, and gradually heated to redness.
 By    these means they were           reduced to 49-5 grains, which
  proved to be carbonate          of lime. The crucible was now ex
 posed to a violent heat         in a forge. Nothing remained but a
 quantity of pure lime weighing 27 grains.
     4. From this experiment we learn, that 72 grains of dry
  oxalate of lime contain 27 grains of lime.                Of consequence,
  the oxalic acid in this compound must be 45 grains.                       But
  the weight    of crystallized oxalic        acid actually used was 58-3
  grains,   a quantity which exceeds           the whole acid in       the ox
 alate by 13-3 grains.          These 13-3 grains are the amount of
 the water of crystallization, which either did not unite with
  the salt, or was driven off by the subsequent exposure to
  heat.     Hence crystallized oxalic acid is composed of
                      Real acid           -      -      45-
                       Water             .•     -        13-3
                                                         58-3
     Now this     is equivalent to                     t
                       Real acid           -      -      77

   fourth part of their weight of water*.

                  II. Alkaline and Earthy Oxalates:
     1.  The preceding experiment gives us likewise the com
position of oxalate of lime. This salt, when merely dried in
the open air, still retains a portion of water which may be
driven off by artificial heat. It is necessary to know that it
parts with this water with considerable difficulty, so that a
long exposure on the sand or steam bath is necessary to get
it thoroughly dry.            It  afterwards imbibes a little water            if it
be left in a moist place.              Well dried oxalate,        we have seen,
is   a  compound of
                    Acid     45 or per cent,        62-5   acid.

     Though       the   oxalate       of lime dried spontaneously can
 scarcely be considered as always in the same state, yet as the
 difference in the portion of water which it retains is not
 gTeat, provided it be dried slowly in the temperature of 60°,
 and in a dry place, it may be worth while to state its com"
 ^position.      It  is as follows      :
                    Acid       45 or per cent, 59-2 acid.
                    Base       27                    35-5 base.
                    Water 4                    -       5-3 water.
                                76                  100-0
      When rapidly dried,              as by pressing it between the folds
 of filtering       paper,     it  is  apt to concrete into hard lumps,
  which retain more moisture. In this state I have sometimes
  seen it retain 10 per cent, of water after it appeared dry.
  mentioned incidentally,     that the crystals of oxalic acid contain about half
  their weight of water. He dissolved 100 parts of cinchonate of lime in water,
  and precipitated by means of oxalic acid ; 22 parts of crystallized oxalic acid
  were necessary ; and the oxalate of lime formed weighed 27 grains. From this
  experiment he draws the conclusion which I have stated, (see Aim. it Chimie,
  lix. 164 ) But this ingenious chemist does not serai to have been aware of
  the real composition of oxalate of lime.       27 grains of that salt are composed
  very nearly of 10 grains of lime and 17 grains of acid. But the Weight of
  the crystals used by Vauquelin was 22 ; the difference, five, is obviously the
   water of crystallization     in 22 grains of the crystals. But if 22 grains con
   tain five of water, it is obvious, that 100 contain very nearly 23.        So that fjr
   his experiment in reality coincides with mine.
                                                                         Bergmann

   106                       On Oxalic Acid.
     Bergmann states the composition            of  oxalate  of lime'   as
  follows :
                        Acid                      48
                        Lime      -        -      46
                        Water     -        -       6
                                                 100*
     His method     was to dissolve a determinate quantity        of  cal
  careous spar in    nitric acid, and     then to precipitate the lime
 by oxalic acid.      100 parts of calcareous spar thus dissolved,
 require, according to him, 82 parts of crystallized acid to
 precipitate them.       But there must have been some mistake
 in this experiment ; for, according to my trials, (provided
 the nitric acid be carefully neutralized by ammonia as it is
 evolved,) no less than 1 17 grains of oxalic acid would have
 been required, and at least 145 grains of oxalate of lime
 would have been obtained instead of the 119, which was
 the result    of Bergmann's experiment.            It is obvious    that
Bergmann did not precipitate all the lime.                He added ox
 alic acid till it ceased to produce any effect on the solution
from the great excess of nitric acid evolved ; and then took
it for granted that all the lime was separated.             But had he
added ammonia,        he would     have     got an additional quantity
of    oxalate   of lime, and    the  precipitation would have re
commenced upon adding more oxalic acid. This explana
tion accounts in a satisfactory manner for the difference be
tween Bergmann's statement of the composition of oxalate
of lime,     and mine.
    2. Though the preceding experiment was made with care,
yet as some of the most important of the following observa
tions in some measure rest upon the analysis of oxalate of
lime, I thought it worth while to verify that analysis in the
following manner :
    J 00 grains of crystallized oxalic acid were dissolved in
 1000    grains of water, making a solution which weighed
1100 grains.
    It is obvious that every 100 grains of the above solution
contained 9'09 grains of crystal of oxalic acid, equivalent,
                             * Opuse. i. 262.
                                                             according

                                Chi   Oxalic Avid.                         107
according to the preceding analysis,                 to seven grains    of real
acid.
     100 grains      of this solution      were gradually mixed with lime
water till      the    liquid ceased to produce any change on vege-
table blues.         The oxalate of lime thus formed being well
dried, weighed 1 1-2 grains.                Exposed to a violent heat in a
platinum crucible, this salt left 4' 2 grains of pure lime.
Hence it was composed of
                     7     acid, or per cent. 62- 5 acid.
                     4-2 lime            -          37 '5 base.

                    11-2                            100-0
     Thus    we have        obtained exactly the same result as in the
 former experiment, both as far as relates to the composition
 of oxalate of lime, and likewise to the proportion of water
 pf crystallization in crystallized oxalic aci.d.
     The lime water necessary to saturate the acid amounted
 to 3186 grains. Hence, it contained only -j-fyth of its weight
 of lime.                                                                       •>
     3. The oxalates of barytes and strontian are white, taste
 less powders,' which may be obtained by mixing oxalate of
  ammonia with the muriates of these alkaline earths.                       It is
  said that these earths are capable              of forming soluble super-
  oxalates    with this acid       ;  but  I  have not tried the experiment.
  These oxalates,          as well   as  oxalate   of lime,  are partially so
  luble in the strong acids.
      4. Oxalate of magnesia is              a soft white powder, bearing a
  considerable resemblance to oxalate of lime.                  It is tasteless,
  and not sensibly soluble in water ; yet when oxalate of am
  monia is mixed with              sulphate of magnesia, no precipitate
  falls; but      if the solution be heated and concentrated suffi
   ciently,    or  if   it be evaporated to dryness, and redissolved in
   water, in both cases the oxalate of magnesia separates in the-
   state of an insoluble powder.
      5. Oxalate      of potash readily crystallizes in       flat rhomboids,
   commonly         terminated        by   dihedral    summits.     The lateral
   edges   of   the prism are usually          bevelled.   The    taste  of this
   salt is cooling and bitter.            At the temperature of 60° it dis
   solves    in thrice its weight of water. When dried on the

    This salt combines with           an    excess    of acid,    and   forms a
 superoxalate, long known by the name of salt of sorrel.                     It
 is very sparingly soluble in water, though more so than
 tartar.     It occurs in commerce           irt beautiful 4-sidi-d prisms
 attached     to each other.      The acid contained in this salt is
very nearly       double  of  what   is contained in oxalate of potash.
 Suppose 100 parts of potash ; if the weight of acid neces
 sary to convert this quantity into oxalate be x, then 2 x will
 convert it into superoxalate.
    6. Oxalate of soda readily crystallizes.               Its taste is nearly
the same as that of oxalate of potash. When heated, it falls
to powder, and loses the whole of its water of crystallization.
Soda is said to be capable of combining                  with   an   excess  of
 acid, and of forming a superoxalate.                   I have not tried the
experiment.
    7. Oxalate       of ammoTiia is the most important of all the
Oxalates,      beintr very much emplo\ed            by chemists to detect
the presence of lime, and to             separate it from solutions.         It
crystallizes      in long transparent prisms, rhomboidal, and
terminated        by dihedral summits.               The lateral edges are
often truncated, so as to make the prism 6- or 8-sided. Some
times the original faces of the prism are nearly effaced.
    The taste of this salt is bitter and unpleasant, somewhat
like that of sal ammoniac. At the temperature of 60°, 1000
grains of water dissolve only 45 grains of this salt.                   Hence,
 100O grains of saturated solution of oxalate of ammonia con
tain only 43-2 grains of this salt. The specific gravity of
this solution is 1-0186. As it may be useful to know the
weight of this salt contained in solutions of different spe
cific gravities, I have thought it worth while to construct
the  following      table :

    8. To determine the composition of these salts, I took
seven different portions of a diluted oxalic acid solution,
each weighing        100 grains,        and    containing       seven      grains of
real oxalic acid.        To    each   of these portions I           added     respec
tively potash, soda, ammonia, barytes water, strontian wa
ter, and lime water, till it ceased to produce any change.
The liquid       was then evaporated           to drjness, and the residue,
after being       well   dried     on    the     steam bath, was weighed.
Each of these salts contained seven grains of acid ; the ad
ditional weight I ascribed to the base. Hence I had the fol
lowing table, which exhibits the weight of each salt obtained,
and its composition           deduced     from that weight.

    9. Tn the preceding statement, no account has been
taken of the water of crystallization which might still re
main attached to the salts, notwithstanding the heat to which
they were exposed.        There is reason to believe, however,
that in most     of  them    this water must be so small, that it
may be overlooked without any great error.                     Oxalates of
soda and of ammonia, I have reason to believe, lose all their
water of crystallization at a moderate heat.             This is the case
also with oxalates of lime and barytes, and I presume that
the oxalates    of strontian    and magnesia are not exceptions ;
but oxalate of potash retains its water much more obstinate
ly.   I believe that in that salt the weight of acid and of base
is nearly equal, and that when dried in the temperature of
812°, it still retains nearly ten per cent. of water; but I
have not been able to establish this opinion by direct ex
periment.
   The composition of       oxalate   of strontian in       the preceding
table, was so different from what         I expected,     that I' repeated
the experiment ; but the result was the same. This induced
me to combine strontian and oxalic acid in the following
manner:     100 grains   of  a solution containing 7 grains of real
oxalic   acid were    neutralized by ammonia, and the oxalic
acid precipitated by means        of muriate of strontian.              The
salt obtained weighed 12-3          grains   ;  of   course   it  was com
posed   of
                                                                       Acid

    Thus   it appears that there are two           oxalates of strontian,
the first obtained       by saiurating        oxalic acid with strontian
water, the second by mixing together oxalate of ammonia
and    muriate of strontian.            It is remarkable that the first
contains just double the proportion of base contained in the
second.

XIX.       Hints respecting Women's and                Children's Clothes
                                catching Fire.
                               To   Mr. Tilloch.
         SIR,
 W hen         we reflect on the many dreadful misfortunes          which
 have of late years happened, in consequence of the clothes
 of women and children accidentally catching fire, it is a
 matter of some surprise, as well as great concern, to find so
 very little attention paid to the prevention of such misfor
 tunes in future.
     The following hints are offered with a sincere wish that                *
 they may meet          with     that   serious consideration which the
 subject requires, and be the means of engaging the attention
 of the public on this subject, and of adopting the following
  measures recommended, or some more effectual.
     There are two principal objects which offer for our consi
  deration    : the first is, to prevent the clothes
                                                            from catching
Jlre   ;  and   the other,    to check the progress of the flumes.
     One of the most evident methods 10 prevent the clothes
 from catching Jire,       is to have wire-fenders placed before the
  fireplace, of      a sufficient height to hinder the coals from
  flying into the room       ;   such fenders are so placed in some
  parlours, but more it is believed for protecting the marble
  hearth and carpet, than for the safety of the females and chil
  dren of the family.          Wire screens are sometimes placed in
  rooms    where    birds  are    let loose, parallel to the fire-place
                                                                           ;
                                                                       scuh

112         On Women's and Children's Clothes catching Fire.
such     as these,        if more
                                projecting ones should be objected
to, might           be used in common sitting-rooms.   One or two
strong metal bars would                   be some          protection, if close wire-
work should not                 be liked       ;   these    of course should come
some way forward,                   otherwise they would                   not be of much
use.   Certainly              the    safest    are fenders          of close wire-work
projecting into the room, sufficiently open to let the heat
through, but not any coals which might        from the fire.                   fly
Nurseries in particular should have this sort.
  The second object which offers for consideration                                             is   to
check   the progress   the flames   one of the most evident

                                                                                 is
bable that muslins and linens                      will   be laid aside on account                  of
the danger they expose the persons wearing them to, perhaps
some method may be adopted which may check the progress
of the      fire    in those         substances.       Experiments for this pur
pose     have          been    made      (on   a   small scale) which very well
answered           the end, but on account                 of   the preparations used
(which       were pot-ash and other alkaline                         substances)          having
the property            of imbibing moisture in                 a   great degree,         it   ren
ders this exact method,                       is
                             feared, impracticable.

  It    has beenrecommended, that persons whose clothes
have caught fire should immediately roll themselves up in
the carpet  but this excellent method of extinguishing the

                                                                          as   it    is
to nail down carpets to                  the floor, —      a    practice which should
never be suffered in rooms where there    any danger of ac          is
cidents of this kind happening  nor   should heavy tables or
                                                   ;
other furniture be so placed on the carpet                               as to   hinder   it   from
being easily rolled up.
   If   woollen cloth were constantly kept in nurseries and
        a
iitting-rooms, especially when there are fires, laid loose
upon the table or other piece of furniture, this being always
at hand, might be easily resorted to in case of accident,
and being wrapped tight round the flames, or strongly press
ed against them, would,                       by
                             excluding the air, no doubt, in

which have happened of late, to the modern practice of fix

XX.       On the     Chinese   Method of propagating Fruit-trees
    by Abscission.       By  Dr.  James Howison, London*.
 J. he Chinese, in place of raising fruit-trees from seeds or
from grafts, as is the custom in Europe, have adopted the
following method of increasing them.
    They select a tree of that species which they wish to pro
pagate,     and fix upon such a branch as           will least hurt or dis
figure the tree by its removal.
     Round this branch, and as near          as   they can conveniently
to its junction with the trunk, they wind a rope, made of
 straw, besmeared with cow dung, until a ball is formed,
 five or six times the diameterof the branch. This is intended
 as a bed into which the young roots may shoot.                     Having
 performed this part of the operation, they immediately under
 the ball divide the bark down to the wood, for nearly two-
 thirds    of the circumference of the branch. A cocoa-nut
 shell or small pot is then hung over the ball, with a hole in
 its bottom, so small that water put therein will only fall in
 drops ; by this the rope is constantly kept moist, a circum
  stance necessary to the easy admission of the young roots,
  and to the supply of nourishment to the branch from this
  new channel.                                 <
      During    three   succeeding weeks, nothing further is re
  quired, except supplying the vessels with water. At the ex
  piration of that period one-third of the remaining bark is
  cut, and the former incision is carried considerably deeper
  into   the wood, as by this time it is expected that some roots
  have struck into the rope, and are giving their assistance in
  support of the branch.
      After  a similar period the same operation is repeated, and
  in about two months from the commencement of the pro
  cess, the roots may generally be seen intersecting each other
  on the surface of the ball ; which is a sign that they are suf
  ficiently advanced to admit of the separation of the branch
  from the tree.       This is best done by sawing it off at the in-

cision,    care    being taken that the rope, which by this time
is nearly      rotten, is not shaken off by the motion.                The
branch is then planted           a» a young tree.
    It appears probable,          that to succeed      with this operation
in Europe,       a  longer period would be necessary, vegetation
being much slower in Europe than in India, the chief field
of my experiments. I am, however, of opinion, from some
trials which      I  have lately made on cherry-trees,         that an ad
ditional      month    would       be adequate   to make up for the de
ficiency     of climate.
    The    advantages     to be derived from       this method are, that
a further growth of three or four years is sufficient, when
the branches are of any considerable size, to bring them to
their full bearing state        ;   whereas, even in India, eight or ten
years are necessary         with most kinds of fruit-trees, if raised
from the seed.
    When      at Prince     of Wales's Island,      I  had an opportunity
of seeing this proved by experiment.                    Some orange trees
had been raised by a gentleman,              from seeds sown in 1786,
which had not borne fruit in 1795,                  while branches taken
off   by the Chinese        mode in 1791, had         produced two plen
tiful crops.
    Whether       forest   trees    might be propagated in Europe in
 the   same     manner,      I  have   not had experience sufficient to
form     a  judgment : it it should be found practicable, the ad
 vantages from it would be great, as the infancy of trees
would, by this means, be done away, a period which, from
the slowness of their growth, and the accidents to which they
 are liable, is the most discouraging to planters.
    The adoption of this method will, at all events, be of
 great use in multiplying such plants as are natives of warmer
 climates, the seeds        of which    do not arrive here at sufficient
 maturity to render them prolific.
     I have frequently remarked that such branches                 of fruit-
 trees as were       under the operation of abscission, during the
 time   of   bearing, were more laden with fruit than any other
 part  of the   tree.    It  appeared to me probable, that this arose
 from a plethora or fulness, occasioned by the communica
 tion between the trunk and branches, through the descend-
                                        H  2                             ing

  ing vessels being cut off by the division of the back, while
  that by the ligneous circles or ascending vessels,                       being
  deeper seated, remains*.               The same reasoning accounts for
  fruit.trees      producing a greater crop than usual, on being
  stripped of their leaves, most of the ascending juices being
  thrown off by them in perspiration, or expended in their
  nourishment,          for we find that bleeding trees cease to give
  out their juices after they have put forth their leaves f.
       I have observed that the roots from a branch under the
  operation        of abscission        were   uniformly much longer in
  shooting into the rope when the tree was in leaf, than the
  contrary : hence, the spring season appears most proper for
  performing that operation.
       It will  seem singular that the Chinese entertain the               same
 opinion that Linnaeus did, respecting the pith of trees being
 essential to the formation of the seed.                By cutting into the
 trunk of the guava tree before it has produced, and making
 a division in the pith, they have obtained fruit without seed.

XXI,      Description of a Gauge for measuring Standing
      Timber. By Mr. James Broad, of Downing Street * .
T
J- he
     SIR'
            instrument       I   send    herewith,        is for finding the girth
of standing timber,              and   will,   I   flatter myself, be found ex
ceedingly useful to all gentlemen and others having timber
to dispose of, and likewise to such purchasers as wish to
pay for the true quantity.     At present a gentleman having
timber to dispose of, is liable to be imposed on to a very
large amount ; for though some    surveyors may be found
whose eye is pretty accurate, yet that is far from being ge
nerally the case.   When an estate is sold on which the
timber is to be valued, I believe there is no other way in
general use     of finding        the girth    of atree (which being         squared
and multiplied  by its length, gives                      the contents),
                                                          by                 than
actually getting up to the middle, where the girth is usually
taken, with a ladder or otherwise : a method which is very
troublesome and expensive where the quantity is large. The
seller has, therefore, no way, but at an enormous expense,
of finding     the real contents          of what         he has to offer;    and as
the buyer, if a dealer, from his knowledge, is able to form a
more accurate judgment, it often happens that the seller sus
tains much loss.         /
                   have known it exceed 50 per cent . Having
some time ago a large quantity to survey, I thought it pos-.
eible to invent an instrument which would obviate this in
convenience,       and       which      might          be sold at a low     price, he
correct in its work,              quick in execution,              and   such as any
capacity might use.  1 likewise thought it might be so con
trived as to make such an allowance for bark as should be
agreed on.     The instrument I send you possesses all these
qualifications, and is susceptible of several improvements,
of which I was not aware when I made        which  will pointit,         I

                                         with the hark on, is
                                                        a tree
found to be thirteen inches, it is supposed it would be only
12 inches         if   the bark was taken off.
     The instrument            of two straight pieces of well-
                               is composed
seasoned deal, about thirteen feet long, joined together by
a pin going through them, on which they are moveable ; but
neither the length nor thickness is of any particular con
sequence, as by following the directions hereafter given,
they may be made of any size. A little way from the larger
end is      a brass     limb    I call  on which are engraven
                                          the index,
figures denoting the quarter. girth in feet and inches. To use
this instrument, it is only necessary to take hold of the large
end, and apply the other to that part of the tree where you
wish to know the girth, opening it so wide as just to touch
at the      same       time both sides             of
                                                straining it,
                                                          it,    without
keeping the graduated side of the index uppermost, on which
the greater girth will be shown, after allowing for the bark,
by    the    inner edge        of    the brass on the right hand leg                        ;— an
operation so easy and simple,                      thai   a     person   of   the meanest
capacity might measure      get at number of trees in
                                         a              day.                       a

rods of seven feet long, made so as to fit into ferrils at the
end of each other, tapering all the way in the same manner
as   fishing rod.

                            A
them, would enable      man quickly to measure
                                a                  tree of more               a
than forty feet high,               as he     \vould be able to reach                  himself
about seven feet.

are closed) towards the centre, which would make      easier                           it
to carry.  Secondly, as it sometimes happens that standing
timber    sold without anv allowance for bark, and at other
            is
times with     less allowance than one ineh
                  a                           thirteen, two              in
other scales on the inilix mitjht be added in such cases, one
without any allowance, and the other to allow as might he
agreed      on.    I     would       have      aJded      these,but thought the
society would           rathur   see     it   in   the state in which   has been  it
                                                                                            tried

tried on a large survey, as any artist can with great ease add
whatever scale he pleases.               The present scale allows one
inch in thirteen for bark, and is calculated on the following
data : The diameter of a circle whose quarter circumference
is 26 inches, is 33 -ffo inches.              The diameter of a circle
whose quarter girth is 64- inches, is 8 -ffo inches.            To gra
duate the scale, the instrument is opened so as to take in at
the small end between the touching points 8 -?fe inches, and
a mark is made on the arch to denote 6 inches quarter girth :
it  is then opened     so as to take      in 33 ffe inches, and another
mark is then made on the arch, to denote two feet quarter
girth ; (these marks are made close to the inner edge of the
brass on the      right hand limb:) the space between them is
then divided into eighteen parts, which represent inches,
 and are again divided into half, for half inches ; if any no
 tice is to be taken of quarter inches, the eye will easily make
 a further decision.

 for sale.              I  am, sir, your obedient servant,

 would,    if generally adopted, lower the prce of butchers'
 meat, and thereby be of essential benefit to the community
 at large.      I keep a large stock of poultry, which are re
 gularly fed in a morning upon steamed potatoes chopped
 small, and at noon they have barley; they are in high con
 dition, tractable,     and   lay a very great quantity of eggs.
 In the poultry-yard is a small building, similar to a pigeon
 cote, for the hens to lay in, with frames covered with net to
 slide before     each  nest  : the bouse  is dry, light, and   well
 ventilated, kept free from dirt by having the nests and walls
 white-washed two or three times a year, and the floor co
 vered once a week      with fresh ashes. When I wish to procure
 chickens,    I  take the opportunity of setting many hens to
 gether, confining each to her respective nest ; a boy attends
morning and evening to let any off that appear restless, and
to see that they return to their proper places : when they
hatch, the chickens         are taken away, and a second lot      of
eggs allowed them to set again,         by which means they pro
duce    as  numerous      a  brood as before. I put the chickens
into long wicker cages, placed against a hot wall at the
back of the kitchen fire, and within theip have artificial
mothers for the chickens to run under;         they are made simi
lar to those described by Monsieur Reaumur, in his " Art
defaire cclorre et d' clever en toutes Saisonsdes Oiseaux domes-
tiques de toutes Espcces," &c., in two volumes, printed at
Paris, 1751: they are made of boards about ten inches broad,
and fifteen inches long, supported by two feet in the front
four inches in height, and by a board at the back two
inches in height.       The roof and back are lined with lambs'
skins dressed     with  the  wool upon them. The roof is thickly
perforated with holes for the heated air to escape ; they are
formed without bottoms, and have a flannel curtain in front
and at the ends for the chickens to run under, which they
do apparently by instinct.         The cages are kept perfectly dry
and clean with sand or moss. The above is a proper size for
fifty or sixty new.hatched chickens, but as they increase in
size they of course require a larger mother.            When they
are a   week     old, and the weather fine, the boy carries them
and their    artificial mother to the grass-plot, nourishes and
                                                              keeps

               Anew Method      tf rearing  Poultry.            193
keeps them warm,       by placing a long narrow tin vessel filled
with hot water at the back of the mother, which will retain
its heat tor three hours, and is ihen renewed fresh from the
steamer,     (ti the evening they are driven into their cages,
and resume their staivon at the hot wall,       till they are nearly
three weeks old,     and able to go into a small room appropri
ated to that     purpose.   The room is furnished with frames
 similar to the artificial mothers, placed round the floor, and
with perches conveniently arranged for them to roost upon.
    When I first attempted to bring up poultry in the above
 way, 1 lost immense numbers bv too great heat and suffo
 cation, owing to the roofs of the mothers not being suffi
 ciently ventilated ; and when that evil was remedied, I had
 another serious one to encounter     :  I found chickens brought
 up in this way did not thrive upon the food I gave them,
 and many of them died, till I thought of getting coarse bar
 ley-meal, and steaming it till quite soft : the boy feeds them
 with this and minced potatoes alternately; he is also em
 ployed rolling up pellets of dough, made of coarse wheat
 Hour, which he throws to the chickens to excite them to eat,
 thereby causing them to grow surprisingly.
     I was making the above      experiments in the summer for
 about two months ; and during that time my hens produced
 me upwards of five hundred chickens, four hundred of which
  I reared fit for the tabic or market. I U3ed a great many
  made into pies for the family, and found them cheaper than
  butcher's meat.     Were I situated in the neighbourhood of
  London, or any very populous place, I am confident I could
  make an immense profit, by rearing different kinds of poul
  try in the above method for the markets, and selling them
  on an average at the price of butchers' meat.
     A young person of twelve or fourteen years of age might
  bring up in a season some thousands, and by adopting a
  fence similar to the improved sheep-fold, almost any num
  ber might be cheaply reared, and with little trouble.         Hens
  kept as mine are, and having the same conveniences, will
  readily set four times in a season, and by setting twice each
  time, they would produce at the lowest calculation eighty
   chickens each, which would soon make them very plentiful.
                                                                    If

To    Charles Taylor, M.D.                      Sec.
          SIR,
     According            to your     request, I have sent you a model of
an artificial mother.               The most convenient size for forty or
fifty young  chickens is about fifteen inches long, ten deep,
four high in front, and two at the back ; it is placed in a
long wicker cage against a warm wall, the heat at about
eighty degrees of Fahrenheit'* thermometer, till the chick
ens are a few davs old,                 and used      to the comfort       of   il,   after
which time they run under when they want                              rest,     and ac
quire warmth            by crowding together.             I   find   it   advisable to
have two or three chickens among them                       of about       a   week old
to teach them to peck and eat. The meat and water      given                    is
them in small troughs fixed to the outside of the cage, and
a little  strewed along from the artificial mother, as
            is                                          train                   a
to the main deposit.               It    would have given me great pleasure
to have been able to send                 a   specimen of my superior feed
and management,               if   the season     had been rather more ad
vanced, for think I            not possible for turkeys and chickens
                              it   is
to weigh          heavier, be whiter, or altogether better fed than
mine are.
     After   a    certain age, they arc allowed their liberty,                       living
chiefly      on steamed                         and
                                     being situated tolerably
                                   potatoes,
secure from the depredations of men and foxes, are per
mitted to roost in trees near the house.
                         I    have the honour to be, sir,
                                         your most obedient servant,

     According           to your request,      I  herewith send you rough       a
sketch       of   the    apparatus      I   use, which probably will convey
                                                                                        an

an idea       of the business, and not    be too complicated   for
persons employed in poultry-yards           fully to understand.
But to prevent trouble and prejudice in the first outset, I
think it necessary to remark, that if the chickens do not
readily run under the artificial mother for want of some edu
cated ones to teach them, it will be proper to have the cur
tain in front made of rabbit or hare skin, with the fur side
outwards, for the warmth and comfort to attract them      ; after
wards they run under the flannel ones, similar to the one I
sent, which are preferable for common use, on account of
cleanliness,      and  not being liable to get into the mouths of
the chickens.
    I have had great amusement in rearing poultry in the
above way ; and if my time was not occupied with my chil
dren and other family concerns, I should most assuredly
farm very largely in poultry.
                           I have the honour to be, sir,

                               To   Mr. Tilloch.
         SIR,
JVly       paper on Vision,        printed      in 29th volume of the
                                                         the
Philosophical        Magazine,       has been reviewed in one or two
of   the periodical publication?.
     "    We,"     says one   of           cannot help regard
                                   these writers,              "
ing  it as, in  some  measure, derogatory to the character of a
respectable    journal, and at the same time discreditable to
the literary reputation of 'he country, that papers should be
brought forward, without censure, and without comment,
which betray         the deficiency      of their authors tn the first          ele
ments      of science."
     I         it is now pretty well understood, that nothing is
         believe
so   " discreditable   to the literary reputation of the country,"
at   this time, as the concealed, ignorant critic, who passes
an unjust censure upon the works ot others.
     "
     It is true," says this reviewer, " that when the surfaces
of a lens are perfectly spherical, its mean focal length is
altered  in a very slight degree by a change in its aperture;
but this  change is in all practical cases absolutely insensible,
and, unfortunately for Mr. Walker's opinion, is of a nature
precisely opposite to that which he takes for granted."
  But, whatever may be the opinion of this reviewer, it
will be generally believed, that the bare assertion of an ano
nymous writer does not alter the truth of any proposition.
  The truth of what I have advanced in my paper, respect
ing this property of the convex lens, may                          be clearly under
stood from the following
   Experiment. — I took the same instrument mentioned in
my former paper, and directed it to the moon, and drew out
the inner tube until her image appeared distinct upon the
unpolished glass.    Then, after having contracted the aper
ture of the lens  from two inches to   of an inch, the image
                                                         -J-
of candle, which stood at the distance of 12 feet from the
     a
instrument,        was distinctly       painted, in an inverted position,
upon the glass        in   the lunar focus     of the lens.
                                                                               The

  The only difference between this experiment and thosemen-
tioned in my former paper, made with the same instrument,
consists in the brightness of the object : the principle is the same.
     In the next paragraph         he says   :
                                               "  One simple argument
is sufficient to set aside these opinions          : it is founded on an
experiment well known to all those who have properly stu
died the subject.        If we look through two minute holes,
 much nearer together than the diameter of the pupil in its
 most contracted       state,   at one   of two points, nearly in the
 same     line, and within the limits of perfect vision, the other
 point will always appear double, whether we fix on the
 nearer or the more remote for the object of our attention.
 Here there is no change of the aperture, but a true altera
 tion in the refractive powers of the eye."
      This experiment is erroneous, and can only mislead those
 who may not be inclined to try it ; for when we look through
  two minute holes, made in the manner described above, two
 circles    of light are seen intersecting each other as represent
 ed    in Fig. 9, Plate IV. .
      Now when a point is seen through a or I it will appear
  single ; but if it be seen through the space c, it will appear
  double ; because an image is formed of it by each hole ; and
  if two points be viewed through c they will both appear
  double : but to see one of the points single and the other
  double, one must be seen through a or I, and the other through
  the space c. This experiment, which is the only one advanced
  *' to set aside"    my theory, proves nothing more than that
  the reviewer looked through two minute holes.
       If there were any alteration in the refractive powers of the
   eye, we might then see one point single and the other
   double, when viewed through one minute hole; but this
   is contrary to experience, and consequently proves the ab
   surdity of the reviewer's supposition.
       As this critic  docs    not appear to understand his own ex
    periment, let us see, in the next place, whether he under
   stands mine.
       "  It  is obvious,"    says   this writer,   " that   Mr. Walker's,
    three experiments     with   the  lens prove a great deal too much ;
    they demonstrate that a contraction of the aperture makes a
                                                                   remote

  remote object appear indistinct, while, in the next page, we
  are told, that when we view a remote object through an
  aperture of about one-fiftieth of an inch in diameter, if the
  object be seen in a proper light, it will appear as distinct as
  to the naked eye.     What must be the confusion of that
  man's ideas, who could fail to discover so glaring a contra
 diction ? The true explanation of the paradox, supposing
 the appearances to have been correctly described, is this : the
 light admitted   was diminished by the contraction of the ori
 fice, from two inches to one-fifth of an inch, in the ratio
 of   100 to one; consequently   the   pictures of all distant ob
jects must have been rendered extremely faint : but the image
 of the plumb-line in the window was rendered distinct by
 the contraction,   as it would have been     by the contraction
 of   an aperture  without   any lens,   which  would have exhi
 bited a shadow nearly as distinct, without any trace of a
 picture of the remoter objects."
     My experiments with the lens might appear a paradox to
 this reviewer in consequence of his not knowing, that di
stinctness and brightness are different, properties. Thus, if
we look through a small aperture at the moon, she will ap
pear more distinct than to the naked eye, though less bright :
if we look at a remote terrestrial object properly illuminated
for the experiment, it will appear as distinct when viewed
through a small aperture, as to the naked eye, but not so
bright ; but when the same object is seen in a faint light,
through a small aperture, it will appear       neither so distinct
nor so bright as to the naked eye.
    Now my experiments with the lens were made with ter
restrial objects seen only by day-light, but the object seen
through the small aperture, was strongly illuminated with
the sim's rays, and appeared as distinct as to the naked eye,
though not so bright : it might be (and probably was) this
difference between distinctness and brightness that puzzled
this gentleman so much.
    It is, however, very singular that this writer should be
wrong in all his observations.     For in my experiment with
a small aperture, the plumb-line, which hung down the
middle of the window, was so clearly represented upon the
                                                       unpolished

Unpolished glass at the eye end of the instrument, that even
its colour, a deep red, was very distinguishable.  But, after
the lens was taken away, the shadow of the line was so
broad, faint,                   not to be perceived by a
                          and indistinct,               as
person unacquainted with the experiment : and what might
have been easily expected, this faint shadow was accom
panied with a camera obscura picture of remote objects,
though dark and   defined.     ill
     The following experiments show how                                  the eye        is adjusted
to distinct vision              in   a   very satisfactory manner.                      These were
made with        a   transit telescope,                which has an object.glass of
2£ inches aperture, and                      34.    feet focal distance, adjusted to
observe celestial objects.
 I  directed this telescope to an object at the distance of 40
yards. This object consists of circular hole .fo of an inch in
                                                    a
diameter made in an iron plate, with  plate of metal painted   a
white placed at some distance behind it.   With the whole
aperture of the object glass, this hole in the iron plate                                             is
invisible; but when the aperture     contracted to .L of an   is
inch, the hole            appears so distinct,               that   it   is   easy to see when
it   is   bisected    by    the wire         in    the focus        of   the object glass, to

viewed with the same aperture are seen very imperfectly.
   Hence we see the reason of the pupil's contracting when
we attentively view   near object*, and why
                                  a           expands when                    it

      the xivth volume
professor Pictet communicates   the accension of combustible
substances          by       the       rapid compression                of atmospheric air.
The discovery of this curious fact   due to Mollet, as ap         is
pears from the Journal de Physique for Messidor, An. XII.
It   is                    the air be very suddenly compressed
          there slated, that            if
in   the ball of an air-gun, the quantity of caloric liberated
by   the first stroke of the piston     sufficient to set fire to
                                                             is                                    a

piece     of amadou* placed within the canal of the pump.
And     if the    instrument be furnished by          a lens firmly secured,
a  vivid flash of light           is said to be perceived     at the instant
of this condensation.             The evolution of light seems to have
been first noticed by a workman employed                    in the manufac
ture of arms           at St. Etienne,        who discharged an air gun
highly loaded, observed              a vivid    flash at the orifice of the
barrel.
   These curious discoveries of the foreign philosopher have
lately been applied to practical utility in this country.                  In
genious workmen have shown, that for the accension of
combustible bodies by compressed air, the air gun is by no
means necessary, but that the experiment may be performed,
and even with more easy, by means of a common condens
ing syringe of good workmanship.                    The number of instru
ments of that kind which have been called for at my labo
ratory, and with which the scientific public has been sup
plied, gives me reason to think, that men of science deem
this simple apparatus worthy of notice.                    The instrument I
have furnished consists of a common syringe, as usually sold,
about ten inches long, and not more than •*. of internal bore.
At    the    lower extremity          it is furnished with'a cap, which
serves as a chamber to receive the                substance   intended to be
fired, and which cap is attached to the instrument by a male
and female screw, or instead of this cap a common stopcock
may be used ; the former contrivance, however, is more
elegant, more durable, and less expensive.
    To use this instrument the cap is unscrewed, or the stop
 cock turned, a small piece of amadou or common tinder is
placed in the chamber,              and   the   cap  screwed    on again.     If
 the pistonxof the instrument be now depressed ivith as quick
a motion as possible, the condensation of the air is so ac
tive   as  to set the amadou on fire.
    From the result of          a   few experiments which        I have made
   • The name amailnu it given to a kind of tinder which       is imported from
 Germany.      It is made of a large fungus, which grows on old trees, especially
on the oak, ash, and fir. This substance, being first boiled in common water,
and afterwards dried and well beaten with a mallet, is then soaked in a solu
tion of saltpetre, and again put to dry in an oven.

132        On    th& instantaneous    Production  of Fire, W<r.
 with this instrument, I am induced to believe, that the
accension of the combustible bodies which is .effected in the
 manner stated, is not simply owing to the mere instantaneous
condensation of the air which takes place in the syringe, and
subsequent liberation of caloric, as stated by the continental
 philosophers; but that, on the contrary, it appears to be ow
 ing to the intense and rapid mechanical motion, vibration,
 or friction, produced in the particles of the body, placed in
the chamber of the instrument against each other by the
 rapid current produced.           For it was found that only such
 bodies as are exceedingly porous, or are made up of a multi
 tude of minute fibres, could be set on lire by means of this
 instrument    ;   and that the accension    of compact combustible
 substances, or bodies       of a different texture, when attempted,
 always   failed.     Hence    phosphorus, phosphuret of sulphur,
 camphor, ether, naphtha, fulminating gold, fulminating
 mercurv, and other inflammable substances, which so readily
 take fire, cannot be inflamed,         nor can the thinnest piece of
 foil, made of the fusible alloy which liquefies in boiling wa
 ter, be melted by the current of compressed air thus effected.
 The   case is otherwise when a porous or fibrous inflammable
 body is suddenly struck upon : a piece of common tindery
 a piece of amadou, very dry tow, rolled up in a coil, com
 mon touch-wood,          and the scrapings   of dry paper, or linen
 rag, are instantly inflamed by a stream of condensed air.
 Hence it appears, that the accension of these bodies is not
 solely owing to the mere disengagement of caloric, of which
 the air is deprived      when its volume is suddenly contracted.
 Biot has, indeed, announced in the Magas. Encyclop. for
 April J 805, that the effect of a very instantaneous com
 pression of oxygen and hydrogen gases might be substituted
for the electric spark, in the performance of the famous ex
periment elucidating the production of water. He states,
that having introduced into an air gun a mixture of the two
gases, and having given a sudden stroke to the piston, a vivid
light accompanied with a violent detonation took place, in
dicating the combination of the bases of the two gases. This
important experiment, which no doubt will be repeated by
others, stands, nevertheless,        unconected with what has been
                                                           advanced.

ment I have described is absolutely harmless, when ap
plied for the purpose it is intended, the experiment of Biot
requires nevertheless           precaution, to prevent dangers to which

     Many attempts         have been made in          this line, and several
valuable shrubs, that used to be kept                       our stoves,      are now
to be seen in the open garden   there      :       is, in   however, some rea

isrequired in the case of an annual,               is       to enable   it   to ripen
its fruit in   a    comparatively         cold summer, after which,                  w.e

a perennial has to encounter frosts with its. buds and annual

rend asunder the trunks of our indigenous forest trees.f.

     It is probable that wheat, our        principal food at present,
 did not bring its seed to          perfection in this climate, till
 hardened to it by repeated sowings: a few years ago some
 spring wheat from Guzerat was sown wiih barley, in a well

 thy appearance; but many ears were when ripe wholly with
 out corn, and few brought more than three or four grains
 to perfection.
     In   tbe year 1791,     some  seeds    of zizania  aquatica were
 procured from Canada, and sown in a pond at Spring
 Grove, near Hounslow : it grew, and produced strong plants,
 which ripened their seeds : those seeds vegetated in the suc
 ceeding spring ; but the plants they produced were weak,
 slender, not half so tall as those of the first generation, and
 grew in the shallowest water only ; the seeds of these 'plants
produced others the next year sensibly stronger than their
parents of the second year.
    In this manner the plants proceeded, springing up every
year from the seeds of the preceding one, every year becom
ing visibly stronger and larger, and rising from deeper parts
of the pond, till the last year, 1804, when several of the
plants were six feet in height, and the whole pond was in
every part covered with them as thick as wheat grows on a
well managed      field.
    Here    we  have   an    experiment which proves, that an an
nual plant, scarce       able to endure the ungenial summer of
England, has become, in fourteen generations, as strong and
 as vigorous as our indigenous plants are, and as perfect in
 all its parts as in its native climate.
    Some of our most common            flowering    shrubs have  been
long introduced into the gardens ; the bay-tree has been
 cultivated more than two centuries ; it is mentioned by Tus-
 ser, in the list of garden plants inserted in his book, called
 500 Points of good Husbandry, printed in 1573.
    The laurel    was    introduced    by master Cole, a merchant,
living    at Hampstead,      some   years before 1629, when Par
kinson published his Paradisus Terrcstris, and at that time
we had in our gardens, oranges, myrtles of three sorts,

                                                                  tus

             On inuring Tender Plants to our Climate.           135
ttis brought from Bermudas, and the passion-flower, which
last had flowered here, and showed a remarkable particula
rity,    by rising   from    the  ground  near a month sooner if a
seedling plant, than        if  it grew from roots brought from
Virginia.
     All  these   were   at that time rather tender plants ; master
 Cole cast a blanket over the toprof his lam el, in frosty wea
ther, to protect it ; but though nearly two centuries have
 since elapsed, not one of them will yet bear with certainty
our winter frosts.
     Though some of these shrubs ripen their seeds in this cli
 mate, it never has been, I believe, the custom of gardeners
 to sow them ; some are propagated by suckers and cuttings,
 and others by imported seeds        ; consequently the very identi
 cal laurel    introduced by master Cole, and some others of
 the plants enumerated by Parkinson, are now actually
 growing in our gardens; no wonder then, that these original
 shrubs have not become hardier, though probably they would
 have done so, had        they passed through several generations
 by being raised from British seeds.
     Is it not then worthy a trial, as we find that plants raised
 from suckers or cuttings do not grow hardier by time, and
 as the experiment on zizania points out the road, to sow the
 seeds    of  these   and   such like tender shrubs  as occasionally
 ripen them      in this climate?      Fourteen generations, in the
  case   of the zizania,   produced a complete habit of succeeding
  in this climate, but a considerable improvement in hardiness
  was evident much earlier.
     In plants that require some years to arrive at 'puberty,
  fourteen generations is more than any man can hope to sur
  vive: .but a much less number will in many cases be suffi
  cient, and in all, though a complete habit of hardihood is
  not attained,    a great progress may be made towards it in a
  much less time; even one generation may work a change of
  no small importance : if we could make the myrtle bear the
  climate of Middlesex, as well as it does that of Devonshire,
  or exempt our laurel hedges from the danger of being cut
  down by severe frosts, it would be an acquisition of no small

XXXI. Among                forces applied to
                            the               machine    mo a                     in
tion,     some are of such    nature that each of them forms
                                    a
an acute angle with the velocity                of    the    point at which            it   is

                                                                                  applied.

                       On Machines in General.                     137
 applied, while others form obtuse angles with their points.
 This being granted, I shall call the former moving or soliciting
forces; and the others resisting forces : for instance, if a
 person raises a weight by means of a lever, a pulley, a screw,
 &c, it is clear that the weight and the velocity of the weight
 necessarily form by their concurrence an obtuse angle;
 otherwise it is evident that the weight would descend in
 place of ascending ; but the vis motrix and its velocity form
 an acute angle    :  thus, according to our definition, the weight
 will   be the resisting    force, and the effort of the person will
 be the soliciting force : it is evident, in short,' that fhc latter
 tends to favour the actual movement of the machine, while
 the other opposes      it.
    We shall    observe     that the soliciting    forces may be di
 rected in the same ratio with their velocities,        since then the
 angle formed by their concurrence is null, and consequently
 acute, and the resisting force3 may act in the direction pre
 cisely opposite to that of their velocities, since then the
 angle formed by their concurrence is 180°, and consequently
 obtuse.
     It is also to be remarked,        that any force which is soli
 citing might become resisting if the movement should
 change; that any force which is resisting at a certain in
 stant, may become soliciting at another instant ; and last
 ly, in order    to judge    of it at each instant,  we must consider
 the angle which it makes with the velocity of the point
 where we suppose it applied : if this angle be acute, the
  force will be soliciting; and if it be obtuse, it will be resist
  ing, until the angle in question changes. We see from this,
  that if we make any system of power assume a geometrical
  movement, each of them will be soliciting or resisting in
  respect   of this geometrical movement, accordingly            as the
  angle formed by this force and by its geometrical velocity
  shall be acute or obtuse.
      XXXII. If a      force  P  be moved with    the velocity u, and
  the angle formed by the concurrence of u and P be z, the
  quantity P cosine zudt, in which d t expresses the element
  of time, will be named momentum of activity, consumed
  by the force P during       dt;   i.  e. the momentum     of activity
                                                             consumed

  1 38                On Machines in General.
  consumed by a force P, in a time infinitely short, is the
  produce of this force estimated in the ratio of its velocity,
 by the path      described    in this infinitely short time by     the
 point to which it is applied.
     I shall call the momentum          of activity,   consumed      by
 this force, in   a given time, the sum of the momenta of ac
 tivity   consumed    by it at each instant, in such a manner
 that s P cosine zudt is the momentum of activity, con
 sumed by it in an indeterminate time : for instance, if
 P be a weight, the momentum of activity consumed in
 an    indeterminate    time t will be P     sudt    cosine z ; lei us
 suppose, therefore, that after the time I, the weight P has
 descended     from the quantity H, we shall clearly have
 dH = udt cosine z ; therefore the momentum of activity;
 consumed during d t will be P s d H = PH.
     XXXIII. When we are speaking of a system of forces
 applied to a machine in movement, I shall call momentum
 of activity,    consumed       by all the forces of the system,
 the sum of the momenta of activity consumed at the
 same time by each of the forces which compose it: thus,
 the momentum of activity consumed by the soliciting
 forces, will    be the sum      of the momenta of activity con
 sumed at the same          time by each of them : and the mo
 mentum of activity consumed by the resisting forces
will be the sum of the momenta of activity consumed
by each of these forces : and as each resisting force makes
 an obtuse angle with the direction of its velocity, the co
 sine of this angle is negative; the momentum of activity
 consumed     by the resisting forces is therefore also a nega
tive quantity ; and therefore the momentum of activity con
sumed by all the forces of the system, is the same thing
as the difference between the momentum of activity consum
ed by the soliciting       forces, and the momentum        of activity
consumed at the same time by the resisting forces consider
ed as a positive quantity.
    A force estimated in a sense directly opposite to that of
its velocity, and multiplied by the path described in an in
finitely short time by the point where it is applied, will be
called the momentum of activity produced by this force in
                                                                  this

                      On Machines in General.                        13Q
this infinitely short time : in such a manner that the mo
mentum of activity consumed, and the momentum                     of ac
tivity produced,      are  two   equal quantities,     but  of  contrary
signs; and there is a difference between them analogous to
that which       we   find  (XXI)     between the momenta         of  the
quantity of movement gained and lost, by a body, in respect
of any geometrical movement.
     I shall also give the name of momentum of activity exer
cised by     a force, to what I have called its momentum of
activity consumed, if it be soliciting,' and to what I have
called its momentum of activity produced, if it be resisting:
 thus, the momentum of activity exercised by any given force
 in   an infinitely short time is in general the produce of this
 force, by the path which it describes in this infinitely short
 time, and by the cosine of the smallest of the two angles
 formed by the directions of this force and of its velocity ;
 whence it clearly follows, that this momentum of activity ex
 ercised is always a positive quantity.
      We shall make, with        respect to the quantities     which we
 call momenta       of activity produced      and momenta     of activity
 exercised,    the same remarks with those we have made above,
  upon the subject of momentum of activity consumed by a
  force or system of powers in a given time.
      These definitions being admitted, I shall proceed to the
  general principle of equilibrium and of movement, in ma
  chines properly so called     ; and    the inquiry   into  which    has
  been the principal object     of this   essay.

      XXXIV.      Whatever is the state     of repose or cf movement in
   which any given system offorces applied to a machine exists,
   if we make it all at once assume any given geometrical move-
  iment,   without changing these forces in any respect, the sum
   of  the products     of each of them, by the velocity which the
   point at which it is applied will have in the first instant, es
   timated in the direction of this force, will be equal to zero.
                                                                     That

     140                             On Machines in General.
          That        is to say,      by calling     F    each     of   these   forces*, u the
  velocity which the point where it is applied will have at
  the first instant, if we make the machine assume a geome
  trical movement, and z the angle comprehended between
  the directions                   of F       and   of    M,   it must       prove that we
 shall          have       for the whole system                sF u     cosine z = 0. Now
 this equation is precisely the equation (AA) found (XXX),
 which  is nothing else in the end but the same fundamental
 equation (F), presented under another form.
          It   is easy to perceive that this general
                                           principle  properly                            is,

          It
occur to those who have not paid sufficient attention to what has been
said (XXX) upon the true meaning we ought to attach to the word force:
Let us imagine, for instance, they will say, a wheel and axle to the cylin
der of which weights are suspended by means of cords;         there be equili   if
brium, or    the movement be uniform, the weight attached to the wheel will

                                                                          is
wheel; which      conformable to the proposition. But the case
                          is                                         not the same    is
when the machine assumes an accelerated or        retarded movement
                                                               a            seems,          :   it
therefore, that here the forces are not in reciprocal ratio of their velocities es.
timatcd in the direction of these forces, as would follow from the proposition.
The answer to that       that in the case where this movement
                               is,                                not uniform,       is
the weights in question are not the only forces exercised in the system    for                       ;
the movement of each body changing continually,         also opposes   at each
                                                                         it

therefore, keep an account of tlu's resistance. \Ve have already said (XXX.
see the miuO how this force should be estimated, and we shall see further
on (XLV), how we should make      enter into the calculation. In the mean time
                                               it
it  sufficient to remark, that the forces applied to the machine in question
     is
are not the weights, but the quantities of movement lost by these weights
(XXX), which should be estimated by the tensions of the cords to which
they are suspended now whether the machine be at rest or in motion,
                               :
whether this motion be uniform or not, the tension of the cord attached to
the wheel    to that of the cord attached to the cylinder, as the radius of the
                     is

procal ratio of the velocities of the weights they support  this agrees with   :
the proposition.  But these tensions are not equal to the weights; they are
(XXX. see the note) the results of these weights and of their i-u inertia:,
which are themselves (XXX. see the note) the results of the actual move
ments of these bodies, and of the movements equal and directly opposed to
those which they will really assume the instant afterwards.

      In order to      have all the conditions    of the equilibrium  in a
   weighing machine, it        is only necessary to make the machine
   successively assume        different geometrical movements, and
   to equal in each of these cases the vertical velocity of the
   centre of gravity at zero.

      General Principle       of Equilibrium letween two Weights.
      XXXVII.        When two weights form a mutual equilibrium,
  if we make tlie machine assume any geometrical movement :

  ratio,   will  lie in a reciprocal ratio to their weights : 2d, One
  of  these bodies    will necessarily ascend, ivhile the other will
  descend.
     This proposition      is   a  manifest  consequence of the pre
  ceding corollary, and is still more evidently deduced from
  the first corollary.
     We may remark by           the way,  how    essential it is for the
 precision of all these propositions,          that the movements im
 pressed upon the machine should be geometrical, and not
 simply possible ; for the slightest attention will show by
 some particular example, that without this condition all these
 propositions would be absurd.

,    XXXVIII. We generally take the principle of equili
brium in weighing machines when the centre of gravity of
the system is at the lowest possible point ; but we know
that this principle is not generally true; for besides that this
point would be in certain cases at the highest point, there
is an infinity of. others where it is neither at the highest nor
at the lowest point : for instance, if the whole system be
reduced      to a weighing body, and this moveable article be
placed      upon   a curve which has a point of inflexion, the tan
gent of which is horizontal, it will remain visibly in equili
brium, if we place it upon this point of inflexion, which

nevertheless is not the lowest weight, nor the highest point
possible.
     We may          also    take for the principle of equilibrium                          in a
weighing machine the proposition which we have already
given (II), and which we shall repeat, in order to give a
rigorous demonstration of it.
     In orderto ascertain that several weights applied to any
given   machine  should mutually form an equilibrium, it is
sufficient to prove, that               if
                             we abandon this machine to itself,
the centre      of gravity of the               system      will   not descend.
      In order     to prove       it,   let us name          M     the total mass         of the
system, m that              of   each     of      the   weights which compose                   it,

      gravity   and suppose that

remain in equilibrium, as  assert that   should, the velo

city of m after the time  would be V, the height from which
                                    t

descended        mh; we shall then have (XXIV) smgdh — sm

of gravity of which               is    at the lowest possible            point; but we

each into three others                parallel     to any three axes perpendicular
to each other :
     1st.    The sum         of   the component forces,               which are parallel
to one and the same axis,                     and conspiring           towards one and
the same side,             is equal to the sum of those which, being pa
rallel      to this same axis,       conspire towards the opposite side:
  2d. The sum of the momenta of the component forces
which tend to turn around one and the same axis, and which
conspire in one and the same ratiof is equal to the sum of the
momenta           of     those which tend to turn around the same                      axis,
hit in a contrary direction.
  In order to demonstrate this proposition,      let us begin by
imagining,    that in place of each   of the forces  exercised by
the resistance of obstacles, we substitute an active force equal
to this resistance, and directed in the same ratio: this change
does       not alter the state        of equilibrium, and makes of the
machine           a system     of powers perfectly free, i. e. freed from
every obstacle.             This being grauted,               if   we make this system
assume any geometrical                     movement,          we     shall have    by the
fundamental theorem                   s   F u cosine z = 0, by calling F               each
of   these forces, u its velocity,                  and   z   the angle comprehend
ed between             F and   u : thus,
     1st.    If    ive    suppose           with respect to all
                                          that u is the same
the points of the system, and parallel to any one of the axes,
the movement will be geometrical, and the equation, on ac
count of u constant, will be reduced to s F cosine z = 0 :
i. e. the sum of the forces of the system estimated in                            the ratio
of the velocity u, impressed parallel to this axis, will                          be   null;
which evidently          reverts to the first part of the proposition.
     2d.    If we    make the whole system turn round any one of
the axes,         without changing in any respect the respective
position of the parts which compose       this movement will   it,
still be geometrical   u will be proportional to the distance
                                  ;
of each power from the axis and therefore might be ex

stant: thus the equation will be reduced tos FR cosine = 0;                        3
which, as may easily be seen, reverts to the second part of
the proposition.

    In the last Number of the Philosophical Magazine,          p. 70,
tome remarks were       made on the case    of Miss R., who had
a tumour in the right     breast,  which    had   existed  for some
years, and which had lately assumed          the   character  of the
 true scirrhus.
    It appears that this disease  originated    from   local injury,
and remained stationary for almost six years, when a second
blow was received on      the part  : — then,  and not until   then,
did the disease    assume its true character   : this took place in
a constitution naturally irritable and delicate. Is it possible
to suppose, that the mode of treatment by depletion, com
menced in October 1806, and regularly persevered in till the
following April, could fail to have produced the increase of
unfavourable symptoms, and that general debility which then
existed ? Ought it not rather to be matter of surprise, that
at this period  a professional man is to be found, who should
regularly and obstinately have persevered in a mode of treat
ment for so many months, which evidently tended to the
increase of the disease,   and also to the destruction        of his
patient   ?
   This disease arises from very opposite causes, and takes
place in constitutions which are exceedingly different ; and
even in many instances it occurs without any obvious or
assignable cause ; neither does its true nature appear to be

  at all understood:           yet we find professional        men, of no in*
  considerable eminence, recommending the mode of treat
  ment by depletion; from which I must confess, that so
  far from        its doing good, (if the disease be well defined,)
  it can      never     fail, in my opinion, to increase the unfa
  vourable symptoms, and consequently to hurry on the fatal
 event.
     In this    disease      we have an extraneous substance, that               is,
 a substance        dissimilar from every part of a healthy animal
 body.        Is it possible for this to arise from obstruction in the
 lymphatic system ? or is it not more probable that it is pro
 duced by a peculiar action in the minute branches of the
 arterial system ? There are certainly many facts tending to
 corroborate this opinion, which I have delivered in my Lec
 tures for      some years        past,   and mean to illustrate        in a sub
 sequent report.

 books of reference.
     Part  I. of this work, which      is publishing    in periodical
portions,     has made its appearance, and presents        promising
specimens of talent and of industry. The         articles are all new
written, many of them original, and exhibit a just picture
of the present state of knowledge, in the various depart
ments embraced         by them — detailed with all that brevity
which is consistent with perspicuity, and which is so de
sirable in works of this nature, to keep them within some
reasonable compass — while at the same time such ample
references are given to other sources, as cannot but prove of
the greatest utility to those readers who may be occupied
with    the investigation    of any particular   branch of know
ledge.
    Among other articles which          have particularly struck us
as masterly compositions,       exhibiting at the same time, in
formation, genius, and intellect, are the following:             Abs
traction, Accent, Ether,         As elegant well written speci
mens of biography we notice Abercrombie, Abelard, Ag-
nesi.     Abyssinia and Africa are good examples of concise
yet perspicuous abridgement — compressing anil condensing,
not omitting what should be known.             JEtna is a beautiful
and     interesting article.    Abstinence, Academy,         Alacus,
Achromatic Telescopes, Acousties, Adds, Affinity, Agri
culture, are all excellent articles. Some of them are new in
our language ; and all of them present much novelty, and do
credit to their respective authors.
    Should this work be continued with the same spirit, and
conducted with the same judgement, with which it has been
commenced,        it will indeed prove an acquisition to the Bri
 tish public.     We have every reason, from the list of con
 tributors whose names have been communicated to the pub
 lic, to believe that the Edinburgh Encyclopedia will not
 fall off, but improve as it proceeds. The plates given with
 this work are superior to any before given with similar
 works issuing from the Scotch press, and are creditable to
 the artists who furnish them.

 our hopes that a second would soon be called for.                  Our
 wishes have been more than gratified.          The present work,
 though presented'to the public as a republication,         is in many
 respects new, the additions that have been made            being very
 numerous and highly interesting. All the modern improve
 ments in analys'19 are detailed with brevity ; but at the same
  time with so much perspicuity, that the student in this
  amusing science can be at no loss to apply them with effect.
  This work, though modestly entitled A Manual, will be
  found worthy of the notice of all who cultivate chemistry,
  whatever their acquirements may have been.

                         KOYAL     SOCIETY.
  July    1.— Mr. Davy, in     the Bakerian    Lecture    on the de
  composition   of the alkalies,  read in November        1807    before
  the Royal Society,   described some      experiments on barytes
  and strontites ; from   which he inferred that these bodies
  contained inflammable      matter.    In  a communication made
  this evening,  he states that he has since made a number of
  experiments with a Voltaic battery of 36.000 square inches,
  on these and the other alkaline earths, and silex and alu-
  mine.    All these bodies, when slightly moistened, and
  acted  upon by iron wires, negatively electrified, undergo
  change at the points of contact.        And the metals of the
                                                                  earths

                                  Royal Society.                              149
earths appear         to form alloys       with    the negatively      electrified
iron.
    Mr. Davy         has likewise metallized the earths by electrify
ing them when mixed with various metallic oxides, such as
those of lead, silver, and mercury. In these cases, the me
tals   of    the earths, and the common                metals are revived to
gether in alloy.
  Mr. Davy referred to some very recent experiments of two
Swedish chemists, M. Berzelius and Pontin, who have suc
ceeded               amalgams of the metals of barytes and
             in obtaining
lime by exposing the moistened earths to negatively elec
trified mercury. Their method succeeds likewise with stron-
tites and magnesia, but not with alumine and silex.
   He mentioned likewise a most interesting experiment of
the same gentlemen on ammonia, which seems fully to con
firm his analysis of    and his idea of its being an oxide
                                 it,
with    binary base. — When quicksilver
        a                                 negatively electri
                                                         is
fied in contact with solution of ammonia,   soft amalgam      a                  is
formed, consisting of nitrogene, hydrogene, and mercury,
which absorbs oxygene, or decomposes water with the evo
lution of hydrogene, and re-produces ammonia.
   July 8. — In paper read this evening, Mr. Davy stated
                       a
that he had procured the metal of barytes     pure form — •   in   a
that    it   was highly combustible,          and rapidly decomposed wa
                                                                             by
 ter with         the production       of barytes.     This   he effected    di
 stilling             of the basis and mercury and he stated
              the amalgam                                          ;
 that   similar methods he had succeeded in obtaining the
         by
metals of strontites and magnesia nearly pure. The earths
 are  mixed with red precipitate which      negatively electri
                                                        is
 fied, the amalgam    absorbed
                            is      fresh mercury, and when
                                              by
it  becomes semifluid   distilled in the vapour of naphtha in
                                 is
a    tube    of   plate glass.
    Mr. Davy stated his intention of entering fully, at the next
 meeting of the Society, into the discussion of the theoretical
 views connected with this new subject, and of its- general
 relations to Nature and to Art.

    A paper by Mr. Knight, on the alburnum                   of trees, was
 also read ; after which the Society adjourned               till Thursday
 the loth of November.
           WEItNERIAN NATURAL HISTORY SOCIETY.
    At  the    last meeting of the Wernerian Natural History
Society (July 16),       the President laid before the Society three
 communications from Col. George Montague, F. L. S. of
 Knowle House,          Devon.        Two of these communications
were read at       this meeting.        The first part of the first com
munication        contained      an   interesting view of the natural
habits and more striking external appearances of the Gannet
or Soland Goose, Pelecanus Bassanus. The second part of
this communication contained an account of the internal
structure    of this bird, particularly of       the  distribution    of its
air-cells, which       the   ingenious author showed to be admi
rably adapted to its mode of life, especially to its continued
residence on the water, even in the most turbulent seas
and during the most rigorous seasons.                  The second com
munication was the description and drawing of a new genus
of insect, which inhabits the cellular membrane of the gan
net ; and to which Col. Montague gives the name of Cellu-
bariu Bassani. —At the same meeting, Mr. P. Neill laid be
fore the Society a list of such fishes belonging to the four
Linnean orders Apodes, Jugulares, Thoracici, and Abdomi-
nales, as he had ascertained to be natives of the waters in
the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, accompanied with valuable
remarks, and illustrated by specimens of some of the rarer
species.      Of   the Apodes       he enumerated four        species, be
longing   to three genera      :  2toMuraena;        1 Anarhichas; and
1  Ammodytes.          Of  the   Jugulares    he mentioned 13vspecies,
belonging      to three genera       : 1 Callionymus,      the gemmeous
dragonct    ;   (for, from examining         many specimens, the au
thor  had concluded that the sordid dragonet             of Mr. Pennant
and   Dr. Shaw is not         a distinct   species,   but merely the fe

  and   2 Blennius.      Of the Thoracici     he stated 22 species, be
  longing   to nine genera : 1 Gobius ; 2 Cottus ; 2 Zeus, the
                              (a specimen of this last most resplen
  doree and the opah,
 dent fish having been taken off Cramond in the Frith of
  Forth, some years ago, and being still preserved in the mu
  seum    of P. Walker, esq.)        ; 7 Pleuronectes ; 1 Sparus, the
 toothed gilt-head, (a rare fish, of which only two specimens
  have occurred in the Frith of Forth); 2 Perca; 3 Gasteros-
 teus ;   with l Trigla. Of      the Abdominales he had ascertained
  14 species,    belonging to seven genera: 1 Cobitis ; 4 Salmo ;
 3  Esox,    the  pike, gar-pike, and the saury or gandanook,
  (which last, though rare in England, is not, it appears, un
 common at Edinburgh, but arrives in the Frith almost every
 autumn in large shoals) ; l Atherina ; 3 Clupea.                 Of the
 genus Cyprinus, of which no fewer than ten species inhabit
 the rivers and ponds of England, (including the carp, tench,
 gudgeon, dace, roach, bream,             &c),    only one insignificant
 species, the author remarked,             is found for many miles
 around the Scottish. metropolis,           viz.  the common     minow.
 Of   the genus Scomber,        the   mackrel    is  got in the entrance
 of  the  Frith of Forth. Mr.         Neill reserved the notice of the
Amphibia Nantes of Linnaeus, including               the Ray and Shark
 tribes, to a future meeting.

among whom are some of the first medical characters in the

  In our last Number                    we mentioned the election          of   a suc

Price was elected. We have, by some, been understood to
insinuate that that gentleman's election was not so fair as                            it
ought     to have been            — because      we stated that 34     of his    votes
were      by   new-made voters.               We meant only        to state     a   fact,
but not        as prejudicial          to any individual.      The election was
perfectly fair; for the rules of the                Institution allow new mem
bers to be made as freely before elections to office as at any
other period, and the friends of the unsuccessful candidates
might have        been admitted, had they presented                 themselves.

    Durham, Sunday, June          5. — The morning was cloudy, and
portended a thunder storm, and about mid.day distant thun
der was heard in the neighbourhood, attended by very vivid
lightning. The storm gradually increased till the evening
was far advanced,          and the lightning became remarkably
vivid, approaching        very close to the earth.      At nine P. M.,
as captain    W.   and  Mrs.   W.     (at present residing in    Durham)
were walking on the race-ground, a flash of lightning passed
 between them, running along the metal buttons of captain
 W.'s coat     ; he felt a sensation, as he expressed, as if a strong
 electrical shock had been given to the left side, which was
 followed by a numbness of that side for four hours after,
 and next     morning he felt a pain of the left shoulder.             He
 remarked also, " that though he has been much abroad, in
 tropical climates, he never remembers to have seen such
 vivid   lightning; and that he is persuaded that if he hail
 been only half a step further advanced it would have struck
 him lifeless !" Mrs. W. did not feel any shock, though
  she   was on the left side        of captain W.,     and close to him
  when it happened.
                    INDIAN     OR HOKSE CHESNUTS.
     M.    de la Chabaussiere,        a French    agriculturist,   has ad
  dressed the     following hints on this subject to the Editor of
  one   of the Foreign Journals* :
      " It has been stated in several Journals, that in Saxony
  chesnuts are advantageously employed in feeding cows. This
   method is also known in the environs of Montpelier, at
   which place they are sold in the market, although no per
   son has   as yet   noticed the fact.       I have long regretted    that
   so fine and so abundant a        fruit has not been turned to more
   advantage.
      "It   has been suggested, that these chesnuts might supply
   the place of soap and candles, or tapers may also be made
   of them. In Silesia, they extract the oil from the feculum

  of chesnuts,   and use the latter for making glue : this process
  was described in     1 794, in the  Lycie    des  Arts.
     " In the  same country they make a        kind of snuff of a black
  colour,  and also a horse medicine,        from chesnuts.
     " Abbe    Rozier   says, in his Agricultural Dictionary, that
 the feculum      of the chesnut mixed with other fecula will
 make wholesome and well-tasted bread.
     "We    find in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences, that
 M. Bon, of Montpelier, after having taken the bitterness
       le
 from chesnuts by macerating them in an alkaline ley for
 24 hours, and washing them every day for ten days, boiled
 them for three or four hours, when they made excellent
 food for pigeons, and kept well for some time after being
 dried.
    " The chesnut     tree (cesculus liippocastanum of Linn.) is in
 digenous   in  Asia,  whence it was brought in 1588 to Vienna.
 Bachelier brought it from Constantinople to Paris in 1615
 and in 1 656.
    " The   bark  of   the  chesnut tree is said to be an excellent
 substitute for Peruvian bark.
     " The  name of liippocastanum (horse chesnut) seems to be
derived from its having been used in some countries as food
for horses."

    Sir, Having     been in the    habit of amusing myself with
electrical experiments in my leisure hours, I was not a
little surprised on finding the difference in shocks from a
Leydea phial filled from the conductor in the common way,
and those filled as follows :       I stood on an insulated stool,
laid one finger on the prime conductor, and filled the jar
from the other ; when, on receiving the shocks, I found
them so considerably augmented, that two taken in this
manner incommoded me more than a dozen in the common
method.       Not having     seen this fact noticed in any publica
tion, it  may perhaps      prove new     to many of your readers.
Of    the cause    of the difference I     have farmed no opinion,
but the fact is correct, the same         effect   having    been expe
                                                                  rienced

     For a few days      about the middle of this month            (July)
the heat was higher than has ever           been   remembered.        The
accounts    of temperature in London         are so various,    owing to
differences of   exposure and      reflected  heat,   that they cannot
be perfectly relied upon.        We therefore      present   the  follow
ing register for   the two hottest days, taken from an accurate
thermometer      suspended in an elevated situation at Hamp-
stead, (four miles from London,) in the shade, about a foot
distant from a brick -wall facing the north, and slightly co*
vered with the foliage of currant bushes.

    Sir, As the subject of meteorology comes within                         the plan
of your periodical publication,                 perhaps    the    following     state
ment abstracted         from     a  register I    have    kept of      the   weather
 at Cheltenham         for two years past, may be worth inserting
 in the next Number of your Philosophical Magazine.
     As the weather has lately been hotter than we have ex
 perienced in Britain for some years past, and I understand
  the mercury rose in the thermometer above 90 in London,
  I beg leave to state the greatest heat and cold at Cheltenham
  by Fahrenheit's thermometers, placed in a northern aspect,
  and in the shade in the open air, where they were unexposed
  to the influence of hot walls.                   It appears the heat was for
  two days     17  degrees higher           than in the same          week     of    the
  preceding year at Cheltenham.

       The observations were made three times a day, viz. at
  eight o'clock in the morning, and one and eight P. M.
  The annual mean of the thermometer is 48-064. The highest
  degree of temperature, which was 82°, took place on the 25th
  of May;       and    the    lowest      was 18°, which      happened     on the
   24th of December,           being     14° below the freezing point. The
   range    of these extremes         is 64°: the mean, for the six summer
  months,       is 56,0574, and for winter,          40,072.
       N. B. The       upper part of the Table having no abbrevia

   mean and range, and the means upon the extremes                        of high
   and low.

been the most prevalent.   Mr. Dalton asserts, that the two
former   properly belong to  the northern temperate     zone,
arising from the two general currents of the air tending from
and towards the equator.

J.   he solution of silex in water,                              by       means peculiar to na
tural agency,           is    not confined               altogether to hot-springs, as
it   has been frequently detected                        in other mineral waters and             ;
in no     case can its presence                       be ascribed to an alkali acting as
a    medium, because                   this      is not always to be found, and,
when     it   is   detected,
                                      it
                                      is         combined with carbonic acid, which
destroys    effectually the solvent power of the alkali over silex.
In    three mineral springs, analysed     M. Stucke, the whole    by
contained silex*; and in      sulphureous water, which was
                                                 a

              the Marquis de Breze,     considerable portion of   a

  A great deal of the siliceous principle exists in the warm-
baths      of Pozzello; for,                      besides the 10 grains derived                     from
every  100 pounds of the water, there was likewise    pellicle,                             a
which formed itself upon the surface of the bath     and this,                         ;
when examined, consisted of silex, carbonate of lime, and
carbonate of magnesia                     J.
   From the experiments of M. Volta, we are informed, that
all the waters of Verona contain silex in the state of carbo
nate of lime or chalk, and, agreeably to this philosophy's
opinion, this      held in solution
                        is               means of oxygen             by                                 §.
Here,    Ithink, we may perceive that graduation of silex
into lime, which              I       mentioned            in   a    former         paragraph, and
which forms another example of                                  the prevalence         of this con
stant association in all native carbonates. In the same warm
baths of Pozzello, which      have just noticed, there
                                                 I      also                                is          a
quantity of carbonates; thus, each hundred grains of the
pellicle consisted of 86 grains of carbonate of lime,    grains                             1

for such, doubtless, is the action of various elements in the

   Few substances             are so rare as carbon,             that is,      in   its most

culiar    circumstances               under       which   the    combinations              fre

especially in all geological inquiries, that leads directly to
others of the utmost importance. It might be asked — What
was the primary state       of carbon     ?       Why    can we not separate
it from    its compounds,     and,   asmay be done with all other
simple substances, exhibit        carbon in its pure state or dia
mond, were it even in form of powder only ?
   However pure common charcoal may have been obtained,
it always seems perfectly dissimilar to the true diamond, so
much so as to lessen greatly the supposed identity of these
bodies ; thus, by whatever means they are reduced to the state
of a powder,     the diamond is always white and more like pow
dered glass, while the charcoal is intensely Hack, in proportion
to its division.  Whatever be the real nature of carbon, and
whether it may prove to be the basis of hydrogen, which,
I believe, has been suggested by some author, I shall leave
to others to decide    ;   from what          I   have   detailed, however,
respecting its alliance with silex, I am justified in this in
ference at least, that the coincidence is not casual, but ra
ther the effect   of design, and, consequently, that it is essen
tial to the   perfection of every thing of a material nature, in
which it is present.
   It has been noticed by several authors, that the peculiar
Smell, which is evolved when flint or any siliceous stone
gives out sparks of fire, is precisely the same to our senses,
as that which succeeds the electrical excitation or the strong
effectsof lightning from the atmosphere. Though conclu
sions favourable  to my theory might be deduced from this
singular fact, I shall not now avail myself of the oppor
tunity ; the electric fluid is imponderous, and I wish to con
fine these observations to material bodies only. One remark,
however, may be tolerated, and not deemed ah intrusion
on the present occasion, it is this ; that this identity of smell
stamps silex with such a degree of consequence as to assimi
late it,in this quality at least, with one of the most impor
tant objects    nature, the electric fluid of the atmosphere.
                in
   From numberless phanomena that admit of no other in
terpretation,   itmay be justly inferred, that Nature possesses
means of converting silex into other forms, and of so inter
weaving    it into the constitutions of Her varied works that

 it  ceases entirely to appear in its original state. Every thing
 connected with the progress of animal and vegetable exist
 ence ; with the inscrutable secrets        of the assimilating powers;
 or with the physiology of all organized matter, shows, that
 transmutation is an operation which we cannot disprove,
 though we may not be able to trace it through all its steps.
 As far as concerns the formation of chalk from silex, the
 next advance,     if  there be any such graduation,           is most pro
bably into clay; for, we may remark, in all chalky soils,
particularly in such as prevail in the counties of Kent and
Sussex, and other parts of England, where the superficial
Stratum    of soil  is extremely shallow, that this stratum consists
chiefly of argillaceous earth, which, like all other clays, con
tains a considerable quantity of silex in the condition of sand.
So prevalent is this mixture of sand in clay, that there never
was a specimen of porcelain clay, or of any other species
whatever, that did not include a portion of siliceous matter;
and the most useful clays, those employed for china and pot
tery in general, seldom contain less than 50 per centum of
silex.
    The power of silex as an oxidizing, saturating and neu
tralizing agent, is by no means confined to rocks, moun
tains, and other inanimate parts of created matter, but it
pervades, also as an essential element, the structure of all or
ganized beings, and occupies a distinguished place both in
the animal and vegetable ceconomy.                    " Nothing is more
astonishing," says Dr. Smith,
                                         "  than the secretion of flinty
earth by plants"       — and    this is a fact that       "  is well ascer
tained*."
    That this most      dense and insoluble       substance     is truly se
creted by the peculiar assimilating           faculty of    the   vegetable
alone, and never imbibed from the soil by direct absorption,
seems certainly to be the more feasible theory; indeed it is
substantiated by experiments and accords with reason and
general   facts.
    It is truly remarkable, that in            those   vegetables,    where
silex is most abundant, the chief residence is usually in the
                          * Jntroductisn to Botany.
                                                                  epidermis

epidermis and other external parts ; and, hence it is that, in
the common experiment of burning a piece of charcoal in
oxygen gas, the scintillating appearance will be more bril
liant if the charcoal be selected with the bark attached to it.
I  am assured by a          frieai, who      resided     for some     years  in
India, that, in this experiment,             he never succeeded         so well
as with the charcoal           procured    from the bamboo, and that
this produced always a most splendid combustion.                          Now,'
the bamboo is known to abound with silex, for, according
to Mr. Macie's experiments, the white matter, found between
each knot      of this   reed,   proved   to be true       silex*.    In fact,
the whole tribe (arundo),           and also the straw        of oats, wheat,
barley, and, perhaps, every vegetable similarly constructed,
seem to derive their necessary strength, tenacity, and some
other peculiar requisites chiefly from the silex.
    Straw has been very successfully used in this country for,
the manufacture of paper, and though the colour of this
paper remained unchanged, yet in its texture and other pe
culiar properties, it appeared to be little inferior to that which
is generally made.           The bamboo, I am informed, answers
likewise for this purpose, and in some parts of India it is in
constant use. This circumstance is an additional proof of the
efficacy of silex in the manufacture of paper. I do not recollect
that common flax,          of which   the best paper i3 principally made
in this country, has yet been analyzed ; by analogy one
would conclude this also must contain the siliceous princi
ple.     In Mr. Davy's experiments f» the straw or stems of
corn, grasses, and some other vegetables yielded a notable>
quantity of silex, and, what must be considered as one of its
most intimate associates, there was also carbonate of potash ;
and from the ashes of straw', a piece of fine white transparent
glass was produced, perfectly soluble in water and indecom
posable by acids.         The culms of      the grasses appeared to        Mr.
D.   to contain      more silex and       a  much larger proportion          of
potash    even     than the corn.       In 200 grains of the culm            of
wheat, which, when burned, gave 31 of ashes, this gentle
man obtained 13 grains of silex and IS of potash, which was

with the blue flame from the blow-pipe, beginning at one
end of the straw, this was converted into a fine pellucid
globule of glass, almost fit for microscopic experiments.                                         Itj

account of its carbon only     for saw-dust and many other

ligneous bodies, which                  contain       more carbon, prove to be
inferior or          useless.    The straw of oats, particularly,       burned    is
and the ashes are employed to polish marble, and this must
consequently arise from the silex, of which about one half
of      the ashes       chiefly consist      ;    for according to         M. Vauque-
hn's analysis, in               100   parts, there         are 55       of silex besides
other matters *.
        In no   case whatever does           it     appear that silex can be con

     I   am strongly induced to establish this as a general maxim,
that wherever potash is collected or, shall we say, generated
in the vegetable structure, there, by necessity, there must
also be silex.   All the potash of commerce contains si-
lex, and, in whatever way it is purified, it is difficult to
divest it completely of this substance ; for, unless it be su
per-saturated by carbonic acid, or some other scientific mode
pursued                  it,
                     potash never quits entirely this sub

without exception, from whatever source        derived, and

     In   the experiments to which I allude, the seeds were sown
  in  a variety   of  the most insoluble bodies, as sulphur,           glass,
  leaden shot, litharge, sand and such like                 matters,  which
 could not assuredly yield of themselves any nourishment,
 but merely to serve as the supports, to which the fibres of the
  roots might cling. In all these instances the plants grew and
 generally seemed to thrive ; but whether they prospered in
 the same degree as plants that are raised under common cir
 cumstances,       I am not disposed to affirm;        it is quite sufficient
 for my purpose        to find, that they yielded the same principles
 by analysis as vegetables of the same species generally contain,
 when cultivated in the usual way or left to nature ; and that
 potash, silex, lime, the salts and, in short, all the products
 peculiar to each species were obtained. There are many very
 pertinent remarks upon this process by M. Braconnot, who
seems to have accomplished his object                with great attention
and ability *. Various arguments have been offered tending
 to invalidate the conclusions drawn from this method of ex
perimenting; but, all          those which     I have seen,     amount to a
xnerusim'ple      denial of (he facts, or to captious objections built
upon unfair premises.
     Contrary to a very generally adopted theory, it appears, that
plants, during their vegetation, do not.emit oxygen or pure
air ; that nitrogen is not necessary to their growth, though
they     very   frequently exhibit it to he in their composition;
        ,«
that       oxygen is, by the vegetative process, converted into
carbonic acid without entering into the vegetable system ;"
that neither the presence nor absence of carbonic acid causes
the least difference in the health and growth of plants ; and
that it is always, however, necessary that oxygen should be
present.       It is farther remarked, " that, instead of absorb
ing carbonic acid from          the atmosphere, plants,        by their ve
getation, are       constantly producing it        ;"    and that, " since
carbonic      acid is necessarily a product and consequence of
germination, it seems absurd to consider it at the same time
as an exciting principle and a cause."            To    these observations
I   may add the following question, by the same intelligent

excretions * i                                                                •
    Few circumstances occur in the ceconomy of vegetables
more inexplicable           than the circulation and accumulation
in particular    receptacles of insoluble salts, and, among others,
particularly    that  of phosphate of lime, which is very abundant
in most kinds of grain, though it is chiefly situated in the
seed.     Though the last part formed in the whole period of
growth, the seed is the proper receptacle for this solid and
insoluble compound.             How such        a salt  should pass through
the whole circulation           to be deposited in the most distant
extremity, is truly wonderful.               It may be said, by way of
explanation, that, by an excess of acid, this salt becomes
verv soluble, and that vegetables in general contain acids.
This position, however, is untenable ; for these vegetables,
especially oats and wheat, have a great deal of carbonate of
lime or chalk in their stems, leaves, and other parts ; and as
the super-phosphate must pass this way before it can arrive
in  the grain,     it is evident that this phosphate of lime could
not pass with impunity but must be arrested in its progress
by the carbonate.
    It is not only     in  the composition         of vegetable bodies, but
even    in  the   animal      organs, silex seems to have been either
disregarded      or considered as a mere accidental material.               It
is true, that it does not occur so copiously as in the vege
 table constitution,        nevertheless      it is assuredly necessary to
 the animal perfection ; and           if we appeal       to the nature and
 functions of some animals, we must either confess this sub
 stance to be quite essential to the life of such animals, or give
 some     more satisfactory reasons for it* presence in their or

 I should suppose, by no very forced analogy, the hair of all
 animals whatever, contains silex as                a  constituent    element.

For the discovery of silex in human hair we are indebted to
the industry and sagacity of M. Vauquelin ; and from that
gentleman's labours we learn, that besides a notable portion
of silex in hair, there .ire many other ingredients ; thus,
he shows sulphur, iron, carbon, lime, phosphorus, man
ganese, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, as the associates
of silex in the hair, of which he analyzed several specimens *.
The manner in which this substance is assimilated and de
posited, and whence it originates, are certainly important
questions ; for, here silex seems to have preferred the most
inaccessible situation of the whole human frame, as if it
would shun detection.                 If it    is,   therefore, in the constitution
of hair, we must              be compelled to admit that               itcirculates in
cur fluids      ;I    believe, however, there              is   at least one strong
objection against this conclusion, which on the present oc

                On the Identity    of Silex and Oxygen.            171
there Is a fair claim     upon the silex as the origin of this aci
dified or oxygenated      fluid, since this acid was created in the
very cell and immediate         vicinity where silex   never  fails to
reside.
     There is commonly a large quantity of siliceous stones,
sand, and small gravel in the gizzards of birds; in some it
is in minute grains, and in others, such as ducks, geese,
 turkeys, and other domestic poultry, it is considerable both
in size and quantity, according to the nature and peculiar
 habits of each species. I have taken pieces of silex, from the
 gizzard of a goose, some of which weighed thirty grains,
and the whole contents of the gizzard were pure siliceous
 matter, quite insoluble in diluted muriatic acid, and these
 stones exceeded one ounce in weight.
      I  have  occasionally seen gizzards quite empty, and at
other times have met with them completely crammed.                   It.
 is absurd to say these insoluble stones are for the purpose of
 grinding the food,      and  I  believe   no other reason   has ever
 been     advanced    to  account for this extraordinary accumu
 lation.
      It  has been    proved, that, independently of this silex. in.
 the gizzard,       birds discharge more solid matter than the
 amount of their food ; that their feathers grow very ra
 pidly, and, whatever the species of the food be, these are
 always of the same nature ; likewise, that the chalk or car
  bonate of lime of the egg-shell, together with what is found
  of the    same   chalky   substance    in the excrements, exceeds
  in weight    the whole   of  the lime contained in the oats,     with
  which the animal was nourished for this experiment.
       As there is a considerable difficulty in accounting for some
  most curious phaenomena respecting the physiology of birds,
  in which the formation of lime is effected, this silex of the
  oats or food, together with what is contained in the gizzard,
   must, I should tnink, be the only source from whence the
   newly created substance, the egg-shell, can be derived. It is
  also to be noticed, that, in these experiments, the food con
   tained no carbonate of lime, it is the phosphate of lime of
   which    oats  are composed;       and, respecting the egg-shell,
   nearly nine-tenths of its weight      are carbonate of lime. "Are
    t                                                                we

  periments,     **
                     that it is the siltx which has served to furnish
 this excess    of lime   ?    For this   purpose    it would  be necessary
 that it should absorb nearly five times its weight of some
 unknown principle*."
     But it is not merely carbonate of lime that            is generated   in
 this case at the expense of silex, there is also a quantity of
 phosphoric acid; for a larger quantity of the phosphate of
 lime is voided with the excrements than can be derived from
 the oats, and yet there is less silex.
     The  case is indeed so        evident that, to me at least, there
 appears    no objection to the conclusions drawn by M. Vau
 quelin    from his experiments. These I shall endeavour to
give in his own terms ; and, that they may be more gene
rally known, I shall endeavour to translate the substance of
them into English.
    " If  the experiments are exact, if they do not include
some circumstances not accounted for, we are forced to
draw the following conclusions:                   1st. That a portion of
lime has been formed from the oats by the act of digestion
and animalization ; 2d, that a quantity of phosphoric acid
has also been generated ; 3d, that a certain quantity of car
bonate    of lime      has   likewise been created.        There was less
silex discharged than the oats contained, consequently some
of this body had either disappeared or put on some other
form."—
    " Be   it as it may, it is not less certain that a considerable
amount of lime, as well in the state of carbonate as in that
of phosphate,        has formed    itself in    the   organs of the hen,
and that a quantity        of silex has disappeared. Though these
conclusions be still not very certain^ the results of the ex
periments on which they are founded deserve, nevertheless,
a high degree       of credit  ; and   if  new efforts, often repeated,
should be conformable to            these, we must be compelled to
acknowledge from them, that, during the digestion               of thehen,
silex is converted into lime."
    It were superfluous to expatiate          upon every case in which

        as
or in the numerous examples that abound in the animal or
vegetable ceconomy ; but, fearing I may have already tres
passed upon the patience of your readers,     I shall, for the
present at least, quit this subject, with the  full assurance,
that the extensive influence of silex, its magnitude, ubi
quity and importance, its uniform intrusion into organized
bodies, where earths and more soluble matters are denied —
that, from these and other considerations, this question will
be indulged with an open and impartial reception by all who
may peruse these remarks.
  In the course of this discussion, which             I have   endeavoured,
as much as possible, to epitomize, I have occasionally shown,
that I have some reliance on geological proofs for support.
These, however, are so intimately connected with facts and
reasoning which must depend upon mineralogy, metallurgy
and all other branches of chemical knowledge, that I did
not deem it requisite to consider these separately; and,
therefore,    I do not rest my opinion upon the merits of
                    as
any solitary fact, I shall claim every latitude that the science
of geology, in this acceptation of the term, can comprehend.
   There are few subjects in which speculation and hypothe
tical reasoning have been more freely indulged, and the most
opposite and even extravagant theories defended, than in
geology ; it must be confessed, however, that no science has
a fairer claim on the most liberal and dispassionate reason
ing. Indeed, while the mysteries of nature are at such an
awful and inaccessible distance, human curiosity will ever
be on        the     and, in all difficulties, the mind will

      Planche.       Read to the Pharmaceutical Sosiety              bf Paris*.
 JM. Berthollet,               in two excellent memoirs read to the
 Academy of Sciences in 1782 and                17 so, has detailed several
 remarkable properties of the sulphurous acid.
     Messrs. Fourcroy and Vauquelin have presented to the
 Institute a much more comprehensive memoir upon the
 same subject, and which exhibits the most complete history
of this acid,       and of its different combinations.             I have me
 ditated with much attention upon the labours of these learned
 chemists, and have found nothing in the whole series of
their experiments which had any connexion with what T am
about to mention          :   I  mean the changes       which the gaseous
or liquid sulphurous acid produces in the syrup of violets
reddened by different acids, and vice versa.
     I think myself the more bound to publish this new
property of the sulphurous acid, as it may furnish an in
teresting, subject of reflection upon the theory of acids in
general.

was prepared by the decomposition of very pure sulphuric
acid upon equally pure. mercury.             With respect to the ma
nual operation,      I  followed that which was pointed out by
Jtf. Berthollet.
   My violet syrup was a very fine blue, without mixture.
   first Experiment. — Syrup of violets diluted with eight parts
of distilled water, and coloured          red by the    nitric, muriatic,
fulphuric, phosphoric, or acetic acids, resumes, upon the
addition of liquid sulphurous acid, its blue colour, a little
Jess intense, to be sure,        than before     its change into red ;
but without any mixture          of this  last colour.
   Second Experiment. —The above acids, added gradually
to the blue liquor, instautly restore its primitive red colour,
the acetic acid excepted, the action of which is some minutes
slower, and it must be added in a larger quantity.
    Third Experiment. —Syrup of violets diluted with a simi
lar quantity of water, and coloured red by the oxalic, citric,
tartarous, and acetous acids, also becomes blue upon adding
some drops of liquid sulphurous acid ; but these acids pre
sent, in their subsequent employment, some peculiar pro
perties, which I shall detail :
    1st. The oxalic acid, in a small quantity, produces no
change at first : we must add a considerable quantity, in
order to give the liquor a violet hue, and it is some hours
before it resumes its red colour.
   2d. The tartarous, citric,        and- acetous   acids, mixed in any
proportion with      the blue liquor,      cannot   make   it become red
again, even after being 12 hours exposed to the air.
   3d. In these three experiments the blue colour gradually!
decreased ; which shows that the sulphurous acid continues
to enjoy its property      of discharging colours, notwithstanding
the superabundance         of the other acids. AH these trials were
made    in earthen vessels, and exposed to the air ; but        it became
necessary    to ascertain if this agent had any influence in the,
colouring of the different mixtures. : this is. the reason why I
repeated the same experiments in glass bottles well closed,
and operating     as   hastily  as possible.
   fourth Experiment. —tExperiments in close Bottles.                     I

pers, some syrup of violets diluted in water, in the propor
tions mentioned above, and reddened by the same acids                  I
poured drop by drop into each flask, liquid sulphurous acid,
in a sufficient quantity to restore the blue colour; but before
adding a second drop of this acid, I took care to shake the
mixture strongly, and to observe the change in its colour :
this operation was performed upon the nine flasks succes
sively ; and the latter being corked, 1 allowed the whole to
rest for six hours.      I observed, that during this time the
blue colour had become weaker, without any             shade    of  red
having altered it.
    It was now necessary       to examine     if all  the acids    em
ployed in the preceding experiments had also the faculty of
reddening the syrup of violets rendered blue by the sulphu
rous acid. The following is the result of my experiments :
    Fifth Experiment. —With       the nitric, muriatic,     sulphuric,
and phosphoric     acids, the blue liquor became a wine red.
    With   the acetous acid it became a clear violet colour.
    With   the oxalic acid, a pale red.
    With   the tartarous, citric,  and acetous    acids, mixed in a
very large dose, no shade of red, nor any weakening of the
blue colour.
    Sixth Experiment. —Subphurous acid gas and syrup                 of
violets diluted in water, and coloured red by different acids.—'
We know that the sulphurous acid in thestate of gas has
much more energy than in the liquid state.
 . I was anxious to verify this fact, by an experiment upon
syrup of violets coloured red by the acids above mentioned.
For this purpose,     1 arranged  the apparatus    as  if  to  prepare
the sulphurous acid.       As soon as the second flask, filled two
thirds with distilled water, was saturated, I e-tablished a'
communication between it and a third flask filled with a
mixture of water and syrup of violets, or reddened by sul
phuric acid : a few bubbles of acid gas were sufficient for
giving   the liquor its blue colour.     I  replaced    this flask by
another, equally filled with syrup of          violets diluted with
water, but reddened by another acid, and so on successively
until the whole mixtures reddened by the acids mentioned
in the first experiment had been submitted to the action              of
       ;                                                            the

the gas.     I  did not remark any perceptible difference between
them; it appeared, however, as if the colour was less
weakened with the sulphurous acid gas than with the liquid
sulphurous acid.
    Besides, this slight difference might perhaps he owing to
the greater quanti'y of coloured liquor employed in the latter
experiments, and to the facility of observing the effects of
the aras, and to that or' directing its artion at pleasure.
    F"r   the present   I confine myself to a simple detail      of facts,
and   1  have reason to     think it correct.
    The same experiments repeated with sulphurous acid, ob
tained either by the intermedium of charcoal or by that of
 sugar, furnished similar results.

        every place,    and   in most    of the    houses,  I  conversed
with    the common workmen,          and endeavoured     to collect from
 them their practice and ideas of malting.              Many of them
 were old and intelligertt men, and had worked in malt-houses
all their time.       They declared, they had never used them
 selves,    or seen others use any water upon the floors ; and
they all believed it could not be employed there without in
jury. When asked, why they worked the young floors so
 cool  ?   they   said, to prevent the corn from sweating out
 the cistern water, and to keep the floors back, (meaning the
 vegetation.)       When interrogated why it was necessary to
 keep back the vegetation at tirst ? they replied, if it was al
 lowed to go on too quick at first, it would both sweat out
 the  moisture and drive out          a long tail. (root).    And when
questioned as to what        injury  \vould  result  from  a  long root?
 their reply was, it would run the inside of the corn out, and
 make light malt.          These were the actual expressions of
 many, and the ideas of all ; their opinions of the acrospire
 were also very similar.         Most of them signified that they
 wished to get it no farther than over the hack of the corn,
 meaning the thickest part of the barley, and none were de-

  sirous   of carrying it more than        three -fourths   up.    Alf of
  them maintained that the barley might be perfectly malted
  beyond the acrospirc, and that driving it up to, or beyond
  the end of the grain would spend the inside, and make the
  malt less productive.
     My enquiry was not limited         to the common         workmen,
 for I   endeavoured   to select   and   converse with many of the
 most intelligent and best informed masters ; and I met with
  several who afforded much useful information.                 Some of
  them had worked        many years themselves, and their malt
 was in the highest repute in the markets ; their account of
 the process    of malting   was to the     following    efl'ect :  That
 the cistern water was        .amply   sufficient   when the working
 was properly     conducted,    for the malting of every variety of
 barleys. That they had malted barleys from every kind of
 light and heavy soils, and fVom almost every country, even
 as far as Scotland on the one hand, and Devonshire on the
 other; and they considered       it as entirely groundless to ima
 gine that there     did any where exist a kind of barley which
 required watering on the floors more than the Hertfordshire.
Their ideas were the contrary ; for the more inferior the
barley was, tlie more readily it would spend itself by running
out in    a quick vegetation ; and the less there was of the ori
ginal substance, the less of it could be spared in the process
of malting it ; whereas their own large plump corn would,
if   the  thing  were   necessary, stand watering on the floors
beyond any other kind, less bold and abundant in body.
Nevertheless, though the fact really was that their own large
grain would stand watering better than any other of an in
ferior quality, they were well convinced, that were they to
practise watering, their malts would be light, and much in
ferior to those which they now make without watering; and
they considered it as a case almost self-evident, that if their
own full-sized barleys could be well and even best malted
without watering, the malting^of all other inferior kinds might
be still easier accomplished in the same way.
    They    were aM  of opinion,   that weight is the best criterion
of good malt, when the grain is perfectly malted, and this
was now so well known in the market, that weight and ten
                                                                 derness

dcrne?s were the only qualities in estimation there, and their
own malts preserved their superior prices entirely from these
characters.      la  the  working  process   thf y knew that both the
root and       acrospire consumed the substance of the barley,
and that the       only mode of preserving weight in malt, was
by preventing these from proceeding any farther than was
consistent w it'll the malting of the barley ; and that this
could not be accomplished if the floors were watered, tram
the too powerful vegetation which it promotes.                 Some of
them had been down in the lower parts of Suffolk, and in
other places       where watering is practised, and had observed
there,    that the custom    of watering resulted from improperly
allowing the young floors to heat, in order lo forward the
private views of the maltsters; and the consequence was
that much more root and a longer acrospire were driven out
in   these   than in the     Hertfordshire    malts, and   the  former
were, on that account, for the most part lighter than the
latter, by twenty pounds in four bushels.
    I also met with several intelligent common brewers, who
were likewise considerable maltsters,          and who declared, that
thtir experience in brewing had confirmed to them thai up
wards of half a barrel of wort of equal quality could be
drawn from a quarter of unwatered malt more than from
malt which had been watered on the floors.              They    related
many other interesting particulars, all directly in favour of
malt made without watering; and they declared their opi
nions, both as brewers and maTtsters, not only to be de
cidedly in preference of such malts, but also that every va
riety of barleys might be readily and best malted without any
sprinkling upon-the floor.
   In my progress through the country I visited the brew
eries,   and examined the ales and         goods in the mash tuns,
and more especially the grains,         which were thin transparent
husks, and more perfectly spent than I ever recollect seeing
before. The usual lengths were three barrels and a half to
a quarter    of mail,    and this I know to be upwards of half a
barrel more      than  the brewers in Manchester draw from their
malts, and the ales of the latter       I also think inferior.

where any brown malt was making, and at one of these onty
two steeping? were in operation.    At another place a little
amber malt wa» in process, and these were the only porter
malts (except the pale) which occurred to notice in the whole
enquiry.    In truth there cannot prevail a more erroneous
opinion  than  that which the agents oF the watering party
endeavoured to inculcate, and apparently with much suc
cess, in the committee of enquiry into malting, that the
Hertfordshire        malts arc manufactured with an exclusive view
to the brewing        of porter,   and are, on that account, unfit tor
the brewing of country ales.     Very little porter indeed (I
found it only at one house) is drunk in any of the place*
which I visited ; and the ales are all brewed from the same
pale malts which are sent in such abundance to the London
market.
  The   vast mass of pale malt which I saw in operation is
perfectly well adapted for the brewing of evcrv species of the
best ales that are or can be made in any pait of the king
dom ; and I humbly think that its superior weight, price,
and quantity of wort drawn from              it,
                                        all demonstrate that          it

from the large and stronger grain.

found the practice of watering the corn upon the floors very
general.   Ivisited in all about 60 malt houses of this de
scription.   At some the steepings were made at every third,
and  at others every fourth day. From four to six floors were
depending at each house, and the steepings were dried off             a
third part at    a   time.   For   the first three days after the barley

   To obtain this increase of measure     most certainly, one            is,
of the objects of watering the floors. Before the wet corn
can be brought forward to the kiln, most of the water given
   on the floor must again-be worked out of      because                                   it,         if

and the circumstance of being obliged again to work the
water out of the grain, keeps    several days longer from the

 being so dry and floury             when brought         to   the kiln   as the
 Hertfordshire malt.
    The    same object, that      of an increase     of  measure,    also occa
 sions the acrospire beine driven quite up to the end of the grain,
 and very frequently much beyond it. The longer it is suf
 fered to grow the more it distends the body of the corn, and
 of  course increases       the bulk    of    the malt.      In  several  of the
 old floors which        I examined I found the acrospire driven an
 inch out     of the grain, and so unequal was the vegetation in
 many      of  the   same     steepins;s,    that the acrospire was of all
 lengths, from upwards of an inch out down into the body of
 the grain.      In many floors too the corn was run together in
 hard bunchy knots,          by the fibres      of the root growing and
,strongly matting together.             This originated on the water
 given on the floors puddling in holes, and                   the corn     there
 getting    a larger   proportion.      All this mischievous inequality
 of vegetation       arose    entirely from      the  water given on the
 floors,    and it is more or less        inseparable from the practice.
 Nothing similar        appeared on any of the Hertfordshire             floors,
 and   I also observed      that manv of the old watered floors were
 mouldy, much beyond any which I saw in Hertfordshire.
 It is called in the west finnerv, appearing to be very com
 mon in those mailings, and it was said, by some, to be oc
 casioned by the floors not being watered more early. But
 this was rather an excuse than an explanation, for it very
 evidently results from the wet corn heating, and being after-
 wards excluded too long from the influence of the atmo
 sphere.
    Exclusive      of   the   double root which I have             mentioned,
 and which cannot fail           greatly to exhaust the corn, I paid
 particular attention to the quantity of root which appeared
 on the grain in most of the floors, and it certainly was not
 less   than double the quantity which I had observed in the
 Hertfordshire      floors, and this I consider as one of the chief
 causes    of the lightness and inferiority         of  the malt.
    In   the west, as in Hertfordshire,           I  entered     into   conver
 sation with the common workmen,                 and endeavoured        to draw
 from them information           on the subject of their employment.             '
 Most of them maintained that watering on the floors was
                                                                    beneficial,

consisted,  the conclusion almost invariably was, that it was
better tor their masters, meaning that it produced an in

knew of no other purpose it answered, and others could only
say that along with an increase it also improved the husk                  of
the malt, by making it brighter. There was not one, how
ever, who contended that watering made better malt for a
brewer, and, almost every individual of them, allowed that
it threw out more root, and on that account made light malt.
   I also enquired of and waited upon several of the most
intelligent maltsters,         to learn what they had to say upon the
subject    of watering.       Some    of them     said they had made malt
without watering, but that when                so made,   it measured     less
than the original barley, and the trade was this season so
bad, that without an increase of measure there would be Jjo
profit ; they all contended for this increase of measure, and
one of the principal maltsters declared he had made good
malt with an increase of two bushels in twenty, but cer
tainly the epithet can apply to such malt in no other way
than good for sale.    The same gentleman declared he was
making   his malt this season without watering, but the con-:
dition in which I found his corn on the floor evidently dis
proved tbis assertion.  The reason he gave for not now wa
tering was, that he made chiefly for a considerable brewer,
who insisted- on the grain not being watered ; and the brew
er's reason for this was said to be, that watering so late as
the tenth day made the malt finncry (mouldy), and injured
the flavour of his ale.  It          is,
                               however, easy to imagine that
the true       reason   of   the brewer was, that      watering impove
rished the malt.
     The maltsters all complained of being greatly undersold
by what     called ship malt upon the coast, and said they

and that the injury     received in malting, and the frauds
                              it
which occasioned its being sold so low, could only originate
in   the abuse      of watering profusely on       the floors.   I   met with

detections and prosecutions had betm had thereon, and                                                it   is
impossible to doubt that these frauds have been and still are
looked up to "as  source of very pioductive emolument, ex
                         a
clusively annexed to the watering system.       Tn fact, not
withstanding       the preference given in the market to the Hert
                                                                                           fordshire

                                     On Malting.                                  185
fordohire malts, they urge no complaint against that quarter,
or appear to consider the maltsters there as at all their rivals;
but they speak of being greatly injured by what they call the
low country and coast maltsters ; and they all admit that the
interior priced malts made there can only arise From fraud
and watering, admitting, certainly, that their own frauds
have been suppressed while the others are still going on.
   Having thus had opportunities of personally examining
the two different modes               of manufacturing malt,          1     can now
speak more confidently on the practical merits                  of each.           In
Hertfordshire         they are endeavouring to preserve ali the sub-
Stance they possibly can              in   the malt for the   purpose        of   ob
taining      weight,        whereas in the west          they are purposely
driving    the substance out           of   the grain,   in order to blow up
the bulk      of   the       malt.     Both objects admit of different de
grees   of   abuse.         In Hertfordshire    I could observe that some
of   the maltsters were taking their malt too early to the              kiln,
and were      drying        it there less    perfectly than it ought in both
cases to promote its weight. In the west, besides wasting
the corn by running out a second root, the acrospire was
allowed to shoot up out of the grain, in order that it might
spread over the back and increase the measure.      It is also
material to remark,  that the lighter the malt  the less          is,               it
will press down in the bushel, and thereby measure the
more.    The Hertfordshire abuse has its limits, and can
never extend to any mischievous length without defeating
itself, but the watering abuse supports itself the emolu       by
ment rising      nearly proportionate ratio.

                                                                    by it
simple to make     question
                        a         even decided
                                       ;    it   is the very
 p-inciples upon which the   two parties proceed the  one       :                  la
 bours to preserve the substance of the malt, the other pur
 posely to dissipate it. The emolument of the former hangs
 on the specific gravity of the commodity, and that of the
 latter on its levity.            -
     The practice of watering upon the floors,      humbly preI
 sume, has never had or can have any other object            view            in
 than that of the individual interest of the maltster, and as  the
 sacrifice which he makes in the light and impoverished arti
                                                                                   cle

 cle which he manufactures,         is a loss that fulls wholly   on the
 consumer, and he, very generally in the country, knows
 but little of the injury which has been done; all the advan
 tage, without any share in the loss, rests with the manu
facturer.
    The numerous detections of the frauds of short wetting
 sufficiently establish their extent; and the great quantities
of low priced malts that are still brought to market, prove
that these frauds are yet in operation ; and indeed, to any
one conversant with the revenue, it is easy to imagine that,
this must be the case, for it is well known that excise tra
ders, who have         once shared     in  the large emoluments     of a
considerable fraud, will not, even by numerous prosecutions,
be driven from the practice while they are left in possession
of the same means. It is on this account that so many suc
cessive improvements are necessary in the revenue laws ; as
new frauds are developed, new legal regulations are become
expedient, to deprive the unfair trader of his nefarious
means;      and this   I humbly think     is the  only effectual mode
of suppressing      the gigantic frauds    of short wetting   at  malt-
houses.
    That the    present  legal restriction against watering scarcely
operates at all in protection    of the revenue, and but    very feebly
in aid of the commodity, cannot, I humbly conceive, be doubt
ed.    That material fact, that all fraudulently short wet com
assumes a false age, viz. that of the preceding steeping, as
soon   as  it is laid upon the floor, and that the regulation of
such false age is very much within the power of the maltster,
fully   proves   that such fraudulent corn can be timely watered
under the present restriction, almost with impunity ; and
the general practice of watering, which is still so much pur
sued, also shows that the quality of the malt is not at pre
sent within the limits of legal protection.
    The former restriction of twelve           days  was  much     more
effectual for both purposes, and certainly afforded all the ac
commodation that a fair and honourable investigation of the
case can discover to be necessary ; and to sum up the whole :
although that branch of the subject which includes fraud on
the revenue be of itself of sufficient magnitude to demand
                                                                 strong

strong legal interference in the process of malting, yet in
my humble judgment, that most improvident waste of the
Commodity and mischievous injury to the community, which,
certainly do result from the practice of watering malt upon
the floors, furnish out a case of national grievance, equally
deserving the consideiation            of  the legislature.

XXXV. An            improved Method of making Muffles for Che
        mical Purposes.           By Mr. Edmund Turreli,*.
       MY LORDS AND GKNTLEMEN,
JLJ.AVING experienced much inconvenience in                      the common
mode     of moulding muffles on wooden blocks, for                   the use   of
chemists, enamellers, &c.               I  beg leave to lay before your
 praise-worthy Society,           an improved method, possessing the
following advantages : namely,
     First, By this new method of moulding                  muffles, coarser
 and cheaper materials may be used than can be employed in
the common mode ; and which also gives them the valuable
 property of resisting a greater degree of heat.
     Secondly, That much time will be saved by this improved
 method of manufacturing them, must be allowed, when the
 two modes arc compared.
     Thirdly, The certainty of making them without cracks or
 flaws, and with coarser materials, will appear obvious, when
it is considered,         that   by this     improv<<!    method,      they are
 internally    moulded        instead   of externally ; by which means
 the strcngih     of   the operator may have its full effect, in firmly
 compressing       the   composition into the mould.
     Whereas, in the old mode, the workman, after havin**
 spread the composition             upon a cloth, guessing at its thick
 ness, bends it over the block in the best way he can, and by
 thus disturbing the composition,               he must needs make many
    • From Transactions
                           of the Society for  the Eneourazmienl  of Arts,  Manu
factures, and Commerce,     lor  1807.     Ten guinea* were voted fur this com
 munication.
                                                                           crackr

188              An improved Method of making Muffles
cracks and flaws, which                       can   be but imperfectly          closed in
smoothing the surface                   of   the muffle, whilst upon the block.;
the evil consequence attending which is, its being subject
to fly or crack when exposed to a great heat ; and it will also
be plainly seen,  that, in the old mode, a great disadvantage
is felt by  the sides  of the muffle, whilst in its wet state,
hanging from its centre, and which also tends to crack                                    it,
as there can be nothing applied to assist    in this case, but     it
by employing             a  proportion of cohesive clay in the
                              greater
composition, which, however, produces little         any advan            if
tage; whereas in the mode which         have invented, this fault
                                                       I
is  entirely obviated,  and   the composition,      its contrac           by
tion   indrying, assists the extrication of the muffle from the
mould.
  Fourthly, With respect to simplicity, this new mode
will be found to possess very great advantage, for
                                         a            boy of                    a
twelve years  of age may be  taught to make them   in   very                        a
short time.
     The fifth       advantage           in this improvement, and of equal
consideration,            is   the cheapness      of the article the price of
                                                                          ;
*which has been reduced nearly one-third to the consumer                                  ;
and when ike superior  quality of them      taken into consi       is
deration,   may fairly bt said to be full one-half.
                it                                      mean,                   I
when regard    had to their superior quality
                     is                           and that the           ;
muffles may be used over again when broken and ground,
with much less proportion of cohesive clay than in the old
       a
mode; and this conceive to be no inconsiderable advan
                          I
tage for
       ;     well known, that when the old muffles or
                it   is
broken crucibles can be used without much fresh clay, they
are far superior to new materials.
     Sixthly, The muffles                    made     in   the old way arc seldom         of
equal thickness           ;    whereas        those    made according to the me
thod which           I   have the honour to present before the Society,
will   be found to possess that necessary quality in perfection:
for,   if   an hundred           are made             from the same          mould,     they
will   be all   of       the same thickness.
             Description          of    the    Moulds and Implements.
     The first mould for this purpose                         is   a    tjn one, Fig.     1,
                                                                                      (Plate

(Plate    V.) which may                 be    made from a piece              of tin   the size
of   the arch,          being bent so            as   to form such a concavity as
may best suit the purpose to which it is to be applied ; this
being done, two square pieces of tin, a a, must have an
arch cut out of them, of such   size thai the diameter thereof
                                                 a
.may be about three-fourths of an inch less than the diame
 ter of the concave piece before stated ; these being soldered
to each end            of   the first-mentioned          piece, will form a stand
for the hollow              part   of   the    mould,    and the thickness of the
muffle moulded in this will be exactly determined by the
edge at each end.   A piece of hollow tin, b bf may be sol
dered along the top edge of the mould, to form a better re
sistance to the great pressure within. The next part of this
mould is a flat piece of tin, Fig. 2, cut exactly to fit the
inside of the mould, the use of which        to form   solid           is,               a
back to the muffles used for chemical purposes.
     The second tool for
                       th'i3 purpose     piece of sheet brass,
                                                         is   a

bent in  semicircular form, and screwed to      piece of wood

               a
 extending beyond its breadth about an inch,       used for cut
 ting the small air holes   (Fig. 11), in the aforesaid muffles.

    The third    the tool or frame, Fig. 4, for preventi/icr the
                       is
 contraction           of    the muffles in drying,           which          is   made   of four
 pieces    of      beech, about three quarters                of an inch broad, and
 half    inch thick
          an                        ;   the length must be adjusted to the
 mould of the muffle;                   two of these being laid parallel within
 the inside            of   the     mould,      and
                                  being joined across bv the
 other two, the ends of which should extend so far beyond
 the outer edges of the other two, that they may rest upon
 the edges of the muffle mould, and thereby prevent its fall
 ing into the mould.
    The fourth   the tool for spreading the composition into
                            is
 the moulds, which       formed of iron or steel, (Fig. 5),
                                     is
 about thirteen inches    length, one inch and
                                        in        half broad,                     a
 and about one-eighth thick    its face under being; rounded
                                                ;                        A

 curve     of      the muffle mould              (Fig.   6,    section of it); this
                                                              is   a

                                                                                              end,

 190       An improved Method of making Muffles
end, long enough to be bent in the form of, a bricklayer's
trowel, and by the wooden handles which must be put on,
hanging down, it will be tound, that, as it is moved either
backwards or forwards, it will always present an edge to
smooth the composition, and condense it in the mould.
   The fifth is a frame (dd),       Fig. 15,  of which   the bottom
and farthest side      only   are shown,    and in which frame the
tin mould,    Tig.  1,  is placed, simply constructed by joining
two pieces of    wood, the one as broad as the bottom of the
muffle mould,      and   having    two narrow groves (ec), cut in
it, so that the edges of the tin mould may be confined
therein ; the other board being joined to this, at its edge,
should come up so high as just to be under the edge of the
mould.
   The sixth is the tool for cutting the muffles of different
lengths (Fig. 7), and is made of a piece of wood, to the end
of which is fixed a thin piece of brass (f), which extending
about one inch and one-fourth beyond the top of the wood,
is bent at right angles, and made thinner at the end, that it
may the more conveniently cut the muffle ; under this piece
of wood is used another straight piece (g), with two steady
pins, which being shifted at the will of the workman, will
cut them of any length.
   The seventh is the mould for forming the bottom of the
close muffle (Fig 8), which is made of a mahogany or oak
plank, about sixteen inches long, ten wide, and about
three-eighths of an inch thick ; upon this is fixed a ledge on
each side, one inch broad, and nearly          half an inch thick,
and at each end a ledge       of the  same  kind is placed, at such
a distance as is   best   suited to the    length of the bottom re
quired.    Fig. 9 and 10, are circular moulds for muffle bot
toms of dial plates.      Fig. 1 1, a complete muffle standing on
its bottom.    Fig. 12, a roller for rolling the composition in
the first mould.     Fig.    13, a tool for making    small holes in
the muffle.
   The usual composition for making muffles is as follows ;
viz. two parts pipe clay and one part sand, such as is used
by the bricklayers,      sifted, and mixed      together to a proper
                                                        consistence ;

                     for  Chemical Purposes.                       1gi
consistence ; ibis is very expensive, on account of the high
price of pipe clay, which is about ten shillings the hundred
weight, whereas I employ in my improved mode of making
them the coarser kind of Stourbridge clay, which can be had
at the ulass-houses, in the ground state, for six shillings the
hundred weight, and this I sift also, to separate the finer
part, which I employ lor making other smaller articles ne
cessary in my business ; using only the grosser or coarser
part for/muffles, to which I add one-eighth part only of pipe
clay, mixing them well together with water, so as to form
a mass of a pretty thick consistence.          The tin mould being
iirst greased,  I place it in  the   frame Fig, 15, shown under
Fig. I,   and  having spread     the   composition in the mould,
and smoothed it with the spreader,         Fig. 5, till the mould is
quite full, the flat piece  of tin is then to be well greased, and
thrust in at one end        of the mould, and the back of the
muffle is then formed       by spreading the composition,          and
firmly pressing it against the part already formed. The next
thing to be done is to cut the holes in the sides of the muf
fle, which is done by pressing the semicircular cutter, Fig. 3,
into the sides thereof, while it is yet wet, and bringing the
piece out entire  :  the tin mould must now       have    the irame,
Fig. 4,   put in to keep the sides    of the muffle from contract
ing,   and  being   set  up end-ways, and a little inclined, it
must be dried in the sun, until it has shrunk sufficiently- to
leave the mould, after which it must be completely dried
and burned in the usual manner.
    The composition of the smaller implements, or muffle,
bottoms for dial plates, for the mould Figs. o and 10, is
made of the finer part of the Stourbridge clay, with a small
proportion of pipe clay.

XXXVL            Description     of    a    Mac! ine    for raising Coals or

       sir,
  J- he improvement of             the     machines in use for raising coal
 and ore from the mines, Ins long bev n a desideratum of the
Society 'or the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and
 Commerce,         and they have          repeaieJly offered     a premium for
that purpose.
     Those in general use (from the increased expense of horse
labour), are worked by a steam engine, attached to a crank
of iwenty-one niches radius,                 wedged on a shaft       along with
 a  fly wh'-el, eleven or twelve feel in diameter, and pinion
 wheel, of eleven teeth, which latter works in another of
 sixt-v four teeth, on the shaft of which is a plain cylindrical
 barrel, from four to six feet diameter, and nine or ten feet
    * From T'amai-lio-is oflht     Society  for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufac
 tures, ar.d Commerce,  for 1S-07.       Twenty guineas were voted by the Society
 to Mr. Gilpin for this invention.
                                                                             long;

                     or other Articles from Mines\                   193
long    ;  some   have   barrels formed      of frustums of cones,
 (whose perimeters are in the proportion of about five to four),
 united at their bases, and of various diameters; the axes of
 both kinds    are placed at right angles with the centre line of
 the pit, and at each end a rope of six inches in circum
 ference is made fast by a staple, which ropes work (in con
 trary directions. at the same time) over two pulleys, placed
in a frame parallel to each other, and at an equal distance
 from the centre     of the pit ; to the ends     of  these   ropes the
 baskets   of coal and ore to be raised are hooked.
     The simplicity of their general structure is such as, per
 haps, not to admit of any considerable improvement i but
 the forms of the barrels are very defective.
     On putting    one  of  these  machines in motion         each rope
 forms a triangle, the lines thereof from the pulley to the
 first and last coil, and the surface of the barrel, forming its
 three sides.      Upon the cylindrical barrel the load always
 tends, from gravitation, towards the nearest point of con
 tact with the centre     of motion of    the barrel,   and, in conse
 quence, the ascending rope at first bends around it in re
 ceding coils from the subtending side of the triangle, dimi
 nishing their distances as they approach the nearest point of
 contact,    (where the rope crosses the centres of the pulley
 and barrel at right angles,) thereby leaving a great part of
 the latter uncovered by the rope, and hence the necessity
of such long ones; afterwards coiling            hard against itself as
it  approaches    the other side  of  the   triangle,  to its great in
jury in wear.
    The barrels formed of frustums of cones, uniteii at their
bases, whose perimeters are in the proportion of about five              •
to four, are equally defective, on account of the rope, for
 the   reason  before    mentioned,    binding hard against itself,
 and even sometimes (in wet weather, when its rigidity is
increased by absorption of water,) folding at first in receding
 coils, and afterwards so hard against itself as to force those
 receding coils to slip suddenly towards the small perimeter
 of the cone, thereby making a large portion of the rope to
descend the pit in an instant, breaking the rope by the sud-

  194        Description   of a Machine for raising Coals
  den  jerk,   and frequently causing the    immediate destruction
  of the men who may be ascending the pit at the time, or
  dashing to pieces the basket and its contents.
    Besides the unnecessary expence arising from the use of
  hempen ropes, and the breakage of chains when applied in
 the common way, the forms of the barrels are quite erro
  neous in principle.      Some are cylindrical ; others formed of
 frustums of cones       united at their bases, without any deter
 minate proportion in their perimeters, or regard to the weight
 of the rope or chain working thereon, both of which are
 absolutely necessary to acquire a maximum effect.
    The convex surface of a frustum of a cone, is = to the
 convex surface of a cylinder of the same altitude, having its
 circumference = to half the sum of the perimeters of the
 frustum : and circumferences of circles being to one another
 as   their diameters, the surface of      a barrel   formed   of two
 frustums     of right cones (united     at their   bases),  each   64
 inches diameter at one end, 32 at the other, and            54. long,
 which is the size we have       adopted  here,  is = to  the surface
 of a   plain cylindrical one, 48 inches diameter, and 108 long.
 Each will therefore bend the same length of cordage in an
 equal number of revolutions, and so far they are equal to
each other;       but they vary very considerably in the momenta
 required to work them.
    Let   a =   the weight  of  the basket   of coal,   and 0 = that
of  the descending part     of the chain ;  then, on the cylindrical
barrel, when the former is hooked to the end of the latter,
and eased from the bottom of the pit (the opposite chain
Wing bent on the barrel), a + b = the counterpoise required
at 24 inches radius ; and       when it is wound       up to the top
(the descending part of the opposite chain            hanging down
the pit), a — b — the counterpoise required at the same
radius.
    On the    barrel formed   of frustums of right cones, when
the load is eased from the bottom of the pit, it and the chain
are suspended       from one of the smaller perimeters (the op
posite chain being bent on the barrel), -£ + t — tne coun
terpoise required at 32 inches radius; and when it is wound
                                                                    to

                   or otlier Articles front Mines.                 190
 to the top of the pit, it is suspended from the larger pe
 rimeter of one frustum, whilst the descending part of the
 opposite chain is hanging down the pit from the smaller
 perimeter   of  the other, and    in that     position a — T «= the
 counterpoise required at the same radius.
    Consequently, by supposing a, the weight of the basket
 of coal, to  be 800lbs.    and b, the weight     of   the descending
 part of the chain,    400lbs. (these     are the weights which we
 have adopted   here), we have the counterpoise required upon
 the cylindrical barrel, at 24 inches. radius, I2i)0lbs. when
 the basket of coals is at the bottom of the pit, and 400lbs.
 when it is at the top ; but upon the barrel formed of frus
 tums  of right cones,     the counterpoise required at 32 inches
 radius is 600lbs. in each position.        And as the counterpoise
 required is in inverse proportion to the length of the radius
 at which it is applied, we have 24 : 32 : : 600 : 800lbs. the
 counterpoise required upon the barrel formed of frustums of
right cones, at 24 inches radius. Again, as the descending
part of a chain + a basket of coal of double its weight, un
bending out of equi-distant grooves from the base of a frus
tum of a right cone, towards its smaller perimeter, balances
in  every revolution   of  the barrel, a chain    of  equal weight  +
a basket   of coal, of double its      weight-,  bending into equi
distant grooves from     the  smaller   perimeter of a similar frus
tum towards its base, the counterpoise required must be
equal in all parts   of the descent.
    So that by making the weight of the basket of coal to that
of the chain, and the perimeters of the frustums of cones,
which form the barrel, to each other, in the proportion erf
two to one, a maximum is obtained, by which a barrel of
this description requires one-third      less momentum,     (and cow
sequent ly one- third  less expence,)     to work   it than  a cylin
drical one.
   The barrels   are made by nailing two to three inch planks
upon   wooden   or  iron curves, as in the common way, and
afterwards folded, spirally, with wrought iron tire, so as to
leave a vacancy    of about half an inch between each fold, for
the lower part   of the ellipses of those links of the chain
                                  N   2                        which

 196         Description   of a Machine for raising Coals
  which work vertically to move in, and keep the coils at an
  equal distance from each other.
      The wrought iron tire is of two kinds, the one for coni
 cal, and the other for cylindrical barrels ; the cross section
 of that for the barrel formed of frustums of cones, is nearly
 a   parallelogram, 1^ inch by ti-ths, out of the upper part of
 which about one- fourth of an ellipsis is taken, to form a
 horizontal     bearing for those links of the chain which lie flat
 upon the tire ; the cross section of the latter is a rectangle
  1-J- inch by £ inch.     Both are rolled into their proper form,
 and holes of a quarter of an inch diameter punched therein,
 at a foot from each other, for the purpose of nailing them
 to the planking of the barrels.
      As the method of working chains in grooves has only
 been in use about three years and a half, it is impossible to
 give a certain idea in respect to their durability.     In all that
 time not    a single link has broke, or the least accident oc
 curred therefrom, though Messrs. T. W. and B. Botfield
 have nearly three thousand feet in daily motion at this ma
 nufactory.      The wear has also been so trifling, that I con
 ceive    they  will sooner fail from oxydation than attrition     :
 for although the machines for raising coal and ore from the
 mines are in use twelve hours in the day, the brown oxide of
 iron formed upon the links by exposure to the atmosphere,
 is seldom disturbed by the motion of the chain.
      The method of folding wooden barrels with wrought iron
 tire, does away the necessity of cast iron ones, and may be
 applied to every wooden barrel now in use at a small expence,
*as may be seen by the estimate which is subjoined.
      There are now at work in the mines of this manufactory,
 four machines,      with   wooden barrels folded with     wrought
 iron tire,    one cylindrical,  and three formed  of frustums of
 cones, raising upwards of eight hundred tons of coal and
 iron ore per week from pits of about eighty yards deep ; and
 three others are in- hand.
      T look forward with confidence to the general substitution
 of   chains for hempen ropes at all our mines and manufac
 tories, a matter of importance       to the British empire, as it
                                                                will

                    or other    Articles from Mines.                      197
will considerably lessen the consumption of hemp, and render
it more abundant for the exigencies of the navy.
   Wishing to give this method of working chains all the
publicity in my power, I will obviate all apparent (for there
are no real) difficulties which may occur to any person in
their application,       on his stating them in          a letter  post paid
addressed to me here.

        SIR,
     This   is to certify,    that Gilbert Gilpin has invented a me
  thod   of raising coal and        ore from the mines by means of
  chains working in grooves, formed by folding wooden bar
  rels spirally, with wrought iron tire, so as to leave a vacancy
  between    each fold for the lower parts      of the circumferences
  of those   links of    the   chains  which work vertically to move
  in, and thereby cause uniformity and safety in motion ; four
  of which machines we have now at work at our mines at
  this place, one with         a cylindrical barrel, and three formed
  of frustums of cones, which machines            are  (to the best of
  our knowledge) superior to any hitherto known or in use,
  and will produce the effect at a much less expence.

  To C. Taylor, M.D. Sec.
        SIR,
     Messrs. T. W.         and   B. Bolfield inform      me, that they
  sent the certificate in respect to the machine for raising coal
  and ore from the rnines, to you yesterday.
     You will please to observe, that of the four machines now
  in  use,  two only work with two chains each, and they are
  both formed of frustums of cones ; the other two, the one
  with   a cylindrical barrel, and the other a frustum of a cone,
  have each a chain at one end, and a patent flat rope at the
  other.    We     are induced to adopt the latter plan to do away
  by degrees the prejudices which miners and colliers have im
  bibed against chains, from accidents which they have been
  witnesses to in the common way of working. Though the
  causes   of similar accidents are entirely done away by the new
  method of working, some little of the old prejudice remains ;
*
  a thing not to -be wondered at when we consider the unin
  formed slate of this description of men, arising from a life
  spent in the dark recesses of mines ; and, as it were, cut off-
  from the rest of society.
     From the uniformity and safety of the new method, their
  prejudices     against chains are, however, rapidly wearing
  away, and I have no doubt that in a few years they will

                      or other Articles from Mines.                      199
  even be preferred.        It  is certainly more reasonable       to sup
  pose that this will be the case from the superiority which
 iron holds in point of strength of materials, than that ropes
 even should have been known, (at least in the mines,) had
 the new      method of working chains          be*en   in use prior to the
 introduction of hemp.
     By excusing the liberty which I am now taking, you                 will
 oblige,                            Sir, your obedient servant,

As  there are some points, however, contained in      which                      it,
I do not clearly comprehend, and others, on which       hold                      I
a different opinion from Mr. Graham        shall take the li-   ; I
bertv of troubling you with  few ideas on the subject.
                                           a
     The principle of commerce being nearly coeval with man
is   dogma universally admitted
     a                               is, indeed, so evident
                                                      ;    it
and rational, that   would be absurd to argue against
                           it                             or                            it,
even to question its probability but, to admit    as the in-                it
                                      " that there no coun
                                                  ,
fcrence of Mr. Graham's statement,                                           is
try, however highly      may be favoured, which can produce
                                it
all that      is
           necessary for the comfort, health, protection, and
security       of its inhabitants," would,                 I    conceive, be weaken
ing instead        of confirming            theposition, and, so far from
proving the importance of                   commerce, would show     to be             it
of very little use. For,                  ifa     country       is   naturally incapable
of itself to produce all that              is   necessary           for the health and
comfort of inhabitants,              I  do not see how this deficiency can
be supplied        ;   because,      from the nature of the soil and cli
mate, inhabitants             themselves          cannot long continue there in
existence.         We accordingly find, that such                tracts of land
as      naturally barren, are also uninhabited.
       are                                                true,                  It    is
many   countries draw the most material articles of their sub
sistence from others, whence they are exported for their use                                  ;
but, then, this          is   no proof of the               first being incapable to
produce them, or at least, something equally, and perhaps
more, adapted to the purpose    or of their not having ac
                                                  ;
tually produced one or other of them, previously to the con
nection.   This, in treating of the origin of commerce,                                       I
shall explain presently more at large   but, considering Mr.
                                                           ;
Graham's statement in     general point of view, let any one
                                     a
examine into^the various articles respectively produced                                       by
the different nations of the earth, and,       am not very           if I
much mistaken, he will perceive how admirably they are
 adapted to the preeminent and,                       in   some      respects,    exclusive
 use     of   the inhabitants        of   those countries to which they seve
 rally belong.   Rice, for instance,    the chief support of
                                                           is
 the inhabitants of India, and corn may be said to answer                                     it
 in Europe; an exchange, however, so as to substitute one
 to the exclusion of the other, would injure both people: for
                                                                                              it

 it must      be known          that corn, instead                     of rice, would            as   ill
 agree with the constitution of  native Indian, as rice, sub
                                                     a
 stituted for corn, would with that of an European.    Again,
to notice an example Mr. Graham has selected as one par
ticularly worthy of attention — mean the difficulty of this

         ;                        piece of cruel policy, that
                                                         a
prevents greaiabulk of people from   enjoying those bounties
of Providence which                 the earth sends                forth      in   such abund
ance. Now,             these articles are certainly,                    both of them, very
useful      in   the countries in which they are respectively manu
factured, and custom may have led some persons to suppose
that they (particularly the first) are equally so in those in
which they cannot   be manufactured ;.but, taking the ques
tion generally (which    the only way to determine
                                     is                cor                                  it
rectly), let me ask, how long an English brick-maker could
support himself upon French claret in lieu of porter, or
what would become of                    a   French           peasant,   were he to drink
as plentifully        of Burton          ale as he does             of his native wine                ?
In the same manner,     may be argued, that the importa
                                    it
tion of tea, which, from its general use,   looked upon                  is                           by
many as     necessary of life, ought to be encouraged
              a                                        and
promoted in this country       but, no one will undertake to
                                            ;
say, that its use in this country (where, notwithstanding its
prevalence,                                     by
                                 ihe faculty) can be compared
                   in it
                       is
                  deprecated
with its     use           China,    to which        it      is    indigenous      ;   it   consti
tutes there the common                   drink of all descriptions of persons,
from the highest to the lowest orders, and affords as much
nourishment and refreshment to them as beer or wine does
to the inhabitants of this country or the continent.
  It    moreover to be observed, that
       is                                person passing from       a
one country into another, where he settles as an inhabitant,
no longer stands in need of those articles on which he has
been in the habit of subsisting, and which can only be pro
duced in the country he has left   these, indeed, so far from
                                                     :

at least,        capable of being produced, in the climaie into

vincing proof of          of Mr. Graham's statement, and
                               the reverse
shows how Nature contributes to a change of constitution
with    a   change         of residence,         produce of
                                                so as to render the
each country the most proper for its inhabitants.    Indeed,
I am surprised that the contrary should have been stated by
him to form           a part         of   the immutable          laws of the Creator;
when every testimony concurs to show that it was and is his
intention to gift each nation with such and such properties
of soil and climate as are necessary to produce those articles
the best adapted to its uses : the more especially, when we
come to consider, that those commodities which are intro
duced into countries where they cannot be naturally pro
duced, are, always, in such countries, articles of luxurious
superfluity,          and, mostly, causes                of intemperance and dis
ease.       I   am not prepared to defend                   the opinion ; but,         from
attentively considering the different dispositions, the oppo
site climates, and the various languages that belong to the
several nations            of    the earth, it should seem, that Providence
had rather intended that they should be independentof one
another, than that, according to Mr. Graham's representa
tion, they should, of necessity, have recourse to mutual
assistance       :    it cannot fail  that, in proportion with
                                              to strike,
the local distances between them, they differ in these parti
culars in a greater or less degree, which shows that the con
nections of society die gradually away, and that to break the
natural order of its communication,  by corresponding with
distant parts of    unassisted it,the medium of those that
                                                   by
intervene,    an invention
                     is     of mankind,  and not  law of the               a
Creator.   But this leads me to    consideration of the first
                                                     a
principles of commerce.
   When, at the beginning of these remarks,                                I       admitted
that commerce was nearly coeval with man,                                it   is   to be ob
served,    that, not making use of the term in its fullest sense,
I   meant that there existed, at the first institution of society,
a   practice of bartering, or exchanging one commodity for
another.               principle of self-interest, men found,
                 Actuated            by   a
that,       by
         devoting their time and talent3 to one particular
occupation, they could obtain the necessaries of life with
greater ease,             in   greater plenty and          in   greater perfection, than
                                                                                          if

if   each had undertaken to procure them separately                     for him
self.       Their being, however,        enabled       to do this, did not so
much arise from natural as artificial causes ; for though,
most assuredly, there are particular parts of a nation, which
may exclusively produce articles necessary to the whole, yet
this is no argument in support of Mr. Graham's statement,
which implies            that nations themselves are as         much    depend
ent upon each other, as the several parts of which they are
each of them composed.        But, even here, it must be ad
mitted, that such articles are more adapted to the use of the
inhabitants of the parts where they are produced, than to
that of those who live in different ones of the same nation ;
the degree of utility lessening          as the   local distances
                                                              increase.
In addition to what has been             said before, that the Creator
has distinguished           the different nations      of the    earth by dissi
milarity of language, habits,and dispositions, he has, to
make this distinction more evident and striking, separated
them by less equivocal divisions: by rocks, water, long
chains of mountains, and other boundaries or marks; so
that, the difficulty of defining the limits of a nation cannot
be urged in opposition to the distinction which is made be
tween that commerce which is carried on by the several parts
of   it,
      among themselves, and that which       carried on be  is
tween       it                   But, leaving the, generally
                 and other nations.
speaking, unimportant consideration of the difference be
tween what each part of         nation
                                     a    naturally capable of
                                                   is
producing, —     will be found that the difference between
                    it
what each part of     acually does produce, arises always, and
                           it
almost totally, from that superiority of skill and judgement
which    the inevitable consequence of the attention of their
            is
several inhabitants being respectively devoted to    few pur        a

confined to any particular branch of agriculture, art, or ma
nufacture,        cannot fail to arrive at   a    degree    of perfection far
beyond what    would otherwise have attained, had
                    it                              been                 it

every thing necessary           for his use, was appropriated solely to

the cult'rvation        of  one   particular article ; the overplus of
which, or what was more than wanted for his own con
sumption, he exchanged, with others in a similar situation,
for such     and such commodities as he required.              Men were,
accordingly,        led to associate    with one another;       conscious,
that the best way to accommodate themselves, was to ac
commodate their neighbours.                Villages were established, to
each     particular member of which, certain functions were
assigned ; by which means, the whole body was combined
 together, and transformed, as it were, into an individual of
itself.
    Suppose, then, a certain number of these individual bodies
to be stationed at different parts of the same country,— not
so distant,      however, but to be able, without difficulty, to
 communicate with each other ; is it at all surprising, seeing
 the advantage which each of them has obtained by dividing
 their employments, that they should be induced to repeat
 the same experiment upon a larger scale, and appropriate to
 each of these bodies the principal cultivation of some one
 particular article or another ? — Proceeding upon the same
 principle, we may form an idea of this extended class or
 province concentrating itself and communicating with others
 concentrated in the same way ; till, at last, a whole country
 becomes united.           During     the   progress, money,     or some
 thing    else, is introduced as a medium          of exchange    to facili
 tate the connection ;         civilization imperceptibly     advances    to
 refinement      ;   and commerce,       although originally directed to
  the necessaries of life, gradually embraces its conveniences
  and comforts,        and ultimately includes its      luxuries   and   su
  perfluities. — In      proof   of this being     the origin   and rise   of
  commerce,        it is only    necessary     to refer  to any particular
  country,      and, even under the present          complicated    appear
  ance   of  its arrangement, (owing to the length          of time which
  has elapsed since the first stages were performed,)             it will be
  seen,    that separate     employments arc undertaken by the in
   habitants     of   separate   places, that certain manufactures are
  carried on in certain districts, and that the cultivation of
   particular articles is left to particular counties or divisions.
     The commerce between nations may be accounted for in
                                                                     exactly

exactly the same way ; every one admitting the former prin

   One of the principal uses of commerce between nations,

what uniformly        results from undivided care and diligent re
gard to any particular object of employment.           With respect
to the natural resources of a country, it is impossible to say
how far they may extend ; because commerce, by intro
ducing articles from abroad, applicable to useful purposes,
renders the seeking of them, or substitutes for them, un
necessary     at home; and prejudices people with an idea that
none other will answer equally well the purposes to which
they are applied : whereas, it has repeatedly been discovered,
in this   and other countries,      when prevented from importing
certain articles, that many of them are more serviceable if
cultivated at home,, and that several of them are less so than
others indigenous to such countries, the superior use of
which would never have been known, but from the circum
stance   of the importation being prevented.
   As my only view, in troubling you with these remarks,
(which, however familiar to Mr. Graham, seem to have
been overlooked by him, as applicable to the question,) was
to point out, what        I  conceive to be, an error in his funda
mental statement.          I should be trespassing too much upon
your   attention    to extend   them any further, although, were it
necessary, I think I could assign other reasons than he has
done for the decline        of commerce, — a circumstance which I
deplore    equally with himself.       Many of these reasons, de
tailed in   a  full and masterly manner, are to be found in the
works of Lord Bacon and Mr. Locke, both of whom were
staunch advocates for commerce, and           able writers in its de
fence.      Mr. Graham's        motives, however, are laudable in
the extreme     ; his observations are, generally, instructive ; and
since his abilities and experience are far superior to mine,         I
trust that the remarks which I have made will be indulgently
received, and operate rather as an inducement to others to
examine into the subject, than be considered as offered            by
me under an idea of their being accurate or'conclusive.

ANALYSIS OF THE CARBONATED STEEL WELL.
                           SITUATION OF THE SPRING.
\Jp       a different nature from the last described                        waters, is the
spring called the Carbonated Steel Well.    This spring                                    is.
situated near Hygeia House, 600 feet from the last described
well  ;  rises out of
          it          black ferruginous mould.
                                 a                The water
lines the reservoir,            as    well       as the    channels through which        it
flows, with          a   yellow brown precipitate.
                PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE WATER.
     This water           at the fountain                 head   is   perfectly colourless,
and transparent.    has  slight odour, resembling thar
                               It        a                                               of
iron when moistened, or rubbed in contact with water.                                    It
sparkles rather more than common spring water its taste                       ;          is
strongly chalybeate when suffered to be exposed to the
                                ;
open air for six hours, the inner side                           of the vessel containing
it   becomes        studded     with air bubbles              ;    in 12 hours the water
loses its chalybeate taste.                      The   same effect ensues instantly,
when      it   is   made      to boil, which
                                          the water turbid,renders
and causes   brown granular precipitate to fall down.

temperature of  the spring at 78 Fahr., was  53.5, the baro
meter indicating 29.5. The specific weight of the water
was 2.39.

   Experiment III.  —  Muriate, acetate, and nitrate of ba-
rytes renderea both the fresh and boiled water turbid.
   Experiment IV. — Sulphate, nitrate, and acetate of silver
produced much cloudiness ; even when a few drops of nitric,
acetic, or sulphuric acid had been previously added to the
water.
   Experiment V. — White prussiale        of iron underwent no
change in this water.
   Experiment VI. — A plate of polished silver and bismuth
suffered no alteration, when kept submersed          in the carbo
nated chalybeate water.
   Experiment   VII. — Baryles rendered the water milky.
   Experiment   VIII. — Lime water produced the same effect;
the precipitate again vanished,     by the admixture    of muriatic
acid.
   Experiment IX. — Filiate     of soda and oxalate    of ammonia
product^ much cloudiness.
   Experiment X. — Sulphuric        and   nitrous acid extricated
many air bubbles.
   Experiment   XI. — A   slice  of gall nut    suspended    in the
water became    instantly    surrounded    by a  purple zone, and
lastly rendered the water black ; boiled water remained un
altered.
   Experiment XII. — Tincture of cabbage became reddened
with the water at the fountain head, but boiled water suf
fered no change from this test.
                          ANALYSIS.
   Experiment I. — Having learnt from the preceding experi
ments, that the water contained earthy carbonates, oxide of
iron, Sec, 231 cubic inches of it were slowly evaporated to
five cubic inches, and when cold filtered.
    Experiment  II. — On   the  product obtained, muriatic acid
was made to act, which was likewise employed to detach the
earthy crust that had been formed on the vessel during the
process  of evaporation.
    Experiment III. —To this muriatic solution,           sulphuric
acid was added, atvi heat applied until it became nearly dry;

concentrated, was mingled with liquid ammonia in excess,
and the formed precipitate collected on the filter.
  Experiment V. — The separated oxide of iron was redis-
solved in nitro-muriatic acid, and evaporated to dryness,
for several times successively and lastly, sulphuric acid was

the same results, namely, carbonate          of lime and carbonate
of iron,    besides   a    portion of sulphate of lime.  The latter
being removed, the fluid was evaporated to perfect dryness.
   Experiment IX.—The dry mass being repeatedly digested
in alcohol, the solution filtered, concentrated, covered with
sulphuric acid, strongly heated, and lastly, the sulphate of
lime separated        by

sively.    It yielded seven grains of muriate of soda.                 These
being dissolved, and added to the fluid from which they were
obtained, and sulphate of silver dropt into the solution, the
niuriate  of silver produced weighed 116 grains; indicating
50 of muriate of soda, of which 6. 25 are contained in one
gallon of the water.
   Experiment XI. — The insoluble residue left, together
with that obtained in Experiment VIII., being boiled in a
Florence flask with a large quantity of water, became dis
solved, and     yielded by evaporation to dry ness 17 grains of
sulphate of lime     ; of which 2.i. were therefore contained in
one gallon of the water.
   The aeriform products         of this spring being      ascertained    by

 phuretted Saline Spring. It rises under Hvgeia House. The
 odour and taste of this water indicate that it contains sul
 phuretted hydrogen gas.       The depth        of this spring      is eight
 feet. Its circular reservoir measured           three feet in diameter.
 The height of the water was 14 feet. The quantity of water
 it is capable of yielding amounts to 206 gallons in 24 hours.
 Its taste is slightly saline and bitter, leaving a strong im
 pression of sulphuretted hydrogen in the month.                 It is per
 fectly transparent   and   colourless.       The   temperature of this
 Spring was 52.5 Fahr., at 78° barometrical pressure.                      It*
 specific gravity was as 369'3 to 269.
    The analytical investigation of this spring being conduct

   XXXIX.      Memoir upon the De-sulphuration                   of Metals.
          By M. GueniveaU»                Engineer of      Mines*.
Among       the number of metallic               sulphurets which         nature
presents   to us,   there are several the decomposition               of which
is very important in the arts         :   the    sulphurets     of iron, cop
per, lead,   mercury,     &c,       give     place    to metallurgical      pro
cesses highly deserving        of   the attention       of chemists.
   The nature and properties of these compounds are well
known, since chemists have so frequently made them an
object of inquiry. The facts, however, collected in labo
ratories have      never been carefully compared with those
furnished by the workshops, although it is very well known
that the latter description of experiments furnish the most
useful results ; and the theory of various operations to which
we subject the sulphurets,           has not kept pace         with the     rela

tive progress of science. It is my intention, in this Memoir,
to supply what is wanting in this respect : for this pur
pose,   I have    made various experiments, and collected seve
ral observations long known : to these I have added some
reflections peculiar to myself, and have deduced, from
their examination, consequences which may be productive
of gome  changes in the ideas generally entertained respecting
the treatment of the metallic sulphurets.
   § I. Of the Action of Heat upon the metallic Svlphurety.
   The action of heat upon the metallic sulphurets should be
first examined, because it is to be met with in all the ope
rations by which we seek to decompose these substances :
in order to appreciate it in a precise manner, I have made
choice of experiments and observations in which this action
is entirely isolated, which is worthy of observation ; for it
is because we have not analysed the effects produced by se
veral causes, that we have been Kl, in metallurgy, to ascribe
to caloric alone a de-sulphurating power, which it does not
seem to possess in any great degree.
  The sulphurets of mercury and of arsenic are volatilized
in close vessels, when they                    are exposed,      to a temperature
somewhat raised.            The sublimed sulphuret is frequently al
tered in its colour ;       and the experiments of Messrs. Proust
and Thenard show that this change is the consequence of a
variation in the proportion of the elements of this com
pound.
  The native sulphuret of iron (pyrites of iron) undergoes a
partial decomposition only from the caloric : by distilling it
in a retort, we cannot extract from it the half of the sulphur
which it contains *.              In Saxony,           the distillation   of pyrites
upon a large scale never yields more than from 13 to 14
per cent. of sulphurf.
  These facts not being sufficient to decide my opinion
upon the effects of heat, because all the experiments which
have come to          my knowledge                  were    made, at a tempera-

                   On the De-sulphuration          of Metals.             815
ture a little raised, 1 proceeded in the following manner:                   I
put into a crucible, pyrites of iron pulverized ; covered it
with charcoal in powdei, and heated it in the forge for an
hour     ;  I found      a   mass   still preserving all the characters of
pyrites ;      it seemed to have been completely melted, and re
tained two thirds of the sulphur contained in the natural
pyrites. This experiment being repeated, left me in no un
certainly upou the effects             of  heat by itsebf upon sulphuret
of iron,       and   I  thought I might conclude, that) whatever be
the     temperature, these effects           produce a partial decompo
sition.
     Sulphuretted copper and pyritous copper, submitted to
 the action of heat, produce effects analogous to those ob
 served with respect to iron : the distillation of the pyritous
 copper furnished but very little sulphur : these two kinds of
 minerals of copper may in short be considered as mixtures
 of the sulphurets of copper and of iron, and the sulphur
 which       heat    separates    from it proceeds almost entirely from
 the sulphuret         of iron.
     The sulphuret oflead, or galena, is one of those minerals the
 treatment of which is most various : all chemists agree in
 regarding it       as   composed of sulphur and lead only, in the
 proportion of         15   of the former, and 85 of the latter.        I  was
 the more careful in observing the effects               of caloric upon the
 galena, because,            by trying     to separate the sulphur from       it
 by this agent, I expected to obtain lead in a metallic state,
  the weight and fusibility of which render the re-union very
 easy. It was, besides, very easy for me to operate without the
  contact      of atmospheric air.
      I  put into a retort 30 grammes of galena reduced to pow
  der, which I heated for two hours, but not so strongly as
  to make it agglutinate          : a   very little sulphuric acid only was
  disengaged, produced by the action                of the air of the vessels,
  and     I perceived      no sulphur sublimed at the neck of the re
  tort.      I  increased     the fire for about two hours more, until
  both the galena and the vessel which contained it had un
  dergone a kind of fusion.                 The sulphur volatilized in this
  second part of the operation was in so small a quantity that
   it was not possible for me to detach and weigh it : the re-

216              On the De- sulphuration       of Metals .
 siduc was    of a metallic lustre ; it was agglutinated,         and did
 not contain an atom of ductile lead *.
     The  heat not having been very strong           in this experiment,
 I  submitted to the fire of a forge some pulverized galena,
 placed in .a crucible, and covered with charcoal in powder.
 I  found a mass which had been melted, and similar to what
 is called matte de plomh by the French metallurgists; there
 was no lead free from sulphur, but only some parts of the
 button were a little ductile. Analysis convinced me that there
 remained     about three fifths        of the sulphur contained in
 the galena.      I attributed a part of the loss of 27 per cent.,
 which it had undergone by the action of the fire, to the vo
 latilization of the sulphurct of lead itself; for the loss
 owing to the separation of the sulphur could not exceed six
 per cent, at most.
     The galena    therefore   undergoes    but  a very  incomplete de
 composition from heat.
     I shall not particularize the sulphurets of zinc, antimony,
 &c, because I do not' know a sufficient number of experi
 ments for determining, in a certain manner, the effects which
 heat produces upon them : analogy, however, inclines me
 to think that it does not completely decompose them.
     All the facts   I have    presented    seem   to me to establish,
 that the action of caloric alone upon the metallic sulphu
 rets, and particularly upon those of iron, copper, and lead,
 is confined to their taking from them a small portion of the
 sulphur which they contain,           and afterwards in     melting and
 volatilizing them.
 §   II. Of   the simultaneous       Action of Heat, and       atmosphe
               ric Air,   upon the metallic Sulphurets.
    The metallurgic operation which             has   for its object the
 de-sulphuration       of  the   metals   is known by the name of
 roasting.     Most of      the  authors who have spoken of it do
 not seem      to have     recognized any other agent in the de
 composition except caloric        ;  and even    those who since       the
   * There are few chemists who have not made this experiment with similar
results. I may here remark, that if the heat had been long enough con
tinued, and in the open air, the galtna would have been completely roasted.
                                                                      new

                          On the De-svlpkuration        of Metals.                 217
hew chemical                theories have remarked the influence                 of the
atmospheric air, have never regarded it as essential*.   The
experiments I have detailed having shown how the action
of heat alone is insufficient for decomposing a metallic sul-
phuret, we must necessarily ascribe to the oxygen of the
atmosphere the greatest share in the de-sulphuration of the
metals by roasting.    The affinities of sulphur and of me
tallic substances for this principle render this assertion very
probable        ;    it   is besides proved    by the       chemical examination
of the produce of              all the roasting,by the way in
                                                       as   well   as
which the operation is conducted.     In place of seeing in the
roasting of the sulphurets the volatilization of the sulphur,
produced by a well managed heat, it will be the decompo
sition of a sulphuret by the simultaneous action of the air
and of caloric : and the well known necessity of not melting
the ores does not seem to be recommended in consequence
of the fear of communicating to                  it,
                                together with liquidity,                                a
force of cohesion which will oppose the separation of the
sulphur   but rather because this state will confine the ac
            ;
tion of the air to      surface, which, not being capable of
                                 a
being renewed,  will be  soon covered    the metallic oxide.by
The combination    of the oxygen with the elements of the
sulphurets, gives birth to oxides and to acids, the affinities
of which have great influence upon the separation of the
sulphur,            and the results   of   a    latter generally
                                               roasting     :    the
present    mixture of oxide, of sulphate, and of indecomposed
            a
sulphuret.     shall examine separately and
                    I                          detail the roast    in
ing of     several kinds         of sulphurets,     because the nature           of the
metal produces great modifications                  in their results     ;   and shall
presently show, why, and in what form,                             the sulphur    is   se
parated.
  * Macquer,     in this respect, agrees with the metallurgists.        We find in
his Dictionary    of Chemistry the following passage: " There are several
methods of separating sulphur from metallic substances        in the first place, as
                                                                   :
sulphur    volatile, and as these substances are fixed, or at least not so volatile
           is
as sulphur, the action of heat alone ti sufficient to take the sulphur from most
metals."        He seems, however,    to have been aware of the importance of the
contact    of                               since he says, when speaking of
                 the atmospheric air in roasting,
the sulphurets of mercury and of arsenic, "     will be possible to desulphu-
                                                       It

                        Roasting     of Pyritous Copper.
    We      arrange     pieces   of pyritous copper upon faggots, in
such a way        as  to make the combustion continue                  a  long time.
The     first application     of    the heat separates a part           of   the sul
phur,       which is distilled in some              measure,     and   may be col
lected ; but afterwards it is this                 combustible       which     serves,
upon burning, to continue the operation : sulphurous acid
is liberated, the elasticity of which, increased by the eleva
tion of the temperature, hinders its combination with the
metallic oxides.           The sulphuric acid which is formed, in
spin' of the care taken to slacken the combustion, is united
to the oxides        of copper and iron, but             the sulphate      of iron   is
partly decomposed by the hyper .oxidation of the metal.
    The pyrites of iron submitted to the same operation un
dergoes analogous decompositions                  ,  the   succession of which
is iix every respect the same.
    The roasting of pyritous copper in the reverheratory fur
nace produces the same phenomena, and seems as if it
would admit of a much more complete separation of the
sulphur, than that produced in the open air. If it were not
so, it would no doubt be owing to the difficulty of hindering
the agglutination of the sulphuret produced by the elevation
of temperature, owing              to the rapid and inevitable combus
tion of a great quantity of sulphur.
     I come now to speak of a furnace, in which we effect
 at the same time both the melting and the roasting (to a
certain degree) of pyritous copper : this is the method prac
tised at Falhun in Sweden*, and is done with an inner cru
                                                                                 cible,

Ian,   tome iii. pages 55 & set}. " The flux of the mineral roasted a single

sulphur takes plaee.                The wind of the bellows passes over
the surface with sufficient force for removing the 3corise,
and burning a part of the sulphur on the surface : the iron
is thus oxidized, and quartz is added in order to vitrify it in
proportion as the roasting goes on*. It is thus that we may
explain the concentration of the metal, and the general re

 process is perhaps the only one in which, at the same time,
 the sulphur and iron are separated in any quantity.
      The de-sulphuration of pyritous copper by roasting, is,
 in my opinion, produced, 1st, by the sublimation of a small
 portion of sulphur, which may be collected or burnt in the
 air   : 2dly, by the extrication of sulphurous acid, so much the
 more abundant as the operation is well conducted                          f:   3dly, by
 (he vaporization of a little sulphuric acid, the greatest part of
  which, however, remains united                       to the copper.
  can be used, and which,         in spite of the inconveniences it presents, may ne
  vertheless be advantageous."—" Another very precious advantage is a con
  centration    of the metal contained in the fiuid maiter which is continually
  agitated    by the wind of the bellows.         They extract a smaller quantity of
  mattes,    but they are richer.        We confess our surprise at the flux of black
  copper, when we see the small quantity of rich mattes which comes from
  a very inferior sort of ore, and which does not even seem to have teen
  Toasted."     We should be of M. Jars' opinion, that this method of melting py
  ritous copper is one of the best, if more copper was not volatilized than by
  the other processes : but if, as I think, we may substitute the reverberatory
 furnace for that used at Falhun, and in other respects following up the same
  series of operations, there would certainly be great advantages derived over
   fusion in the hand furnace-

    Particular Law concerning Machines,                the Movement   of

  XL.   Is    a machine,      the movement         of which    changes   by
 insensible    degrees,    the momentum of activity consumed
 in a given time by the soliciting forces^ is equal to the mo
 mentum of activity exercised at the same time by the resist
 ing forces.
    That   is to 3ay  (XXXIII)       that   the   momentum     of activity
 consumed      by all    the   forces of       the system, during the
 time given, is equal to zero :          this will be clear (XXXII) if
 we prove that the momentum                  of activity consumed at
 each   instant by these forces is null ; now F expressing each
 of these forces, V its velocity, Z the angle comprehended
between F and V, and d t the element of time, the momen
 tum of activity consumed by all the forces of the system
during dt, (XXXIII) s F V cosine Zdt; we must there
fore prove that we have s F V cosine Z,dt = 0 ; or s F V
cosine z = 0     :  now this is clear         by   the   fundamental the
orem   : ergo &c.
   The particular law       here in     question is certainly the most
important     of the whole theory of the movement of machines
properly so called     : we shall give some peculiar applications
when we enter upon the detail of the subject, in the scho
lium which will succeed to the following corollary, and
which will conclude this essay.
   XLI. Let us suppose, therefore, for instance, that the
powers applied to the machine are weights : let us call in
the mass of each of these bodies, m the total mass of the
system, g the gravity, V the actual velocity of the body m,
K its initial velocity, t the time which has gone past since
the commencement           of the movement, H the height from
which     the centre    of gravity of the system has descended
                                                                   during

during           the time t, and               lastly,     W    the velocity         due   to the
height     H.
   This being done, we must consider that there are two
sorts of forces applied to the machine, viz. those which
proceed from the gravity of the bodies, and those which
proceed from their vis inertia, or from the resistance which
they oppose to their change of state (note to XXX) : now
(XXXII) the momentum of activity consumed during the
time / by the first of these forces, is, with respect to the
whole system, M g H, or | M W 1. Let us now see what is
the momentum     of activity consumed by the vis inertice:
the velocity of m being V, and becoming the instant after
wards V + d V, it is clear (note to XXX) that its vis inertice
estimated          in the direction             of V, is md V, or rather                   m   —.
                                                                                               d t   *
therefore          (XXX)            the   momentum             of activity,      exercised          by
this force during                   dt, is m             Vdt, prroVdV: therefore the
momentum              of activity, consumed by this                           vis inertice du
ring the time             /,       is   s.mV dV, or, by integrating and com
pleting the integral, {                   m V* —
                                                 \ m K1 : therefore the momen
tum of activity, consumed at the same                                        time by the vis
inert'ue         of all   the bodies        of    the system,         will   be -i   5   m V1 —      \
s m K1       :    now this vis inertice is a resisting force, since it is
by it that bodies resist their change of state : and the weight
is here a soliciting force, since the centre of gravity is
supposed to descend : thus, by the proposition of this co
rollary, we should have M W1 =                                  * m   V1 —     s m   K1, or     s m
V1 = s m K1 + M W1 ; i. e.
    In   a machine with weights, the movement     of which changes

from     which the centre       gravity    the system has descended,

shall continually have      =              V          K,   and    therefore W1 =               0,   or

   XL1V. In the same manner since (XLI) the momen
tum of activity produced in a given time by the vis inertice
of any body is equal to the half of the quantity by which
its active force augments during this time, we may con
clude also, that
   la. order to make any given movement arise by insensible
degrees in a system   of bodies, or to change that which has
arisen,' it must follow that the powers destined to this effect
do consume a momentum of activity equal to the half of
the quantity by which the sum of the active forces of the sy
stem will have been augmented       this change.

  XLVI. We          have    supposed       in all      that has      been    said, as
the tide     of this corollary announces, that the movement
changes      by
           insensible degrees but                     if,

sudden shock or change happens in the system, what we
have mentioned would not take place.  Let us suppose, for
instance, that at the moment of this                            shock the centre of
gravity of the system has descended from the height                           h;      that
at this same instant the sum of the active forces                           is   X    im
mediately before the shock, and                   Y

thus the momentum of activity to consume in order to
raise    this case M to the height H,
          in                              necessarily greater     is

 without gravity, be enclosed completely in       vessel, and,                  a
 that, having made two equal apertures in this vessel, we ap

 mass on pushing these pistons must be equal,                                      if   they mu
 tually    form        an equilibrium        ;   i.    e.   that in            a   fluid mass the
 pressure      spreads equally         in   every direction                :   this   is     the fun

                                SCHOLIUM.
    XLVIII.      This scholium       is destined for the development
 of  the principle laid down in the fifth corollary         : this propo
 sition, in fact, contains       the principal part of the theory of
 machines in     a  state of motion, because most of them are
moved by agents which can only exercise dead forces, or
 those of pressure : of this description are all animals, springs,
 weights,     &c., which     is the cause      why the machine gene
rally changes     its state   by   insensible    degrees.    It also most
frequently happens, that this machine passes very quickly
to uniformity of motion, for the following reason :
    The   agents   which move this machine being at first a little
above     the  resisting force*, give rise to a small movement
which    is afterwards gradually          accelerated  ; but, whether as
a necessary    consequence of this acceleration,            the soliciting
force diminishes, whether the resistance increases, or, lastly,
if there happens any variation in the directions, it almost al
ways happens that the relation of the two forces is brought
nearer and nearer to that in virtue of which they could mu
tually form equilibruMi : these two forces are then destroyed,
and the machine is no longer moved, except in virtue of the
acquired movement, which, on account of the inertness of
the matter, generally remains uniform.
    XLIX. In order to understand still better              how this hap
pens, it is only necessary          to attend to the motion of a ship
which has the wind directly on her poop : this is a kind of
machine animated by two contrary forces, which are the im
pulse of the wind, and the resistance of the fluid upon which
it swims : if the first of these two forces, which may be re
garded as soliciting, is greatest, the movement of the ship
will be accelerated : but this acceleration necessarily has
limits, for two     reasons ; because,       the more the movement       of
the vessel is accelerated,       1st, the more is it subtracted from
                                                                        the

power applied                          it
                          produce, when we are acquainted
                                 to         can
with that which it would produce without the machine : let
us suppose, for example,          man is capable of exercising
                                                  that   a

nually with a velocity of three feet in the second : this being
granted, when we apply it to a machine, the momentum of
activity FVr, which this man will exercise, will be (XXXII)

of F   V       =    q, we shall have q — 25" 3 p' t, whatever be the

               :

the power is in a state to produce naturally, and without a
machine.
   Thus, for example, if this man with his effort of 25", and
his velocity of three feet in the second, is in a state with a
given machine, or without a machine, to raise, in a given
time, a weight p to a height H, we cannot invent any ma
chine by which it is possible, with the same labour,       e. the                                (i.
same force, and the same velocity as in the first case,) to
raise,    in
           the given time, the same weight to     greater height,                a
ora   greater weight   to the same height, or, finally, the same

therefore consist                in
                    producing great effects from small causes,
but in affording the means of choosing, among different me
thods which may be called equal, that which        most con                               is
venient in the existing circumstances.                                   In order              to force   a

agent to produce any given momentum of activity, ihe
moving forces employed must of themselves consume a
momentum     of activity equal to the first no machine can                   :

  nishing    the force at the expense       of  the time,   or the velocity
  at the expense of the force; or rather by employing two or
  more forces instead of one : this gives an infinity of resources
  for producing the momentum of activity necessary : but,
  whatever we do, these         means      must always be equal, i. e.
  the momentum of activity consumed by the soliciting forces,
  is equal to the effect or momentum exercised at the same

    XLI.     On the Planet     Vesta.    By S. Gkoomrridge, Esq.
       SIR,
                             To   Mr. Tilloch.
   JL he discovery of the planet Vcsia, on the 29th of March
  1807, having been communicated to this country by Dr.
 Others ; on the 26th of April I found its place, and observed
 the same on the meridian.             I obtained a series of observa
 tions to the 20lh      of Mav    ; after   which, from the increase of
 daylight, it was       no longer visible on the meridian.              The
 observations which were afterwards made were with equa
 torial instruments ; and these cannot be depended on, for
 sufficient     accuracy in calculating the elements.              I have,
 however, used some of these, from the 29th of March to
 the 22d of June, to determine the eccentricity ; those which
 were made on the meridian producing nearly the same ra
 dius.     I  thence discovered, that the planet, was decreasing
 in radius, and therefore conjecture that it was in aphelio
 about the time it was first seen.            When the planet was dis
 covered     by  Dr. Olbers on      the 29th    of March, it    appears to
 have been about        seven   days    past   the   opposition ; and it is
 well known, . not having that point of the orbit for a datum,
-the difficulty of calculation is increased.               I was therefore
 anxious to observe the planet before the ensuing opposition,
 to obtain sufficient materials for ascertaining all the elements.
 For this purpose,       I assumed     a mean      radius of the extreme
 observations     ; which,    if I  was right in my conjecture of the
 aphelium,      would    prove  too    great ; and therefore the planet
should be further advanced in the ecliptic.               On the 30th of
July,    the evening being clear, and            the  moon not risen,      I
observed      the difference   of right ascension of       several stars  of
                                                                         the

                               On the      Planet     Vesta.                              289
the sixth magnitude, compared with those laid down in
 Bode's Catalogue ; but in particular five stars, about two
 degrees      advanced       in longitude, from the computed place of
 the planet ; not one           of which was to be found in that Cata
 logue   ;   the    latitude being nearly the same                   :   I   therefore sus
 pected one        of  these to be Vesta.              On the        1st    of August      the
 same five stars being brought into the field                         of    the   telescope,
it  was instantly          apparent      that     one     had changed             its place,
 southward and retrograde in right ascension :                                this was the
 object of my research.                I could not obtain a meridional ob
 servation till the llth, having been disappointed by the in
 tervention        of clouds or vapour.                 The following               were the
 places as observed           on the meridian           ;    from      which its course
 may be discovered.

Organic Remains        of  a former World.      An Examination of
    the Mineralized Remains of the Vegetables and Animals
    of the Antediluvian World, generally termed Extraneous
    Fossils.   By James Parkinson.          The  second  Vol. 4to.
 We      have much pleasure in announcing the appearance of
this   volume,    containing the Fossil Zoophytes, and illustrated
with 20 plates.       To say that there is no falling off in this
volume, either in point of execution or embellishment, would
not     be doing sufficient justice to Mr. Parkinson.             The
work improves in every respect in its progress ; nor could it
be otherwise in the hands of a person possessing that in
dustry and acuteness which are so discernible in the present
performance;        for new specimens and unabating research
cannot but furnish fresh means for further investigation, and
must frequently ascertain points that were before doubtful.
    From a careful review of this volume, compared with the
first, we think the author is justified in the conclusion he
Ijas drawn, that traces'of but few of those species of orgar
nised beings which now exist can be discovered in the fossil
 state.    Indeed we should have been inclined to conclude,
 that   of all the varieties that have    been  discovered, not one
 of  them can be identified with any 'living species.
     Our limits     do  not permit our giving a longer extract
 than the following, .which is the last letter but one in the
 volume,      and which contains the author's     " General  remarks
 on the fossils already described," and the          " Conclusions"
 he has drawn from the circumstances which have come un
 der his observation.
     "  In  the series  of letters composing     the former volume,
 various facts were     adduced, in proof of    the solid part of this
  globe having,     at some very   distant  period, been covered by
 water.      An unexpected circumstance was at the same time
             —
  noticed : hardly any agreement could be found between the
  fossil vegetable remains and those vegetables with which the
  earth is at present clothed ; and in the present volume, an
  equal    want of agreement      has been observed      between   the
                                                                 fossil

fossil remains, and the actually existing animals, of the
order of zoophytes.
    " That, in the stupendous changes which this planet has
undergone, several specie.? of beings endued with vegetable
or animal life should have become extinct, is by no means
inconsistent       with   the   conclusions     to which     an unbiassed
consideration of those grand events would lead.                   The dis
coveries, therefore, in the vestiges           of  a former world, of the
remains       of innumerable        vegetables    and   animals,   such   as
would constitute        a prodigious number of species, and such
as, according to the          strict laws of arrangement, might be
even     disposed    in new and distinct genera, although quite
unexpected, is not in contradiction to what, on reflection,
we should have admitted, might, from the influence of par
ticular circumstances, have occurred.                 But a fact has been
 established     in the former and in the present volume, to the
 expectation of which no chain of reasoning could have led.
 Of    the    numerous      vegetables    and   animals    with which the
 earth is at present furnished, the mineralized remains             of very
 few species indeed can be found : of man himself, the mi
 neral world presents not a single trace — an explanation of
 which I in vain attempted in the preceding volume.
     "  Whilst instancing this wonderful want of accordance
 of  the mineralized       organic remains of a former period, with
 those beings      which    arc known now to exist, I shall lure
 confine myself to such facts only as have been noticed whilst
 examining the fossil bodies which have engaged                 our atten
 tion in the present volume.
     "  The examination of fossil corals was commenced, as
 may be seen, with the expectation of being able to preserve
 somewhat of a parallelism between the corals of this and
 those    iif  the  former world.         But it soon became necessary
 to abandon this attempt, it appearing that of the fossil corals,
 which, it may be said, have been only fortuitously dis
 covered, many more species have existed than are known of
 even the recent corals,         which, from their beauty and various
 other circumstances,          have been so long and        so assiduously
 collected.       This abandonment        was further authorized by its
  also appearing,       on compaiisun,        that   scarcely any    specific
                                        P  4                     agreement

232                Notices respecting  New Books.
agreement    could be established     between    the recent and the
fossil corals.
   "  With   respect to the degree    of accordance of    the   fossil
with  the recent alcyonia,    sponges, and other soft, and, con
sequently,    easily altered   zoophytes, I considered myself as
not authorized to speak with confidence; since it being pro
bable, that from these bodies never having been the object of
very general attention in a recent state, many may be yet
withheld from our knowledge, which might, when found,
considerably reduce the number of those fossil species, which
we are obliged, at present, to consider as without any recent
analogies.
   "  With   respect to those zoophytes,     with  the examination
of which   the latter part   of this volume   has been engaged,     it
must be acknowledged that they seem to point out most de
cidedly a considerable want of agreement between the inha
bitants of the former and of the present world.          Tt appears
that of these zoophytes, which, perhaps, should be arranged
under two genera, encrinus and pentacrinus, upwards of
twenty species are known in a mineralized state ; hut that,
incalculably   numerous    as these  animals must have been, not
a single fragment    of any individual, of any of     the numerous
species belonging to the genus encrinus,        has ever yet     been
seen in a recent state.    Two or three fragments of pentacrini
have indeed been discovered, but whether exactly agreeing
with any of the fossil species, I have not been able to ascer
tain.
   " No   stronger proof need be required of the sea having
long covered this globe, than the various mineralized re
mains of zoophytes, which have been found in different
parts  of the world, imbedded       at considerable depths and at
very great elevations, in some of the loftiest lime-stone
mountains.      But it may be argued, that although the ma
rine origin of these remains be admitted, and although they
are found    thus imbedded, still it is not yet proved that the'
sea has rested on the parts where these fossil remains have
been found ; since they might have been          brought there by
floods from distant^arts.         But that these animals dwelt,
and perished, on the identical        spots  where they are now
                                                              found,

tout)   1,  in  a mineralized       state,  may be fairly, and, I trust,
unquestionably, inferred from the circumstances of the con
gregation of similar animals, and of their bearing but few
marks of external violence; since, had they been thus trans
ported from distant regions, individuals of similar species
would have been separated,                 and scarcely any individual,
except of very strong fabric, would have been found, that
hfidrnot suffered material injury.
    " Reverting to what has been remarked of corals, that it is
not very frequent that the superior external face of the coral
is found in our fossil specimens, it might be thence remark
ed,    '.hat this was most probably the result             of attrition,     du
ring the conveyance by the waves from one spot to the other.
But when it       is considered what prodigious masses are often
formed by one species of coral, as in the recent coral reefs
in the South Sea, it will naturally occur to the mind of every
 one, that, in cabinet specimens of fossils, which are the
small fragments of such masses mineralized,                         by far the
greater number          of specimens may         be expected      to be found,
not possessing        this, the most characteristic           surface    of the
fossil.
    "   Instances of the vast quantities            in which      these    corals
were accumulated, may be found in various marbles                      of which
 they form the basis, and             which are in masses           sufficiently
large, to allow        of being cut into slabs, of         very considerable
size, and to show that they could not have been brought by
 the waves to the places where they now are found.                       Corals,
 in a mineralized state,         yield also ample testimony of similar
 species having congregated together in particular places.
 The Swedish islands of Gothland and Oeland, as well as
 many other parts of Sweden ; Worcestershire, Shropshire,
 Perthshire, Fifeshire, and many other parts of Great Britain,
 possess considerable numbers of the simple turbinated ma
 drepore*.        In Wales are to be found considerable masses of
 the remains of the curious madrepore, distinguished by
 Lhwydd as Lithostrotion, sive Basaltes minimus striatus et
    • I lately received, from some unknown friend, two of these fossil*, which
 were found about thirty feet deep, in a mass of calcareous rock, at Lord
 Elgin's lime-works    on the banks of the Firth of Forth, in Fifeshire.
                                                                       stellatus.

 stellatus.  In Westmoreland,         Cumberland,       the bishopric    of
 Durham, and several other parts of Great Britain,              as  well as
 of the Continent, are considerable accumulations                of parti
 cular species of the aggregated and compound madrepores.
     " The softer zoophytes, such as the sponges, alcyonia,
  &c., evince still stronger marks of 'their not having been
 conveyed by torrents to their present residences. Many of
 these are of such a structure as certainly could not have
 borne such a conveyance, with so little injury as is discover
 able in the several specimens, which have been examined in
 the preceding pages.        But   the congregation      of so   many of
 these bodies in particular districts,       as has   been   already no
 ticed, particularly      in France, in Switzerland,        and    in this
 island, still more strongly proves           these  to   have   been the
 identical parts where they lived.
    "  But should any doubt remain of the fossil zoophytes
 having inhabited the sea, in the identical places where they
 are now found, penetrated with and entombed in stone,
 those doubts must yield to the still more convincing circum
 stances, which attend the fossil remains of encrini and pen-
 tacrini.   The marine origin of        these animals,     we have seen,
 has been determined by the discovery            of the recent remains
of two or     three    pentacrini in the   Atlantic Ocean : and that
the fossil species must have had their existence where they
 are now found, is plainly evinced, not only by the vast ac
 cumulations of distinct species in particular districts ; but
by several instances occurring, particularly with the lily en-
crinite, where, notwithstanding the extreme delicacy of their
 construction,    even the more minute,         and more easily sepa
rable parts, have been repeatedly         found, in their mineralized
 state, preserved     in  almost  their  natural  connexion.
    " In concluding the present volume, it seems necessary
to remark, that the circumstances observed whilst examin
ing the several fossils hitherto noticed, have appeared to be
sufficient to warrant the following conclusions :
    " 1st. That the water has rested for a considerable period
over the general surface of the earth.
    "  Sd. That the mineralized          zoophytes found       imbedded
in different    parts    of the  earth, and     even   in mountains pf

  considerable height, have lived and died on those identical
  spots, which in the former world constituted parts of the
  bottom of the ocean.
       "  3d. That in a previous state of this planet, many spe
  cies    of organized beings existed, which are not known to us,
  in    a recent state   ;  their having existed being proved, only by
  the discovery       of  their fossil remains.
        "  4th. That the traces of very few of those species which
  now exist can be discovered in the wreck of a former world.
        "  5th. That even in rocks          of  the newest formation,     and
   in alluvial strata,      which are comparatively of but modern
   deposition,      the remains of extinct animals are as frequently
   to be found, as in what are termed transition rocks, (those
   which are supposed to contain the first traces of organic re
               '
   mains,)
        " 6th. That there appears to have been no line of separa
   tion between the creation of species now extinct, and of
    those now /existing ; since not only the remains of extinct
    species,    but perhaps of extinct genera,          are found,  with the
    remains of species very similar to, if not exactly agreeing
    with, species known in a recent state.
        "   7th. That many of the pebbles, found in gravel pits,
    on the shores of rivers, and on'the sea beach, do not appear
     to have been bowldered down to the form in which they are
     now found ; but that, on the contrary, their present forms
     are precisely those which they, at first, derived from the si
     liceous impregnation          of different animals, which     existed  in
     the former ocean.
         "  8th. That judging from the original delicacy of struc
      ture in these bodies, and         from the little injury which they
      have sustained, it appears          reasonable   to suppose, that this
      solidification was      effected,    in several instances, previous to
    'the removal of the waters from their former bed."
         We cannot dismiss this work without speaking of                   the .
      plates in terms     of the highest commendation.          They   are ex
      ecuted with     uncommon          care,  and   present pictures of the
      various specimens coloured after nature, and so faithfully,
      that they may well answer the purpose of a collection of
,     fossils to those who are fond of this pursuit — a pursuit which
                                                                         opens

   the impulse     of the wind    ; 2d, on the other hand, the resist
   ance  of  the water increases     : consequently these two force9
   tend to equality     :   when they have attained this point they
  will be mutually destroyed ; and therefore the vessel will be
   moved as a free body, i. e. its velocity will be constant.
   If the wind fell, the resistance of the water would surpass
  the soliciting force ; the movement of the vessel would
  slacken ; but, as a necessary consequence of this slackening,
  the wind would act more efficaciously upon the sails ; and
  the resistance of the water would at the same time diminish :
  these two forces would still tend        therefore to equality, and
  the machine would at the same time attain an uniformity of
  movement.
     L. The      same     thing happens when the moving forces are
  men, animals, or other agents of this kind : at first the
 mover is     a  little above the resistance   ; thence arises a small
  movement, which is gradually accelerated by the repeated
 efforts of the moving power; but the agent itself is obliged
 to assume an accelerated movement, in order to remain
 attached      to the      body upon which it impresses motion.
 This acceleration, which it procures for itself, consumes a
 part of its effort, in such a manner that it acts less effica
 ciously upon the machine ; and the movement of the latter,
 accelerating less and less, finishes by soon becoming uniform.
For instance : a man who could make a certain effort in the
 case   of equilibrium,       would   make   a  much less one  if the
body he applies his strength to should yield, and if he was
obliged to follow it in order to act upon it : it is not because
the absolute labour of this man is less ; but it is because his
effort is divided into two, one of which is employed in put
ting the man himself in motion, and the other is transmitted
to the machine.           Now it is from this last alone that the
effect is manifested in the object proposed.
    I shall nevertheless continue to consider machines under
a   more general point of view : thus, I shall place in this
scholium several reflections applicable to the varied move
ment.      I shall only suppose that this variation takes place
by insensible degrees ; and I shall prove that this should in

advantageous manner possible.
  LI.. Let     therefore designate hy O, the momentum of
               us
activity consumed by the soliciting forces in a givrn lime /4
and by q, the momentum of activity exercised at the same
tune by the resisting forces : this being done, whatever be
the    movement     of the machine, we shall always have, by
the fifth corollary,   O = ci ; in such a manner, for example,
that if each F of the soliciting forces be constant, its velo
city V  uniform, and the angle Z formed by the directions
of F and V always null, we shall have at the end of the time
t s F V I = q ; and if all the soliciting forces are reduced to
a single one, we shall consequently have                     FV I    —
                                                                         (i   (XXXII
and    XXXIII).
  LI I.    We may in           general        regard the rrionientum           of   ac
tivity   (], exercised    by the resisting forces,              as the efiect pro
duced by the soliciting             forces:          for instance,   when it is re
quisite to raise    a         a given height H, it is very
                         weight P to
easy to regard the eHect produced by the moving force as
being in a compound ratio of the weight, and the height to
which we have to raise it ; so that I* H is what we then na
turally understand by the eflect produced. Now, on the other
hand, this quantity P          II
                         is precisely what we have called the
momentum of activity exercised by the resisting force P ;
therefore this momentum of activity, or q, is what we na
turally understand in this case by the effect produced.
   Now, in the other cases, it is evident that q is always                               a
quantity analogous to that iust mentioned : this is the reason
why I shall frequently, in the course of my subsequent ob
servations, call this quantity q the effect produced : thus, by
the terms effect produced, I shall mean the momentum of
activity exercised by the resisting forces ; in such a manner
that, in virtue of the equation    = q, we may establish as

XLIV.       Description of the Apparatus invented by W. H.
   PEPYS, Esq., for the Decomposition of the Alkulis under
   Naphtha,       by Galvanism.
 I  HE celebrated discovery of the compound nature of the
alkalis hy professor Davy excited the attention of all classes
of philosophers. Numerous experiments and apparatus for
the more easily and permanently securing these volatile and
decomposable metals were invented. — Of the several appa
ratus for decomposing the alkalis under naphtha, the most
simple is that invented by Mr. Fepys.
   Mr. Knight, of Foster-lane, who has made several,                fa
voured us with the instrument from which the present              Plate
is taken :
   C. A cylinder of       glass with a pedestal ground glass stop
per  P,   perforated   through to allow a communication to take
place, by means of a wire, between two metallic plates
cemented      to the top and bottom of the stopper/                The
lower plate is of copper : the upper of platina.
   W. A wooden cover, through which a platina wire
(with a plate of the same metal riveted to the inferior end)
is allowed to slide.
   Use. —The copper base          of the pedestal is brought in con
tact with the positive end      of  the trough  :  the potash, slightly
moistened,      is laid on the platina plate      p.   The cylinder   is
then filled with naphtha, the wooden cover put on, and the
platina wire N, previously communicating with the nega
tive end    of the trough, is suffered to come into contact with
the potash or soda. Decomposition is immediately effected.
Part of the metal sometimes floats, but the larger portion
will  be found      imbedded in the alkali.       A  considerable por
tion of gas is evolved from the decomposition of both the
naphtha and the alkali.
   By   a  simple modification of the above apparatus, we un
derstand    Mr. Pepys has collected the whole of the gases
during decomposition.

    XLV.      On the Crossing Spider.            By R. Teed, Esq.
                             To  Mr. Tilloch.
      SIR                                             Lancaster Court,  Strand.
 X our ingenious correspondent, signed Lehmann, (Phil.
Mag. vol. ii. p. 320,) having given an interesting, and in
my opinion      the best account        of  the crossing spider (Aranea
Diadema),       induced      nie    not long ago        to examine more
minutely     the wonderful         sagacity and      contrivance      of   that
curious insect    :   and as the experiment         I made   is simple, and
can be repeated by any person            inclined to ascertain      the fact,
(to whom I will promise much pleasure from the result,)
I shall describe as briefly as possible the method I pursued
to obtain the most ample satisfaction.                  In the month of
September last       as  I  was one evening amusing myself in my
garden at Kentish-Town,               just as the sun was setting, I
observed   a large     crossing spider in the .centre of his web,
watching for        the    unwary fly who should chance to be en
tangled in it.       I took him from his post on a small stick,
and, suspending the insect between myself and that bright
luminary, I observed that he let himself down to the distance
of about   one yard     ;   which    was no sooner done, than           I  saw
the thread by which he was suspended, in a moment divide
or split into five or six lengths of a smaller size, and nearly
half a yard long. A gentle breeze at that instant blowing to
wards the setting sun, and consequently from me, I was
enabled to see more distinctly the very wonderful and sur
prising operation ; for the end of one of the threads
nearest the stick, being at liberty, was blown by the wind
until they were all unfolded to some distance; and being
Stopped by      a tree, the spider, who appeared perfectly ac
quainted   with     the busines, felt with one of his hinder legs
that it had laid hold of something.                  I soon perceived his
object ;   I   extended      the    stick,   and thereby tightened          the
thread  : this being known           to   the   spider, he crossed       from
the stick to the tree with the greatest alacrity.                I was then
convinced how easy it is for these insects to transport them
                                                                        selves

                           On the Crossing Spider.                           243
   selves from one side        of  a  garden to the other, or to cross
   lanes, rivers, &c. But it may be asked, How the spider, who
   has an inclination to cros3 a garden, knows when the line
  or thread is long enough to answer his purpose ? — A second
  experiment with another of these curious creatures most
  fully  satisfied   me.    Repeating what        I  have    already   stated,
  I  so managed      the floating   web    that it should      not presently
  fix on the tree     ; but as the   air wafted it to     a distance, I was
  much gratified by observing the line to lengthen, not from
  any more folds, but from the spider's body, the wind draw
  ing it out,    and no doubt aided by some internal force which
  he had the power to exert, thereby          lengthening it at least ten
 yards    : — it  was then suffered to      light on a wall, when the
 spider in     a moment ran along the thread with the greatest
 ease.    Now, sir, these experiments I have many times made,
 and advise others who are fond of exploring Nature in all her
 wonderful        works   to do   the same     ;  but it is best to have a
 strong light, in order to observe the curious foldings of the
 web, which appears (when viewed with a glass of one inch
 focus) to be fastened with something like a slip knot*.
     The observations which I shall make are as follows                    : —
 First, it    appears to me that Nature has furnished these little
 creatures      (which   we   from habits of education            too much
 despise)      with a most curious       method     of   ejecting at plea
 sure  ,a   glutinous thread many times double; and although
moist, the spider can contrive to separate or spin singly, by
which       means they not only weave their beautiful nets, but
make a thread which has excited the wonder of thousands,
to know by what means they have crossed roads, &c.                       And
secondly,       that by the power they have         of lengthening      those
threads they can cross to any distance.                 It is indeed pro
bable that instinct informs them when the wind is fair for
their purpose ; and it is remarkable that these powers are
confined to the crossing spider, as no other which I have
ever met with possesses them.              The largest spiders have the
strongest webs, and are best for the experiment ; but the
                                                                           i
    * You will remark that M. C. G. Lehmann       has not noticed this ; and  I
am persuaded that each folding is fastened  by a knot leaving one end loose.
                                     Q   2                          smallest

smallest have 'the same properties, ind the thread may he
seen to unfold with a good glass. By what means. these
threads are separated at the instant they are drawn from the
spider's body, I am at a loss to determine, and by what kind
of construction the aperture from whence they are drawn is
contrived to spin a thread of a gummy consistence, either
single or double, at the pleasure              of   the spider, is equally
mysterious.
  The spider, for some reason or other, is generally looked
upon with abhorrence, and some have declared them to be
poisonous, but the fact is otherwise ; they are perfectly in
nocent,  which could be easily proved, and they are a very
ingenious and wonderful little insect, highly deserving the
attention of the curious. When I say they are not veno
mous, I speak only of our English spiders ; for; notwith
standing their dexterity in killing a fly, there   believe,  is,
                                                               I
no doubt as to the means they use for that purpose, being
commonly done              by
                      incisions made with their formidable
forceps, and then sucking their blood.
   There are many other very curious observations which
might be made, peculiar to the spider, and which       may          I
at a future period trouble you  to  insert in your valuable
Magazine.                            I   am, sir, yours, &c.

to heat,  it  only partially acted upon,
               is                           considerable por

tion escaping without alteration     but when an alkaline or
                                           ;
earthy oxalate heated, the acid remains fixed till
                    is                             under           it
goes complete decomposition.    The new substances into
which the acid   converted, as far as my experience goes,
                      is
are always the same,            what oxalate soever we employ.          They
                                                                          are

                                     On Oxalic Acid.                                      245
are five        in number; naV.ely,x water,                  carbonic acid, carbonic
oxide, carbureted hydrogen, and charcoal.
  2. The water is never quite pure. Though no sensible
portion of oil can be perceived in    yet lias always the  it,       it

of wood     smell which

                                       is              com                       It
monly shows traces of the presence of ammonia, changing
vegetable blues to green, and smoking when brought near
muriatic acid   but this minute portion of ammonia
                      ;                              pro                           is
bably only accidentally present. All the oxalates which                                    I
decomposed               by
                          distillation, were obtained                     by   double de
composition           from oxalate of ammonia; and                          though they
were washed  with sufficient care, yet think not unlikely    I            it
that   minute portion of oxalate of ammonia might con
        a
tinue to ldhere.  Practical chemists know the extreme diffi
culty of removing every trace of     salt with which another
                                                       a
has been mixed.
   The carbonic               acid remains partly combined                with   the base,
which           always    becomes      a    carbonate, and            partly makes its
escape in the form              of   gas.
   The carbonic oxide and carbureted hydrogen make their
escape in the form of gas   the charcoal remains in the re
                                            :
tort mixed with the base,                    to which        it   communicates        a   gray
col~ur      :   the quantity      of   it   depends     in   some measure upon the
heat.        If the      oxalate was exposed            to   a    very violent heat,       no
charcoal at all remains.                    Hence       it   probably acts upon the
carbonic acid united to thehase,                   converting into carbonic
                                                                       it
oxide,       as   happens when         a    mixture of carbonate and char
                                                             a
coal    is   heated.
   3.  Iwas induced to examine this decomposition with
considerable attention, because conceived that   would
                                                   I                             it
furnish the means                of estimating          the composition          of oxalic
acid;       and   I    pitched upon             oxalate of lime,          as the salt best
adapted           for the purpose           I    had    in view.        A      determinate
quantity of this salt was put into  small retort, and gradu
                                                       a
ally heated to redness.    This retort was connected with                                   a
pneumatic trough                 by
                       means of a long glass tube, having                                   a
valve at its extremity which allowed gas to issue out, but
                                                Q   3                            prevented

 prevented     any water from entering the tube. The experi
ment was repeated three times.
    4. A hundred grains of oxalate of lime, when thus heated,
yield above sixty cubic inches of a gas, which is always a
mixture of carbonic acid and inflammable air, nearly in the
proportion of one part of the former to three and a half of
the latter, reckoning by bulk. The specific gravity of the
inflammable gas was 0. 90S, common air being T000; it
burns with a blue flame, and when mixed with oxygen may
be kindled by the electric spark.         The loudness of the re
port depends     upon the proportion of oxygen.
   The smallest quantity of oxygen, with which it can b«
mixed,    so as to burn by the electric        spark, is l-9th; the
combustion is very feeble, and is attended with no percep
tible report.     If the residue be washed in lime-water and
mixed with i-9th of its bulk of oxygen, it may be kindled
a second    time  : this may be repeated five times, after which
the residue cannot be made to burn.
   The combustion       becomes      more violent,  and the    report
louder,   as we increase      the proportion of oxygen, and both
are greatest when_the oxygen is double the bulk of the gas.
As we increase the dose of oxygen, the combustion becomes
more and more feeble        ;  and five parts of oxygen  and one   of
gas is the   limit of combustion on this side: for a mixture of
six parts  of oxygen and one of the inflammable air will not
burn.                                                           ^
   In  these .experiments       the  results differ materially from
each other, when the proportion of oxygen used is small
                          "
and when it is great.         I am not able at present to account
for this difference, which holds not only with respect to this
gas, but every compound inflammable gas which I have
examined.       This difference makes it impossible to use both
extremes of the series : I make choice of that in which the
proportion of oxygen is considerable, as upon the whole
more satisfactory.      The best proportion is one part of the
gas  and   two   parts of oxygen.      The oxygen ought not to be
pure, but diluted with at least the third of its bulk of azote,
unless the gas be much contaminated with common air.
                                                              I have

                                 On Oxalic Acid.                                847
    I  have elsewhere detailed           the method         which     I  follow in
 analysing gases of this nature*. The following table ex
 hibits the mean of a considerable number of trials of this
 gas with oxygen.

 that is to say, 100 cubic inches of the gas when burnt,
 combine       with 91 cubic inches of oxygen; there are pro
 duced 93 inches of carbonic acid ; and after the combustion
these     93   inches alone remain,             the rest being condensed.
Hence we conclude that the other substance produced was
water.
   This result corresponds almost exactly with what would
have been obtained,           if  we  had made the same experiment
upon a mixture         of   70    measures of carbonic oxide, and 30
measures       of  carbureted       hydrogen,        as will   appear    from the
following      table.

This coincidence        is so exact, that         I do not hesitate       to con
clude that the inflammable gas, which was the subject of
experiment, was in reality a mixture of 70 parts of carbonic
oxide, and 30 of carbureted hydrogen. The specific gravity
indeed, which was 0-908, does not exactly agree with the
specific gravity of such a mixture ; for 2-J- measures of car
bonic oxide, and one measure of carbureted hydrogen, ought
                      * See Nicholson's   Journal, xvi.   247.
                                                                                 to

to form a mixture    of the specific gravity 0.849, provided
the specific gravity of carbonic oxide be 0'956, and that of
carbureted hydrogen 0.600 ; but this objection cannot be
admitted to be of much weight, till the specific gravity of
pure carbureted hydrogen be ascertained with more accuracy
than has hitherto been done.
   The results contained in the preceding table enable us to
determine the composition of this inflammable air with con
siderable precision ; for 100 cubic inches of it require 9l
inches of oxygen, and form 93 cubic inches of carbonic acid.
But it is known that carbonic acid gas requires for its for
mation    quantity of oxygen gas equal to its own bulk':
          a
therefore to form 93 inches of           it,
                                 93 inches of oxygen gas
must have been employed but only 91 were mixed with
                                 ;
the gas   :therefore the gas itself must have furnished quan  a
tity of oxygen, equivalent    to the bulk of two cubic inches,
besides all the carbon contained in 93 inches of carbonic acid.
      This carbon amounts in weight to              12.09 grains.
      Two cubic inches of oxygen weigh                .68
                                           Total    12.77
But   as 100   cubic inches     of the   gas weigh 28.15 grains,    it   is
obvious that besides the 12.77 grains which    furnished to
                                                       it
the carbonic acid,    must
                        it have contained  15.38 grains of
additional matter   ;   but    as the   only two products were car
bonic acid and water,         by it   plain that the whole of this ad
ditional matter must,            is
                         the explosion, have been converted
into water. Its constituents of course must have been
                              13.19 oxygen
                               2.19 hydrogen
                              15.38
Adding this     to the 12.77 grains formerly         obtained, we get
the composition      of the gas as follows     :
                             Oxygen        13.87
                             Carbon        12.09

    5. The residue        which remained in          the   retort, after the
distillation was over, was         a gray    powder, not unlike pound
ed clay slate.       To ascertain    its constituents,      it was dissolved
in diluted nitric acid with          the   necessary      precautions ; the
loss   of weight indicated       the quantity     of carbonic     aeid.   The
charcoal remaining           undissolved,      was allowed to subside,
carefully washed         by repeated      affusions of water, and then
dried in     a glass   or porcelain capsule. It must not be sepa
rated by the filter, for it adheres so obstinately that it can
not be taken off the paper, nor weighed.                      The nitric acid
solution was precipitated by carbonate of soda, and the car
bonate of lime obtained was violently heated in a platinum
 crucible.      What remained        was pure lime.
     6.  I  shall now detail one      of my experiments more parti
 cularly.      Eighty-nine grains of well dried oxalate of lime
 were exposed         in  a small retort to     a heat   gradually raised to
 redness ; the products were the            following    :
                                                               Grains.
              45-6 cubic inches      of gas* weighing           14'8

  The loss is obviously owing           to the gas which filled the retort
  and    tube when the experiment was concluded.                        We are
  warranted therefore to add it to the weight of the gaseous
  products obtained.
     • The gas obtained measured 60 cubic inches, but 14 4 inches of these
  were found to be common air which had previously filled the retort and
  tube ; this quantity was therefore deducted.
                                                                          Now

   Now the     gas was composed        of

      Inflammable air        35.1       -     -       = 9'9
so that one-third    of the weight      was carbonic acid, and      two-
thirds inflammable air.        If   we divide the 5.4 grains     of loss,
in that proportion we obtain 1.8 grains carbonic acid, and
3.6 grains of inflammable air.            Adding these quantities to
the weight obtained, we get for the weight of the whole
gaseous product
                                              Grains.

   Had   the experiment been made upon 100 grains               of oxalic
acid instead    of 55.6, it   is clear that the pr6portions would
have been as follows      :

   The most remarkable circumstance attending           the decom
position of oxalic     acid  by heat, is the great proportion of
carbonic acid formed ; the quantity amounts to 6-10ths of
the whole weight of acid decomposed.
   As the composition of all these products of oxalic acid
is known with considerable accuracy, it is obvious that they
furnish us with the means of ascertaining the constitueuts
of that acid itself.
    59.53 grains of carbonic     acid are composed    of
                      Oxygen         -      42.96

given in a preceding part of this paper, are composed of

    As for   the charcoal, though     it probably contains both ox
 ygen and hydrogen as well as carbon, yet as the proportion
 of the two first ingredients is probably very small, and as
 we have no means of estimating them, we must at present
 rest satisfied with considering it as composed of pure carbon.

   7. The result of two other experiments on               oxalate of lime
was very nearly the same as the preceding.                  The following
may be stated in round jiumbers as the mean of the whole.
Oxalic acid is a compound of

acquainted has been given by M. Fourcroy, as the result of
his own experiments, in conjunction with those of Vau-
quelin *.   It is as follows :

   It gave me considerable uneasiness to observe, that mv
experiments led to conclusions irreconcileable with those of
chemists of such eminence and consummate skill, and it
was   not without considerable hesitation that            I ventured to
place  any reliance upon them.            I  am persuaded,     however,
that some mistake has         inadvertently     insinuated   itself into
their calculations    ;  since the carbonic         acid alone, formed
during   the distillation     of oxalate    of lime, contains consi
derably more carbon than the whole quantity which they
assign to the oxalic acid decomposed. M. Fourcroy informs
us, that oxalic acid is converted into carbonic acid and wa
ter, when    acted upon by hot nitric acid ; and           this decom
position seems to have been the method employed to ascer
tain the proportion of the constituents of oxalic acid ; but
the numbers assigned by him do not correspond with this
statement.     For  10 parts    of hydrogen require (50 of oxygen
to convert them into water, and 13 of carbon require at
least 33 of oxygen.        So that instead of 77 parts of oxygen,
there would have been required no less than 98 to convert
the hydrogen and carbon into water and carbonic acid.                  It
is true, that the    surplus of oxygen may be conceived to be
furnished by the nitric acid ; but if this be admitted (and             I
have no doubt from experience that the nitric acid actually
does communicate         oxygen), it is difficult to see how the
constituents of oxalic acid could be determined by any such
 decomposition, unless the quantity of oxygen furnished by
the nitric acid were accurately ascertained.

          SIR,
   J. HE present improved state of chemistry; its application
  to so many of our principal manufactures, and the necessity
  of determining the specific gravity of the various substances
  which     are used in them, or affording            in all  cases an im
  portant indication with regard to their qualities, and being
  in many the only accurate measure of their value, may
  perhaps    render the     following description of an instrument
  for this purpose not unacceptable to your numerous readers.
      By giving it a place in your valuable Magazine you will
  therefore oblige,                 Sir, your obedient servant,
                                                            GE0. ATKINS.

         Sept. 10, 1808.
     The specific gravity, or comparative weight of the ma
jority of those substances which fall under the observation
 of the manufacturer,          the mineralogist,     or the chemist, hav
 ing   always been considered as one            of their most distinguish
ing characteristies,        a variety of methods have           at different
 periods been resorted to for ascertaining it.
     In point of accuracy, perhaps,             the  best mode    of taking
 the specific gravity of a body is by a very good hydrostatic
 balance.       This instrument, however, we may venture to
affirm, can scarcely ever be obtained sufficiently perfect to
 be depended       on for so nice     a  purpose.
     Persons who are in the habit of adjusting               balances, and
those who use them with considerable care,                  well know the
various sources of error to which they are liable.                 The cir
cumstance of the arms of a beam being in equilibrio, is no
proof of its correctness, unless it will remain so when either
 loaded or unloaded, and with exchange                of scale.pans.    The
necessity of having         a piece   of  steel for the beam which shall
be perfectly homogeneous ; the uncertainty                 with regard    to
the exact equality of the arms, in both weight and length ;
 and, even when very nicely adjusted, its liability to acquire
                                                                   polarity,

               Description           of an Universal Hydrometer.                       255
polarity,      and consequent derangement by magnetism ; the
expansion of either arm by the heat of the hand, or its con
traction by a current of air, renders those instruments ex
tremely liable to give anomalous results.
   But supposing the balance not liable to error,                             it is    too
complicated in its use for any other than the man of science,
in his closet, where time and close attention may be af
forded ; and since the application of science to the arts has
become so general, chemists, manufacturers of acids, brew
ers, dyers, distillers, and all others whose manufacture con
sists of any chemical process, require a more simple and
expeditious mode of ascertaining the specific gravity, and
consequently the value of their articles, than by the hy
drostatic balance. Indeed, in many concerns its use would
be impracticable,              it being    necessary      to   intrust the business
of examining the qualities of                       the substances     in question       to
persons who have neither time or knowledge sufficient to
enable them to apply an instrument of such a kind.
  The hydrometer, on a variety of constructions, has been
long made use             of by distillers                    in spirituous-
                                                    and all dealers
liquors;       and      of    late    years brewers have generally adopted
it, for its simplicity               and facility in use compared with the
hydrostatic balance or weighing bottle. But as the hydro
meter for spirituous-liquors, and the saccharometer for malt-
liquors, (which the author of this paper       in the habit of    is
manufacturing,)               are adapted        solely to their respective pur
poses,      he has long thought                it  very desirable object to con
                                                   a
struct an instrument which                      would combine simplicihj with
an universality              of application to all substances, fluid                   and
 6olid,    of which       it   might be requisite to ascertain the specific
 gravity.         And   it   ispresumed that this object              is
                                                              accomplished
 in the instrument about to be described.
      Among         the      principal     subjects      of consideration         in    the
 construction of hydrometers, are, the form of the instru
 ment which shall be best adapted to facilitate its motion in
a   fluid, and that            it    be   of   a    convenient   size, both for the
 sake     of   portability, and that     may require as small
                                               it                             a   sample
 of   a   fluid   as   possible to make an experiment with.
      With        these viewst the            spheroidical     form    is   that which
                                                                                        has

230         Description           of an Universal Hydrometer
has been preferred           for the bulb of this instrument,                  on     ao
count   of its more readily dividing               the fluid in its passage up
and down       :   and  size of it is such, that half a pint of
                           the
any liquid is sufficient for trial with it.
  The hydrometer (see Plate IX.) consists of the bulb t, a
small stem a c, with       cup d on its top to receive weights,
                                  a
and a shank     ef            the bulb with a pointed screw, to
                          beneath
 which is affixed a cup g, to receive weights or solids when
.their specific gravities are required to be taken.
   The instrument           is accompanied with                an   accurate   set    of
grain weights.
   The weight of           the hydrometer itself is 700 grains,                and on
adding 300 grains in the upper cup, and immersing it in
distilled water, at the temperature of 60 degrees, Fahr.
it will subside          to the middle         mark on the stem, and will
then consequently displace 1000 grains of water.
   It follows, therefore, from this adjustment of the hulk                            of
the instrument,           that each grain in         the upper cup will re
present one thousandth part of the specific gravity of the
water, or one unit in specific gravity, if that of water be
taken to be 1000 ; and one-tenth of a grain one-tenth of
unit, which            is also the value      of   each   of   the small divisions
on the stem        ;             when the hydrometer is im
                       and accordingly,
mersed in any liquid until it sinks to the middle point on
the stem, the specific gravity of such fluid will be indicated
by the sum of the weight of the instrument (which         as                    is,
before stated, "00 grains) and the grains added in the upper
cup.
   Suppose, for example, that, on immersing the instrument
in ether,    requires 34 grains in the top cup to make
            it                                                                        it
subside to the middle mark on the stem. The specific gra
vity of such ether will in this case be 700 + 34 = '734.
And on putting the instrument into alcohol or wort,                              if   it
requires in the former case 125 grains, and in the latter 355,
the specificgravity              of   the   spirit will be .825, and that             of
the wort 1.055.
  To ascertain                          gravity           solid, we have to take
                                                   ; of
                        the specific                  a
any fragment           less than 300 grains           Jind its weight in air,
and its weight in water, and tyke their difference                       ;     and    0H
                                                                           dividing

                for ascertaining Specific Gravities.                  257
 dividing its weight in air by this difference the quotient           will
 be its specific gravity.
    The weight of a bodv in air is found by putting it in the
 upper aip, and adding grains until the hydrometer sinks in
 water to the mark on the stem.          Now, as the substance and
 the additional weights in the cup will be altogether 300
 grains, the weight of the body will of course be so many
 grains as the weights put in fell short of 300.             Its weight
 in water will be found by putting it into the lower cup, and
 adding grains in the upper cup until the instrument sinks as
                                                                           ,
 before : the complement of the weights in the top cup to
 300 being in like manner its weight in water.
    Example. — If a body weighs in air 120 grains, and in
 water 104, the difference is 16.         On dividing 120 by 16,
 we have for the quotient ,75, or (taking, as before, the spe-
cirip gravity of water at 1000) 7-500 for the specific gravity
of the body.
    This instrument affords us consequently a very ready way
 of determining the purity or value of any alloy or metallic
ore, and is therefore particularly adapted to the mineralogist.
Thus, for example, the weight of a guinea, or its weight
in air, is 128 grains;    and  if  the gold is of its proper standard,
it will weigh about       121  grains in water, or will lose one-
eighteenth part only of        its weight in air.     If it loses more,
therefore, it is not of its       proper specific gravity,      and con
sequently not of standard gold.
   To find the specific gravity of any of the different species
of wood or other bodies lighter than water ; — after taking
its weight in air as before, fix it on the small screw of the
shank, and      see how many grains it wiH then be necessary
to add   in the top cup, to sink lh,e instrument to the mark,
with the body on the screw ; which will in this case be more
than    300, on account of its buoyancy ; and dividing its
weight in air by the difference between the weights put in
the top cup     in each case,    the quotient   will   be its     specific
gravity.
   Thus,    if  on putting    a piece  of willow in     the upper cup,
it requires    258  grains to sink the hydrometer in water, the

weight of the wood in air will be 42 grains ; and if on fix
ing it to the screw beneath, the instrument requires 323
grains to sink it to the mark in water, (being 28 grains
more than would be necessary to sink the instrument itself,)
we have only to find the difference between the weights put
into the top cup, which in this case is 70 grains ; and di
viding 42 by 70, we have .6 or .600 for the specific gravity
of the wood.
  For   the man     of science,        the   instrument       with   its set of
weights    is all   that           and it is packed into a

very small compass* ; but to accommodate it to those who
are concerned with spirituous liquors, and to brewers, the
inventor attaches a scale, show.ing the relation between spe
cific-gravities and the commercial or technical denomina
tions of per centage with the former, and pounds per larrel
with the latter.
   It is needless to enumerate the various departments in
which an attention to the specific gravities of bodies is now
become of the first consequence, and wherein this instru
ment might be applied with advantage                 ;   and although many
may be satisfied if they have any arbitrary standard to regulate
their process by, yet it must be acknowledged that the uni
versal standard of specific gravity is by far the best ; for, by
its currency all over Europe, it enables a person to know
what relation their practice may bear to that of others in the
same pursuit ; and it would, by the universal adoption of
it,prevent the many differences which exist among mer
cantile men, especially those who deal in, or pay duty on,
spirituous liquors.
   Indeed the wide field          which      opens, on considering         the
importance of paying attention                to   specific gravity of
                                                   the
bodies, convinces          us   that   we are yet in infancy on the
subject.

                         secure    Boat, or Life Boat*.
        SIR,
 XJ.EREWITH            you will receive drawings of a neutral .built
 self.balanced boat, with an explanation, which I request
 you will have the goodness to lay before the Society for the
 Encouragement of Arts, &c. for their inspection and ap
 probation.         I have made the explanation as clear as I can.
 Its construction          will obviate       the danger      of its being overset
 by persons crowding             on one side        in  getting in or out of the
 boat ; it will facilitate the landing of men on shore or in.
 boarding ships, and will carry a much greater press of sail
 without danger.
     As  to the building part,             I think that may be easily un
 derstood.      My     boat     was  made      by men that had never before
 seen a boat built, and I flatter myself the Society will ap
 prove of it.            I am, sir, your most obedient servant,

 To C. TAYLOR, M.D. Sec.
 An Explanation of             the Engravings           of  a neutral-luilt self-
                                   balanced      Boat.
     By the term neutral is meant, what is neither of the two
 present modes now in use, i. e. clincher and carver, but
 both united, viz.' clincher in the inside and carver on the
outside, which           neutralizes both the two into               a third ;  and
as every thing          has a distinguishing           name,    I  have taken the
liberty to present            it  to  the public        under the name         of  a
Neutral Boat.
    The two modes of clincher-                    and carver.built      have each
their separate advantages arid disadvantages                   in regard to each
other.
    I  shall begin with the clincher first. As the sides of the
planks are firmly fastened to each other, by lapping over
and riveting, they are much stronger than if the edges only

to Mr. Wilson for this invention.
                                            R  2                           butted,

    260          Description    of a  secure Boat,   or Life Boat.         »
    butted, and they have the property of being made tight
    without caulking, only in the huddings and keel seams,
    and are much lighter than carver-built                boats, and more
   adapted tor many uses          ; beside saving the difference between
    thick   and     thin   plank.    But    they  have their disadvantages
    also  :  In  the first place, both unfair sides       and   unfair water
    lines, which make them liable to be injured by other bodies
    they come in contact with, and have the edges of the planks
    broke so as to make a leak, which would not happen to a
   smooth-sided         boat ; neither     can  the uneven    side move so
    well through the water, on account of its various resistances.
   They have also this disadvantage, that if damaged they re
    quire the skill of a professional workman to repair them.
       The carver.built boats have the advantage of having
    smooth sides and         fair water lines, together with having the
   planks of an equal thickness all over the boat, which makes
   them less liable to receive injuries when meeting with other
   bodies, and        more adapted       to   move in the water, by their
   fair sides and fair water lines.          They are also more readily
   repaired    :  if  a professional      boat.builder  is  not  at hand, it
   can be done by a common shipwright,               or any workman that
   is used to wood work.
       But they have also their disadvantages. In the first in
   stance they are under the necessity of being .built of plank
   of a great thickness to stand caulking ; at the same time
   they require larger timbers, which makes them heavy and
   unfit for miny uses, and also a great consumption of limber
   on account of the thickness of the plank necessary.                  They
   are also more subject to leaks from various causes than
   clincher-built boats.
       We will now look         to the neutral system, and see      if both
   their advantages       are not united,     and both the disadvantages
  got clear of.
       Plate  VIII.    Fig. 2, shows      the section  of the fore part of
  a hoat.      The longitudinal slips are represented lig.hter-co-
'
  loured, and placed over the joints where the edges of the
  planks      meet;     they   must be riveted      on to each adjoining
  plank, near the edge, in the same manner as clincher-built
  vessels, with a sufficient quantity of blair, made of tar and
                                                                     flocks,

           Description   of a  secure Boat,    or Life Boat.          26 1
flocks,    such  as is in common       use in the North   of England,
 (or any     other caulking,)       between   the slips and      planks,
which will always keep them tight, as long as the boat re
mains unstaved, or the planks worn through.                 These slips,
each being riveted to the two adjoining edii.es of the planks,
 as   shown in Fig. 4, will make the joint as           strong    as  the
joint of a common clincher-built boat, and             as tight, with
 out the risk of any external damage.              Those joints have
 also this advantage,      that the planks will not have their sides
 bevelled    off, but be of an equal thickness from edge to
 edge, which is not the case in clincher-built vessels ^ for at
 the ends they are half bevelled away, so as not- to bear
 clinching. By the neutral system two inches in the breadth
 of each plank will be saved in the laps, which may be con
 siderable in the conversion of plank.             I set little value on
 the slips, as there is always a sufficiency of waste in cutting
 the planks to a proper form.
      A boat of this construction has all the strength of one
 clincher-built, and can be made as light or lighter.                It is
  free from the disadvantages of irregular outsides, and from
  the difficulty of repairing, which in this cin be performed
 by any common workman in wood, as I have found by
  experience.     A boat built this way has a fair and smooth
  outside, it has all the advantages of a carver-built one, at the
  same time it is clear of the disadvantages          of being loaded
  with unnecessary      wood, which makes the carver-work             very
  heavv, the liability of leaks, and frequent want of caulking.
  There is one evil which both carvi r- and clincher-built boats
  have in common,        that of having keel seams, and a vacancy
  between    the sand    or  garboard streak, and the upper part of
  the keel, which soon gets filled with dirt, and remains so,
   which naturally retains moisture, and speedily rots the wood.
  In this   mode   that   evil is removed, by having the midship
   plank bolted on to the keel, wide enough to come over each
   side of the keel to clinch the slips on : this not only removes
   the evil,  but saves   a   great  deal  of trouble in making        the
   rabbets in the keel, and various bevellings in the sand streaks,
   which must be done by         a good   workman.
       These   boats require no larger timbers          than    common
                                       R 3                      clincher

   262        Description    of a secure Boat, or Life Boat.
   clincher-built boats,     as the timbers need no greater notches;
   but with this difference, that these         timbers will catch the
   slips that are riveted over the joints of the planks each way,
   and so the timbers and slips will brace one another, and add
   an additional strength ; but in the clincher-built boats, the
   timbers catch the laps of the seams only one way, and con
   sequently form no brace whatever.
      All I  need to explain      further on the neutral system is its
   application.      It can be applied to all open boats, of what
   ever form or use,      to  all coal and other barges, lighters, or
   any vessels used in rivers or canals, and also to all large cut
   ters and luggers, which are now clincher-built.

      Fig.  1, is a  bird's-eye view of the boat, showing the pro
  jecting   balance    bodies, or hollow sides a b, one of which,
  8, is left open to show the partitions which are placed op
  posite to each timber, and are water-tight ; by this means
  if  one or more should be broken,        the    rest   would keep the
  vessel buoyant.        These partitions gradually lessen          towards
  each end, where the planks unite, so as to make                 a  similar
  appearance     to any other boat when in the water.          '
      Fig. 2, shows the depth and form         of   the cells or  hollows,
  as they    appear in    a section of the boat    ; also the manner in
  which the slips are placed over the       joinings, or seams of the
  planks.

      The section Fig. 2, will best explain the nature and
  utility of the seli-balanced boat. The balance bodies form
 two separate holds, to put any thing in, such as provision,
-arms, &c. which are wanted to be kept dry, having locker
                                                                       lids,

             Description      of a  secure Boat,    or Life Boat.         2G3
  lids, to open at the top of the different partitions in the
  holds, as fancy or utility may require; or part of them may
  be filled with cork shavings, and by that moans, if the boat
  should happen to fill by any accident, she cannot sink.
      lu  the boat    I   have   altered   for government, the balance
  bodies    (if  the    interior   of   the boat    was filled with water)
  would     exclude      as much water, between           the inside of the.
  boat and the outside, as is equal to a body of water of one
  ton 17cwt. 2qrs., which is a great deal more than the
  weight of men that will go in her, consequently they can
  run no risk whatever of being drowned ; and even if she had
  a hole through her bottom, she would always keep a suffi
 cient heigh* out of the water either for rowing or sailing.
     But   the main object is to         make her sail and row much
 faster than other boats ; and both              on calculation and trial
 my boat will be found to sail much                faster   and   with much
 less danger than other boats.
     I now come        to the advantage       of rowing.   — As   the balance
 sides project a foot beyond the resisting part                in the water,
 there is that leverage on the boat (over a common one), and
 also the same in the length of the loom of the oar, that is
 in the inside from the gunwale of the boat, which allows
 the whole       of  the    oar to be lengthened, and by that means
 it describes a larger circle in the water, and makes a longer
 pull : the oars for the government boat I have made are
 lengthened from 14 to 18 feet.
    The experiment of having two spars fixed at a distance
from a boat's gunwale, and the oars to work from them,
has often been tried and found to answer, but this has a
great advantage         over that method.
    There is another advantage or property which this boat
has,- she cannot roll at sea, but always keeps a level position
as far as the surface         of the sea   will allow  ;  she may heel but
not roll,     as  the     balances    are  always ready to catch either
way, and the opposite one assists the other by its weight out
of water and gravitation ; neither can this boat pitch like
another, for the balance bodies being out of the water, and
the breadth of six feet only in the water, it can onlv act
with    a  gravity on the        water, equal to a boat       of the weight
                                         R  4                              of

264          Description         of a   secure Boat,   or   Life Boat.
of six    feet,   but    as the   resistance of the water upwards equal
to a boat     of eight      feet. wide.
  Or I may make this mechanical simile: Suppose a work
man uses a chisel to smooth a surface of wood , bv laying
too great a stress on the tool it will go loo far into the wood
for him to force it along in the direction wanted, but put
that chisel into a stock like a plane-stock, and stt it to the
depth required, then the stock will prevent its going too far
in, and he can work easily though the plane be pressed on
ever so hard..          A  view of the engraving will elucidate that
comparison,        as    the balance bodies lie parallel with the sur
face   of   the water lengthways.             The national        importance    of
such boats I leave to the public to decide. I must here
observe, that my plan contains two distinct and separate
improvements, viz. my neutral mode of building, and the
application of the balance bodies.                           ,
  The first improvement relates                   to the    luilding of boats,
barges,  &c. in general. The second is only partial, and
applicable to boats of peculiar descriptions or uses; that                      is,
all such as are wanted for dispatch, safety, or pleasure, or
occasionally for life.boats, as there can be no question of
the    self.balanced         boats      built upon my plan, rowing             and
sailing faster      than other boats,           and they may be used to go
to sea when others cannot               ;   but the application of the ba
lance bodies        is      not meant       as   general one, as     not fit
                                              a                      it
                                                                     is
for        of burden that are sometimes light and at others
       vessels
heavy  laden, when the difference of the draught of water                        is
considerable.

               — We whose names are hereunto subscribed
have examined the boat building on Mr. Wilson's plan,
(which he calls the neutral plan,) and are of opinion that                       it
will be attended with many advantages.
  The boats can be built as light as those that a,re clincher-
built, preserving    smooth surface, and will not require
                             a
caulking; and they can be easily repaired      any carpenter.by

                                         having air gunwales
is  obvious, and from the partial trial we have had of the
boat's sailing which he has altered, we are of opinion that
                                                                                his.

his improvement            in   the   keel  and   formation of the boat's
bottom, will        give her greater stability       than other boats       of

drawing very little water.                    Malcolm Cowan, R.N.

London,    May 7,    1806.
       Gentlemen,
     Permit me to present my thanks                 and   acknowledgments
 for the     truly     polite and      distinguished     manner in which
 (though a stranger) you              have   permitted me to visit your
 committee ; the society of which the same is formed I hold
 in the highest estimation, and have deeply to regret the
 distance that prevents           my offering myself        a candidate for a
 seat amongst you.
     The   last time     I  had    the   honour of attending your com
  mittee,    Mr. Wilson's new life-boat became the subject of
  discussion, the operation of which you did me the honour
  of requesting      me to acquaint you         of as soon as an opportu
  nity presented       itself for a fair trial of her at sea.
      About    three    o'clock in the afternoon of Friday last, the
  tide being     about quarter flood, and the wind at souh-west,
  blowing excessively hard, an object was discovered in the
  offing at about two leagues distance, bearing from the piers
  of Newhaven W S.VV. which had the appearance of a
  vessel water-logged,           and with only      her   foremast standing.
  This induced Mr. Thomas Tasker, (the person whom I ap
   pointed master of the boat, and which I have named the

 Finding its magnitude too vast for their strength to low, and
 the evening approaching, they returned. Numbers of persons
 were              on the piers to witness the action, power,
           assembled
 and performance of the boat, who were highly pleased and
 gratified. I was not present myself, but the next morning
 one of the crew was                 sent   to me      from Newhaven         to this
 place, who stated that the whole of them were so fully sa
 tisfied with the safety and superior powers of the boat, that
 they shall not be afraid to put to sea in any weatlier when
 the distresses     of their fellow.creatures           claim their exertions
 and assistance.            They particularly         observed, she,       with the
 six oars manned, pulled extremely light and easy through
 the water, and that though the breakers they pulled through,
 and the heavy seas they rode over were awful, she did not
 ship ten gallons of water the whole trip, neither were the
 men wet on the seats. We have now at Newhaven one of
 Mr. Greathead's            boats,    provided by subscription         ;   hul from
 the difficulty     of getting       her to sea, and her weight and con
 struction rendering it almost impossible to pull her through
 the  broken water, it is very improbable she will ever be
            •
 used.        .
   My opinion          is,   that    Mr. Wilson's boat will answer.              Its'
 cost  I conceive will exceed 15.0/. including the building and
 fitting her out.

 respect,              Gentlemen,        your obliged and most

                                   that the crew pulled her

      SIR,
 J. request you will            lay   before the Society of Arts, &c.
 the model      of a capstan contrived by me, which works with
 out requiring       the messenger         or cable coiled round it to be
 ever surged, an operation necessary              with common capstans,
 which is always attended with delay, and frequently with
 danger.       Capstans of this kind can be made by a common
 shipwright, and would not be liable to be put out of order.
They      also   would    not oscasion        any    additional   friction    or
 wear to the messenger or cable, in which particulars they
 would be superior to the other contrivance hitherto brought
 forward for the same purpose ; they also would much facili
 tate the holding on.
    The    great loss   of time-and      great   trouble which alwavs at
 tend applications to the navy board,               prevent my attempting
 to bring the matter before the public               through that channel,
 though I have had the most unequivocal approbation of the
 capstan from the two gentlemen of that board best qualified
 to judge of it.        I mention this, lest it might be thought
 that my not applying there             first was from any doubt of the
 goodness of the invention.             If the society should approve
 of  the capstan,     I will  draw up a more minute accoint of it
 for publication.           I am, sir, your very humble servant,

      According          to your desire,     I transcribe the part of                   the
letter from Mr. Peake (surveyor of the navy) to me, which
relates to the capstan laid before the society.
             Extract of a Letter from Henry Peake, Esq.
      " With        regard to your       ideas on the capstan,          I   have tried
all   I   can to find some objection to            it,   but confess             hitherto
have been foiled,          and shall more readily forward                it, I

only             plan now creeping into the service, more
           to supersede    a
expensive, and much worse than one lately exploded."
  As you and the members of the committee have seen the
letter,  imagine further attestation needless relative to it.

  I  request you will mention, that all friction of the revo
lutions of the cable (or messenger)     in passing each other
between           the barrels   of   the capstan, must be effectually pre
vented     the whole thickness of one of the rings that passes
              by

      In    obedience     to your      intimation,       that   a   written explana
tion of the advantages to be obtained                     by     the use of capstans

                       Description       of a Capstan.                 269
   As few but mariners understand                 the  manner in which
cables   are hauled       aboard      in large ships, it will probably
render the object of my capstan more manifest, to give some
account of this operation. — Cables above a certain diameter
are too inflexible to admit          of being coiled round     a capstan  ;
in ships where cables of such large dimensions are necessary,
a smaller cable is employed for this purpose, which is called
the messenger,      the two ends       of which are made fast together
so as   to   form     an   endless      rope, which, as' the capstan is
turned about, revolves           round it in unceasing succession,
passing   on   its course     to the head of the ship, and again re
turning to the capstan.            To this returning part of the mes
senger,   the    great   cable    is   made fast by a number of small
ropes,   called nippers, placed at regular intervals ; these nip
pers are applied,       as the cable enters the hawse hole, and
are again removed        as  it approaches the capstan, after which
it is lowered into the cable tier.
   The   messenger,      or any other rope coiled round the cap
stan, must descend          a space at every revolution equal to the
diameter of the rope or cable used ; this circumstance brings
the coils in a few turns to the bottom of the capstan, when
it can no longer be turned round, till the coils are loosened
and raised up to its other extremity,           after which the motion
proceeds   as  before.      This operation of shifting       the place   of
the coils  of  the messenger         on the capstan    is called  surging
the   messenger.       It always       causes considerable delay ; and
when the messenger          chances to slip in changing its position,
which sometimes happens, no small danger is incurred by
those who are employed about the capstan.
   The first method that I know of, used to prevent the ne
cessity of surging, was by placing a horizontal roller be
neath the messenger,           where it first entered on the capstan
so supported by a       frame, in which it turned on gudgeons,
that the messenger in passing over it was compelled to force
upwards all the coils above the capstan, as it formed a new
coil.
   This violent forcing of          the coils upwards along the barrel
of the capstan, not only            adds considerably to. the labour in
turning   the   capstan,     but   from   the great friction which the
                                                               messenger

 270                              Description     of a Capstan.
messenger             must suffer         in   the operation,    while    pressed    so
hard against the capstan, (as it must be by the weight of the
anchor and strain of the men,) could not but cause a very
great wear and injury to the messenger, or other cable
wound round the capstan ; and that this wear must occa
sion an expense of no small amount, must be manifest on
considering the large sums which the smallest cables used
for this purpose cost.
   The next method applied to prevent surging, was that for
which Mr. Plucknet obtained  a patent, the specification of
which may be seen   in the Repertory of Arts, No. 46.    IH
this way a number of upright puppets or lifters, placed
round the capstan, were made to rise in succession, as the
capstan turned round by a circular inclined plane placed
beneath them, over which their lower extremities moved on
friction wheels              ;    and^ these    puppets, as they rose, forced
upwards the coils                 of   the messenger on the barrel of the cap
stan.          This      was a superior method to the first,
                                                      the ope            as
ration of forcing upwards the coils was performed more
gradually by it ; but still the wear of the messenger from the
lateral friction in rising against the whelps of the capstan re
mains undiminished.
   The third method used for                          the same purpose was         that
proposed by captain Hamilton.                          It consisted in giving       the
capstan        a   conical shape,          with    an angle so obtuse, that the
strain of the messenger forced the coils to ascend along the
sloped sides of the barrel. The roller first mentioned was
sometimes used with this capstan, of which a full account
is inserted in the Repertory of Arts, vol. ii. The lateral
friction,          and    wear of the messenger             against   the whelps     of
the capstan, is equally great in this method as in the others                             ;
and      it,   besides,          has the inconvenience       of causing       the coils
to become loose              as  they ascend  for as the upper part of the
                                                  ;
barrel    is    near     a   third less in diameter than the lower part,
the round           of    the messenger          the lower
                                               that tightly embraced
part, must exceed the circumference of the upper extremity
in   the same proportion.

the society represents, none of the lateral friction of the
messenger or cable against the whelps of the capstan,
(which all the other methods of effecting the same purpose
before mentioned              labour      under,) can         possibly take place,
and       of   course   the wear     of   the messenger        occasioned thereby
willbe entirely avoided in    while        it,
                                        performs its purpose
                                                         it
more smoothly, equally, and with    less moving power than
                                                     a
any of them.
     My method of preventing                the necessity       of surging, con
sists in the simple addition of     second smaller barrel or
                                                     a
capstan of less dimensions to the large one; beside which
it   to be placed in
     is              similar manner, and which need not
                               a
in   general       exceed        half-barrel cask. The coils
                              the size     of   a
of the messenger are to be passed alternately round the large
capstan and this small barrel, but with their direction re
versed on the   different barrels, so that thev may cross each
other in the interval between the barrels, in order that they
may have the more extensive contact with, and better gripe
on each barrel. To keep the coils distinct, and prevent their
touching each other   passing from one barrel to the other,
                                in
projecting rings are fastened round each barrel, at distance            a
from each other equal to about two diameters of the mes
senger and the thickness of the ring.    Those rings should
be so fixed on the two barrels, that those on one barrel
should be exactly opposite the middle of the intervals be
tween those on the other barrel and this    the only cir
                                                 :               is
cumstance which requires any particular attention in the
construction of this capstan. The rings should project about
as much as the cable or messenger from the barrels, which
may be formed with whelps, and in every other respect,
not before mentioned, in the usual manner for capstan bar
rels, onlv that         I  would recommend the whelps to be formed
without          any    inclination inwards at the top, but to stand
upright all round, so  as to form the body of the capstan in
the shape         of
                polygonal prism,
                        a            the intervals between the
                                                    if
whelps are filled up, in order that the coils may have equal
tension at the top and at the bottom of the barrels, and
that       the    defect    which      conical barrels cause in this respect
 may be avoided.
                                                                              The

     The small      barrel should be furnished                 with falling palls as
well    as the large ones ; a fixed                 iron spindle ascending from
the deck will        be the best for            it,   as   will take up less room.

This spindle        may be secured                  below the deck, so                   as to bear
any strain,        as the      small barrel need not be much above half
the height     of       the    large      barrel    ;    the capstan             bars can easily
pass over    it    in   heaving round, when                   it     is    thought fit to use
capstan      bars on the same deck with                        the        small barrel.   As
two turns of the messenger round both barrels will be at
least equivalent to three turns round the common capstan,
it will hardly ever be necessary to use more than four turns
round the two barrels.
     The circumstance which                    prevents         the lateral          friction of
the messenger  in my double capstan,     that in   each coil     is,                it
iskept distinct from the rest, and must pass on to the se
cond barrel, before  can gain the next elevation on the first,

a single revolution,               it   regains as much as                is   necessary           in   its

 I   have described my double capstan, as           to be used            it   is                       in
large vessels,   where messengers       are necessary,  from the
great    size of the cables              ;    but   it   is   obvious that equally  it   is
applicable     in   smaller vessels,            as    their cables can be managed
with    in the same manner
        it                                     as   is directed for the messenger.
The     same principle may also be easily applied to windlasses,
by    having   a   small horizontal                 barrel      placed           parallel to the
body of      the windlass,              and having both fitted with rings,                              in
the same way as the capstan   already described.  The proper
place for the small horizontal   barrel  forward, just before   is
the windlass, and as much below its level as circumstances
will admit     ; should be furnished with catch.palls
                   it                                                                         as   well
as   the windlass.
     Besides the advantages
                         already stated, my proposed    im
provement to the capstan has others of considerable utility.
Its construction   so very simple, that
                              is            no more liable             it   is
to derangement or injury than the capstan itself.  Its cost
                                                                                                    can

oxides irreducible  by any hitherto known process. This
opinion was first adopted with reference to barytes, which
participates of the properties of both classes of bodies, and
was    from    analogy extended          to the other members           of     the
two species.
  Very shortly after Lavoisier's    Elemens de Chimie were
published,     some experiments, made at Schemnitz in Lower
Hungary,       by Toudi* and Ruprecht,    were given to the
world, by which it appeared that they had effected the re
duction of barytes, magnesia, and lime. These results, the
translator of that work, Mr. Robert Kerr, introduced into
the second English edition, immediately succeeding the
speculations of Lavoisier above alluded to, and accompanied
them      with some       original remarks on the nature and ar
rangement      of    physical bodies, which, as they are peculiarly
applicable to the present moment,              I   have thought proper to
transmit to you.
   He     observes    f " These
                        :     discoveries give reason to hope,
that chemistry may one day arrive at a most beautiful state
of simplicity.    It is, perhaps, no improbable conjecture,
that all the bodies in nature may be referred to one class of
simple comlustille elementary substances, to oxygen and
caloric; and that, from the various combinations of these
with each other, all the variety produced by nature and art
may arise. The only known difference between metals and
pure combustibles, as they are called, is in degrees of qua
lities.    They     are all combustible ; that        is,   they all combine
with oxygen, though under different degrees of temperature;
and in different states of saturation with that body form
oxides, which have alkaline    or acid properties."

      Such were        Mr. Kerr's views of chemical science              at least
  fourteen years ago.             Of their correctness and claim          to at
  tention,    we cannot have a stronger proof               than   the aptness
  of their    reference to the present reformed state of know
  ledge.     The      classification, for instance, into oxygen and
  inflammable matter*, which he suggests, is precisely the
  arrangement according to which natural bodies now divide
  themselves      ; and     with regard to his idea, that alkalinity de
  pended upon the dose of oxygen with which the combusti
 ble was united, (chimerical as it might have appeared in the
 day   it was elicited,) we now possess proof of its truth. So
 that, although this respectable philosopher has forborne to
 obtrude his speculations on the world at the present mo
 ment, and is, therefore, suffering himself to creep into the
 charnels of obscurity, we find that he is entitled to some
 attention,       and    I  have allotted myself the present task solely
 for the'purpose of dragging him into view.
     That future experiments will demonstrate hydrogen to be
 the common inflammable principle, and teach us that that
 substance and oxygen are the ultimate constituents of mat
 ter, is more than probable : there exist many facts which
might be adduced to prove the point ; amongst which, the
 late   most ingenious            experiments of        Braconnot   f   arc   by
 no means inconspicuous,               notwithstanding       the captious and
jejune objections made to               them by an English professor of
high respectability.           Oxygen and hydrogen, in fact, are the
only well characterized elementary substances in nature.

 LT. On Superacid and Sub-acid                      Salts.       By William
               Hyde Wollaston,              M.D.      Sec.    R. S.*
 In   the paper which has          just   been read to the          society, Dr.
 Thomson        has remarked,        that oxalic acid unites to strontian
 as- well   as to potash     in two different proportions, and that
 the quantity       of acid combined with each of these bases in
their super-o.xalates, is just double of that which is saturated
 by the same quantity of base in their neutral compounds.
     As  I  had observed      the same law to prevail          in various other
instances of super-acid and             sub-acid salts, I thought it not
unlikely that this law might obtain generally in such com
pounds, and it was my design to have pursued the subject,
with    the hope    of discovering       the cause to which            so regular
a relation might be ascribed.
     But since    the publication       of Mr. Dalton's theory of che
mical      combination,        as   explained and illustrated by Dr.
Thomson f,        the  Inquiry     which    I had designed appears to be
superfluous, as       all the facts that I had observed are but par
ticular instances of the more general observation of Mr.
Dalton, that in all cases the simple elements of bodies are
disposed to unite atom to atom singly, or, if either is in
excess,     it exceeds by a ratio to be expressed by some simple
multiple of the number of its atoms.
     However,     since those who are desirous of ascertaining
the justness of this observation by experiment, may be de
terred by the difficulties that we meet with in attempting to
determine with precision the constitution of gaseous bodies,
for the explanation of which Mr. Dalton's theory was first
conceived, and since some persons may imagine that the
results of former experiments on such bodies do not accord
sufficiently to authorize the adoption of a new hypothesis,
it may be worth while to describe                a  few experiments, each
of which may be performed with                    the utmost facility, and
each   of   which affords the most direct proof of the propor
tional redundance or deficiency of acid in the several salu
employed.

                      Sub -carbonate    of Potash.
    Experiment I. Sub-carbonate of potash recently prepared,
is one instance of an alkali having one-half the quantity of
acid necessary for its saturation, as may thus be satisfac
torily proved.
   Let two grains of fully saturated and well crystallized car
bonate of potash be wrapped in a piece of thin paper, and
passed up into an inverted tube filled with mercury,           and let
the gas be extricated from it by a sufficient quantity of mu
riatic acid, so that the space it occupies may be marked
upon the tube.
   Next, let four grains of the same carbonate be exposed
for a short time to a red heat , and it will be found to have
parted with exactly half its gas ; for the gas extricated from
it in  the same apparatus      will  be found to occupy exactly the
same     space as the quantity before obtained from two grains
of fully   saturated  carbonate.
                        Sub-carbonate     of Soda.
   Experiment      II. A    similar experiment may be made with
a saturated    carbonate    of soda, and with the same result; for
this also becomes a true semi-carbonate            by being exposed
for  a  short time to    a red heat.
                     Super-sulphate      of Potash.
   By   an experiment equally simple, super-sulphate        of potash
may be shown to         contain   exactly twice as much acid as is
necessary    for the mere saturation of the alkali present.
   Experiment III. Let twenty grains of carbonate of potash
(which would be more than neutralized by ten grains of sul
phuric acid) be mixed with about twenty-five grains of that
acid in a covered     crucible of platina, or in a glass tube three
quarters   of  an inch diameter,      and five or six inches long.
   By heating this mixture till it ceases to boil, and begins
to appear slightly     red hot, a part of the redundant acid will
be expelled, and there will remain a determinate quantity
forming super-sulphate of potash, which when dissolved in
water will be very nearly neutralized by an addition of twenty
grains more of the same carbonate of potash; hut it is ge
nerally found very slightly acid, in consequence of the small

quantity of sulphuric        acid which remains in the vessel in a
gaseous state at a red heat.
     Jn  the preceding experiments,         the acids are made to      as
sume a determinate proportion to their base,              by heat which
cannot destroy them.          In those which follow, the propor
tion which a destructible acid shall assume cannot be regu-
lattd by the same means ; but the constitution of its com
pounds previously formed, may nevertheless                be proved with
equal facility.
                       Super-oxalate      of Potash.
     Experiment IV. The common snpcr-oxalate of potash is
a   salt that contains alkali sufficient to saturate exactly half of
the acid present.       hence,     if  two equal quantities     of salt of
sorrel be taken, and      if one of   them be expftsed to a red heat,
the alkali which remains will be found               exactly to saturate
the redundant acid       of the other portion.
     In addition to the preceding compounds, selected as di
stinct examples of binacid salts, I have observed one re
markable instance of a more extended and general prevalence
of    the law under consideration ; for when the circumstances
are such as to admit the union          of    a  further quantity of ox
alic acid with potash.         I found    a  proportion, though diffe
 rent, yet analogous to the former,             regularly to occur.
                     §. Quadroxalate of Potash.
     In  attempting to decompose the preceding super-oxalate
 by means of acids, it appeared that nitric or muriatic acids
 are capable of taking only half the alkali, and that the salt
 which crystallizes after solution in either of          these acids, has
 accordingly exactly four times          as  much acid as would satu
 rate the alkali that remains.
      Experiment V. For the purpose of proving that the con
 stitution of this compound has been rightly ascertained, the
 salt thus formed should be purified by a second crystalliza
 tion in distilled water; after which the alkali of thirty grains
  must be obtained by exposure to a red heat, in order to neu
  tralize the redundant acid contained in ten grains of the
  same salt.     The quantity of uuburned salt contains alkali
  for   one part out   of four of the acid present, and it requires
                                                                        the

                   On Super.acid and Sul-acid Sails.                      279
the alkali    of    three equal quantities       of the same salt to satu-
rate the three remaining parts            of acid.
   The limit      to the  decomposition of super-oxalate of potash
by the above acids, is analogous to that which occurs when
sulphate of potash is decomposed by nitric acid ; for in this
case also, no quantity          of that acid can take more than half
the potash, and the remaining salt is converted into                a definite
super. sulphate, similar to that obtained by heat in the third
experiment.
   It is not improbable that many other changes in chemistry,
supposed     to be influenced by a general            redundance    of some
one ingredient,         may    in  fact   be   limited by a new order of
affinities    taking     place   at some      definite    proportion    to be
expressed      by a simple multiple.            And though the strong
power    of  crystallizing      in oxalic   acid,   renders the modifica
tions of which its combinations are susceptible more distinct
than those of other acids, it seems probable that a similar
play of affinities will arise in solution, when other acids ex
ceed their base in the same proportion.
    In order     to determine      whether oxalic acid is capable of
uniting to potash in a proportion intermediate between the
double and quadruple quantity of acid, I neutralized forty-
eight grains of carbonate of potash with thirty grains of oxalic
acid, and added sixty grains more of acid, so that I had two
parts of potash of twenty-four grains each, and six equiva
lent quantities of oxalic acid of fifteen grains each, in so
lution, ready to crystallize together, if disposed to unite,
in the proportion of three to one ; but the first portion of
gait   that crystallized,        was the common binoxalate,            or salt
of sorrel,       and   a portion     selected     from the after crystals
 (which differed verey discernibly in their form) was found
to contain the quadruple proportion of acid.                   Hence it is to
be presumed, that          if  these    salts  could have been perfectly
separated,      it would have been found,            that the two quanti
ties  of   potash     were equally divided, and combined in one
instance    with     two,  and in the other with the remaining four
 put of the six equivalent quantities of acid taken.
    To account for this want of disposition              to unite in the  pro-
                                      S 4                             portion

portion   of three  to one by  Mr. Dalton's theory, I apprehend
he might consider the       neutral salt as consisting of

The binoxalate as       1  and 1, or 2            with          2,
The quadroxalate as      1 and 2, or 2            with          4,
in which   cases the ratios which      I have observed     of the acids
to each other in these salts would respectively obtain.
   But an explanation, which admits the supposition of a
double share of potash in the neutral salt, is not altogether
satisfactory ; and I am further inclined to think, that when
our views are sufficiently extended, to enable us to reason
with precision concerning         the   proportions of elementary
atoms, we shall find the aritrfmetical relation alone will not
be sufficient to explain their mutual action, and that we shalt
be obliged to acquire a geometrical conception         of their relative
arrangement in all the three dimensions           of solid extension.
   For instance, if     we suppose    the  limit  to  the approach    of
particles  to   be the same in all directions,        and hence their
virtual extent to be spherical (which is the most simple hy
pothesis) ; in this case, when different sorts combine singly
there is but one mode of union.            If they unite in the pro
portion  of two   to one, the two particles    will naturally arrange
themselves    at opposite poles of that to which they unite.           If
there be three, they might be arranged with regularity at
the angles of an equilateral triangle in a great circle sur
rounding the single spherule; but in this arrangement, for
want of similar matter at the poles of this circle, the equili
brium would be unstable, and would be liable to be deranged
by the slightest force of adjacent combinations ; but when
the number of one set of particles exceeds in the proportion
of four to one, then, on the contrary, a stable equilibrium
may again take place, if the four particles are situated at
the angles of the four equilateral triangles composing a re
gular tetrahedron.
   But  as  this geometrical arrangement of the primary ele
ments of matter is altogether conjectural, and must rely for
its conformation or rejection upon future inquiry, I am de
sirous that it should not be conloimded with the results of
                                                                    the

the facts    and   observations related      above, which are suffi
ciently distinct and satisfactory with respect to the existence
of  the law of simple multiples.          It is perhaps too much to
hope, that the geometrical arrangement of primary particles
will  ever be perfectly known ; since even           admitting    that a
very small number of these atoms combining together would
have a tendency to arrange themselves in the manner I have
imagined ; yet, until it is ascertained how small a propor
tion the primary particles themselves bear to the interval
between them, it may be supposed that surrounding com
binations,    although    themselves     analogous,      might   disturb
that arrangement     ;  and in that case,     the   effect  of such in
terference must also be taken into the account, before any
theory of chemical combination can be rendered complete.
        LI I.  On the Uses    of Sugar for fattening Cattle.
 -L he honourable the West India committee                 having made
their fourth    report to the house     of commons on the distil
lation of sugar and molasses, we make the following ex
tracts from     that part which relates to the feeding of cattle
with sugar, and which we think will              be   interesting to the
majority of our readers.
   " In the course of their inquiries it        has appeared obvious
to your committee,       that  effectual   relief to the West Indian
colonies was only to be expected in one of the three follow
ing ways : a change of their staple commodity, sugar, for
some more lucrative produce ; a reduction of the expenses
attending its cultivation and sale ; or an advance of price,
whether effected by an increase of the demand, Or a dimi
nution of the supply.
   -" Under such circumstances,          your committee could not
but favourably entertain the consideration of a plan for em
ploying sugar in fattening cattle. The advantages of this
scheme, supposing the success to be but moderately an
swerable to the expectations formed, are obvious and pecu
liar ; the relief it offers would be of the most desirable kind,
that of opening anew source of consumption               — within   our-
                                                                 felyeij

 selves,   and  therefore   independent of external accidents,
 or war; not interfering with the interest of any body of
 men whatever ; extensive in proportion to the degree in
 which it should     prove    beneficial   to those    great  classes,
 the feeders and consumers of cattle       ; and   on the favourable
 supposition of eminent success, it would be attended with
 this especial advantage, that whatever increase of the price
 of sugar might be occasioned by the increased consumption
 from this cause, the burden would fall generally on the
whole country, and might perhaps be even compensated by
a reduction in the price of cattle, arising from the improve
ment in the mode of feeding them."             " As, however, it is
evident, that even      the present price of sugar, swelled as it
is by the duty, must prove an insuperable bar to its adoption
for this purpose, your committee thought it adviseable to
inquire into the possibility of admitting a drawback, to be
received   on all so employed, without risk to the present
revenue, which appears, by the evidence of Mr. Frewin, to
form the only ground of doubt concerning the allowance."
    " On private application, Mr. Parkes*, a very intelligent
practical chemist, took the subject into consideration, and
in a manner very creditable to his public spirit undertook a
conrse of experiments, and has detailed in a very clear and
able paper (which will be found in his evidence) several sub
stances, which appear capable of being so united with sugar,
as to prevent its being again used either for common cecono-
mical purposes, or in wash for distillation, and from which
it cannot be again separated without very considerable skill,
difficulty and expense, at the same time not injuring, as is
supposed, its nutritive qualities."
    The committee then relate to the house some of the cir
cumstances that have occasioned the present distresses of
the West India planters, and conclude by recommending it
to the house to reduce the duty on sugar for common con
sumption.

    25th day  of May    1808.     Lord Binning in     the chair.
                  • Author of the Chemical Catechism.              *(.
                                                                   Sir

           On the Uses       of Sugar for fattening Cattle.           283
    Sir John Sinclair, Bart. M.P. called, and examined by
the committee.
    "  Has  the board      of agriculture been taking any steps to
ascertain the effects         of sugar in feeding or fattening live
stock?" "Directions were given to Mr. Arthur Young, se
cretary to the board, to collect as many facts as he possibly
could, tending to point out the advantages of the use of
sugar in feeding or fattening live stock, which are now given
in ; and    a premium        has  been   offered   by the board to the
 following     effect :
                           *
                              To the persons who shall make and re
port to the board       the most satisfactory experiments        to ascer
 tain the quantity,      the effect,   and the value   of brown    musco
vado     sugar, in feeding or fattening           oxen,   tows, hogs, or
 sheep,   a piece  of plate of the value of 25 guineas.'
     "  The board would        have been very happy to have given a
 larger premium, had its funds admitted of it ; but full jus
 tice cannot be done to so extensive an inquiry, unless pre
 miums to so large an amount as 1000/. in all were granted
 by parliament for that special purpose."
     John Curwen, Esq. M. P. was then examined by the
 committee, who stated that he had tried sugar and molasses
 on calves, without success         :
                                      " But,"    said he,  " I conceive   it
 may be applied for rearing stock, giving a part            skim-milk."
  He stated that he had used it in the proportion of 2 oz. of
  molasses boiled in two gallons of water, which was found
  to produce great laxity in the animal.               On this the com
  mittee remark (page 395) :          " The apparent results from the
  evidence of an honourable member of this house appear dis
  couraging ; but it does not seem impossible to account for
  them, without concluding against the general effect of sugar
  given in larger quantities, and in a less diluted form.              Ex
  periments, which it is hoped will prove more decisive, are
  about to be instituted."
      27th day of May 1808.            Lord Binning in the chair.
      Arthur Young, esq. called, and examined by the com
   mittee.
      "  Can you give       the committee any information         as to the
                                                               probability

  f84        On the Uses   of Sugar for /aliening Cattle.
  probability   of feeding live stock with sugar or     molasses   with
  success?"
     "  Whatever     I know   relative to this subject has been from
  reading, and a very little personal information from one or
  two individuals ; and the whole is detailed in a paper, which
  the president of the board of agriculture informed me he had
  delivered in to the committee."         " Should it be found upon
  experience to answer, it seems to offer a very considerable
 market for sugar; for on the average of the last six years
 London has consumed 123,000 oxen, and 827,000 sheep."
 Calculating from the London consumption, he goes on to
 show that if the use of sugar were general for feeding cattle,
 the whole consumption of the kingdom, at 2oz. for each
 animal per day for six months, (which, at 4d. per pound,
 would be only [d. per day,) would amount to 140,000 hhds.
 annually.
                "  Do you conceive the sugar would be nourish
 ing to the cattle, from the bulk of the food, or merely by
 assisting the nutriment derived from other substances ?"
                                                                    " I
 do not apprehend that the bulk of any quantity of sugar that
 could be given would be material in fattening a beast ; but
 the quality of the food I conceive to be so good, that it
 would render other articles of nourishment of a much more
 fattening nature ; for instance, you could not fatten         a beast
 upon cut straw or bran, but with the addition of              a  small
 quantity    of sugar,   I should    apprehend such an effect might
 take place."
     13th day   of June   1808.     Lord Binning in    the chair.
    Mr. Samuel Parkcs called,          and  examined by the com
 mittee.
    "  What    is the business   in which you    are engaged  ?"   "A
 manufacturing chemist."
    "  Have you made any experiments on the mixture of
 different substances with sugar, so as to prevent its being
used for domestic purposes, or for distillation, without in
juring   its nutritious qualities   ?"  " I have  made many experi
ments, the results      of which I    am ready to state to the com
mittee."
                                                                   The

                On the Uses          of Sugar for fattening Cattle.                285
  The witness here read, and afterwards, on the 1 6th of
June, delivered in to the committee the following statement :
    "•   When       I   was informed          of your inquiries respecting          the
possibility of rendering sugar unfit for common use, with
out destroying its nutritious properties, and received your
requisition to engage in the investigation of the subject, I
lost no time in instituting such a scries of experiments                           as    I
conceived would be necessary to ascertain the fact.
    " This       being entirely new ground, no chemist having
ever engaged         in such an undertaking that,we know of, I
made a        great number of experiments, the chief of which I
will endeavour              to describe, and their results, with as much
brevity as the nature of the subject will permit.
   " Interwoven with these details you will perceive an ac
count of some facts already known to chemists; but I was
desirous of furnishing you with every thing of importance
on the subject.   To this end I have examined a large body
of chemistry with great care, and I hope no work has escaped
me that would have thrown any light upon the inquiries in
which you          are engaged.
"   " Sugar is said to contain more nutriment in the same
bulk than any other known substance *; but how to allow
its use duty free for the purpose of feeding cattle, and at the
same time guard against any encroachment upon the revenue
now arising from               it,   may be attended with considerable             dif
ficulties.
    "The chief difficulty,               in
                              my estimation, arises from the
soluble nature of sugar; for,   sugar be mixed with ground
                                              if
com,, barley meal, or other farinaceous matter, which                                   it
might be in the presence of an excise officer, there would
be danger of its afterwards being washed out        means of           by
water, the water evaporated,                     and the sugar brought            again
into the market.
    "    One pound of water              is   capable   of dissolving one pound
of sugar.          Lime.water          renders sugar still more soluble,
                                                                   and

 one part of lime,) I conceive this would not be a proper
 means of rendering sugar unfit for common use.   Lime in
 powder, if mixed with sugar, might perhaps answer better,
 ifthis would not injure the cattle ; and it would prevent the
 sugar so mixed from being fraudulently used for the still, as
lime, even in small quantities, has the property                                of rendering
sugar incapable of fermentation*.
      "   An   aqueous           solution of sugar may be preserved a long
time unaltered             if   the sugar be pure ; but if mixed with mu
cilaginous or farinaceous matters, it quickly enters into the
vinous fermentation. This property of sugar is an objection
to its being mixed in a state of solution with any kind of
ground corn for any considerable time before it is intended
for use.
      "
     Sugar is found by analysis to be a triple compound,
consisting of 98 parts, by weight, of carbon, 8 parts of hy
drogen, and 64 parts of oxygen.
   " Sugar being of vegetable origin, few bodies are capable
of uniting chemically with it.                              Most   substances      therefore,
if    mixed with            it,      would form mere mixtures and not che
mical compounds.                     There    one substance, however, which
                                              is
mixes   readily with sugar, which destroys its taste entirely,
and yet does not decompose it. This        fixed alkali.   If,     is

therefore, potash or soda be mixed with sugar, either of
them will completely destroy its saccharine taste; but the
sugar will not be decomposed, for      may be recovered un   it
changed         by
              the addition of sulphuric acid, which would
form an alkaline sulphate which might be precipitated from
the solution          by   alcohol.           Hence      it     may be supposed, that
the mixture of small quantity of an alkali with sugar would
                       a
not deprive   of its nutritious qualities.

water in separate vessels, and added two.drachm measure of yeast to each.

mixture began to ferment, but that containing the lime showed no signs of
fermentation,     though        it   was continued     in   a   favourable   situation during   a
period of twenty.four            days.    A   similar experiment was nude          with potash
with the tame result.

     Having mixed 112 grains of good brown sugar with 10
grains of a very strong solution of caustic potash, the sugar
lost its sweetness  entirely, and the whole acquired a dis
agreeable urinous taste.   One cwt. of sugar would require
about -libs, of American potash to reduce it to this                                      state,
the expense of which would be about 2s. Qd. or 3.?. On the
mixture of potash and sugar I poured three grains of sul
phuric acid, diluted with a little water. This restored the
sugar to its usual flavour, the sulphuric acid having formed
a salt by its union with the alkali.   The expense of thus
recovering the saccharine taste of the sugar would be only
Is. per cwt. ; but as a salt would then be in solution with
it,   this wouldprevent its being applied to common pur
poses, for the affusion of alcohol would be too dear an ex

        "
     Since    engaged in this inquiry
                   I                      have been
                                                I                           informed
that catile will eat rancid fish oil with avidity                  ;    if   so, such
oil, and especially the dregs of oil, usually called oil foot,
which comes very cheap, might be put into the hhds of
sugar at the West India Docks in the presence of an officer,
and    once poured on sugar no common expense would
            if
ever be able to separate it. Linseed oil being more fluid
might         be poured into      the hhds at the cane holes.                        This
would so spread itself throughout the whole hogshead, that
Iam persuaded the sugar could never afterwards be used for
any domestic   purpose. Moreover,         well known that
                                                   it   is
sugar, when mixed with oil,    incapable of the vinous fer

                   ;                                                                   a
fraudulent use of it.
    " Sulphuret of potash or soda has the property of con
verting sugar into      mucilaginous substance not unlike
                              a
gum.             Mucilage   and   sugar   are both highly nutritive,                 but
they differ in their chemical properties.  Sugar     soluble                is
not only in water, but in alcohol   mucilage   : soluble  in       is
water, but insoluble in alcohol.  Sugar    an essential in
                                                         is
gredient in all vinous fermentation                ;   mucilage        is   incapable
of that process.
    "       In order to
                 ascertain the expense of treating sugar with
an alkaline sulphuret,    mixed 14 grains of dry sulphuret of
                               I
potash with      grains of sugar. The mixture soon became

potash were manufactured directly for this purpose,      suf                     a
ficient quantity for mixing with one cwt. of sugar would
cost near 145.   but   apprehend there are common alkaline
                       ;     I
sulphurets which might be had cheap enough,         the cattle     if
would not refuse the mixture.      Respecting the nature of
this mixture, or the nutritious quality of sugar when reduced

        an alkaline sulphuret,may be remarked that mucilage
                                     it
    very similar in some of its properties to sugar, for many

               On the Uses   of Sugar for fattening Cattle.           289
    plants which yield sugar at a certain period of their growth,
    only contain mucilage at an earlier period. This is the case
    with several of our wall-fruits. In the operation of malting,
   the mucilage of the barley absorbs oxygen, and is converted
   into sugar. No chemical means, however, have yet been
   discovered of effecting the same purpose. We can, as you
   have seen, readily convert sugar into mucilage, but have not
   yet acquired the means of regenerating sugar from the same
   mucilage.      This circumstance is in favour of adopting this
   method for the deterioration of sugar, if it should be found
   to agree with the cattle.
      "  Having moistened 112 grains of sugar with water, two
   drops of a solution of sulphate of iron, and two drops of
   tincture of galls were mixed with the mass; by exposure to
   the air this sugar became quite black, and tasted of iron
  very strongly.      It would cost    15. per cwt. to blacken sugar
  in this way    ; but  as oak bark or any other substance that
   contains the gallic acid might be employed instead of galls,
  it could   be done in quantities at less expense, and I know
  of no cheap method by which sugar thus treated could be
  rendered    again fit for sale or common use.           Indeed, if the
  gallic  acid  were  separated   from   the  gallate of iron  by means
  of potash, the sugar might then be fermented and fraudu
  lently used for the still : but this could not be expected to
  succeed, unless it were done by an experienced chemist, for
  an excess of potash would render the sugar incapable of fer
  mentation.       And even if the mixture were submitted to
  distillation, it is probable that part of the iron would come
 over in the process, and contaminate the spirit.
      " One hundred and twelve grains of sugar were mixed
 with ten grains by weight of oil of vitriol, previously diluted
 with a little water. This rendered the mixture so sour, that it
 would be impossible to use such sugar for common purposes.
.The oil of vitriol also blackens it considerably.             It would
 cost 3s. or 3s. fid. per   cwt.   to treat  sugar  in this  way, but a
 less quantity    of oil of vitriol might be sufficient, and when
 mixed with a large portion of other food, I think the acid
 would not be disagreeable to cattle.
      " No experiment was made with             nitrous acid, because

the operation of that acid on sugar has been long known to
chemists.   By its means two new acids are formed from
sugar, first the malic, and then the oxalic, acid, neither                       of
which would be of any use as food for cattle.
  "I  mixed 112 grains of sugar with ten grains of common
alum.  Here the sugar lost a great portion of its sweetness,
and acquired a disagreeable astringent taste. One cwt. of
sugar would require lolbs. of alum for the formation of
such a mixture, which would cost 2s. 3d. In this and the
last experiments the sugar might be completely restored by
the addition of nitrate or muriate of barytes, which would
precipitate the sulphuric acid from the sugar in the one case,
and from the earth of alum in the other ; but as both these
are poisonous salts, no one would think of using them to
regenerate sugar for domestic purposes.
   " One hundred and twelve grains of sugar were mixed
with      20 grains     of common salt. This proportion of salt
destroys the sweetness        of the sugar, and renders it unfit for
human consumption. If government would allow the farmer
waste salt free of duty, of which a sufficient quantity may
be had at the salt-works,          called the      ' pickings of the pans,'
at 5s. or 10s. per ton,it appears to me, that this would be
the most suitable, convenient, and ceconomical article that
could be used to prevent the sugar from being again brought
into common consumption.    Cattle and horses are fond of
 it,
 it     known to agree well with them, and there
          is                                           no                   is
cheap way     whichbythe sugar could be separated from it.
Cattle are so fond of salt, that they will even devour large
quantities of marie   mixed with it. In America
                          if                           com        it   is

  shall witness the complete solution of sugar in sea-water,         I
  apprehend the duty on sugar may be remitted, without any

 of common consumption : 30 lbs. of sea-water contain on
 an average one pound of common salt ; and would take up
 near 30 lbs.    of sugar.
    "   On this subject I    have consulted some farmers    of great
 intelligence and experience, who are of the class of improved
 breeders, and feed both sheep and cattle on an extensive
 scale.    These gentlemen entered cordially into my views,
 and communicated to me the following particulars.             They
 say that with sugar salt      may be used in the proportion       of
 one-sixth    with   advantage ; but that for the purpose of      se
 curing the revenue, the mixture might be one part salt, one
 part train oil, and ten parts of sugar. From my own ex
 periments, I am persuaded, that less than five per cent. of
 train oil would     effectually prevent sugar from ever being
used for domestic purposes.          These gentlemen are of opi
nion, that the salt causes a quick circulation of the fluids,
and that chalk, which has long been given with salt to
calves, acts upon this principle.        The salt induces the calf
to lick up the chalk, but the improvement in the colour of
the flesh may be owing to the salt impelling the fluids, which,
otherwise,     from a calf's confinement, would be stagnant.
    "I    next tried saltpetre with sugar, and made several ex
periments with it ; but it appeared to me that the quantity
necessary to alter the flavour of the sugar sufficiently, would
be too dear for the use      of the farmer.
   "  I  then tried assafcetida;    1 12 grains of sugar were mix
ed with a quarter     of  a grain  of this gum in solution.    This
rendered the mixture so strong in flavour and smell as to
make it unfit for any common purpose ; but whether this
offensive property could be sufficiently disguised for cattle
by the mixture of other food can only be known by trial. It
would cost about 4d. per cwt. only to treat sugar thus with
assafcetida.
   "  Many other experiments were made ; but as their re
sults did not seem to bear so much on the question as I ex-

citing them.
     " la addition      to those substances            on which         I   have     ope
rated, several others have occurred to me j but it would de
pend upon the taste of the cattle, whether any of them
could be brought into use. The articles I allude to are, rape
oil, whale oil, foot oil, horse turpentine, coal tar, com
mon tar*,       gall of animals, blood, wood ashes, soap
                  the

and the residuum procured from makers of oil of vitriol,
called sulphur ashes.
     "In this list I have not adverted to urine; but                          I am    in
clined to think that, all things considered, this might be the
best to mix with sugar, to prevent iis getting again into
common consumption.         If farmers were allowed sugar duty
free, on condition of an officer                 of excise seeing             a certain
quantity of urine mixed with every cwt. of the sugar, there
could, I think, be no danger of the farmer ever using it for
other purposes than those for which government would al
low him     to draw the duty.             Besides, the disgusting                  nature
of urine is such        that the quantity         might        safely       be fixed so
low that there would            be no dinger      of the cattle not eating            the
sugar, when mixed with a large portion of other food. The
beneficial effect of urine upon horses is so well known, that
it   has become a common  practice with grooms, whenever
they want a horse to have a remarkably fine coat, to mix
urine in the manger with his corn.
     "   Chaff   is an article much used by feeders                  of cattle ;      su
gar stained with oil might be mixed with chaff, as another
prevetftahVe.  Besides, as chaff is naturally astringent, the
quantiry)of chaff that can now be given to cattle is limited.
By mixirig such sugar with                 it,
                                more might be used, and
more sugar also might be given to cattle than they could
otherwise bear.          Such      a   mixture    would        be much         cheaper
than feeding in the usual way with oil-cake, on account of
the fattening property of sugar, and the small value of chaff.

rally cultivated,             is preferred     to the old sorts, the Swedish
containing one-fourth more sugar.
     "
     There are many testimonies on record to the nutritious
properties of sugar. Mons. Lennes, first surgeon to the late
duke of Orleans, relates the following circumstance : ' A
vessel,' said he,                '
                         with sugar, bound from the West
                                     laden
Indies, was becalmed for several days on her passage, during
which         the        stock of provisions           was   exhausted.    Some     of
the crew were  dying with the scurvy, and the rest were
threatenedwith death by famine. In this emergency recourse
was had to the sugar. The consequence was, the symptoms
of the scurvy went off,                      the crew found it a wholesome and
substantial aliment,                   and returned in good health to France.'
     "   It   is related, that             sugar given alone, was found to fat
ten horses        and cattle, during the war before last in St. Do
mingo,        for a period of several months, in which the expor
tation of sugar and importation                        of grain   were prevented   by
the want of ships.
     "   According          to       Dr. Rush, sugar      has the most favourable
effect on the animal ceconomy                      ;   and that eminent physician,
Sir John Pringle, remarked, that                        the plague has never been
known in any country, where sugar composes                                a material
part of the diet of the inhabitants.
     "
     Sugar has this advantage over most kinds of aliment,
that it is not liable to have its nutritious qualities affected
by time or weather; hence it is preferred by the Indians ia
their excursions from home.                       They mix maple          sugar with
an equal quantity                of ground Indian corn,           and pack the mix
ture in little baskets, which frequently get wet in travelling,
without   ever injuring the sugar.  A few spoonfuls of this
mixture,        a pint of water, afford them a pleasant and
                in half
strengthening meal.
     "
     Another way of using sugar for cattle has occurred to
me   :   that   is,       to mix      it   with various kinds of damaged      meal,
such meal           as    would be totally unfit for human consumption.

Or   mixture of damaged barley meal, oat meal, damaged
      a
flour,rape cake, or linseed cake might be made, and then
baked with sugar into bread.   This would form a kind of
gingerbread, with which cattle might be fed very cheaply.
The trial perhaps might be made at his majesty's bakehouse
at Deptford.          A   large        quantity        of the different kinds of
damaged          meal is annually         baked        in London          into    what is
called  dog-bread,           for       kennels,       of that
                                                       &c.     The    bakers
would easily come into the way of baking this also. Horses
at sea will eat ship-biscuit ; this is well known to mariners.
Should there be any difficulty in getting cattle to eat this new
kind ofsweet bread, it might at first be ground for them.
     **   I
       have been induced to suggest this method of using
sugar for cattle, and some others mentioned above, because
I conceive it would be a desirable thing, should government
"give sugar to farmers free       of duty, to allow them an optton
in    the       articles to be employed for the deterioration of the
sugar.          This would tend to bring feeders of cattle sooner
into the general use of            it,
                         and.indeed different localities may
perhaps require something of the kind, in order to occasion
a    general consumption.

LIII.     Essay    upon Machines         in General.    By M. Carnot,

 LV.     1 hese reflections should seem sufficient for unde
 ceiving those who think that with machines charged with
levers arranged mysteriously,            we may put an agent, though
 never so feeble, in a condition to produce the greatest effects;
 the error proceeds from persuading ourselves, that it is pos
 sible to apply to machines in movement what is not true
 except with respect to the case of equilibrium : from the
 circumstance of a small power holding a very great weight
 in equilibrium, many persons think that it could in the same
 way raise this weight as quickly as they please : now this is a
 very striking mistake, because, in order to succeed, the agent
 must procure for itsdf a velocity beyond its faculties, or
 which would at least make it lose so much the greater part
 of   its effort upon the machine as it would be obliged to
 move itself more quickly. In the first case the agent, has no
 other object to attain than to make an effort capable of
 counterbalancing the weight; in the second case, besides
 this effort, there must be also another to overcome the iner
 tia, both    of  the body on      which it impresses      the movement
 and    of its own proper     mass    :   the total effort which in the

weight of the body, is here divided into two, the first of
which continues to make an equilibrium in the weight, and
the other produces the movement. We therefore cannot aug
ment one of these efforts except at the expense of the other ;
and this is the reason  why the effect of machines in motion
is always so limited that it can never surpass the momentum
of activity exercised by the agent which produces it.
   It    without doubt, for want of paying sufficient atten
          is,
tion to these different effects of one and the same machine,
considered sometimes                            in   a   state    of       repose        and sometimes          in
movement, that some persons not unacquainted with sound
theory frequently abandon themselves to the most chimerical
ideas,     while we                  see      simple workmen turning to advantage,
as   it   were       by   instinct,             the real properties of machines, and
judging very accurately of their                                      effects.            Archimedes          only
wanted      a    lever and                a   fixed point,            in order           to move the globe
of the earth  how did;   happen then,    may be said, that
                                                it                              it
so great    man as Archimedes could not, even when fur
                a
nished with the best machine in the world, raise weight of                                     a
one hundred pounds in one hour to     small given height                        a                               ?
It because the effect of machine at rest and of one in
     is                                                      a

terogeneous      the first case
                     :        in      requisite to destroy and   it   is
to hinder the movement     in the second, the object

duce      it           up now
                and to keep           clear that this last case
                                              it       ;              it   is
requires more consideration than the first viz. the real ve                          :
locity of       each point                 of   the system            ;— but we shall              better per
ceive the reason                     of this difference                by   the      following remark.
     Any given                   fixed points                or obstacles are forces purely
passive, which may absorb                               a    movement however great    may               it
be, but which can never produce one, let                                            it   be never so small,
in body at rest now
     a                               :             it   is   very improperly that               in   the case
of equilibrium we say of                                a    small power, that                it   destroys
                                                                                                                is a
great one                            not      by   the small power that the great one
                     it it   is is
                 :
destroyed;                           by
                    the resistance of the fixed points: the
small power in reality destroys but   small part of the great,         a
and the obstacles do the rest.  If Archimedes had possessed
what he wished for,                         it     would not have been he                      who would
                                                                                                          have

                         On Machines in General,                                            297
have supported the globe, it would have been his fixed
point: all his art would have consisted not in redoubling
his efforts to contend against the mass of the globe, but to
put in opposition two great forces, the one active, and the
other passive, which he would have had at his disposal :                                     if,
on the contrary,   had been requisite to produce an effective
                         it
movement, in this case Archimedes would have been obliged
to draw   entirely from his own proper person
           it                                       and yet                    ;              it
would have been very .small, even after several years   let us                      :
not attribute therefore to active forces, what                            is   owing to the
resistance      of obstacles only,           arid the      effect     will not          appear
more disproportioned to the cause in machines at rest than
in machines in motion.
  LVI.        What      is   the true object therefore                of machines in
motion    ?      We     have      already said, that           to procure the
                                                                it   is
faculty of varying at pleasure                   the terms of the quantity Q,
or the momentum of activity which should be exercised by
the moving forces. If time be precious,  the effect must
                                                             if if
be produced in very short time, and
                        a                    we have only                                     a
power capable of very little velocity, but of great effort, we       a
may find  machine capable of supplying the velocity neces
              a
sary for the force              if,
                      on the contrary, we must raise
                            :                        very                               a
considerable weight, and we have but     weak power,            a                            al
though capable of great velocity, we may contrive    ma                                 a
chine with which the agent will be in    condition to com    a
pensate       by
            its velocity the force of which       deficient.              it   is
Lastly,    if     the   power     is   neither capable of            a    great effort       nor
of   a   great     velocity, we may still, with
                                            proper machine,      a
make    produce the effect desired, but then
         it                                     will require              it
much time; and herein consists   the well-known principle',
tkat in machines in movement, u-e always lose in time or in
velocity what we gain in force.
  Machines are therefore very useful, not       augmenting                by
                                                                                              by by
the effect        of which
                      powers are naturally capable, but
modifying this effect        true we shall never succeed
                                  :    it   is
means of them in diminishing the expense or momentum of
activity necessary for producing an effect proposed   but they                  ;
will assist us in making    proper division of this quantity
                                       a
tor attaining the desigu in view               their assistance
                                                  :   it   is    by
                                                                                            that

that we shall succeed                     in determining,          if   not the absolute
movement of each part of the system, at least in establishing
among these different particular movements the relations
which are most proper : it is by them, lastly, that we shall
give to the moving forces the most convenient situations
and directions, the least fatiguing, and the most proper for
employing their faculties in the most advantageous manner.
   LVII.         This naturally       following interesting
                                          leads us to the
question — Which  is the best method of employing       any
given powers, the  natural effect of which   is known,   ou
applying them to machines in motion ?      In other words,
What is the method of making them produce the greatest
possible effect ?
  The solution   of this problem depends upon particular cir
cumstances ; but we may hereupon make some general ob
servations applicable to all cases. The following are among
the most essential.
  The effect produced being the same thing (LII.) with
the momentum of activity exercised by the resisting forces,
the general condition  that         is,
                                  maximum     now
                                                q    never
                                                      is   a            :         q
being able to surpass                Q,        1st,    The quantity O must itself
be the greatest possible            ;     2dly,       All this momentum         Q     must
be solely employed in producing the                            effect proposed.
  In order to make                  Q      a   maximum,            we    must consider
that   it   depends         upon four things, viz.: upon the quantity of
force exercised             by the agent which should produce the effect
g, upon its velocity, upon its direction, and upon the time
during which     acts. Now, 1st, As to what regards the di
                       it
rection of the force,     evident that this power should be
                                   it
                                   is
in every thing, besides being equal, directed in the same ratio
with its velocity, for the momentum of activity which du
ring   d
       t   power
             a       exercises, the velocity of which
                            F                           V, and                is
the    angle       comprehended between     and V, Z, being    F
(XXXII.) FWdt             cosine z,    clear that this produce
                                                it     is
will never        be greater than when cosine                       z will   be equal to
the total sinus,        i.    e. when the force and its velocity shall be
directed     the same ratio
             in               2dly, As to what regards the in
                                      i
tensity of the force exercised, its velocity, and the time du
ring  which       exercised
                  it   is    we should flot determine these
                                      ;
                                                                                   things

                             On Machines in General.                                      299
things in an absolute manner, but solely place them in
the relations in which experience has shown they will be of
most advantage: for instance, I shall suppose that a man.
attached for eight hours in a day to a winch of one foot ra
dius, might make continually an effort of 25 tons by making.
one turn every two seconds, which nearly amounts to the
velocity of three feet per second ; but if we forced this man
to go quicker,            thinking thereby             to hasten the business, we
should retard          it,   because he would not be in                    a   condition to
make an effort of 25 tons, or could no longer work at the
rate of eight hours  day. If, on the contrary, we diminish

ed the velocity,             the    force would augment, but in    less de       a
gree,       and the momentum              of activity would also diminish                    :
thus, according to experience, in ordev that this momentum
should be maximum, we must proportion the machine so
                 a
as to preserve to the power the velocity                          of   three    feet per se

It    is   well known that each kind of agent has, in respect of
its physical nature or constitution, maximum analogous toa.
that of which we have spoken, and that this maximum can
in    general       only be found            by
                                      experience.
      LVIII.        This first condition being fulfilled,
                                                  nothing re
mains to be done, to produce with any given machine the
greatest effect possible, but to manage matters so as that the
whole quantity O         employed in producing this effect;
                                    is
 for   if   this be done, we shall have                 q   = O;         and this    is   all we
can expect, since O can never be less than q.
   Now in order to fulfil this condition,     say,   the first         I         in
place, that we should avoid every shock or sudden change
whatever for    ;  easy to apply to all imaginable cases the
                          it   is
 reasoning which has been laid down (XLV1I.) as to ma
 chines with weights whence    follows, that every time there,
                                    ;             it
 is   a    shock, there        is   at the same time          a   loss   of momentum of
 activity on the part                   of the soliciting forces           ;
                                                                           a     loss so real
 that the effect of            it       is necessarily diminished, as we have
 shown with respect                     to machines with weights in the above
 article    :therefore with reason
                it   is                                       that we have advanced
 (LI.),  that in order to make machines produce the greatest
 effect possible, they must of necessity never change their
                                                                                 movement,

movement,    except by insensible degrees ; — we must solely
except those which by their very nature are subject to un
dergo different percussions, like most kinds of mills ; but
even in this case,            it   is clear that we should avoid every sud
den change which is not essential to the constitution of the
machine.
  LIX. We may conclude from this, for example, that the
method           of producing          the   possible effect in a hy
                                                greatest
draulic          machine     moved by a current of water, is not to
adapt a wheel to            it,the wings of which receive the shock
of   the fluid.      In fact, two good                  reasons prevent us from pro
ducing in this way the greatest effects    the first  as we            :               is,
have already said, because    essential to avoid every kind
                                             it   is
of percussion whatever                 ;   the second                 is,   because   after the
shock of the fluid there        velocity which remains to
                                           is   still   a
itas  pure loss, since we should be able to employ this
         a
remainder in still producing new effect to be added to the
                                                 a
first. In order to make the most perfect hydraulic machine,
i.   e. capable of producing the greatest possible effect, the
true difficulty lies, 1st, In managing so as that the fluid may
lose absolutely all its movement                          by
                                      its action upon the ma
chine, or at least that there should only remain precisely the
quantity necessary for escaping after its action  2d, Another                  ;
difficulty occurs in so far as  loses all this movement
                                                  it                                         by
insensible degrees, and without there being any percussion,
either on the part of the fluid, or on the part of the solid
parts among themselves   the form of the machine would be
                                       :
of little consequence for hydraulic machine which will
                                   ;         a
fulfil   these two conditions        will always produce the greatest
                           but this problem    very difficult to resolve
                                                             it is
possible effect       :
in general, not           to say impossible              ;           may even happen that
in the physical           state    of things,           and in respect            of their sim
plicity,         there can be nothing                better than wheels moved by
shocks       ;   and in this case as           impossible to fulfil at once
                                                it   is
the two conditions                 most desirable, the more we wish to
make the fluid lose of its movement in order to attain the
first condition,          the stronger          will    be the shock          ;    the more, on
the contrary, we wish to moderate                            the shockorder to ap
                                                                               in
proach the second, the less                     will the fluid lose of its move
                                                                                         ment.

                         On Machines in General.                                  301
ment.       We      perceive        that there is       a   medium,    by means of
which we shall determine,                   if   not in an absolute manner, at
least, having regard to the nature of the machine,                            that me
thod which will be capable of the greatest effects.
  LX.       Another      general  which is not less impor
                                        condition,
tant when we wish that machines should produce the greatest
possible effect,        is,
                  to contrive that the soliciting forces should
give rise to no movement inapplicable to the object in view.
If my object, for example, to raise to given height the
                                            is                     a
greatest quantity           of water possible, whether with               a   pump or
otherwise,   I       should contrive that the water on flowing into
the upper reservoir should only have precisely as much ve
locity as was necessary and no more, for all beyond this
quantity would uselessly consume the effort of the motive
power.      It    is   clear in fact         (XLV.),          that in this case this
power would have to consume an useless momentum of ac
tivity, and which would be equal to the half of the real
force with which the water would                            have arrived in the re
servoir.
  It   isnot less evident, that in order to give the machines
the greatest effect possible, we should avoid or diminish,
at least as much as possible, the passive powers, such as
friction, rubbing of cords, the resistance of the air, which
are always,in whatever direction the machine moves, among
the number of the forces    have called resisting*.
                                        I
  It would be easy to extend these particular remarks, but
my object    not to enter at present into any larger detail.
               is
   LXI.     may be concluded, from what has been said on
             It
the subject of friction and other passive bodies, that per
petual motion        thing absolutely impossible,
                       is   a                      only em               by
ploying in order to produce                      it   bodies which would not be
solicited    by     any motrix force, and even                     heavy bodies  ;   for
 *   We often hear of passive forces but where
                                            ;        the difference between an
                                                              is
active and a passive force     think this question has never yet been an
                                ?   I
swered. Now     itappears to me that the distinctive character of passive forces
consists in this, that they never can become soliciting forces, whatever may
be the movement of the machine, while active forces can act sometimes in
the quality of soliciting and sometimes   as resisting forces.   In this view,
obstacles and 6ied points are evidently passive forces, since they can neither
act as soliciting    uer ai resisting forces      (XXXI).
                                                                                  these

302                           On Maclune* in General.
these passive forces from which nothing can be subtracted
being always resisting, it is evident that the movement must
continually slacken : and from what we have said (XLV.),
we see that if bodies arc not solicited by any motrix force,
the amount         of  active forces will be reduced to nothing ;
                        the
f.   e.   the machine will be reduced to a state of rest, when
the momentum of activity, produced by the friction since
the commencement of the motion, will have become equal
to half the amount of the initial active forces: and if the
bodies are heavy, the motion will finish when the momen
tum produced by the frictions shall be equal to half the
amount of the initial active forces, plus the half of the ac
tive force whichwould take place if all the points of the
system had one common                 velocity, equal to that which is
owing to the height of            the point where the centre of gravity
was at the first instant of the motion, above the lowest point
to which it can descend : this is evident from (XLII).
     It is   easy to apply the same reasoning to the case             of springs,
and in general to all cases in which the friction being sub
tracted, the soliciting forces are obliged, in order to make
the machine pass from one position to another, to exercise
a momentum             of activity     as great as   that     which is produced
by the resisting forces when the machine                       returns from this
last position to the former.
     The motion would            end    much sooner       if
                                                          some percussion
took place, since the sum                of the active forces is always di
minished in such cases (XXIII).
  It is therefore evident, that we ought entirely to despair
of producing what is called a perpetual motion, if it be true
that all the moving powers which exist in nature are no
thing else than attractions, and that this force, as it should
seem, has a general property, that of being always the same
at equal distances between given bodies, i. e. of being a
function which only varies in cases where the distance of
these bodies itself varies.
     LXII.One general observation resulting from all that has
been said,       is,
             that the kind of quantity to which   have given      I
the name of momentum               of
                                    activity, pcrfonns     very conspi
                                                                 a
cuous part        in   the theory of machines        state of motion
                                                     in   a                    ;
                                                                              for

                       On Machines in General.                       303
for it is in general this quantity which we must ceconomize
as much as possible, in order to draw all the effect we can
from one agent.
     If  it be required to  raise a weight,    water for example, to
 a given height ; you       will   be  able  to raise more in a given
 time, not from having exhausted a greater quantity of power,
 but in proportion as you have exercised a greater momentum
 of activity (XLIV).
     If it be required to turn a mill, either by water, or wind,
 or animals, it is not necessary that the shock of the water,
 the wind, or the effort of the animal be greater ; but these
 agents should be made to consume the             greatest momentum
 of activity possible.                                             ,
      If  we wish to make a vacuum in the air in any way what
 ever, we must, in order to succeed, consume a manxintnm of
 activity as great as that which would be necessary for raising
 to the height of 30 feet a volume of water equal to the
  vacuum which we wish to produce.
      If  it be a vacuum in an indefinite mass of water like the
  sea, we must consume the same momentum of activity as if
  the sea were     a vacuum  ;  as  if the vacuum which we wish to
  make were      a  volume of sea water, and as if we must raise
  this volume to the height of the level of the sea.
      If it be required to produce a vacuum in a vessel of a
  given figure, it is evident that we cannot succeed without
  causing to ascend the centre of gravity of the total mass of
  the fluid in a quantity determined by the figure of the vessel;
  we must therefore consume a momentum of activity equal to
  that which would be necessary to raise all the water in the
  vessel in a quantity equal to that from which the centre of
  gravity of the fluid must ascend.
       In a machine at rest, where there is no other force to
  overcome except the vis inerticp of the bodies, if we wish to
   produce any movement by insensible degrees, the momentum
   of activity which     we have to consume      will  be equal to    half
   the amount of the active forces we wish to produce ; and if
   it be merely required to change the movement it has already,
   the momentum of activity to be produced will only be the
                                                               quantity

304                             On Machines in General.
quantity in which this half amount will be increased by the
change         (XLV).
     Finally, supposing         any system of bodies, that
                                     we have
these bodies attract each other, on account of any func
tion of their distances; even supposing, if we please, that
this law is not the same                    with    respect to all the parts   of the
system,         t. e. that this attraction follows any law we please,
(providing that, between two given bodies, it only varies
when the distance of these bodies in itself varies,) and it be
required to make the system pass from any given position
to another : this being done, whatever be the path that we
wish      each       of   the   bodies to take,        in order   to attain this ob
ject, whether  we put all these bodies in motion at once, or
the one after the other, whether we conduct them from one
place to another by a rectilinear or curvilinear motion, and
varied in any manner (providing no shock nor rapid change
occur) ; lastly, whether we employ any kind of machines
whatever, even by             providing that in this case we
                                a   spring,
ultimately replace the springs in the same state of tension
in which they were at the first moment, the momentum of
activity which they will have to consume, in order to pro
duce this effect, the external agents employed to move this
system, will always be the same, supposing the system to be
at rest at the first instant of the movement, and at the last
also.
     And       if, all this,
                     besides   be necessary to produce in the
                                              it
system any given  movement,    or       be already in motion at
                                                    if   it
the first moment; and        be requisite to modify or change
                                     if  it
this movement,                   activity which the exter
                            the momentum            of
nal agents will have to consume will be equal to that which
itwould be necessary to consume        were merely requisite
                                                     if   it
to change the position                 of     the system, without impressing
any motion upon                 it    (t.   e. considered as at rest at the first
and last instants,)   plus the half of the quantity     which             by
we must augment the sum of the active forces.
     It of very little importance therefore, as to the expen
          is
diture or momentum          activity to be consumed, that the
                                    of
forces employed are great or small, that                       they employ such
                                                                            and

                  Memoirs     of Erasmus Darwin, M.D.                      305
    and such machines, or that they act simultaneously or not :
   this momentum of activity is always equal to the produce of
   a certain force, by a velocity, and by a time, or the sum of
   several products      of this nature ; and this sum should alwaya
   be the same,      in whatever way we take it : the agents there
   fore will gain nothing on the one hand, which they do not
   Jose on the other.
       To conclude,      let  us suppose     that in general we have any

   tity by  which   the   sum   of the active forces will have augment
  ed during this time, in the system of bodies to which they are
  applied: minus       tfw   half of   the quantity     by which this same
  sum    of active forces would       have   augmented,      if each   of  the
   bodies were   freely    moved upon the curve      it  has described,  sup
 posing that it fiad then undergone at each noint of this curve
  the same motrix force as that which it really undergoes :
  providing always that the motion cnanges by insensible de
  grees, and that if we employ machines with springs, wc
  leave these springs in the same state           of tension in which we
 found them.                     [To be continued.]

      Dr. Darwin     relates a remarkable cure      of  bleeding piles.—'
      Mrs.          had    for twelve or fifteen years,     at intervals   of
  a year   or less,  a  bleeding from       the  rectum without      pain    ;
• which, however, stopped spontaneously after                 she became
 weakciud, or by the use of injections of brandy and water.
 Lately the bleeding continued above two months, in the
  quantity of many ounces a day, till she became pale and
  feeble to an al.irming degree. Injections of solutions of lead,
  of bark, and salt of steel, and of turpentine, with some in
  ternal astringents and opiates, were used in vain.               An in
 jection of the smoke of tobacco, with ten grains of opium
  mixed with the tobacco, was used,             but without effect the
  two first times on account of the imperfection of the ma
  chine: on the third time it produced great sickness and
  vertigo, and nearly       a fainting fit; from which time the blood
   entirely stopped. Was this owing to a fungous excrescence
   in the rectum ; or to a blood-vtssel being burst from the
   difficulty of the blood passing through the vena porta from
   some hepatic obstruction, and which had continued to bleed
   so long?   —Was      it stopped at last by the fainting fit? or by
   the stimulus of the tobacco ?
      His method of curing spitting of blond is equally new              and
   extraordinary. — Venous haemoptoe frequently attends                   the
   beginning of     the hereditary consumptions        of dark.eyed peo
   ple ; and in others, whose lungs have            too little irritability.
   These spittings of blood are generally in very small quantity,
   as a tea-spoonful ; and return at first periodically, as about
   once   a  month   ;  and are less dangerous in the female than
   in  the male sex, as in the former they are often relieved by
   the natural periods of. the menses. Many of these patients
   are attacked with this pulmonary haemorrhage in their first
   sleep ; because in feeble people the power of volition is ne
    cessary, besides     that of irritation,     to carry on respiration
   perfectly ; but,     as volition is suspended during sleep, a part
   of the blood is delayed in the vessels of the lungs, and in
    consequence effused,        and    the patient awakes from the dis
    agreeable sensation.

  Leeches applied once a fortnight           or month to tire hemor
  rhoidal veins to produce a new            habit.  Emetics after each
  period of hssmoptoe, to promote          expectoration, and dislodge
  any effused blood, which might           by remaining in the lungs
  produce   ulcers  by   its  putridity.   A hard bed, to prevent too
 sound sleep.       A periodical emetic or cathartic once a fort
 night.
     Also his plan of prerenting miscarriages. —Some delicate
 ladies are perpetually liable to spontaneous          abortion,   before
 the third,    or after the seventh, month of gestation.            From
 some of these patients I have learnt, that they have awa
 kened    with    a  slight degree of difficult respiration, so as
 to induce them to rise hastily up in bed ; and have hence
 suspected, that this was a tendency to a kind of asthma,
 owing to a deficient absorption of blood in the extremities
 of the pulmonary or bronchial veins ; and have concluded
 from thence, that there was generally a deficiency of venous
 absorption ; and that this was the occasion of their frequent
 abortion.     Which       is  further   countenanced,   where   a  great
 sanguinary discharge precedes           or follows  the exclusion      of
 the fetus.
    M. M. Opium, bark, chalybeates in small quantity.
Change to a warmer climate.              I have directed with success
in four cases, half a grain of opium twice a day for a fort
night,    and then a whole grain twice a day during the whole
gestation.      One of these patients took besides twenty grains
of Peruvian bark for several weeks. Bv these means being
exactly and regularly persisted in, a new habit became esta
blished, and the usual miscarriages were prevented.
    His opinion of extracting the cataract to remove blindness
is   so  very   unexpected, that unless it came from such a
source it would scarcely obtain credit, so much has fashion
to do both in medicine and surgery. —
    Cataracta is an opacity of the crystalline lens of the eye.
It  is a disease of light-coloured eyes, as the gutta serena is
of  dark ones. On cutting off' with scissars the cornea of a
calf's  eye, and holding it in the palm of one's hand, so as
to gain a proper light, the arterv which supplies nutriment

to the crystalline humour is easily and beautifully seen ; S*
it rises from the centre of the optic nerve through the vi
treous humour        to the crystalline.        It   is this point,   where
the artery enters the eye through the cineritious part of the
optic nerve, (which is in part near the middle of the nerve,)
which is without sensibility to light ; as is shown by fixing
three papers, each of them about half an inch in diameter,
against a wall about a foot distant from each other, about
the height of the eye ; and then looking at the middle one,
with one eye, and retreating till you lose sight of one of the
external papers. Now as the animal grows older, the artery
becomes    less   visible,    and perhaps    carries    only a transparent
fluid, and at length in some subjects I suppose ceases to be
pervious; then it follows, that the crystalline lens, losing
some fluid, and gaining none, becomes dry, and in con
sequence opake; for the same reason, that wet or oiled pa
per is more transparent than when it is dry, as explained in
Class I. 1.4. 1. The want of moisture in the cornea of old
people, when the exhalation becomes greater than the sup
ply, is the cause of its want of transparency; and which, like
the crystalline,gains rather a milky opacity.      The same
analogy may be used to explain   the whiteness of the hair of
old people, which loses its pellucidity along with its mois
ture.
      M. M.Small electric shocks through the eye. A quarter
of a grain of corrosive sublimate of mercury dissolved in
brandy, or taken in a pill, twice a day for six weeks.
Couching      by depression,      or by extraction.         The former of
these operations is much to be preferred               to the latter, though
the latter is at this time so fashionable, that a surgeon is
almost compelled to use          it,
                            lest he should not be thought
an expert operator.   For depressing the cataract   attended    is
with no pain, no danger, no confinement,                    and may be as
readily repeated,     if   the crystalline   should rise again to the
centre of the eye.   The extraction of the cataract attended     is
with considerable pain, with long confinement, generally
with fever, always with inflammation, and frequently with
irreparable injury to the iris, and consequent danger to the
whole eye. Yet has this operation of extraction been trum
                                                                      peted

peted into universal fashion, for no other reason but because
it   is difficult to perform,         and therefore    keeps the business         in
the hands of a few empiries, who receive larger rewards,
regardless of the hazard which is encountered by the flat
tered patient.
     A    friend     of mine returned yesterday         from      London after
an absence           of many weeks ; he had a     cataract in a proper
state for the operation,         and, in spite of my earnest exhorta
tion to the contrary,          was prevailed upon to havt it extracted
rather than depressed.               He    was    confined   to his bed three
weeks after the operation, and i s now returned with the iris
adhering on one side so as to make an oblong aperture ; and
which is nearly, if not totally, without contraction, and
thus greatly impedes the little vision which he possesses.
Whereas          I   saw some patients couched         by depression many
years      ago       by a then celebrated        empiric, Chevalier Taylor,
who       were       not confined     above      a day or two, that the eye
might gradually be accustomed to light, and who saw as
well as by extraction, perhaps better, without either pain,
or inflammation, or any hazard of losing the eye.
     As   the inflammation          of   the iris is probably owing to          for
cing the crystalline through the aperture              of it in   the operation
of extracting  Could   it,

the opening behind the iris and ciliary process into the                        vi
treous humour? But the operation would still be more pain
ful, more dangerous, and not more useful than that       de                by
pressing it.

                             On Vaccination.
               To the Editor   of the Medical   Observer.
         SIR,
     ON perceiving (in the tenth number of your Observer,)
 among the cow.pox failures and mischiefs which you are
 so   kind as to favour the public with, the case of Mrs.
Hawkins's daughter, of No. 4, Pleasant Place, Lambeth,
and which makts the         40th   of your list, I was a little sur
prised,     as I  had attended   the  child  occasionally,  and    her
parents frequently, during three years previous to her death,
but had never heard that any part of her sufferings had been
attributed to the cow.pox by her parents. She died of psoas
 abscess !      Some time prior to her death, her father died of
hydrothorax, and I have since occasionally been attending
her mother in ascites.       I mention these circumstances as no
further important than to state that they gave me an oppor
tunity of inquiring whether they had ever in the least blamed
the cow-pox for her complaints; the mother says No, though
some person, sent by Dr. Moseley, wished to convince then*
it  was so : unless indeed it may be considered important
to contemplate how far it was wonderful that a child of pa
rents so unhealthy, should die of psoas abscess without the
aid of the cow-pox.
    Just as the circumstances of this        case were passing my
mind, Mr. Vaughan of Lambeth, the           case of whose daughter
makes your flpth, in number 12 of your Observer, came to
 desire I would call at his house, as the child in question
had a slight eruption on the skin, but without complaint.
On seeing her, I immediately wrote the following, which \
(lesiied Mrs. Vaughan (a sensible intelligent woman, who
 entered    mightily into the joke,) to copy,      and send   to   Dr.
Moseley and       Mr. Birch.
  "   SIR, — A case of small.pox has occurred after vaccination
 ly   Dr. Wahliman, at No. 4, Pralt-street, Lambeth, (Me^
 Vaughan 's oil-shop,)   — Perhaps you will like    to look at it.
                                                      "
                                                                     I
remain yours,                                            NOKSB."
      July 20, 1808.
    I  took the child immediately to Mr. Young the surgeon.
of Lambeth,        whom I found along with his friend Dr. Hig-
 gins   :  without   making   them in the least acquainted with
                                                                   my

my plan, I desired them to say what the eruption was. They
both immediately declared it to be the chicken-pox.                I de
sired the nurse to take the child in the course            of the day to
Dr. VValshman, who           was to know nothing about what was
going on.       He   declared   the same thing.       Mr. Foster, Mr.
Key,    and other respectable       surgeons, saw the child; and,        I
believe,   never savy a    more well marked case of chicken-pox.
   'In consequence of Mrs. Vaughan's               copies of my note,
first came     (as   was expected)       Mr. Lipscombe.       Mrs. V.'s
father knew        Mr. Lipscombe         at  Warwick.      He   declared
that it was not the small-pcx          ;  but that he had      no doubt
Dr. Moseley       and    Mr. Birch would        say so.   He   was   per
fectly right, they said so sure enough ; but they were not
quite clear about it the first time they saw the child, while
any one else might have judged of the disease ; but when
the spots had waned so that it was impossible any one, whp
might not have seen the child before, could judge what it
had been — then        indeed   they grew bolder, and would have
taken their oaths it was the small- pox.
    Now, Mr. Editor, I wish           to know     who the other medi
cal men are,      who saw my little patient in the small-pox,
besides Mr. Lipscombe, and particularly if Dr. Moseley and
Mr. Birch are among them. I wish also to know who this
Mr. Lipscombe         is ; and if he has any other wicked -propen
sities, besides this unmanly talent of frightening women,
and men like women.              You, sir, 1 observe, wish to bring
the question of vaccination to an issue. — When you balance
the account, pray do let this statement of facts go for its
full weight.                  I  remain, sir, yours,      &c.

not in the summer season         :    that many patients have been
recovered by changing their residence from a cold to a warm
and equal climate — that especially pulmonary complaints
are rare occurrences in warm climates with little variability
of temperature — and some physicians have availed them
selves of these facts, in employing artificial means of wann-
ing the sitting-rooms      and bed-chambers        of certain patients.
To   these facts and remarks       it  is proper to produce as evi
dence the much less faiality        of our climate in mild than in
cold winters. The common opinion of the salubrity of long
continued severely cold or frosty weather, and of the un-
healthiness of hot summers, is certainly less popular, parti
cularly among the medical profession, than formerly.                The
contrivances for preserving the warmth of rooms by double
windows and double doors have been more generally adopt
ed of late years, especially since the publication of Count
Rumford's Essays ; but they have been employed rather
upon the ceconomical than the medicinal principle, and they
are inadequate for this latter purpose.            A few plans have
been executed      of warming    houses by means        of  the heat  of
the steam     of water, or by passing air through          tubes heated
by a fire ; but either on account of the expense, or of some
defect in these constructions, such modes of furnishing
warm air have been neglected.              Unfortunately too, on one
account,     our climate is neither sufficiently cold in the win
ter rr'inths, and for a sufficient duration, to urge the inhabi
tants   10  employ tit means of defence, as in Russia ; nor is
the climate subject to so inconsiderableavariation of tempera
ture as to allow, with impunity, many persons to be exposed
in  the    usual  manner to the air in the spring and summer
months.        On this account, the ancient rude method of
warming      houses by a fire in the wall       of one side  of  a room
continues to be adopted, although it is obvious to any one
acquainted with the laws of the communication of heat
throuch air, that no benefit, or at least very little benefit,
can be derived     from fire in such     a situation, but in so far as
the radiation or oscillation    extends.        Hence one part of a
room so heated is frequently different in temperature in dif
                 as much as twenty degrees or more ; and the
ferent parts,

             ON THE      HEALTH OF STLK.WORMS*.
    An ingenious member of the academy of Nismes, M.Alex
 ander Vincens, has made a discovery relative to the health
 and nourishment        of silk-worms, which may be of consi
 derable advantage to the breeders and keepers of these cu
 rious insects in this country.        " Experience," says the au
 thor of this discovery,    "   has demonstrated, that the primary
 necessity of  the aurelia of the insect which yields us silk, is
 an atmosphere abounding in oxygen, and that nothing is so
 injurious to it as impure air mixed with foreign vapours.
 Silk-worms      prosper in the mountains : the north winds
 vivify them,  by causing a more pure fluid to circulate between
 the layers of reeds on which they are placed ; but they lan
guish and decline in the vicinity        of marshes,        and under the

                                                                   relaxing

   relaxing influence of the south wind. It was natural, there
   fore, to suppose that an agent, which, in destroying the
  deleterious miasmata suspended in the air, likewise diffuses
  that vital air, the first element of our existence, should be
  particularly favourable to the breeding of silk-worms. The
  use of oxygenated muriatic acid answers this purpose effectu
  ally.   The disengagement of this gas, (the manner of which
  is now sufficiently known) two or three times every day in
 the apartment destined for the keeping and feeding silk
 worms,      will be attended   with   very  important     advantages.
 The     absence   of the offensive smell,    dry.ness  of the layers,
 the appetite, activity,    and equal march      of the worms, are
 usually the first symptoms      of  its salutary effects,   of which
 the greatly increased richness of their products is the fortu
 nate result."     M. Vincens relates the following experiment :
 Having had a large and full chamber of worms suffocated by
 the    negligence of their attendants, who, not perceiving a
 sudden change in the temperature, imprudently continued
 the fire ; a total loss is always the consequence of such ac
 cidents,    as the few worms which do survive are so debili
tated,    that they soon perish in their turn amidst heaps of
dead.      In this case M. Vincens had recourse to the disin
fecting fumigations with oxygenated muriatic acid, which he
doubled and even trebled, till he had the pleasure of seeing
all those worms which were not, familiarly speaking, burnt,
resume their pristine health, and finish their business        of spin
ning with the greatest success.      By these means he succeeded
in saving about the half of his worms. The value of this
discovery will be best appreciated by those who have either
for amusement or profit occupied themselves in rearing silk
worms, which unquestionably might be bred in this country
in quantities sufficient to prevent any disagreeable scarcity of
the useful article of silk. These fumigations are likewise so
simple, that any person, taking two parts of common
salt, adding; one of black manganese, and putting them in
an earthen      pan and pouring on as much oil       of vitriol mixed
with a little water     as will moisten them, may produce this,
gas, so salutary to the worms.

   Having      a desire to  know what is the greatest heat that can
be produced by a close fire, I constructed a furnace, which
I  buried in pounded charcoal to prevent the escape of heat.
   The furnace opens in         the middle into a cupel,     is supplied
with fuel at the top, and at the bottom with oxygen air im
pelled into it by forcing-pumps.
   The furnace being only recently finished, I have not had
time to try many experiments : — Exp. 1st, A seven.shilling
piece disappeared in ten minutes.            2d, Platina was melted,

    f<
         Dear   Sir, — A phenomenon has occurred here not un
usual in former ages, but of which there has been no exam
ple of late years ; it was well calculated to inspire terror,
.UK! In- been attended with the destruction of lives and pro
perty.       On Sunday, the 1st of May, at one p. m., walking
in the balcony of my house at St. Anthonio, I heard noises
like the report of heavy cannon at a distance, and concluded
there was some sea. engagement in the vicinity of the island.
But soon after, casting my eyes towards the islaud of St.
George's, ten leagues distant, I perceived a dense column of
smoke rising to an immense height ; it was soon judged
that a volcano had burst out about the centre of that island ;
and this was rendered certain when night came on, the fire
exhibiting an awful appearance.           Being desirous of viewing
this    wonderful    exertion  of  Nature, I embarked on the 3d of.
May, accompanied by the British consul, and ten other
gentlemen, for St. George's— we ran over in rive hours, and
                                                                 arrived

                                   New Volcano.                         325
  arrived at Vellas, the principal town, at eleven a. m.                We
  found the poor inhabitants perfectly panic-struck,                    and
  wholly given up to religious ceremonies and devotion.                We
 learned     that the fire    of the 1st of May h*d broken out in a
 ditch,    in the     midst of fertile pastures, 3 leagues S.E. of
 Vellas,    and had immediately formed a crater, in size about
 24 acres.        In two days it had thrown out cinders or small
 pumice      stones, that        a   strong   N E.    wind   bad  propelled
 southerly — and which, independent of                  the mass accumu
 lated round the crater, had covered              the earth from one foot
 to   four feet in depth, half a league in width, and three
 leagues in length ; then passing the channel five leagues,
 had done some          injury to the east point of Pico. The fire of
 this large crater had nearly subsided ; but in the evening pre
 ceding our arrival, another small crater had opened, one
 league north of the large one, and only two leagues from
Vellas.       After taking some refreshment, we visited the se
 cond crater, the sulphurous smoke of which, driven souther
 ly, rendered it impracticable to attempt approaching the
large one.        When       we came      within  a mile of the crater, we
found      the   earth     rent   in every direction, and, as we ap
proached nearer, some            of the chasms were six feet wide : by
leaping over some of these chasms, and making windings to
avoid the larger ones, we at length arrived within 200 yards
of the spot, and saw it in the middle of a pasture, distinctly,
ai intervals,      when the thick smoke which             swept the earth
lighted up      a  little.    The mouth of it         was  only about 50
yards in circumference;             the fire seemed struggling for vent,-
the    force with which         a pale   blue flame issued forth, resem-'
bled    a powerful steam-engina, multiplied              a hundred fold ;
the noise was deafening, the earth where we stood had a tre
mulous motion, the whole island seemed convulsed, horrid
bellowings were occasionally heard from the bowels of the
earth, and earthquakes were frequent. After remaining here
about ten minutes, we returned to the town — the inhabitants
had mostly       quitted their houses, and remained in the open
air or under tents.           We passed the night at Vellas, and the
next morning went by water to Ursulina, a small sea-port
town, two leagues south of Vellas,               and  viewed that part   of
                                           •

 the country covered with the cinders before menlioned,                and
which has turned the most valuable vineyards in the island
into a frightful desert. On the same day (the 4th of May)
we returned to Fayal, and on the 5th and succeeding days,
from twelve to fifteen small volcanoes broke out in the fields
we had traversed on the 3d, from the chasms before de
scribed, and threw out a quantity of lava, which travelled on
slowly towards Vellas. ,The (ire of those small craters sub
sided, and the lava ceased running about the 1 Ith of May ;
on which day the large volcano, that had lain dormant for
nine days, burst forth again like a roaring lion, with horrid
belchings,    distinctly     heard     at   twelve   leagues    distance,
throwing up prodigious large stones, and an immense quan
tity of lava, illuminating at night the whole island.                 This
continued with tremendous force until the 5th of June, ex
hibiting the awful yet magnificent spectacle of a perfect ri
ver of fire (distinctly seen from Fayal) running into the sea.
On that day (the 5th) we experienced that its force began to
fail, and in a few     days after it ceased entirely.       The distance
of the crater from      the sea is about four miles, and its eleva
tion about 3,500 feet.
   The  lava inundated and swept away the town               of Ursulina
and   country-houses       and   cottages adjacent,      as  well  as   the
farm-houses,       throughout its course.          It,  as   usual, gave
timely notice of its approach, and most of the inhabitants
fled ; some few, however, remained in the vicinity of it too
long, endeavouring        to save their furniture and eflects, and
were scalded     by flashes of steam, which, without injuring
their clothes, took off not only their skin but their flesh.
About sixty persons were thus miserably scalded, some of
whom     died   on   the spot, or in a few days after.         Numbers
of cattle  shared the same fate.          The judge and principal in
habitants   left the  island   very early.     The consternation and
 anxiety were for some days so great among the people, that
even their domestic concerns            were  abandoned, and amidst
plenty they were in danger of starving.             Supplies of ready-
baked bread were sent from hence to their relief, and large
 boats were sent to brine; away the inhabitants           who had lost
 their dwellings.      In short,     the ^sland,   heretofore rich       in

difference is still greater between the temperature                     of such        a,
gitting. room and the passages into other rooms.                         The      me
thod of warming            houses by fires as above stated would never,
in all probability,         have been employed,          if the    constructor had
been previously acquainted with the laws                      of   passage   of   heat
from one body to another body ; and inveterate custom and
prejudices can only account for so unreasonable a method.
It istrue, Count Kumford, in particular, has occasioned im
provements in the form of grates, to extend the oscillating or
radiating property of heat and to save expense of fuel ; but
to render the air of every part of a large room, and every part
of a house, of nearly the same warm temperature, further
and different modes of building the house itself must be in
troduced.    That this is ceconomically practicable is evident
from     the mode        of warming       the air    of manufactories, work
shops, hot-houses, Sec.    All that is further requisite   to                  is,

vantages of diffusing heat     the several different modes of
                                          by
its communication      namely, oscillation, alteration of den
                            ;
sity of the portions of air with which         in contact, and,
                                                         it   is
diffusion         by
             elasticity  or attraction  from particle to particle

fessional man competently informed on the subject of the
philosophy which furnishes the principle.  From the suc.r

warming rooms even              by
                        clumsy, rude and expensive contri
vances in our present ill-suited houses, in the hands of                               a
physician who has furnished these observations, there seems
a certainty that the undertaking of such  building will be a
come profitable to the proprietor.  The physician alluded to
would willingly incur the expense on this occasion, but                           it   is
necessary that he should be precluded from the possibility of
pecuniary benefit.    He     willing, however, to afford his
                                     is
best assistance gratuitously, and of course to support, as
far     as   he   is   able, the proprietor        by   his recommendation in
practice.

   LVII.        Report   of Surgical    Cases in the  City and Finslury
       Dispensaries,      Jor  February and March 1808.        By JOHN
       TAUNTON, Esq.
   IN      February and March there were               admitted on the
   books of the City and Finsbury Dispensaries 506 surgical
   patients.
                     Cured or relieved        —       465

      During      the summer months, ulcers in general, particular
  ly those seated on the lower extremities, have been more ir
  ritable than usual.          In many instances they have inflamed
 and extended on the surrounding parts very rapidly, bat
 apparently         from the high temperature of the atmosphere
 only    :    the pain has been frequently great, and could not be
 mitigated by the usual remedies, large doses of opium being
 required to produce but a very moderate degree of ease.
      Anodyne        fomentations     with poultices made with crumb
 of    stale    bread,   water, and    a small quantity of new millc,
 gave more ease than any of the lotions in common use.
 How does this fact coincide with the supposed cause of high
 temperature? All greasy applications contributed greatly to
increase the sufferings of the individual.
     Nitrous acid, ferri rubigo, and opium were the internal
remedies which afforded the most effect-.. il relief.
     Mrs. Ann Turner,          aetat. 67, has been visited several times
in the      last two years by     Mr. Jackson, for symptoms      resem
bling      those    which    arise from strangulated   hernia; but   the
existence of thai disease was never made           known till after; the
attack came on which terminated fatally.
                                                                   Nov.

           Report   of the City and Finsltiry Dispensaries.         315
    Nov. 30,     1807.  — She   complained of a tightness across the
umbilical      region, great pain over the abdomen, with hiccup
and vomiting. These symptoms having frequently yielded to
purgative remedies, they were had recourse to, but without
effect.
    Dec.    1. — She    had   passed  a very restless  night,   and was
much worse in every respect.              This day, for the first time,
she mentioned the swelling in the groin.                Some draughts,
each containing         25 drops of tincture of opium, were given?
but not retained on the stomach ; an enema composed of an
infusion of nicotiana was injected, and attempts were made
to reduce the hernia, but without effect.
    I  first saw her at     9  o'clock in the evening, when she ap
peared very low, hut the hiccup returned only when she at
tempted to swallow ; the pain on the abdomen was not so
great     as on the preceding day ;           the pulse was regular,
 moderately full, and did not exceed 90 : the hernia was
 small, and seated under Poupart's ligament, on the inside of
 the femoral vessels : on continued pressure it receded under
 the ligament between          the lower edge   of the external oblique
 and transversalis muscles.          This circumstance has occasion
 ally misled inexperienced practitioners, one fatal instance of
 which is recorded in the Surgical Report for December 1606,
 vol. xxvi. page 255.
     She had had this complaint for several years, but could
 not state when it had been reduced, as it did not appear to
 her to have been of the least           consequence, and she never
 noticed it with much attention           ; neither could we make her
 believe that      her present complaint arose from that small
 swelling    :   however, she consented with considerable reluc
  tance to have the operation performed early in the morning,
  provided the symptoms continued.
     2d. Four A. M. — She appeared much the same               as on the
 preceding evening ;          but her countenance,     and in some     in
  stances incoherent answers, argued           an   unfavourable termi
  nation.
     On dividing       the integuments,     cellular and   adipose   sub-

                                                                  surface

 316       Report    of the City    and Finsimry Dispensaries,
 surface came into view, the contents of which were evidently
 in  a fluid state ; and on its being opened, about an ounce of
 a limpid      fluid escaped.       At the posterior part of the sac
 containing      the  limpid   fluid   (which was a hydatid) was seat
 ed the hernial sac, forming a tumour not larger than a ches-
 put, but adhering firmly in          every part    to the surface of the
 contained intestine, so        as to   render its separation wholly  im-»
 possible.      The   sac was returned with the intestine, after the
contracted part at the neck had been carefully divided by a
longitudinal incision.           One suture was passed through the
integuments,         and   the   edges     of the wound supported by
Straps   of  adhesive     plaister.     From these difficulties, the ope
ration     took more time than is usually              required,  but she
Scarcely     expressed any sense of pain.             The pulse was full,
and did not exceed 60. Small doses of magn. vit. in aq. am.
acet. et aq. menth. sat. were ordered to be taken frequently
during the day.
    Three P.M. — Every unfavourable symptom had subsided:
the medicine and some broth had been retained on the sto
mach,      and   a  gentle perspiration was diffused over the body.
The medicines were ordered to be continued, and a purging
clyster to be injected.
    3d. Five     A. M. — She      had     slept for several hours during
the night, and had not had any return of either the hiccup
or sickness, but no evacuation by stool. Notwithstanding
the cessation of pain, the nourishment taken and retained on
the stomach, and the sleep which she had had, she was evi
dent y lower.
    One P. M. — Quite composed and sensible, but sinking
fast ; and she died at five P. M., 33 hours after the ope
ration.
    On examining          the part by dissection,        the hydatid was
found     to adhere      to the anterior part      of the true peritoneal
herniary      sac, which      from    being very small, and the adhe
sions not permitting its enlargement, was entirely covered
by the same.

one.
   The intestine within the             sac was      inflamed,    but only a
small part of the circumference                  was included within the
stricture ; so that the canal was preserved, even at the dis
eased part, of sufficient size to admit a bougie the size of a
large finger.
   The intestine above the stricture was slightly inflamed,
and rather distended with flatus ; below, it was contracted,
and without any appearance of inflammation.
   The fatal termination of this disease, when only a small
part of the circumference of the gut is included in the sac,
has been noticed by the late Mr. Joseph Else, in a case in
St. Thomas's Hospital, which was mistaken for an enlarged
gland*. The two cases are also similar in proving, that
stools could not be procured, although the intestinal canal
was pervious in each.              I have also observed the same cir
cumstance to occur in omental hernia,                   though   Mr. Charles
Bell, in his work on Operative Surgery,                  has given an oppo

       Though only now published, the Essay on the Teeth of
    Wheels     was written several years ago.           The author's inten
    tions in this publication will appear from his short preface,
    which   we shall here transcribe.
                                       Preface.
       " Led   from situation,        as welf as curiosity, to attend very
   minutely to some parts of practical mechanies, one of the
   objects, which early attracted the notice of the author of
   the following short Essay, was the figure of the teeth of
   wheels.      He observed, that, in forming these teeth, work
   men followed rules for which they could assign no satisfac
   tory reason: — nor did he then find in. books the information
  be wanted:        the    subject seemed to him to require a detail
  •and simplification,       which no English writer, with whom he
  was acquainted, had given it. Afterwards, indeed, he found
  that some French mathematicians had treated it with much
  attention.      But their works, though sufficiently clear to
  those who have studied mathematies, are too abstract to be
  of   general   utility.    In   the  following Essay, therefore, such
  an elucidation      of the subject      has   been attempted, as might
 render it plain to the operative mechanic — an object,              which
 will   appear the more important             the  more we consider      the
 great variety of useful purposes to which wheel .work               is ap
 plied.
      "De La Hire       and Camus are the two French writers who
 have treated most extensively this branch              of mechanies.
 From the work of the           latter,  who has written more accu
 rately   and    more     fully,    the  author has borrowed largely;
 nor has he scrupled to take from others whatever he found
to suit his purpose, and to make the fullest use of the com
munications        of his friends.
     "G;   the method followed,           it will be sufficient to remark,
that the subject naturally suggested these two general divi
sions — First, The princip'es of the con figuration. of the teeth
of wheels . — Secondly, The application of               these to practice.
     " The   first chapter    contains     the  principles.   The second,
their application, with certain modifications — 1st, to Spar
                                                   .                 Otc r,

Geer, under which are comprehended, the wheel and trun
dle; the wheel and pinion; the internal pinion, and the rack
and pinion — and, 2dly, to Bevel Geer.
     "A    third chapter is added,        which    contains a manner        of
forming spur wheels, upon principles somewhat different
from those considered in the preceding chapter.
     "  In the following pages no pretensions are made either
to invention or profound investigation.                  The writer has
studied perspicuity alone, and will have completely attained
his object, if he has only been fortunate enough to give
such a view of the various kinds of teeth, as will enable the
artist to form some judgment of their respective merits, and
 to execute any of them with accuracy and ease.                       For this
 purpose it has been his aim to divest every part of the subject
of obscurity,       and   to   accommodate it to those who possess
 not the advantages of a mathematical education.                    But he is
 far from saying that they will not find some difficulties,
 particularly in the first chapter; nor will they, perhaps,
 fully understand the truths it contains, till they see their
 relation to practice pointed out in the second.                  He found,
 that     without    becoming     exceedingly      prolix, there       was no
 avoiding the use       of  some mathematical terms          ;  but of these
 he has given definitions, either as the terms themselves oc
  cur, or at the conclusion of the Essay *."
      The Essay is followed by a letter containing some scien
 tific and useful observations on the friction of the teeth of
  wheels, by Dr. Young, formerly professor of natural phi
  losophy at the Royal Institution f. There follows a Post
  script and Appendix. The appendix contains
                                                               " A practical
  inquiry    respecting   the Strength and Durability          of the Teeth  of
   Wheels     used in   Millwork."        This subject      we     consider of
  much importance, but it is involved in considerable difficulty.
                                           "
      " I am aware," says Mr. B. that owing to a great va
  riety   of circumstances, this subject        is involved     in much dif
   ficulty,   and that it is no easy task to form any general              rule
      • This preface was written several years before the translation  of Camus
   was published.
      f This gentleman's Lectures on Natural Philosophy, lately published, we
   beg leave to recommend to the attention of our readers.
                                                                           with

 with     regard   to   the pitches and breadths of the teeth of
 wheels.       I do not pretend to more than a mere approxima
 tion towards general rules; yet, were this judiciously done,
 I am     of opinion that it might       be useful    to   the millwright
 who      has   not had     leisure or opportunity       for scientific in
 quiries.      A  rule,  though not absolutely perfect, is better in
 all cases, than to have no guide whatever."
•    In order to clear the ground of inquiry, he proceeds to
make some general observations on the wheel-work of mill?,
which we think merit attention. The elementary propo
 sitions which serve to guide the inquiry are next laid down,
 and     their application considered.         Afterwards the measure
of    the stress on the teeth of wheels is considered.
     "  In order     to   take   experience as   our guide, several ex
amples in the annexed tables,           actually in use, are selected.
     " The     pitch, velocity, and strain, are all stated ; the
 strain is measured by the horse's power ; at which the resist
ance is valued. Horse's power is a term now in general use,
to express the       force required in order to drive any kind of
mill,     and   it may be proper here to give some further ac
count      of it.
    "   Horse's power.         Although   horses    are not    all of one
strength, yet there is a certain force now generally agreed
upon among those who construct steam engines, which
force is denominated a horse's poiver, and hence steam en
gines are distinguished, in size, by the number                 of horses'
power to which they ar2 said to be equal."
    The    table contains a number       of examples      of wheel-work
in actual     use driven by water wheels, horse          mills and steam
engines.        On this table     a number   of observations     are made
and practical pules deduced.           These    are   followed by    a very
useful communication            from Mr. John Roberton, engineer.
    The next subject we consider as also very important, and
on which we believe nothing had previously appeared in
print. It K entitled " Practical Observations witkregard to
 the making of Patterns of Cast Iron Wheels"
    The book concludes with Mr. Donkin's table of the radii
of wheel?, which may save millwrights the trouble of
much calculation.

    mical   Changes produced by Electricity, particularly the
    Decomposition of the fixed Alkalis, and the Exhibition of
    the new Substances        which constitute their Bases; and on
    the general Nature       of alkaline Bodies.         By Humphry
    Davy, Esq.     Sec.   R. S.   M.R.I.A.*
                           I. Introduction.
In    the Bakerian Lecture      which   I  had the honour     of   present
ing   to the Royal Society      last year, I described a number of
decompositions and chemical changes produced in substances
of known composition by electricity, and I ventured to con
clude from the general principles on which the phaenomena
were capable     of being explained, that the new methods of
investigation promised to lead to a more intimate knowledge
than had hitherto been obtained,            concerning    the    true   ele
ments of bodies.
    This conjecture, then sanctioned only by strong analo
gies, I am now happy to be able to support by some con
clusive facts. In the course of a laborious experimental ap
plication of the powers of electro-chemical analysis, to
bodies which have appeared simple when examined by corn*
mon chemical agents,         or which      at least have     never    been
decomposed, it    has been my good fortune to obtain new and
singular results.
    Such of the series       of experiments        as are in a tolerably
mature state, and capable of being arranged in a connected
order, I shall detail in the following sections, particularly
           • From Philosophical  Transactions  for 1S08. Fart I.

4             On the Decomposition and Composition
those which demonstrate the decomposition and composition
of    the fixed alkalis,    and the production of the new and ex
traordinary bodies      which constitute their bases.
    In speaking of novel methods of investigation, I shall not
fear to be minute.         When the common means of chemical
research    have been employed,          I shall mention    only results.
A    historical detail  of   the progress    of the investigation, of all
the difficulties that occurred,         and   of  the manner in which
 they were overcome, and of all the manipulations employed,
 would far exceed the limits assigned to this lecture.                 It is
 proper to state, however, that when general facts are men
 tioned, they are such only as have been deduced from pro
 cesses carefully performed and often repeated.
 II.    On the Methods used for the Decomposition            of  the fixed
                                   Alkalis.
     The researches I had made on the decomposition of acids,
 and of alkaline and earthy neutral compounds, proved that
 the powers of electrical decomposition were proportional to
 the strength of the opposite electricities in the circuit, and
 to the conducting power and degree of concentration of the
 materials employed.
     In the first attempts that        I  made   on the decomposition
 of the fixed alkalis, I acted upon aqueous solutions of pot
  ash and soda, saturated at common temperatures, by the
 highest electrical power I could command, and which was
  produced by a combination of Voltaic batteries belonging to
  the Royal Institution, containing 24 plates of copper and
  zinc of 12 inches square, 100 plates of six inches, and 150
  of four inches square,         charged with solutions of alum and
  nitrous acid ; but     in  these  cases, though there was a high.
  intensity of action, the water of the solutions alone was
  affected,   and   hydrogen and oxygen disengaged with the
  producuon of much heat and violent effervescence.
     The presence of water appearing thus to prevent any de
  composition, I used potash in igneous fusion. By means of
  a stream     of oxvgen       gas  from    a gasometer    applied to the
  flame of   a spirit lamp, which was thrown on a platina spoon
  containing potash,        this alkali was kept for some minutes in
                                                                  a strong

                            of thejixed Alkalis.                          5
 a strong red       heat, and in   a state  of perfect fluidity.      The
 spoon was preserved in communication             with the positive side
•of the     battery   of. the power of      100 of six inches, highly
charged     l and    the connection     from   the   negative side was
made by a platina wire.
    By this arrangement some brilliant phenomena were pro
duced.       The potash appeared a conductor in a high degree,
and as long as the communication was preserved, a most in
tense light was exhibited at the negative           wire, and  a  column
of flame, which         seemed to be owing to the development of
combustible matter, arose from the point of contact.
    When the order was changed, so that the platina spoon
was made negative, a vivid and constant light appeared at
the opposite point ; there was no effect of inflammation
round it ; but aeriform globules, which inflamed in the at
mosphere, rose through the potash.
    The platina, as might have been expected, was consider
ably acted upon ; and in the cases when it had been nega
tive in the highest degree.
    The alkali was apparently dry in this experiment; and
it seemed probable that the inflammable matter arose from
its decomposition.          The residual potash was unaltered ; it
 contained indeed a number of dark.gray metallic particles,
but these proved to be derived from the platina.
    I  tried several experiments on the electrization of potash
rendered      fluid by heat, with the hopes of being able to col
lect    the   combustible     matter,    but without     success ; and    I
only     attained    my object, by employing electricity           as  the
common agent for fusion and decomposition.
    Though potash perfectly dried by ignition is a noncon
ductor,     yet it is rendered    a  conductor    by a very slight ad
dition of moisture, which           does   not perceptibly destroy its
aggregation ; and in this state it readily fuses and decom
 poses by strong; electrical powers.
    A   small piece of pure potash, which had             been    exposed
for   a few seconds      to the atmosphere,     so as to give conduct
ing power.to       the surface, was placed upon an insulated disc
 of platina, connected with         the negative   side  of  the   battery
 of  the   power of 250 of six and four, in          a state  of intense
                                     A 3                         activity ;

<            On the Decomposition and Composition
 activity ; and a platina wire, communicating with the po
 sitive side, was brought in contact with the upper surface of
 the alkali. The whole apparatus was in the open atmosphere.
     Under  these circumstances a vivid action       was  soon ob
 served to take place.      The   potash  began  to fuse at both its
 points of electrization.     There was a violent effervescence   at
 the upper surface ; at the      lower, or negative surface, there
 was no liberation    of elastic fluid ; but small globules having
 a high metallic lustre, and being precisely similar in visible
 characters to quicksilver, appeared, some of which burnt
with explosion    and bright flame, as soon as they were formed,
and others remained, and were merely tarnished, and finally
covered by a white film which, formed on their surfaces.
    These globules, numerous experiments soon showed to/be
the substance I was in search of, and a peculiar inflammable
principle the basis of potash.         I found that the platina was
in no way connected with the result, except as the medium
for exhibiting the electrical powers of decomposition ; and a
substance of the same kind was produced wh€n pieces of
copper, silver, gold, plumbago, or even charcoal were em
ployed for completing the circuit.
    The phaenomenon was independent of the presence of air;
I  found that it took place when the alkali was in the vacuum
of   an exhausted   receiver.
    The substance was likewise produced from potash fused
by means of a lamp, in glass tubes confined by mercury,
and furnished with hermetically inserted platina wires by
which the electrical action was transmitted. But this ope
ration   couid not be carried        on for any considerable time;
the glass was rapidly dissolved by the action of the alkali,
and this substance soon penetrated through the body of the
tube.
    Soda, when acted       upon in the same manner as potash,
exhibited an analogous result ; but the decomposition de
manded greater intensity of action in the batteries, or the
alkali was required to be in much thinner and smaller pieces.
With    the battery   of  100  of six inches in full activity I ob
tained good results from pieces of potash weighing from 40
to 70 grains, and of a thickness which made the distance of
                                                                the

                           of the fixed Alkalis.                         7
the electrified metallic surfaces nearly a quarter         of an inch ;
but with      a   similar   power it was impossible to produce the
effects of decomposition on pieces of soda of more than 15
or 20 grains in weight, and that only when the distance be
tween the wires was about .J.th or .^ih of an inch.
    The substance produced from potash remained fluid at the
temperature of the atmosphere at the time of its production ;
that from soda, which was fluid in the degree of heat of the
alkali during its formation, became            solid on cooling,      and
appeared having the lustre of silver.
    When      the   power of 250       was  used,   with a very high
charge for the decomposition of soda, the globules often
burnt at the moment of their formation, and sometimes
violently exploded and separated into smaller globules, which
flew with great velocity through the air in a state of vivid
combustion,        producing a beautiful effect of continued jets
of   fire.
III.    Theory   of  the Decomposition     of tJieJixed Alkalis ; their
                     Composition, and Production.
   As in all decompositions of compound              substances    which
I  had previously examined, at the same time that combus
tible bases were developed at the negative surface in the elec
trical circuit, oxygen was produced, and evolved or carried
into combination        at the positive surface, it was reasonable
to conclude that       this substance was generated in a similar
manner by the electrical action upon the alkalis ; and a
number of experiments made above mercury, with the ap
paratus for excluding external air, proved that this was the
case.
    When solid potash, or         soda  in its conducting    state,   was
included     in glass tubes furnished with electrified platina
wires, the new substances were generated at the negative
surfaces; the gas given out at the other surface proved by
the     most delicate examination to be pure oxygen; and un
less an excess of water was present, no gas was evolved from
the negative surface.
    In   the synthetical experiments, a perfect coincidence         like
wise will beibundi
                                     A  4                        I  men-

8              On the Decomposition and Composition
    I mentioned      that the metallic lustre of the substance              from
 potash immediately became destroyed in the atmosphere,
 and that a white crust formed upon it. This crust I soon
found     to be    pure potash* which immediately deliquesced,
and new quantities were formed, which in their turn at
tracted moisture from the atmosphere till the whole globule
disappeared, and assumed the form of a saturated                       solution
of potash*.
    When globules were placed in appropriate tubes contain
ing common air or oxygen gas confined by mercury, an
absorption of oxycen took place ; a crust of alkali instantly
formed     upon the globule ; but from the want of moisture
for its solution, the process stopped, the interior being de
fended from the action of the gas.
    With    the substance from soda, the appearances                and effects
were analogous.
    When     the substances        were   strongly heated, confined in
given portions of oxygen, a rapid combustion with a bril
liant white flame was produced, and the metallic globules
were found converted into             a white and solid mass, which in
the case    of the substance        from potash was found to be pot
ash, and in the case        of  that from soda, soda.                            ,
    Oxygen gas was absorbed in this operation, and nothing
emitted which affected the purity of the residual air.
    The alkalis produced were apparently dry,                      or at least
contained no more moisture than might well be conceived
to exist in the oxygen gas absorbed ; and their weights
considerably exceeded those of the combustible matters con
sumed.
    The processes on which these conclusions are founded
will be fully described hereafter, when the minute details
which are necessary will be explained, and the proportions
   * Water likewise is decomposed in the
                                              process. We shall hereafter see
that the bases of the fixed alkalis act upon this substance with greater energy
than any other known bodies.       The minute theory of the 'oxidation of the
bases of the alkalis in the free air, is this :— oxygcu gas is first attracted by
them, and alkali formed.     This alkali speedily absorbs water. This water i>
again decomposed.     Hence, during the conversion of a globule into alkaline
solution, there it a constant and rapid disengagement of small quantities of
                                                                               off

                           of  the fixed   Alkalis.                           f)
of oxygen,        and   of the    respective    inflammable        substances
which      enter into     union     to form the fixed       alkalis,    will be
given.
    It  appears then, that       in  these facts there is the        same evi
dence     for the decomposition of potash and soda into oxygen
and two peculiar substances, as there is for the decomposi
tion of sulphuric and phosphoric acids and the metallic ox
ides into oxygen and their respective combustible bases.
     In the analytical experiments, no substances capable                     of
decomposition are present but the alkalis and a minute por
tion of moisture ; which seems in no other way essential to
the result, than in rendering them               conductors       at   the sur
 face   : for the new substances are not generated               till the inte
 rior, which is dry, begins to be fused ; they explode when
 in rising through the fused alkali they come in contact with
 the heated moistened surface ; they cannot be produced from
 arystallized alkalis, which contain much water; and the
 effect produced by the electrization of ignited potash, which
 contains no sensible quantity of water, confirms the opinion
 of their formation independently of the presence of this sub
  stance.
      The combustible       bases    of  the fixed alkalis seem to be         re
  pelled as other combustible substances, by positively elec
  trified surfaces, and attracted by negatively electrified sur
  faces,    and the oxygen follows the contrary order*; or, the
  oxygen being naturally            possessed of the negative energy,
  and the bases      of the positive, do not remain in combination
  when either of them is brought into an electrical state op
  posite to its natural one. In the synthesis, on the contrary,
  the natural energies or attractions come in equilibrium with
  each other; and when these are in a low state at common
  temperatures,      a  slow combination is effected         ; but when they
   are exalted      by   heat,  a  rapid   union   is the   result   ; and as in
   other like cases with the production of fire.              —  A number of
   circumstances relating to the agencies of the bases of the
   alkalis will be immediately slated, and will be found to
   offer confirmations of these general           conclusions.

 JV.       On the Properties and Nalwe                   of the Basis of Potash.
   After I had detected the bases of the fixed alkalis, I had
considerable difficulty to preserve and confine them so as to
examine their properties, and submit them to experiments ;
for, like the alkahests imagined by the alchemists, they
acted more or less upon almost every body to which they
were exposed.
   The fluid substance amongst all those I have tried, on
which I find they have least effect, is recently distilled naph
tha. — In this material, when excluded from the air, they
remain for many days without considerably changing, and
their physical properties may be easily examined in the at
mosphere when they are covered by a thin film of it.
  The          basis   of potash     at 60" Fahrenheit,            the temperature            in
which       I    first examined       it,   appeared,     as
                                                           I       have already            men
tioned,          in small globules possessing      metallic lustre,
                                                               the
opacity,         and general appearance of mercury; so that when
a globule of mercury was placed near    globule of the pe      a
culiar substance,  was not possible to detect
                            it                   difference                    a
by    the eye.
     At    60° Fahrenheit        it   is    however only imperfectly fluid,
for   it   does not readily run into            aglobule when its shape                        is
altered    ;     at 70°    it   becomes      more fluid   ;    and at 100°             Jts   flu
idity     is    perfect, so that different globules may be easily made
to run into one.                At   503 Fahrenheit        it      becomes         a   soft and
malleable solid, which has the lustre of polished silver; and
at about the freezing point of water     becomes harder and
                                                          it
brittle, and when broken in fragments exhibits  crystallized               a
texture, which in the microscope seems composed of beautiful
facets     of    a     perfect whiteness and high metallic splendour.
     To    be converted into vapour,                it requires  temperature
                                                                       a
approaching that of the red heat                 ;   and when the experiment
is conducted under proper circumstances,                             it   is   found unal
tered after distillation.
     It   is
          a        perfect conductor          of electricity.             When         aspark
from the Voltaic battery of 100 of six inches                                     taken upon
                                                                          is is
a  large globule in the atmosphere, the light                                     green, and
combustion takes place at the point                      of contact only. When
                                                                                       a   small

                          of the fixed Alkalis.                      11
a small globule is used,      it  is completely dissipated with explo
sion accompanied by a most vivid flame, into alkaline fumes.
    It is an excellent conductor of heat.
    Resembling the metals in all these sensible properties, it
is however remarkably different from any of them in specific
gravity ; I found that it rose to the surface of naphtha di
stilled from petroleum, and of which the specific gravity was
•66l, and it did not sink in double distilled naphtha, the
specific gravity of which was about -770, that of water being
considered as one. The small quantities in which it is pro
duced by the highest electrical powers, rendered it very
difficult to determine this quality with minute precision.             I
endeavoured to gain approximations on the subject by com
paring the weights of perfectly equal globules of the basis
of   potash and mercury.           I used the very delicate balance   of
the Royal Institution, which when loaded with the quan
tities I employed, and of which the mercury never exceeded
ten grains, is sensible at least to the -iruVo'ri of a grain.
Taking the mean of four experiments, conducted with great
care, its specific gravity at 62° Fahrenheit, is to that of
mercury as ten to 223, which gives a proportion to that of
water nearly as six to ten ; so that it is the lightest fluid
 body known. In its solid form it is a little heavier, but even
 in this state when cooled to 40° Fahrenheit, it swims in the
 double distilled naphtha.
     The chemical relations of the basis of potash are still more
 extraordinary than its physical ones.
     I have already mentioned its alkalization         and combustion
 in oxygen     gas. — It  combines with oxygen slowly and with
 out flame at all temperatures that I have tried below that of
 its vaporization. — But at this temperature combustion takes
 place, and the light is of a brilliant whiteness and the heat
 intense.      When heated slowly in a quantity of oxygen gas
 not   sufficient   for its complete conversion into potash, and
  at a temperature     inadequate     to its inflammation, 400° Fah
  renheit, for instance,    its  tint  changes to that of a red brown,
  and when the heat is withdrawn, all the oxygen is found to
  be absorbed, and a solid is formed of a grayish colour, which,
  partly consists of potash and partly of the basis of potash in
                                                                a lower

12                      On the Decomposition and Composition
a lower degree              of oxygenation, — and which
                                                     potash             becomes
by being exposed to water, or by being again heated in fresh
quantities of air.
  The substance consisting of the basis of potash combined
with an under proportion of oxygen, may likewise be
formed  by fusing dry potash and its basis together under
proper circumstances. — The basis rapidly loses its metallic
splendour; the two substances unite into a compound, of a
red-brown              colour when fluid,       and    of   a   dark gray hue when
solid   ;    and this compound soon absorbs                       itsfull proportion
of oxygen when                   exposed   to the air, and      is wholly converted
into potash.
   And the same body  is often formed in the analytical ex
periments  when the action of the electricity is intense, and
the potash much heated.
     The      of potash when introduced into oxymuriatic
             basis
acid gas burns spontaneously with a bright red light, and a
white salt proving to be muriate of potash is formed.
     When         a globule is heated in hydrogen at a degree                          below
its point of vaporization,                  it seems to dissolve in              it,   for the
globule diminishes in volume, and the gas explodes with
alkaline fumes and bright light, when suffered to pass into
the air; but            by
                 cooling, this spontaneous detonating pro
perty    destroyed, and the basis
        is                          either wholly or princi
                                                  is
pally deposited.
   The action of the basis            of potash on water exposed to the
atmosphere             is   connected with some beautiful phenomena.
When         it   is   thrown    upon water, or when        brought into
                                                                  it    is
contact with            a   drop of  water  at  common   temperatures,                     it
decomposes             it   with great violence, an instantaneous explo
sion   produced with brilliant flame, and
        is                                                        a     solution of pure
potash   the result.

   In experiments of this kind, an appearance often occurs
similar to that produced     the combustion of phosphuret-

       When a globule of the basis of potash is placed upon ice
    it instantly burns with a bright flame, and a deep hole is
    made in the ice, which                        is    found to contain             a    solution   of
    potash.
         The theory of         the action          of   the basis       of   potash upon water
    exposed       to the       atmosphere,                  though      complicated            changes
    occur,      is far from being obscure.                        The   phaenomena             seem to
    depend    on the strong attractions of the basis for oxygen and
    of    the potash formed for water.      The heat, which arises
    from two causes,   decomposition and combination, is suffi
    ciently intense to produce the inflammation. Water is a bad
    conductor of heat ; the globule swims exposed to air ; a part
'
    of   it,
           there    the greatest reason to believe,
                        is                           dissolved by                 is
    the heated nascent hydrogen; and this substance being ca
    pable of spontaneous inflammation, explodes, and commu
    nicates the effect of combustion to any of the basis that may
    be yet uncombined.
         When   globule confined out of the contact of air
                  a                                              act                            is

                                     in
    does not take place, or at least                        it    can have    a   momentary ex
    istence only.

       So strong    the attraction of the basis of potash for oxy
                          is
     gen, and so great the energy of its action upon water, that
    it discovers and decomposes    the small quantities of water

contained in alcohol and ether, even when they are carefully

     In   ether this decomposition is connected with an instruc
tive result.          Potash is insoluble in this fluid; and when the
basis      of potash     is thrown into      oxygen   it,

     In both     these inflammable compounds                             the    energy       of its
action   proportional
           is                            to the quantity      of water they contain,

dered sulphur, in weight in the proportion of three to one, rendered very
dry, were heated together in retort, connected with mercurial pneumatic

globule is made to touch        a globule of mercury about twice-
as large, they combine         with considerable heat ; the com
pound is fluid     at the   temperature of its formation ; but whea
cool it appears    as a     solid metal, similar in colour to silver.
If thequantity of the basis of potash is still further increased,
so as to beabout js\h the weight of the mercury, the amal
gam increases in hardness, and becomes brittle.         The solid
amalgam, in which the basis is in the smallest proportion,
seems to consist     of about          one part   in weight of basis       and 70
partsof mercury, and is very soft and malleable.
   When these compounds are exposed to air, they rapidly
absorb oxygen ; potash which deliquesces is formed ; and
in a few minutes the mercury is found pure and unaltered.
   When a globule of the amalgam is thrown into water, it
rapidly decomposes          it with hissing noise ; potash is form
                                         a
ed,     pure hydrogen       disengaged, and the mercury remains
free.
   The fluid amalgam of mercury and this substance dissolves
all the metals 1 have exposed to it; and in this state of union,
mercury acts on iron i.nd platina.
  When the basis of notash is heated with gold, or silver,
or copper, in a close ^ssel of pure glass, it rapidly acts
npon them ; and when the compounds are thrown into wa
ter, this fluid is decomposed, potash formed, and the metals
appear to be separated unaltered.
  The basis of potash combines                     with      fusible metal, and
forms an alloy with         it,
                        which has                 a    higher point   of fusion
than the fusible metal.
   The action of      the basis         of
                                      upon the inflammable
                                              potash
oily compound bodies, confirms the other facts of the strength
of its attraction for oxygen.

 sited,   little gas* is evolved, and a soap is formed ; but in
              a
 these cases it is necessary that a large quantity of the oii he
 employed.      On the fluid fixed oils it produces the same
 effects,          but more slowly.
    By heat likewise it rapidly decomposes the volatile oils;
 alkali is formed, a small quantity or gas is evolved, and
 charcoal is deposited.
    When the basis of potash is thrown into camphor in fu
 sion, the camphor soon becomes blackened, no gas is libe
 rated in          the     process    of decomposition,                  and      a   saponaceous
 compound is formed ; which seems to show           camphor                       that
 contains more oxygen than the volatile oils.
   The basis of potash readily reduces metallic oxides when
 heated in contact with them.      When a small quantity of
 the oxide             of iron   was    heated with           it,   to   a   temperature            ap
 proaching its point of distillation, there was   vivid action               a                        ;
 alkali and gray metallic particles, which dissolved with ef
 fervescencein muriatic acid, appeared.   The oxides of lead
 and the oxides of tin were revived still more rapidly   and                                    ;
 when the basis of potash was                      in   excess, an alloy was formed
 with the revived metal.
       In consequence of this property,                      the basis         of     potash        rea

of   charcoal, heavy inflammable gas, cmpyrctimatic oily matter, and water,
so that the existence  of oxygen in them was fully proved; and accurale in

     At   a red heat,    even the purest glass is altered by the basin
 of potash : the oxygen in the alkali of the glass stems lo be
 divided between the two bases, the basis of potash and the
 alkaline basis in the glass, and oxides, in the first degree of
 oxygenation, are the result. When the basis of potash is
 heated in tubes made of plate glass filled with the vapour of
 naphtha,      it first acts upon the small quantity of the oxides
 of cobalt and manganese in the interior surface of the glass,
 and a portion       of alkali     is formed.       As   the heat approaches
 to redness,      it begins to rise in vapour, and condenses in the
 colder parts of the tube ; but at the point where the heat is
 strongest,     a part   of  the vapour seems to penetrate           the glass,
 rendering      it of  a deep red     brown     colour;     and  by repeatedly
 distilling and heating the substance in a close tube of this
 kind, it finally loses its metallic form, and a thick brown
 crust, which        slowly decomposes water, and which com
 bines    with   oxygen when exposed to air forming alkali, lines
 the interior of the tube, and in many parts is found pene
 trating through its substance*.
      In my first experiments on the distillation of the basis of
 potash, I had great difficulty in accounting for these phaeno
 mena; but        the knowledge        of  the substance       it forms    in its
 first degree      of nnion with oxygen,              afforded   a satisfactory
 explanation.

metallic oxides."
   This      "only verifying"            seems to        him    a    matter    of    very
little importance,         and    the    guess     much more           curious than
the discovery. Reasoning in this way, it may be said, that
Newton only verified what Seneca suspected, and that Co
lumbus had only rediscovered Plato's Atalantis.
   From such a writer accuracy is not to be expected. His
first assertion is incorrect.              Lavoisier         never    supposed        the
fixed alkalis to be metallic oxides.                 In his time there were
no analogies which led to such an                  opinion.   This sagacious
philosopher, on the contrary, has stated the idea that they
may contain azote ; which O. may see in the very book he
quotes, Kerr's Translation of Lavoisier's Elements, second
edition,     page 213.
   Before Lavoisier,           even as early as    Van Helm on t jun. and
Becche r, it was conceived that               metals were capable of being
produced from earths. Bergman, in later times, but before
Lavoisier, published the epinion with respect to barytes ;
and Baron, with respect to alumine : but this kind of read
ing cannot be familiar to O., a person who seems to believe
in the results of the experiments of Toudi and Rupfecht, on
the metallization        of
                      the earths, and merely says, that their
accuracy was called  in question by Klaproth and Tihawski ;
whereas the fact         is,
                    that the metallic substances obtained                              by
Toudi     and Ruprecht         were     proved     by   Tihawski      and     by   Klap
roth to be phosphurets of iron                :   and the question            was    laid
at rest     by   the elaborate    researches       of Savaresi, who showed
that they could not be obtained except in cases when mate
rials which furnished phosphuret of iron were present. See
Annates de Chimie, tome ix. p. 275, and tome x. p. 18.                         1
  Mr. Kerr, in his Translation of Lavoisier's Elements,                               se
cond edition,        has reasoned upon            the    experiments of Toudi
and Ruprecht        as  ifthey were correct   stating that
                                                        ;    mag            if
nesia be    a    metallic oxide, then soda, being modification of
                                                               a
magnesia, " according to some experiments published                                    in
the Transactions of the Turin Academy," must be also                                   a
metallic substance.            He might       have gone further,            and said,
that   as    M.    Guyton      de Morveau          has      proved    potash to be

partly composed of lime, therefore potash contains a metallic
oxide.       But the experiments in which magnesia and lime
have been said to be produced from the fixed alkalis, have
been shown to be incorrect by Darracq and others                ;   and the
whole fabric falls to the ground.            Mr. Kerr did not      guess or
 predict any thing.         He  only, stated results considered by all
scientific chemists      as mere    delusions.
    I  do not in the slightest degree         mean   to detract   from the
merit of      Mr. Kerr    as an   excellent translator of Lavoisier.
There      is ofien   ingenuity and good sense in his notes : — but
in the conclusion of the passage, of which the beginning is
 quoted     by O.,  as such an    extraordinary instance of sagacity,
 this sentence occurs,        " Why     should carbon, sulphur, aud
 phosphorus,       not  be   considered     as metals? — Because their
 specific gravity, lustre, and ductility, differ from the bodies
 called    metals,    which    differ so much in these particulars
 amongst themselves,"          —a    mode of reasoning that would
 confound      all principles  of  classification.
    What O. says about oxygen and hydrogen being the
 ultimate constituents of matter, is such vague declamation
 that your sober readers will not wish to read any comments
 on it. The dynamic philosophy of a new German school is
 much more sublime, and more probable ; that water +"
 electricity is oxygen, and w'Ster — electricity hydrogen ;
 and that the metals are water + magnetism.
    Mere speculation can never do any harm, and is a toy
 with which any person has a right to amuse himself ; but
 there is something in O.'s letter which mav do harm.                       I
 mean the indecorous manner in which he speaks                 of    the ob
jections of an English professor of respectability to the con
 clusions of M. Braconnot.
    In reading     these objections, they appear to me expressed
ill  a moot    geuile way, and merely calculated to modify the
 improper confidence which some persons, little acquainted
 with experimental chemistry, had placed in these researches.
 That all things may be composed of light, water, and air,
 js not    an assertion    to be admitted     on slight proof,    or to be
implicitly     confided in, in consequence of           a single labour.
 Pre!!   is at least as  high    an authority as Braconnot,         and yet
                                                                         his

    his experiments on this subject have always been considered
    fallacious by the most enlightened chemists.
         The     general     of O.'s communication shows merely
                            style
    that he is little rejoiced at the progress of science, and that
    he wishes to diminish the importance of the late discoveries.
    He might have praised Mr. Kerr as much as he pleased, and
    no one        would     have been offended            but every philosophical
                                                          ;
    man must be displeased at                    his rude and illiberal mention of
    a chemist, whose merit (being of a totally different nature)
    cannot possibly come in competition with that of Mr. Kerr.
         Your     love    of genuine         science     and your candour are such
    that     I    surprised you should have permitted such un
                 am
    worthy criticisms as those contained in the last part of O.'s
    letter to pollute your pages.  T can only attribute it to their
    having escaped your notice. Your Philosophical Magazine
    has served, and I hops in future will serve, a nobler pur
    pose than that of affording a cloak under which a masked
    bravo in science may hide a dagger for the purpose of
    wounding the feelings, and detracting from the merit, of
    philosophical         men.           I am, sir, respectfully,

  Now it        is evident,      that   if any degree of heat or cold be
applied to this compound                 rod, the one of zinc expands
and contracts as much as the                 two iron ones
                                              together ; the
distance from the point of suspension to the centre of oscil
lation must remain the same.
   In proportioning the length of the bars, I made use of
Mr. Smeaton's table of expansion of metals in the 48th vol.
of Philosophical Transactions ; where he shows, by experi
ments made with a pyrometer, that the expansion of iron is
to that of unhammered zinc, with the same degree of heat,
as 151     to 353, and to that           of zinc hammered, half an inch
per foot,      as 151     to 373.-      This great expanding property of
zinc    rendersit in theory extremely fit for the purpose of
compensation in a pendulum, and I was desirous of know
ing if it would answer in practice, and likewise the exact
proportion that was requisite to answer the intended purpose.
   I made two regulators whose pendulums were composed
of iron and zinc, as above described, with this difference,
however, that one had              a detached     escapement   of a particular
construction;        the   zinc    bar was not hammered, the ball         of    a
lenticular form,       weighed twenty pounds, its arc of vi
                          and
bration nearly five degrees. The other had a simple remon-
toir escapement, the zinc bar was hammered half an inch
per foot, the ball, of spherical form, weighed forty-six
pounds, and vibrated two degrees and three quarters.
   These regulators were both placed in, the same room, and
their cases firmly fixed to the wall ; the pendulums were
suspended from a stout brass cock, screwed to the back of
their respective cases. In the inside of each case, and im
mediately behind the pendulum rod, was hung a thermo
meter, for the purpose of comparing the degrees of heat.   I
adjusted       them to mean time             nearly by corresponding     alti
tudes    of    the sun.        After having compared them together
for several       days,    I found      that the one which had the ham
mered    zinc                         when the air of the
                 bar went somewhat faster
room was heated by a fire in the grate than the other did.
Hence I concluded that the difference of expansion of ham
mered and unhammered zinc was greater than Mr. Smeaton
made     it,   at least   it   appeared so in this instance.

   But to determine whether the length of the hammered
zinc bar wa* accurately proportioned to that of the iron ones
I wished next to prove, without waiting that length of time
that Nature  would require to produce a sufficient alteration
in the temperature of the air, 1 proceeded to make the fol
lowing experiment : I caused to be made a tin tube six feet
long, and two inches and a half diameter at its larger end,
from whence it gradually tapered to the other, which was
only half an inch diameter.   Within the case, and as far
from the pendulum Vs possible, I placed this tube ; the
smaller end was cairicd through a hole in the top of the case,
and projected a few inches above it.   In the lower end of
the tube        v. as   inserted   the nozzle         of
                                                lamp, and immediately
                                                           a
under     it,    in     the bottom of the case, was   hole of an incha
diameter to supply the lamp with air. By this means the
tube would communicate as much heat to the internal air,
as to raise the           thermometer about thirty-fire decrees.
  Previous to the lamp being put in the case,    made both                 I
pendulums vibrate exactly together; and alter an interval of
twenty.four hours, the one with the hammered zinc bar
hud gained, as near as could judge, one tenth of second.
                                   I                                            a
The      mean      height of the thermometer was fifty.three de
grees.    I      now lichted the lamp, and    about four hours  in
ever). part appeared to be thoroughly heated, and the ther
mometer arrived at its maximum, which was eighty-eight
degrees;         at this      point      il continued with little variation.
White the-heat   v.as increasing     found the motion of the
                                                     I
pendulum was accelerated.       again made them beat exactly
                                            1
together, and in about ten hours after, the heated pendulum
had    gained      One second;            the thermometer in the other case
continuing nearly the same.                      The lamp was then taken out,
and as soon as the parts were cooled, and                   both thermome
ters showed             the same degree,         1   adjusted   the beat of the pen
dulums      as      before, and         at the   end       of twenty.four hours      I
found the pendulum that had been heated kept precisely the
same rate as it did before the experiment was made.
     By this experiment            it   appeared evident that             the   zinc bar
was considerably too long.                   The pendulum                was then taken
down,      to have more holes made                         for the adjusting screw    ;

          Description     of a    new Compensation                   Pendulum.           25
and after many            trials with (lie lamp and tube, as
                        repeated
before, I found the length of the zinc bar to be 22 inches,
and consequently the length                  of   the iron
                                               together 39'2     ones
plus 22 equal to Gl'2 inches, or, the expansion and con
traction of iron to that of zinc hammered, half an inch per
foot,    as 151   to IC0.
   Having thus far. satisfied myself with the hammered zinc
l,ar, I proceeded to make similar trials with the one that was
unhammered     : in doing *hich a circumstance occurred that
I   cannot account for, that when the air in the case was ra
refied    by means       of the lamp         and tube, the arc                 of vibration
would be about          half a degree        less than it was before the lamp
was applied, which is directly contrary to what I should ex
pect would have taken place.    I afterwards found that the
other pendulum was affected the same way, but in an ex
treme small degree, which, without doubt, was in conse
quence of the ball being much heavier, and vibratinsr a
smaller arc. In taking the rate of the clock when the lamp
was      in the case,    I   at first   computed           from theory the error
that would arise by            such     a   diminution of       the arc, and al
lowed for it accordingly; but doubting whether the unlock
ing of the swing wheel might not, from a decrease of ve
locity in the pendulum, have a greater tendency to retard its
vibrations, I therefore thought the experiment would be
rendered more accurate if the maintaining power was in
creased until the arc of vibration should be the same. After
several trials I found            the length          of   unhammered zinc
                                                           the
bar to be about twenty.nine                       inches, which agrees pretty
nearly with Mr. Smeaton's experiment              in regard      ;    that     is,
to the relative expansion of iron and unhammered zinc.
   The zinc bar of the pendulum, which     here send to the      I
Society of Arts, was hammered three quarters of an inch
per foot  and        by
                  making experiments with   as    had done
                                                                       it it
            ;                                                                  I
with the other two,   found the length of
                             I              to lie twenty-
two inches, which   exactly the same length as the one that
                             is
was hammered half an inch per foot, so that   seems nothing           it

 determinate increase of heat, from                  the  quantity that is ex
 tended       by  the    hammer       ;  much    depends on the degree of
 curvature and polish of the stake and hammer, and probably
                                                                                  '
 on the heating of the bar at the time ; for it is necessary to
 heat it a little hotter          than boiling water, otherwise it will
 crack in hammering.
      In all these experiments it is to be understood that the
 ball of the pendulum was suspended by its centre ; but if
 the ball be made to rest on its lower edge, the expansion
 and contraction of it must be taken into consideration.
      It has been the opinion            of some     mechanists that    zinc   is
 an     unfit substance        for  a   compensation pendulum,         because
they have thought it too soft for the purpose, and that after
 being heated or cooled to a considerable degree, it does not
 return to its original dimensions. If that was really the case,
no doubt but it would be a general one, cammon to all me
tals in a greater or less degree; but from                   the  experiments
and observations          I  have made on       zinc pendulums, I     am   fully
satisfied     there is no foundation           whatever for such an opi
nion.        Some time in the latter part of last summer, I how
ever noticed a circumstance that made me doubt the matter
— for when I         first used     any zinc pendulum, I could never
bring     the clock to keep         the same rate two days together,
but it       was   continually retarded, whether I used the lamp
or not     ;  and had      \ not before      observed a similar effect on a
lever pendulum           that was made        of   brass and steel,  I should
have ascribed       the cause wholly to the            softness   of the zinc
bar;     but by constantly         comparing its daily rate with one
that had been going a longer time, I found this retarding
property gradually wore off, and in less than a month would
become quite settled to the rate that it would afterwards
keep.        By   subsequent       experiments with         the  lamp too, [
have     constantly found that all              the pendulums I have hi
therto tried kept precisely the same rate, both during the
time they were heated (provided they were properly adjusted)
and afterwards, as they had done before.                    The cause of ihis
retardation appears to me to be, that the points of contact
of   the different pieces, which compose the pendulum, are
more closely connected after                 a  little time than they are at
                                                                          first,

first, that is, those points of contact do, by the weight of
the ball, yield to each other in a small degree, until they get
a broader bearing.
    The    advantages     of this pendulum are, 1st, That from its
simplicity     it will   never  fail to have the desired effect. 2dly,
That no extraordinary care is requisite in executing it. 3dly,
That    the compensation may be increased            or diminished with
the greatest ease, without stopping the clock more than a
minute, by making fast one of the screws that keep the rods
together whilst the adjusting screw is removing, taking care
to release it again afterwards.           And 4thly, That       it   can be
manufactured for less expense than any other compensation
pendulum hitherto published.
    N.B. The compensation of this pendulum which I now
send to the Society         of Arts is properly adjusted, at      least very
near the truth.         The holes for the adjusting screw          are made
at such a distance         from each other, that by removing the
screw one hole,        it will produce an alteration in the going of
 the clock about a quarter of a second per day with a change
 of thirty   degrees    of Fahrenheit's thermometer.
    Permit       me to state to you the observations         I have made
 since my compensation-pendulum               was   laid before      the So
 ciety.
    The regulator, with the hammered zinc bar,                 and ball of
 forty-six    pounds    weight,    was   firmly  fixed  to a brick    wall at
 the top of my house.           The adjustment of the length of the
 bars, by means of a lamp, was repeated as before. There
 was, however, an alteration necessary to be noticed ; the ball
 of the pendulum rested on its lower extremity, instead of
 being suspended by its centre.               I prefer   this method,      as
  being   less liable  to  error if  the rods  should  be  sooner affected
 by heat or cold than the ball.            The length of the zinc bar,
 as  ascertained    by   the  lamp,    was  now found to be 20 inches
  and a quarter.
     The clock     was then set to mean time,         and suffered      to go
  without alteration ; the result is exhibited          in the following
  table.

    Although        a   thermometer        was    attached    to  the clock,    I
could not, from          .1  necessary    attendance to business, register
it regularly.       The difference of        its height in March and June
may be taken at about 22 degrees,                  and in  July   and October
 1.1 degrees,      without much error.
    On comparing it with the rate of the clock, the compen
sation, in the latter case, appears nearly as much too great,
as it was in the first too small.               The true length of the zinc
bar ought to be nbout 23 inches.
    Tlfe length of the zinc bar, thus ascertained,                  is one inch
and three quarters           more than     the   experiment by the lamp
makes it      :  indeed,      I  have   always suspected there might be
 some error in that experiment, on account of the length of
 the arc of vibration being affected by it.
     Having no       means      of finding the time accurately but by
 equal    altitudes,       I could     not net so many observations as
 might be wished. I trust, however, these will not be found
 altogether useless.               I am, sir, your obedient servant,

 JnLis account,        and mode       of  cure  in dej*ctive ossification,
 rickets, distortion      of  the spine,    lameness  from   the hip-lone,
 and protuberance        of the   spine,  claim every attention.
    Innutritio    ossium.       Innutrition of     the bones. — Not only
 the blood effused        in vibices and petechiae, or from bruises,
 as  well as the   blood and new vessels          in inflamed    parts, are
 reabsorbed     by the increased          action of the lymphaties ; but
 the   harder materials, which constitute the fangs of the first
 set of teeth, and the ends of exfoliating bones, and some
 times the matter of chalk-stones in the gout, the coagulable
lymph, which         is deposited on the lungs, or on the muscles
after inflammation          of those parts, and which frequently
produces     difficulty   of   breathing, and the pains of chronic
rheumatism, and lastly the earthy part of the living bones
are dissolved and absorbed by the increased actions of this
 system   of vessels.
    The earthy part of        bones in this disease     of the innutrition
of  them seems to suffer          a solution and reabsorption ; while
the secerning vessels do           not supply a sufficient quantity of
calcareous earth        and phosphoric acid, which          constitute the
substance     of   bones.        As calcareous earth abounds          every
where, Is the want of phosphoric acid the remote cause                     ?
One cause of this malady is given in the Philosophical Trans
actions,    where the      patient had been         accustomed to drink
large   quantities of vinegar. Two            cases are described  by  Mr.
Gouch.       In one    case, which I saw, a considerable quantity
of   calcareous     earth, and afterwards of bone.ashes, and of
decoction of madder, and also of sublimate              of mercury, were
given without        effect.     All  the bones became soft, many        of
them broke, and the patient seemed to die from the want of
being able to distend her chest owing to the softness of the
ribs.

all limestone or marley countries.               The calcareous       earth in
these waters might possibly be carried              to the bones,     a« mad
der is   known      to colour them.     Warm bath. Volatile or            fixed
alkali   as a   lotion on the spine, or essential         oils.
    The innutrition of the bones is often first to be perceived
by the difficulty of breathing and palpitation of the heart on
walking a little faster than usual, which I suppose is owing to
 the softness of the ends of the ribs adjoining to the sternum ;
 on which        account they do not perfectly distend the chest,
 when they are raised by the pectoral and intercostal muscles
 with greater force than usual. After this the spine becomes
 curved    both by the softness of its vertebrae, and for the pur
 pose of making room for the disturbed heart.
     As these patients are pale and weak, there would seem to
 be    a deficiency      of oxygen in their blood, and in conse
 quence     a   deficiency    of phosphoric acid; which is probably
 produced by oxygen in the act of respiration.
     Mr. Bonhomme in the Chemical Annals, August 1793,
 supposes the rickets to arise from the prevalence of vege
  table or acetous acid, which is known to soften bones out                    of
  the body.       Mr. Dettaen       seems to have espoused          a similar
 opinion    ; and both      of  them in consequence give alkalis and
  testacea.      If this  theory was just, the soft bones of such
  patients should       show evident marks of such acidity after
  death ; which I believe has not been observed.                      Nor is it
  analogous      to other   animal    facts,   that   nutritious    fluids    se
  creted   by the finest vessels of the body should be so little
  animalized as to retain acetous or vegetable acidity.
      The   s.iccess    attending the      following     case   in  so short a
  time as   a fortnight,     I ascribed   principally    to the    use   of the
   warm bath, in which the patient continued for full half an
   hour every night, in the degree of heat whnh was most
   grateful to her sensation, which might be I suppose about
   94.    Miss          ,  about ten years of age, and very tall and
   thin,  has laboured under palpitation          of her heart, and diffi
   cult breathing on the least exercise, with occasional violent
   dry cough, for a year or more, with dry lips, little appetite
   either for food or drink, and dry skin, with cold extremities.
   She has at times been occasionally worse, and been relieved
                                                                                in

  in  some degree by the bark.            She began to bend forwards,
  and to   lift   up 'ncr shoulders.      The former seemed owing to
  a beginning curvature        of  the spine, the latter was probably
  caused to facilitate her difficult respiration.
      M. M. She used the warm bath, as above related; which
 by its warmth might increase the irritability of the smallest
  series of vessels, and by supplying more moisture to the
  blood might probably          tend   to  carry further the materials
 which form calcareous          or bony particles, or to convey them
 in more dilute solution. She took twice aday twenty grains
 of extract of bark, twenty grains of soda phosphorata, and
 ten grains      of chalk. and ten of calcined hartshorn, mixed into
 a powder with ten drops of laudanum ; with flesh food both
 to dinner and supper ; and Port wine and water instead of the
 small beer she had been accustomed to             ; she  lay on  a sofa
 frequently in a day, and occasionally           used a  neck.swing.
     Rachitis. Rickets. —The head is large, protuberant chiefly
 on the forepart.         The smaller joints are swelled ; the ribs
 depressed     ;   the  belly tumid, with other parts emaciated.
 This disease from the innutrition or softness of . the bones
 arose about two centuries          ago;   seems   to have  been  half  a
 century in an increasing or spreading state; continued about
 half a century at its height, or greatest diffusion ; and is
 now nearly vanished         ; which gives reason to hope, that the
 smallpox,       measles,   and   venereal disease, which are all of
modern production, and have already become milder, may
in process of time vanish from the earth, and perhaps be
succeeded       by new ones     !
     Spinee distorliy. Distortion of the spine is another disease
originating from the innutrition or softness of the bones.              I
once saw a child about six years old with palpitation of heart
and quickness of respiration, which be^an to have a curva
ture of the spine ; I then doubted, whether the palpitation
and quick respiration were the cause or consequence of the
curvature of the spine; suspecting either that Nature had
bent the spine outwards to give room to the enlarged heart,
or that the malformation of the chest had compressed and
impeded the movements of the heart. But a few weeks ago,
on attending a young lady about ten years old, whose spine
                                                                     had

                Memoirs   of Erasmus Darwin, M.D.                     83
  had lately begun to be distorted,      with very great     difficulty
  and quickness of respiration, and alarming palpitation
  of the heart, I convinced myself, that the palpitation and
  difficult respiration were the effect of the change of the ca
 vity of the chest from the distortion of the spine ; and that
  the whole was therefore a disease of the innutrition or soft
 ness   of the bones.
     For on directing her     to lie down much in the day, and
 to take the bark, the distortion became less, and the palpi
 tation    and  quick respiration became less at the same time.
 After this observation a neck-swing was directed, and she
 took the bark, madder, and bone-ashes ; and she continues
 to amend both in her shape and health.
     Delicate   young ladies are very liable to become awry at
 many boarding-schools.        This is occasioned principally by
 their being obliged too long to preserve an erect attitude,
 by sitting on forms many hours together. To prevent this
 the school-seats should have either backs, on which they
 may occasionally rest themselves ; or desks before them, on
 which they may occasionally lean. This is a thing of greater
 consequence      than may appear to those      who have not at
 tended to it.
     When the least tendency to become awry            is  observed,-
they should be advised to lie down on a bed or sofa for an
hour in the middle of the day for many months ; which
generally prevents the increase of this deformity by taking
off for a time the pressure on the spine of the back, and it
at the same time tends to make them grow taller.               Young
persons, when nicely        measured, are found    , to   be  half an
inch higher in a morning than at night ; as is well known
to those who enlist very young men for soldiers.              This is
owing     to the cartilages between the bones    of the back       be
coming compressed by the weight of the head and shoulders
on them during the day.           It is the same pressure which
produces curvatures and distortions of the spine in growing
children, where the bones are softer than usual ; and which
may thus be relieved by an horizontal posture for an hour
it the middle of the day, or by being frequently allowed to
lean on a chair, or to play on the ground on a carpet.

     Young       ladies should also be directed,
                                      where two sleep                                 iri
a bed, to change every night, or every week, their sides
of the bed which will prevent their tendency to sleep
              ;                                                                      al
ways on the same side; which     not only liable to produce
                                              is
crookedness, but also to occasion diseases      the internal          by
parts being so long kept             in   uniform contact             as   to grow to
gether.       For      the same reason they should not be allowed to
sit always on the same side              of   the fire or           window,   because
they will then          be inclined too frequently to bend themselves
to one side.
     Another       great cause    of injury       to the shape       of young ladies
is from the pressure of stays, or other tight bandages, which
at the same time cause other diseases      changing the form
                                                           by
or situation of the internal parts. If hard part of the stays,
                                                       a
even    a   knot    of   the    thread, with which              they are sewed to
gether,     is   pressed hard upon one side more than                   the other,
the child bends from the side most painful, and thus occa
sions   acurvature of the spine.  To counteract this effect,
such    stays as have fewest hard parts, and especially such
as   can be daily or weekly turned, are preferable to others.
     Where frequent lying down on sofa in the day-time,a
and swinging frequently for        short time a    the hands or      by
head, with loose dress, do not relieve     beginning distortion

moveable arms for the purpose of suspending the weight of
the body          by
             cushions under the arm-pits, like resting on
crutches,  or like the leading-strings of infants.    From the
top of the back of the same chair     curved steel bar may also

project to suspend  the body  occasionally, or in part      the                 by

chair   ismore efficacious in straightening the spine, than
simply lying down horizontally as        not only takes off the

endeavoured to remedy this,                           by
                                taking away the curved bar

cles    of   the back are in action,rather calculated to pre
                                                       it   is
vent the curvature of the spine from becoming greater, than
to extend the spine, and diminish its curvature.
     For this latter purpose                   I      have made      a   sieel        bow, which
receives the head                  longitudinally           from     the       forehead        to   the
occiput  having
             ;                 a    fork furnished with
                                          web to sustain the        a
chin, and another to sustain the occiput.   The summit of
the bow    fixed  is   swivel to the board going behind
                                    by    a
the head of the bed above the pillow.                                    The      bed     is    to be
inclined from the head to the feet about twelve or sixteen
inches.           Hence            the     patient would be constantly sliding
down  during sleep,                       unless supported            by
                                                              this bow, with
webbed forks, covered                          also    with fur,      placed beneath the
chin,        and       beneath
                        occiput.         are also proper

webs lined with fur for the hands to take hold of occa
sionally, and also to go under the arms.   By these means
I should hope 'great advantage from gradually extending
the spine during the inactivity of the muscles of the back                                           ;

     It will     he from hence easily perceived, that all other me
thods of confining or directing the growth of young people
should be used with great skill ; such as back-boards, or
bandages, or stocks for the feet ; and that their application
should not be continued too long at a time, lest worse con
sequences should ensue than the deformity they were de
signed to remove. To this may be added, that the stiff erect
attitude taught by some modern dancing.masters does not
contribute to the grace of the person, but rather militates
against it ; as is well seen in one of the prints in Hogarth's
Analysis of Beauty ; and is exemplified by the easy grace of
some of the ancient statues, as of the Venus de Medici, and
the Antinoiis, and in the works of some modern artists, as
in a beautiful print of Hebe feeding an eagle, painted by
Hamilton, and engraved by Eginton, and many of the
figures of Angelica KauflYnan.
   Where the bone of one of the vertebrae of the back has
been swelled on both sides            of   it,   so as   to become protube
rant, issues near the swelled part have been found of great
service. This has induced me to propose in curvatures
of            to put an issue on the outside of the curve,
      the spine,
where    could be certainly ascertained, as the bones on
            it
the convex side of the curve must be enlarged in one case         ;
I thought this of service, and recommend the further trial
of it.
   In the tendency to curvature of the spine, whatever
strengthens the general constitution    of service   as the use
                                                    is                ;

quires some restriction both in respect to the degree of cold
ness   of    the bath,   the time     of continuing in        it,     and the sea
son    of   the year.    Common springs, which              are   of forty.eight
degrees      of   heat, are too cold for tender constitutions,               whe
ther   of children or adults,         and frequently do them great and
irreparable injury. The coldness of river water in the sum
mer months, which     about sixty-eight degrees, or that of
                               is
Matlock, which           is   about sixty.eight, or       of fiuxton, which
is   eighty-two,      are much to be preferred.            The time of con.
tinuing in the bath should              be but     a   minute or two, or not
so long as to occasion          a   trembling of the limbs             from cold.

   Clandicatio coxaria. Lameness of the hip. A nodding of
the thigh bone is said to be produced in feeble children by
the softness of the neck or upper part of that bone beneath
the cartilage ; which is naturally bent, and in this disease
bends more downwards, or nods, by the pressure of the
body, and thus renders one leg apparently shorter than the
other.   In other cases the end of the bone is protruded out
of its socket, by inflammation or enlargement of the carti
lages or ligaments of the joint, so that it rests on some part
of    the edge   of             which in time becomes filled
                      the acetabulum,                                                   •
up. When the legs are straight, as in standing erect, there
is no verticillary motion in the knee-joint ; all the motion
then in turning out the toes further than Nature designed,
must be obtained by straining in some degree this head of the
thigh-bone, or the acetabulum, or cavity, in which it moves.
This has induced me to believe, that this misfortune of the
nodding of the head by the bone, or partial dislocation of                        it,
by which one leg becomes shorter than the other,       some               is
times occasioned by making very young children stand in
what are called stocks    that ;           is,
                                with their heels together,
and their toes quite out.   Whence the socket of the thigh
bone becomes inflamed and painful, or the neck of the bone
is bent downward and, outwards.
   In this case there     no expectation of recovering the
                               is
straightness  of the  end  of ihe bone: but these patients
are liable to another misfortune, that    to acquire afteris,
wards   distortion of the spine for as one leg
         a                                   ;       shorter             is
than the other, they sink on that side, and in consequence
bend the upper part of their bodies, as their shoulders, the
contrary way, to balance themselves   and then again the
                                                     ;

distorted like the letter      S,
                             owing originally to the deficiency
of the  length of one  limb.  The only way to prevent this
curvature of the spine       is    for   the child       to wear   a   high-heeled

shoe     or patten     on the lame foot, so     as to  support that side

greater deformity.
    I  have this clay seen a young lady about twelve, who does
 not    limp or waddle in walking;            but nevertheless, when
she stands or sits, she         sinks down    towards her right side,
 and      turns  out that     toe more than the other.            Hence,
both     as she sits and    stands, she bends her body to the right ;
 whence her head would hang a little over her rioht shoulder:
 but to replace this perpendicularly, she lifts up her left
 shoulder and contracts the muscles on that side of the neck ;
 which are therefore become thicker and stronger by their
 continued action ; but there is not yet any very perceptible
 distortion of the spine.
    As her right toe is turned outward rather more than               na
 tural, this shows the disease to be in the hip-joint ; because,
 when the limb is stretched out, the toe cannot turn hori
 zontally in      the least without moving the end of the thigh
 bone ; although when the knee is bent, the toe can be turn
 ed through one third or half of a circle by the rotation of
 the tibia and fibula       of  the leg rotind each     other.  Hence    if
 children     are set in stocks       with  their heels touching each
 other     as  they    sit, and   arc  then  made to rise up, till they
 stand erect, the socket or head of the thigh bone becomes
 injured, especially in those children whose bones are soft ;
 and    a  shortness of that limb succeeds,         either by the bend
 ing of the neck of the thigh bone, or by its getting out of
  the acetabulum ; and a consequent rising of one shoulder
  and a curvature        of  the spine is produced from so distant a
  cause.
     M. M. An        elastic cushion made of curled hair should be
  placed under the affected hip, whenever she sits ; or should
  be fitted to the part by means of drawers, so that she cannot
  avoid sitting on it. A neck-swing, and lying down in the
  day, should be occasionally used to prevent or remove any
  curvature of the spine.

                   IV.   Composition    of Oxalic Acid.
   JL HE knowledge of the relative weights of the elements
  which compose oxalic acid, though of importance, is not
  sufficient to convey a clear idea of this compound, and in
  what respect it differs from tartaric acid, alcohol, sugar, and
  various other bodies possessing very different properties,
  though composed of the very same elements in different pro
  portions.
      It has been ascertained, by numerous and            decisive expe
  riments,    that elementary bodies always enter into combina
  tions in determinate proportions, which may be represented
  by numbers.       For example, the numbers which correspond
   to the four elements, oxygen, azote, carbon, and hydrogen,
   are the  following  :
                             Oxygen              6
                             Azote        -      5

  •to                       On Oxalic Acid.
  Now, in all compounds consisting of these ingredients, the
  proportion of the different constituents may always be re
  presented by these numbers, or by multiples of them ; thus,
• the
       composition of the following substances may be thus
  stated  :
                                 0xygen.     Hydrogen.   Carbon.     Azote.
   Water                                 6        +   1
   Carbonic oxide                        6     -         + 4'5
   Carbonic acid                  2X6          -         + 4.5
   Carburetted hydrogen           -            2  X   1  + 4.5
   Olefiant gas                   -                   1  + 4.5
   Ni irons gas                          6     -         -               +5
   Nitric acid                   2x6           -         -               +  5
   Nitrous oxide                         6     -         -         +   2X5
      From  the knowledge      of this curious law, it        is difficult to
  avoid concluding that each of these elements consists of atoms
  of determinate weight, which combine according to certain
  fixed proportions, and that the numbers above given repre
  sent the relative weights of these atoms respectively. Thus,
  an atom   of oxygen weighs six, an atom of hydrogen one,
  &c.     Water   is composed of one atom of oxygen, and one
  atom   of hydrogen    ; carbonic acid      of two atoms of oxygen,
  and one of carbon, &c.      This    curious    theory, which promises
  to throw an unexpected light on the obscurest parts of che
  mistry, belongs to Mr. Dalton. I have elsewhere illustrated
  it at considerable length*.
      The same law holds with respect to the salts. The acid
  and bases always combine in determinate proportions.                    We
  may affix numbers to all the acids and bases, which num
  bers, or their multiples, will represent all the combinations
  into which these bodies enter. Some of these numbers are
  given in the following table      :
               Sulphuric    acid    33         Barytes      67

                                                                              ,

       These numbers may be conceived to represent the relative
    weights of an integrant particle of each of these substances ;
    formed on the supposition that an atom of hydrogen weighs 1.
    It follows equally from this law, that the acids and bases
    combine particle with particle, or a certain determinate num
    ber of particles of the one with a particle of the other.
      One of the most important points in the investigation of
    compound bodies, is to ascertain the number which denotes
    the weight of an integrant particle of each of them, that of
    an atom of hydrogen being 1 ; because this number, or a
multiple of          it,
                represents the weight                      of each, which          enters
into all combinations    and because
                                  ;                    it   enables   us to estimate
    the number of elementary atoms of which each   composed.              is
    From careful comparison of the table of oxalates, given in
           a
a     preceding part of this paper, with the weight of the diffe
    rent bases already determined                *,
                                         appears that the weight
                                                      it
    of an integrant particle of oxalic acid must be represented
    by   the number 39-5.
      Now, what number of atoms of oxygen, carbon, and                                hy
    drogen, go to constitute an integrant particle of oxalic acid?
    We have assigned the relative weights of each of these
    atoms, and we have ascertained the relative proportions of
    the respective     elements of oxalic acid.               From    these data     it   is
    easy to solve the problem.               An integrant particle of oxalic
                of nine atoms combined together, namely, four
    acid consists
    atoms of oxygen, three of carbon, and two of hydrogen.
               4   atoms of oxygen weigh               4x6            =24
               3   atoms of carbon                     3   x 4-J = 13-5

    which together make up               the weight    of an integrant particle
    of oxalic acid.
         According    to these proportions,            100 parts      of oxalic acid

numbers which dp not indeed exactly correspond with the
result  of the preceding analysis, but which approach suffi
ciently near it to give the reasoning employed considerable
probability at least, if it does not lead to certainty.
   We may now examine the decomposition which                      takes
place when oxalate     of lime  is exposed to heat.       Let   an atom
of oxygen    be w,  an atom    of carbon c, and an atom of hy
drogen k. An integrant particle of oxalic acid may be repre
sented by 4 w + 3 c + 2 h.          We may        represent   the com-
positio.n and weight of an integrant particle of each of the
substances into which oxalic acid is decomposed by heat,
by the following symbols and numbers :
         Carbonic acid       -       2   w + c weight      16-5
         Carburetted hydrogen            c +  2 A      -     6-5
         Carbonic oxide          -       w + c         -   10-5
        Water           -       -        w + h         -     7
         Charcoal        -      -              c       -    4-5
   We may now conceive three particles of oxalic acid              to be
decomposed at once, and        to resolve    themselves      into  these
substances, in the following proportions           : •
   4 particles of carbonic acid              = 8 w + 4 c
   2 particles of carburetted hydrogen       «=-       - 2 c + 4 k
   5 particles of carbonic oxide             = 2 w + 2 c
   2 particles of water       -       -      =2if--+2A
   1 particle of charcoal             -      = -        -  \ c
                                   Total         iSw + 9c       + 6 k
   3 particles  of oxalic acid        -      =\2w + 9c          +  6k
   We    see that such  a decomposition is possible. It remains
 only therefore to  see whether the weights of these substances,
 which result from this hypothesis, correspond with the pre
 ceding analysis.     Now,
                                                              4 particles

    Reducing      these  proportions to 100 parts of acid, and
joining together the two inflammable gases, the numbers
 come out as follows :
     Carbonic acid           55•70   we actually obtained 5'9'S3

    It  is impossible to expect exact       correspondence   betweeu
 the theory and      hypothesis, till  the numbers representing the
 weights of the elementary atoms be ascertained with more
 rigid accuracy than has hitherto been done. I satisfied my
 self with taking the nearest round numbers, which are suf
 ficient at least to show an evident approximation to the pro
 portions obtained by experiment.
   V.    Composition    of Sugar, and Formation of Oxalic Acid.
    When      a compound body is decomposed, and resolved into
 a number of new substances, the products are almost always
  simpler, or consist of integrant particles, composed of fewer
  atoms than the integrant particles of the original body. Thus,
  though oxalic acid is composed of nine atoms, none of the
  products evolved, when that acid is decomposed by heat,
  contain more than three         atoms.    Hence it is probable that
  sugar is a more compound          body than oxalic acid, because
  nitric acid resolves it into a    variety of new compounds, one
  of which is oxalic acid. It may be worth while to examine
  the action of nitric acid on sugar, and the formation of
  oxalic acid, more closely than has hitherto been done, as
  the investigation will furnish some data for estimating           the
  composition of sugar.
                                                                  Two

   44                      On Oxalic Acid.
      Two hundred grains of pure crystallized            sugar bring
   treated with diluted  nitric acid in the usual way, yielded 200
   cubic inches of carbonic acid, 64 cubic inches of nitrous gas,
  and 70 cubic inches of azotic gas. But these numbers,
  though the result of a good many experiments, are not to be
  considered as very exact. The uncertainty depends upon the
  property which the solution has of producing more gas after
  ihe sugar is decomposed, at the expense of the oxalic acid
  formed. Now, it is difficult to stop at the precise point.
      The whole weight of oxalic acid, which can be obtained
 from 200 grains      of sugar, amounts     to 116 grains.        If  the
  experiment be properly conducted, the whole of the sugar
 is decomposed, or at least the quantity of residuary matter
 is small.
      From the preceding statement, there is reason to conclude
 that 100 grains of sugar, when decomposed by nitric acid,
 yield,
                                                                 Grain*.
       1. Oxalic acid crystals 58 grains,   or  real acid         45
       2. Carbonic acid 100 cubic inches, equivalent to 46.5
 while these are evolved obviously by the decomposition of
 the nitric acid.
       1. Azotic gas 35 cubic inches equivalent to                10.62
       2. Nitrous gas 32 cubic inches equivalent to                10.85
     Now, as nitric acid contains no carbon, it is obvious that
the oxalic acid formed, and the carbonic acid evolved, must
 contain the whole carbon contained in 100 grains of sugar.
                                                          Grains.
        45   grains of oxalic acid contain of carbon 14.40
        46-5 grains of carbonic acid contain of ditto 13.02
                                          Total           27.42
therefore 100 grains of sugar contain 27i grains of carbon.
     The azotic gas and nitrous gas must have been originally
in   the state of nitric acid, and must have given out oxygen
when they were evolved. But nitric acid is composed of
                                               0xygen.
                  Azote       -     10.62 + 25
                  Nitrous gas       10.85  +     4.5
                                                29.5
                                                           Therefore

                          On Oxalic Acid.                         4$
    Therefore they must have parted with 29-5 grains of oxy
gen. We are at liberty to suppose that the whole of this
oxygen went to the formation of carbonic acid.              Now, 4G-J
grains of carbonic acid are composed of
                                          Grains.
                       Oxygen         -    33'5
                       Carbon        -      13-0
                                           465
    From this it appears, that in the carbonic acid there were
four grains of oxygen more than was furnished by the nitric
acid.    I confess I am disposed to ascribe this surplus to
errors in the experiments, and to believe that the whole of
the oxygen of the carbonic acid was furnished by the nitric
acid.    This being admitted, it follows          that the carbon of
the carbonic acid, and the whole constituents in the oxalic
acid, were furnished by the sugar. These are as follows :
                                                     Grains.
              Carbon          -                       27'5
              Oxygen   in  45  grains oxalic acid     28-8
              Hydrogen    in  ditto          -          1-8
                                                      58-1
 If this total be subtracted from the 100 grains of sugar used,
 there will be a remainder of 41-9 grains. As this quantity of
 the sugar has disappeared, and is no where to be found among
 the products, we must suppose that it has assumed the form
 of water. Now     41 -9 grains of water are composed of
                          Oxygen          35-o
                          Hydrogen          6
                                          41-9
 Adding    thse quantities to the preceding products, we obtain
  the composition   of sugar,     as follows   :
                          Oxygen          64-7
                          Carbon           27-5
                          Hydrogen           7-8
                                          1000
                                                               Though

 46                         On Oxalic Acid.
    Though     the process    of reasoning, which        led to   this  ana
 lysis  of sugar,   is too hypothetical      to   be trusted implicitly,-
 yet I am persuaded that it is to a certain degree correct, and
that the result obtained does not deviate very far from the
 truth.    If we compare Lavoisier's statement of the compo
 sition of sugar obtained in a different manner, though by a
mode of reasoning not less hypothetical, we shall be surprised
 at its near coincidence with mine. His numbers are
                            Oxygen            64
                            Carbon            28
                            Hydrogen            8
                                            100
It  is true that two different hypotheses may lead to the same
result, and yet be both wrong ; but this becomes infinitely
improbable in the present case, when we consider that the
proportion of carbon, which          I assign     to sugar, must     at   all
events be nearly correct.
    We    have no direct method        of determining       the weight    of
an integrant particle      of sugar ; but     if the accuracy of the
preceding analysis be admitted,          it furnishes us with an in
direct one, which        cannot be rejected        ; for it is clear, that
the atoms     of oxygen, carbon,      and hydrogen,      will  be to each
other respectively,      as  the  numbers      y,    \$,  f;    and   these
numbers      reduced    to  their lowest terms         become 5, 3, 4,
nearly, which being primes with respect to each other, must
represent the number of atoms of which an integrant par
ticle   of  sugar  is composed.        Sugar then is a compound of
 12 atoms;      namely, five     of oxygen, three of carbon, and
four of hydrogen       ; the weight    of   an integrant particle       of it
is 47-5, and its symbol is 5w + 3 c + 4 h.                 It differs from
oxalic acid merely in containing an additional atom                of oxy
gen and      two of hydrogen.         If we had any method of re
moving these substances,         without altering the proportion of
the other constituents,         we  should obtain a much            greater
quantity of oxalic acid from sugar than we can at present ;
but nitric acid acts by removing one-half of the carbon in
the form      of carbonic    acid ; the sugar deprived of this, re
solves itself into    oxalic acid and water.          Suppose two par*
                                                                      tides

              Memoir    on the   Incomlustille Man, &c.                   41
tides   of sugar    acted on at once, the        symbol for them will
be 10 w     + 6 c + 8 A. Let three           atoms of the carbon be
removed by the action of the nitric acid, there will remain
 10 tv + 3 c + 8 h.         Now

          Six particles of \vater           = 6w - - + 6 A
 which    is just the quantity bf oxalic acid left.        This will give
 us some idea of the way in which the formation of oxalic
 acid by nitric acid is accomplished. And although the series
 of changes is probably more complicated, yet they are ulti
 mately equivalent to the preceding statement.                  I allude to
 the formation of malic acid, which is said to precede the
 oxalic acid, and afterwards to be converted into it by the
 subsequent action of nitric acid            ;  but on the composition
 and formation of this latter acid,          I  avoid making any obser
 vations at present, as I propose to make them the subject
 of a separate dissertation.

  A HAVE undertaken this short            treatise  after performing       se
  veral   experiments in       the   presence    of some  of my      learned
  friends,    on the pretended incombustibility.           It is extraordi
  nary,    that  in   examining     all  the   phenomena     which Se/ior
  Lionetto has exhibited to the public, no one has mentioned
  the most extraordinary of them, his proposal to enter an
  oven, (I know not at what degree of Reaumur's thermome-

what reproach should I not merit for having hazarded an
examination           of   an    imaginary     fact    Dr. Horstis fell into
                                                       ?
this error, in wishing to give a               physical explanation of the
golden tooth of the boy from Silesia,                      without      first ascer
taining     if the    phenomenon really existed, or was the effect of
illusion,      as the   fact was afterwards publicly known to be a
deception.           Now returning to the proposal of th'e oven,
without entering into any sublime theory, I can venture to
assure any person whatever, that Lionetto never entered an
oven, nor will he enter one near us : this I shall repeat till
the very moment in which myself and others may see
him enter it l so well persuaded am I that he cannot realize
his proposal, if the oven has no particular construction which
alters its nature and effects.             There are indeed some instances
of   personshaving             suffered of a very high tempe
                                          the action

a place simply heated where the air had access, and a close
oven.
                         Memoir, &c.
     The arrival of map calling himself incombustible, who
                           a
treated hot iron in various manners, drank boiling oil, and
handled liquid lead, &c., was scarcely announced, when
this interesting phenomenon engaged me so much, that I
left no means untried by which I might bt enabled to form
an opinion of it.   First, it was indispensably necessary to                          .
ascertain the fact, by assisting assiduously at the experiments
which Senor Lionetto, otherwise called the incomlustible
man, presented to the public.   I approached                       as near to   him
as possible, that I might observe minutely                         whatever was
most particular in his experiments — of which the following
is an account.
   Seiior Lionetto commenced the proof of his incombusti
bility by putting over his head a thin plate of red.hot iron,
which, at least in appearance, did not alter his hair. The
iron had scarcely come in contact with     when   consider it,          a
able quantity of dense white vapour was seen to arise.   A
second plate         of red.hot iron         was   likewise       passed over the
                                                                             whole

        or the pretended    Phenomenon    of Incomlustibility.    49
whole extent of his arm and           leg. With another red.hot
iron he struck his heel and the point of the foot repeatedly :
in this experiment the contact of the fire was longer than in
any of the preceding.        From the sole of his foot so much
vapour was disengaged, that being very near the experi
menter, my eyes and nose were sensibly affected.            He also
put between his teeth a heated iron, which, although not
red-hot,     was still capable of burning.
    It was   announced that he had drunk half     a glass of boiling
oil  ; but, in fact,  I found that he had never drunk such   a dose,
and that he had performed this twice by introducing a little
into his mouth, not more than the third part of a spoonful,
at a time. It was likewise said that he had washed his hands
and face in    boiling   lead ; but he now practised such an ex
periment only      in rapidly bathing the extremities of his fingers
in liquid lead, and also carrying a very small portion of it
on his tongue. He afterwards passed a piece of red.hot iron
over his tongue, without showing the least painful sensation.
His tongue, which I was able distinctly to observe in this
 often-repeated experiment, was covered with a crust similar
to what is seen on the tongues of persons in fevers ; that is
 to say, it was covered with a kind of paste of a dirty gray
 colour.     He  exposed his foot again to the flame     of burning
 oil, but kept it at a certain distance. In short, he threw
 sulphuric, nitric and muriatic acids on inflamed charcoal,
 and immediately exposed his face over the vapours which
 arose from those acids, keeping a small part of it in that
 situation.
    The experiment with which Seiior Lionetto is accustomed
 to terminate his exhibition, is that of passing through the
skin of his arm a thick gold pin, which he does without
feeling the least pain.       In this proof of his insensibility, I
observed     that the pin entered his skin with difficulty, re
quiring such a force as if it had to perforate dressed leather.
Now although at first view this fact seemed to have no rela
tion with the others practised by means of fire, yet it ap
peared to me to throw some light on the examination of the
phenomena relating to the pretended incombustibility.          From
these experiments, which I have seen so often repeated, I lan-

cied that Sefior Lionetto's             skin had become           so insensible,
from     the effect     of   repeated       frictions with some       substances
fit to produce such          a   change, by stimulating          excessively the
nerves  and the vessels of the skin, and by recent usage,
that it was capable of impeding in a certain degree the free
passage of caloric.  Besides the action of such substances,
J thought that the force of habit must always have added to
such a disposition, and that even the frequent impression
of the fire should have contributed not a little to produce
such insensibility in his skin : the experiment of the pin
which he put through              it,
                          was to me no light argument of
its hebetude.
   These opinions, however, were merely the effect of                          a
system dictated by reason, and  knowledge of the laws of
                                               a
animal life    :   but had    I    not known the means used to render
the skin incombustible,              any other knowledge of
                                     nor had
the subject,    should woK. have been able to give
                   I                                 plausible        a
explanation  of the more  surprising phasnomena    such as the    ;
red-hot iron which he so often passed over his tongue with
out suffering any painful impression   and much less with

in   what manner he could suffer the action                    of almost red-hot
iron, which        he put between his teeth,                  on the enamel of

Few substances belonging to chemical compositions, or to
other natural bodies, appeared to me proper for the pur
pose which      had in view.
                   I            The sharp sensation which
was excited     theby
                    vapour disengaged    the contact of the

fire with the incombustible membrane, and the chemical
reason, induced me first to have recourse to acid substances,
and to some of the acidulous salts.                 It   would be too tedious
to relate in detail all the various substances                 and experiments
                                                                          which

 which I made         :   with some of them             I    attempted     to rub my
 skin, which,        after the liquids dried, was always sensible                        in
 the same degree to the action                 of the fire.
    The unfortunate result of my first experiments did not
 discourage me; persuaded that by the effect of only one
 rubbing; it was not possible to change the skin in such a
 manner as to render it insensible to the action of fire. I
 therefore repeated oftener on the same part the frictions
with   the same substance, and perceived the effect, that it
gradually became less and less sensible to the action of ca
loric.  On one part of my body I repeated the frictions so
often with dilute              (allurgato)         sulphurous        acid, that I was
finally able to pass a pla'.e            of red.hot iron over it without
any injury. I afterwards discovered that dilute sulphuric,
nitric, and muriatic acids would equally produce the same
effect: but the sulphurous acid is preferable to all the others,
as  it produces the speediest and most certain effect.         I
next tried the action of acidulous   sulphat of alumine and
potash,  or the alum  of commerce,   a substance distinguished
for its property of preserving bodies from the action of fire.
In making         a saturated     solution of this salr,         I   discovered how
much greater styptic powers it had acquired by being strongly
agitated or boiled (lollirte sulla spugna *). With the fluid
thus prepared, I rubbed one part of my arm several times,
and     did not before         obtain such decided              results;     so   that   I
have ever since used this solution.
  These essays, however, were only the rudiments of a know
ledge of the phenomenon, the examination of which was
still incomplete. An accidental combination afterwards in
duced me to undertake a new series of experiments, by
which I might be enabled to give a more clear explanation
of all     the    more difficult         operations executed by Lionetlo.

•preserved the same insensibility to the action       of red-hot iron,
but had even become stronger than at first.            I again rubbed
 the same part with soap without wiping it with the cloth,
 and passed over it the iron very red.hot, without feeling any
 painful     sensation, or even having the hair burned.               Re
 membering       the  crust which   I observed on Lionetto's     tongue,
 I determined to rub mine with the same soap ; in conse
 quence     of which it became equally insensible to the action
 of  fire.    I began with pieces of iron slightly heated, raising
 them gradually till they were perfectly red.hot.              I made a
 soft paste of soap triturated in a mortar, and water saturated
 with acidulous sulphat of aluuiine and potash (alum), agi
 tated or boiled as above; and spreading this composition
 on my tongue, the experiment succeeded completely. Still
 more simple      I found the process of first bathing the tongue
 with sulphurous acid, and afterwards rubbing it often with
 a piece of soap.        The experiment succeeded still better if
 after bathing      the tongue with this acid,    I  covered it with a
 thin stratum      of   sugar reduced    to impalpable   powder, and
 rubbed it afterwards with the soap in the same manner.. The
 sugar in this case, like a mordant, made a greater quantity
 of  soap attach    to the tongue, and adhere more solidly.
    By    this  mode   of operating, the solution of alum, or of di
 lute sulphurous acid, may be adopted at pleasure to benumb
 the nerves of the tongue, and the soap is a most efficacious
 means of obstructing (rifrangere) the action of caloric, the
 propagation of which it almost perfectly impedes. Of all
 the known substances, indeed, soap is that which of all
 others best merits the name of restuiner        of caloric,   as  I shall
 show on another occasion.
    From these experiments I proceeded to that with the boil
 ing oil, putting at first a very small drop considerably heated
 on the tongue, and afterwards increasing the dose. and the
 temperature. The effect corresponded precisely to my expec
 tation : the oil put on the tongue thus prepared made a
 hissing     noise, similar    to that made    by red-hot    iron when
 brought in contact with a humid body; after the hissing the
 oil ceased to be hot, and was easily swallowed, perhaps in a
 state scarcely tepid.      Thus furnished with facts,       I  now be
                                                                   lieved

       or the pretended Phenomenon         of Incombustibility.      53
lieved myself in     a state  to give the following explanation of /
the phaenomena     which    I had seen executed by Seiior Lionetto.
    I. The  hair over which' he passed the plate of red-hot iron
had    been  first bathed in a solution of alum or in sulphu
rous acid, substances with which it was still wet even at the
moment when touched with the iron.              Hence the origin of
the vapour which arises from his hair in this experiment.
    II. The plate of red-hot iron with which he rubbed his
leg and arm produced no alteration, because those parts were
prepared with the substances of which I have spoken.
    III. The    same    reason   will explain   the phaenomenon      of
the stroke which he gave the red-hot iron with his foot, al
though the contact of the iron in this experiment was longer :
but it is not difficult to comprehend how the sole of the foot
may be conveniently prepared for this purpose, by the above
or similar substances, it being in its nature the most callous
and least sensible part     of the body. The contact however of
his foot   with  the  plate of red-hot iron was certainly not of
very Jong duration ; on the contrary, it clearly appeared in
this experiment, more than in any other, that his incom
bustibility did not     surpass a certain limit, beyond which he
might be burned, and like others was highly combustible.
    IV. With regard to the boiling oil ; this phenomenon, as
being the most striking in appearance, merits             a more mi
nute examination.         To understand well such        a  fact, it is
 necessary   to know the following particulars. Seiior Lionetto
 took the inflamed oil from the fire, and, to give the public a
 proof of its high temperature, immersed in it a certain por
 tion of lead, which melted, thereby demonstrating to what
 degree it was heated.      To me it appears that such an artifice
 should contribute to cool the oil      : this is clearly manifested
 by the known laws of caloric,        the greater part of which is
 employed in the fusion of the lead.          I was better convinced
 of this truth in repeating      the same experiment with a ther
 mometer in my hand, which after the fusion of the lead fell
 most sensibly.      Of all the oil thus reduced to this tempera
 ture, he took barely     a quarter of a spoonful ; and this quan
 tity he dexterously made to fall on his tongue only, which
 was perhaps prepared in such a manner that it cooled in an
                                    D  3                        instant

54                   Memoir      on the   Incomlustille Man;
instant the oil, which was then swallowed                          scarcely tepid.
The experimenter certainly never drank at one draught alone.
the dose of oil which he swallowed at several times, nor
ever ventured to take in his mouth a whole spoonful of
boiling oil.
  V. The experiment with liquid lead, of which, with the
extremity of his fingers, he put a very small portion not in
his mouth, hut on his tongue, requires no other explanation
than the preceding.
     VI. Thered.hot iron also which he passed repeatedly
over the back of his tongue produced no alteration on                                     it,
as he had perhaps clothed    with the plaster of which
                                         it                                              I
have already spoken.
  VII. Washing himself      with nitric acid, exposing his
face to the vapours which arose from sulphuric or nitric acids
thrown on the fire, are experiments equivalent to those with
sulphurous and nitrous acid and also putting his face ex
                                          ;
posed for  time to the flame of blazing oil, are phaenomena
               a
which do not merit any particular examination, and which
certainly present nothing different from the others.                                    The
force of habit, the callousness which the skin after                           a        time
acquires       by   the continued exercise          of such experiments, and
the preceding preparations               of                      of the body,
                                              the exterior surface
are reasons sufficient to explain easily all the phaenomena                               of
this kind. But, How               is
                                  it      possible that the transparent and
opaque cornea of the                      of respiration are
                                 eyes and the organs
uot affected         by   the
                   powerful   action of acid  vapours                              ?      It
would be madness to believe that he held or could hold his
eyes open when his face was exposed                       to the contact       of such
vapours and;         if    he respired    at the same time he must inevi
tably become         a    victim of such temerity.
     In   the experiment with        a piece of iron almost red-hot be
tween his teeth,           and   which        he held there for        a   short time,
it   was sufficient to observe at that moment the visage                           of    the
experimenter, to see the impression of uneasiness and even
acute pain delineated.  Jn this experiment without douht,
more than       in   any other,     he suffered       ;    and    hence     the'
                                                                                   cause
why Senor Lionetto seldom                     repeated it.       His   teeth   indeed
are blackened and spoiled to the last degree.
                                                                                         It

        or the pretended Phenomenon oflncomlustlbility.               55
    It will    not now be improper to show practically what
method should be adopted by any person wishing to become
in this sense incombustible.          First of all, it is necessary to
be convinced from the beginning, that by frequent frictions
and practice on the skin,       any one may become as          able   as
Sefior Lionetto      is at present  to bear the action    of fire,  and
as   he was the first time he attempted similar experiments.
In    the second place it is necessary, that whoever undertakes
 to practise    such operations on his skin, should be informed
 that he will not attain a certain perfection without at the
same time changing his nature, by becoming hardier and
 consequently less sensible.
    I would here premise, that whoever desires to make simi
 lar experiments, should commence by rubbing themselves
 with dilute sulphurous acid, or with the saturated solution
 of alum,     agitated  or boiled  as above.    The more numerous
 the frictions the more insensible the skin will become, and
 also the more proper to sustain the action of fire ; and, as I
 have before observed, the alum made to boil or ferment into
 a spongy      form acquires a greater force, and is therefore
 preferable to the simple solution of alum. With this usage
 alone, after rubbing very often the part over which it is de
 signed to pass the red-hot iron, it will become capable of
 bearing its action.      But to attain this object by these means
 a certain space     of time is necessary.     If any one wishes to
 become capable of sustaining the action of fire, he must rub
 very often with one or other of the above liquids, and also
 with a piece of hard soap slightly moistened, on the same
  part, in order that it may acquire a slight incrustation. The
  kind of plaster, of which I have before spoken, formed by
  the trituration of soap in a mortar with a solution of alum,
  will be the most proper means of rendering the part anoint
  ed insensible to the action of fire : a plate of red-hot iron
  may then be passed over it without occasioning any disagree*
  able sensation.      This mode, although sufficient for the ob
 ject desired, is easier discovered     by others than that  of touch
  ing the part rubbed with soap.
     With    regard to the tongue;     in order that it may be capa
  ble of bearing the passage of a perfectly red-hot iron, it is
                                     D 4                      sufficient

56            Memoir     on the Incomlustible    Man, (3c.
sufficient to bathe it first with the above solution of alum,
and afterwards covering it with a thin stratum of sugar in
fine powder, and also rubbing it often with a piece of hard
soap.      If the tongue, alter being bathed in the solution of
 alum, is rubbed with        a piece of lump sugar, it will have the
same effect as if covered with the powder of the same sugar.
If this preparation is performed with care, a piece of red-hot
iron    may be often drawn successively across the tongue
without experiencing the least sensation of heat. The tongue
prepared in this manner will be very able to sustain the ac
tion of   a  little very hot oil, or    a  little melted lead,  if the
operator has the dexterity to make it fall precisely on the
part prepared.
    Here then the mystery of the pretended incombustibility
is unfolded, and also the means by which any one may at
pleasure become incombustible, if the state of preparation
which I     have described, and with       which one can suffer only
for   a  certain time the action         of fire, merits the epithet.
Hence every one may easily know, that by chemical means
 only we could not explain with sufficient facility the afore
 said phsenomena,        if it were wished to exclude the insensi
 bility which      the nerves  of the skin in such experiments must
 necessarily acquire, especially by the known means fit to
 repel the force of the caloric after their first application.
 Were they employed at the time of the experiment, they
 would be so easily recognised        as to destroy  the necessary  il
 lusion.
     In this first essay I did not wish to enter at greater length
 into a chemico- physiological examination which such an
 interesting phenomenon indeed merits, designing rather to
 notice facts. In a second essay, however, I can with greater
 advantage occupy myself with the chemical philosophy, as
 well   as   that which     belongs to animal life, more diffusely ;
 and with greater precision treat of this subject, which has
  deservedly excited universal attention.

           ANALYSIS OF THE CHALYBEATE SPRING CALLED
                       MR. BARREL'S WELL.
J. HE  spring known by this name is situated in a meadow,
about three or four hundred yards from the upper extremity
of   the town       of Cheltenham.               And although it        had long been
resortedto by the country people, as an efficacious remedy
against various complaints, it was not otherwise noticed,
except by Dr. Fothergill in his Treatise on the Cheltenham
Waters, in the year 1 788. This spring has lately been
opened by the proprietor, a pump-room has been erected,
with other conveniencies to render it worthy of the notice
which it deserves.  The produce of water which this well
affords is upwards              of   100 gallons in an hour,            a much larger
quantity than will probably be ever consumed by the drink
ers who visit it.
   The first portion of water which the spring yields in the
morning, or        having been left undisturbed for some
                        after
time, contains a considerable quantity of brown ferruginous
filaments. This portion being rejected, the rest of the water
which          is pumped is as clear as crystal.               It produces   a   kind    of
greasy feel on glasses which are continually wetted with                          it,   and
eoon deposits             strong coat of brown oxide
                        on them       a                                          of iron.
Over the surface of this spring, which     enclosed in         is                a   small
building constructed  of brick,  and surrounded   with                           a   beau
tiful plantation of             trees,   a     dense atmosphere       of carbonic acid
gas       is   manifest.        The   sides     of    the reservoir   of the spring are
lined with         a   thick cream-like               substance, wholly composed
of carbonate of iron,                and   a    considerable stratum       of the     same
substance         is   deposited        of the well.
                                      at the bottom
  These   facts alone are sufficient indications of the intrinsic
value of this fountain of health.     Without stating the indi
                                                                                     vidual

      ANALYSIS OF THE MINERAL SPRING AT PRESBURY.
    This mineral    water is known under the name of the Hyde
 Spring.     It was   first noticed    by Dr. Linden, in the year
 1750, and recommended by him as equal in efficacy to that
 of the Cheltenham Spa. It has not acquired much reputa
 tion  as a medicinal water, but large quantities of medicinal
 salt have been obtained from it in the usual manner, during
 a series of years.    The water is now only used for the most
 rude   purposes  of rural ceconomy.           Its composition      is as

                          To  Mr. Tilloch.
     SIR,
 _L o place every man's merits in a conspicuous point of
view, and to hold modest worth up to the admiration it de
serves, is laudable ; and if the motive for such conduct be
indeed uninfluenced by other considerations, it must chal
lenge universal applause. I am led to this remark by a paper
in the last Number of your Magazine, signed O., on the
Nature of the Earths. Its author sets out with stating, that
" the result of the late experiments by Messrs. Davy, Ber-
zelius, and Pontin, has only confirmed the idea entertained
by Lavoisier and others, with regard to the nature of earths,
alkalis,    &c."
   That    barytes and strontites were       long    since suspected to
be  of a metallic nature, from their high specific gravities,
is well   known, and the similarity of the properties of the
earths and metallic oxides did not escape the observation of
the old chemists.      I have not the experiments of Messrs.

  ing the decomposition of either barytes, magnesia, or lime ;
  nor can I agree with your correspondent O., that the ob
 jections of Klaproth and Tihawski, to the accuracy of the
  results of Toudi and Ruprecht's experiments, do not affect
  the purpose for which he has introduced them. These re
   sults, Mr. O. tells us, were noticed by Mr. Robert Kerr, in
   the second English edition of Lavoisier's Elements of Che
   mistry,     accompanied with some original remarks, which
   O. copies.      I am as much inclined to allow Mr. Kerr all the
   merit he deserves, as his friend Mr. O. can be, and am
   ready to acknowledge that his remarks are striking, parti
   cularly the following, mentioned in the note, that " from
   analogy we may presume potash to be a metallic substance
   in some hitherto unknown state of combination." But, sir,
   this conclusion was drawn from incorrect data, viz. from
   some experiments published in the Transactions of the Turin
   Academy, (from which O. says Mr. Kerr's opinions re
   ceived corroboration !) which gave reason for supposing
   soda to be a modification            of magnesia. Now we know
    that soda is not a modification of magnesia, neither had
    magnesia, at that time, been proved to be a metallic oxide,
    for Toudi and Ruprecht's experiments were far from satis
    factory. I cannot therefore allow Mr. Kerr any other merit
    on this head, than that of having made a very fortunate
    guess at this philosophical aenigma ; for the mere supposition
    of  a fact, and the proof,       are very different      things.   Ages
     ago   the   alchemists    supposed   gold    to  be a compound   body,
    and all the world knows how earnestly and how fruitlessly
    'they laboured to prove it so.             Fire may be a compound,
     and there     is  just  reason to think    it  is ; but what is all this
     but conjecture?      —a   field of all others the easiest to indulge
     in; and if men are continually guessing, it would be indeed
'
     extraordinary if they did not sometimes approach the truth.
     But indeed O., a few lines further, seems to be perfectly
     of my opinion, allowing           at  the   time    Mr. Kerr  made his
     conjectures      they might have appeared chimerical ; that is,
     allowing they were neither more nor less than so many
     guesses.     But, I repeat, I am far from wishing to deprive
      Mr. Kerr of any well.earned praises, (and his Translation

vegetables."  M. Braconnot's experiments were certainly
conducted with great ingenuity and apparent accuracy, and,
supposing the facts to be precisely as he imagines, would
lead to the extraordinary conclusion, that plants derive no
nourishment from any source but water and light, and con
sequently that all manure is useless, except to enable the
soil to retain the necessary quantity of moisture,   iku al
though   it is probable that charcoal does contain hydrogen,
it is by no means proved, nor is the fact at all likely, that
charcoal is nothing else lut hydrogen in a certain modified
form, as M. Braconnot seems to think may be the case :
and it is proved by            Mr. Davy,    and   most satisfactorily          so,
(.'.'/'/</ his Bakerian        Lecture, Philosophical Transactions,

tains both saline and metallic
afford much, probably ample, food to the seeds sown                             by
M. Braconnol in his experiments. The sand also, Mr. Davy
observes, may contain carbon and various inflammable mat
ters, which the process of washing in weak muriatic acid
could not deprive    of: and
                          it     perfectly true, (though per
                                      it   is
haps O. may not be aware of it,) that        stone containing

     West Coker, Somersetshire*                .
       SIR,
1 made       a   model     of a machine for thrashing out hemp-seed
and flax-seed,         in the year 1803; and in the year 1805                         I
had a real       machine made after the plan of the model, by
Mr. John Wadman, carpenter and hemp- merchant. The
said machine has been since tried and approved by many
hemp- and (lax-merchants.
     1  now send the model for the inspection of the Society,
 and leave the event thereof to their decision.                          It does not
 injure the stalk of the hemp so much as the common mode
 of thrashing out the seed, and consequently leaves it much
 better for scaling.                1 am, sir, your humble servant,
                                                              Ezekiel Cleall.

     We whose          names       are    hereunto subscribed, do certify,
 that we well know            Mr.    Ezekiel Cleall, of West Coker; that
 we have many times seen his machine at                        work, in thrashing
 out hemp-seed and flax-seed,                     and    think it likely to be of
 the ardour of other eiperimentists, and instead of provoking emulation in
duce despondence         I cannot but lament that any motives, of patriotism or
 prudence, however aminble or respectable, should have led them to insert a
 passage so susceptible of misinterpretation, and so obvious to censure." Edit.

      SIR,
   The machine, of which           a model was ,sent to the Society
some months ago, must            be used   with eight flails, two on
each arm, for beating out hemp-seed.
   When     required    to be used for beating out     flax-seed, the
above eight flails must be taken out, and four beaters put
in their place.
   The height of the machine from the floor to the top of
the board on which the flax or hemp is laid, is two feet ; the
breadth, two feet ten inches; ihe length of the board, four
feet four inches    ;  the length   of  each  of the arms, from     the
axis  of the machine,      is three feet two   inches;  the  flails for
the hemp-seed,        two feet two inches long ; the heights of
the uprights, seven feet two inches ; the beaters for the flax
seeds are each one foot three inches long, and seven inches
broad.
   The machine will thrash, in one day, as much hemp as
grows on an acre of land, and other crops in proportion ;
and the work is done with less than half the expense of
thrashing in the usual way.

X. Description of a Machine for breaking Hemp, with Ob
  servations on the Culture of Hemp in Canada. By Wil
  liam Bond, Esq., of Canada*.
1 he culture of hemp in Upper Canada is no doubt one of
the most desirable objects with every person of discernment
settled there, and more particularly so with those of this
description in our mother country} and though there are so
many millions of acres so well calculated to the growth of
this highly valuable article, yet I do not expect, much                   pro
gress therein for some time, for the following reasons                :
  The part of       the country the best calculated for the growth
of hemp   is so lately and in so small a degree occupied, that
few have begun to use the plough, but depend upon raising
a sufficiency of grain by harrowing only ; in this they are
not disappointed for two or three crops ; — in the mean time
they clear away fresh fields from the woods, many of thein
to a large extent, which take up so much time in fencing
and dressing,       that few      of   the farmers have been able to raise
more than needful for their own families' consumption, and
for the use of their neighbours; indeed they arc ignorant as.
to the growth and management     of hemp, and in general so
poor, that they cannot afford to raise any thing for sale that
will not bring them ready money as soon as brought to
market ; and grain brings such a high price in cash, that
few farmers are inclined to turn their attention to any other
article. Another obstacle is, there being no person or per
sons appointed to buy small quantities  of hemp, and pay
ready money   for  the same.
   The tract of rich hemp land in Upper Canada is that part
west of Yonge Street f, and north of Duudas Street J, and
partly enclosed          by Lakes          Ontario, St. Clair,   Huron     and

Simcoe,       and     to the east and       north-east     almost as far at
Grand or Ottaway River, and to within a few miles of the
south and south-east side of Lake Huron. I have not failed
to make annually from one to three journeys through this
tract ; I have crossed it in all directions with Indian guides,
great part of which no white man, except myself, has ever
Bet   foot in    ;  and  I  find, that chief of the interior part con
sists   of  a  rich deep black soil, which I am well convinced,
when well inhabited with farmers, will become one of the
finest countries in all his majesty's territories for the growth
of hemp.
     It is only about five years since this valuable tract began
 to be occupied at all, and though               by industrious farmers,
yet by     such    as  have   brought   little  to   the country.    A few
 cows and sheep, a pair of plough-oxen, one or two horses,
 a  small stock of fanning tools, such as two or three axes,
as many hoes and iron wedges, one or two ox-chains, bting
the most that a new settler (generally speaking) possesses on
 his arrival     ; with    these they make a shift to clear awav the
 woods, and        divide    and fence the land with split timber into
 fields, and they are greatly encouraged to continue clearing
 away the forest, in consequence of the high price given for
 the ashes by the potash makers : this eventually will be
vastly in their favour, in future, when hemp becomes the
 object, as it gives time for the roots and stumps of trees to
 rot, their stock of horses            and oxen to increase, which is
 essentially necessary         before the   farmer can expect to he suc
 cessful in the growth of hemp.                   It is in this progressive
 manner      that   this  fine  country   wiil be   settled ; the nature of
 things demands the pursuit ; and the first settlers are in a
situation capable of putting the same in practice ; their
 Stock of horses and oxen are sufficiently strong to work the
 ground     a second     time over, tear up the stumps and roots,
 plough      and     pulverize the soil ; and until the ground is
brought to this state, it is not fit for hemp, as hemp, in its
 nature, dtpends chiefly upon a tap root ; and when this root
 is interrupted in its progress downwards, it will throw out
 horizontal       ones, which      produce horizontal branches also,
§nd. the open spaces round the stumps of the trees admitting
                                                                         sq

                and on the Culture   of Hemp in Canada.                71
  so  much      air, permits these branches to grow to such a
  length and strength as greatly to injure the bark or hemp            of
  the stem. Such hemp,         when it comes to the hackle, breaks
  off, and drags away at the knobs of the branches, so as to
  leave it short, and make a very great waste ; notwithstand
  ing,  if   there   was  a sure  market for    as  small  a quantity  as
  iolb.   there are few farmers but would         try the experiment;
 and   if  one was more successful than the rest, his neighbour
 would      endeavour to find out the        reasons    why it was so    :
 thus, step by step, the knowledge in the management of
 hemp would be greatly extended, the farmer would gene
 rally be in possession of fresh seed, and when grain becomes
 less an object,      he would feel no fear in turning his attention
 to the culture      of hemp upon    a large scale ;  and, in order to
 encourage the        farmer, it would prove highly advantageous
 to take in any quantity, great or small, of sound hemp,
 assorted perhaps into four or five qualities, according to its
 length,     which will vary for some years to couie, for the rea
 sons before given.
     The high price of labour, owing in some measure              to the
 high price of grain, is such, that hemp, agreeable              to the
 present    regulations,   is not an object with the     farmer;   if an
 addition of about a third of the present price was given, it
 would he an inducement for the farmers to cultivate their
 old fields in    a more spirited manner, which bounty might
 be taken      off  again when grain becomes less an object than
it is at present, which will soon he the case in time of peace,
and no doubt will affect        the price of hemp in proportion in
the English market.
    In all new countries where labourers are scarce, we find
many contrivances calculated for the purpose of reducing
labour, more for the sake of expod'nion than case ; such,
for instance, as the saw-mill, the hoe. ploughs, scythe and
cradle for cutting and gathering grain, the wooden machine
(drawn round by one horse) for thrashing grain, the iron-
shod shovel, drawn by oxen, and held by two handles, as
a plough,      for the purpose of levelling the roads, &c. &e.
Nor    are the Americans,        or other settlers &c. in this coun
try, fond of any         work that needs     violent   exercise of   the
                                    E 4                          body,

72       Description    of a Machine for breaking Hemp,
body, which the breaking of hemp in the old way certainly
occasions, in consequence or' requiring a cross motion of
each arm, which makes the breakers complain of a pain
about the short ribs on        the  side they hold    the hemp; and
on the opposite side a little under the shoulders, so that
breaking of hemp in the old way is a great obstacle to its
increased culture.        To render labour, therefore, somewhat
more easy and expeditious, is an object worthy the first at
tention, and I consider it practicable at a small expense,
and have sent to the Society a model of a machine for this
purpose.
    I have   observed    among the clothiers' and fullers' ma
chinery,    great    power and rapid motion proceeding from
what is commonly called a dash wheel, erected across a
stream   of rapid water,     the flies or float boards   of which are
fixed in the octangular axis, from fifteen to twenty- five feet
in length, and from three and a half in depth, each flie.           I
have seen many corn-mills in Upper Canada, with no other
water-wheels than such as the above described, which save
a vast expense in raising dams, &c.
   There are   a  number of streams         in that part of Canada,
which I have endeavoured to describe, (as to the practicabi
lity of the various ways of cultivation,) that are well calcu
lated for such wheels ; and where these streams or rivers are
not too wide, the axis of the wheel might be extended across
so as to reach the land on each side, where I prepare the
breakers   to be fixed to go by a      tilt the same as a forge ham
mer, and such       a  simple piece    of machinery would not cost
more than 70 or 80 dollars, as little iron would be wanted,
and timber we have for nothing; and when in motion would
employ four breakers and two servers, from whom I should
expect as much good work as fifteen or sixteen persons could
possibly do in the old way, and that without much bodily
labour.
   Mills for breaking hemp,         on the very same principle as
that of  a saw-mill,     as to  motion only an addition of an iron
crank,   so as  to run with two cranks instead of one, with
something of a larger sweep than that           of a saw-mill, would
be   of vast utility  in  a neighbourhood of a large growth of
                                                               hemp,

hemp, and would not cost more than a common saw-mill ;
as the brakes of the frame continue in motion the same as
that of     a   saw-mill, twenty men might                      employed, who
                                                                   be
would do         as   much        as    fifty or sixty could do in the old way,
and with much               more        ease and pleasure          to themselves         ; and
this is not the only advantage that would result from such
mills ; it would cause something of a social meeting, which
the youth would be particularly fond of.   At such meetings
al! thedefecls respecting the culture and managementof hemp
would be examined into, and those who raised the best would
become ambitious,                   and    try to excel           each other ; thus we
might reasonably expect                    that Upper Canada would far exceed
all other countries in the world for the growth of good hemp.

   rp
   JL o include the interest               of  the colonists      and the mother
  country also in one and the same pursuit, is not only laud
  able, but most likely to succeed, especially where only a
  trifle of property of the individuals or of the public is wanted
  to set the bountiful hand of Nature to work in a country
  where animal           subsistence and a suitable climate call for
  the industrious husbandman,                  who may in various ways be
  useful to himself and his country.
      In my travels through America, I have often been sur
  prised that nn attempt has been made to introduce, for the
  purpose    of propagation, that useful little animal, the warrtn
  rabbit, of such vast importance to the hat manufactory of
 England. It is chiefly owing to the fur of this animal that
 the English hats are so much esteemed abroad.                           It is a fact
  well known amongst the hatters, that a hat composed of
 one half of coney wool, one sixth old coat beaver, one sixth
 pelt beaver, and one sixth Vigouia wool, will wear far pre
 ferable to one made of all beaver, as it will keep its shape
 better, feel more firm, and wear bright                      and    black     much
 longer.
      The  value   of the coney wool,            the produce       of   the   united
 kingdom       only, is not           less,   I will    venture to say, than
 250,000/. per annum             ;  but the quantity is much diminished,

owing to the banishment and persecution they meet with on
every side, and so many small warrens taken in for grain
land   ;   in consequence of which it is time, that some pro-
testion       should be afforded, if possible, to that important
branch of British manufactory (in which coney wool is used)
from suffering any inconvenience in the want of so essential
an article, and the accomplishment of this grand object I
conceive perfectly easy.
    General Observations. — When I speak of the warren
rabbit,      I  have to observe, that there are in       England, as well
as in most parts of Europe, three other kinds, viz. the tame
rabbit, of various colours, the fur of which is of little val.ie,
except the white ; the shock rabbit, which has              a  long shaggy
fur of little value ; the bush rabbit, like those             of America,
which commonly sits              as a hare,  and the fur   of   each is   of a
rotten inferior quality.
    To return        to the warren rabbit. — There      are two     sorts   in
 respect to colour,          that is, the common gray, and the silver
gray,     but   little   or no  difference in respect to the strength and
 felting qualities of the fur.          The nature of this animal is to
 burrow deep in sandy ground, and there live in families,
nor will they suffer one from a neighbouring family to come
amongst them without a severe contest, in which the in
truders are generally glad to retire with the loss of part of
their coats, unless when pursued by an enemy, when they
find protection.
    It   is scarcely worth while for me           to mention a thing so
 generally known, viz. that rabbits, particularly those of the
 warren, are the most prolific ot all other four-footed animals
in the world         ;  nor do I apprehend any difficulty would attend
 the exporting this little quadruped with safety to any di
 stance, provided it was kept dry, and regularly supplied with
 clean sweet food, and            a due regard  to the cleanliness    of   the
 ooxes or places          of confinement.
    Twelve or fifteen pair of these valuable animals               taken to
 Upper Canada, and there enclosed within a small                   space    of
 ground        suitable to their nature, but furnished with            a  few
 artificial     burrows at the first, by way of a nursery, spread
 over those now useless plains, islands, and peninsulas, so
                                                                         well

    76               Observations     on the Breeding           of Rallits
   well calculated to their nature, would,                      I will make bold to
   say,     the eighth       year   after   their introduction,              furnish   the
   British market with a valuable raw material, amounting to
   a large      sum, increasing every year with astonishing rapidity,
   so as      to become, in a few years,                one amongst the first of
   national objects.
       It  may be supposed          by some, that the above project is
  magnified beyond possibility, or even probability ; but from
  the serious attention I have paid to the subject, these many
  years past, as to all points for and against, leaves no room
  to accuse myself          of being    too sanguine        ;   for,   if properly    ma
  naged a few years at the first,                I cannot find          a single    thing
  likely     to interrupt their progress.
      Some idea of the astonishing increase                     of   the     rabbit may
  be had from the          following     facts    :
      An old       doe   rabbit will bring forth young nine times in
  one year,        and from four to ten each time ; but to allow for
  casualties, state the number at five each litter.
      In nine months              -        -                  -          -      -      45
     The females of the first litter will bring forth five times,
          the proportion       of which      is 2   j females'     produce             63
     Those       of the   second litter four times produce                      -      50
   •
     Ditto of ditto third ditto three ditto ditto                     ..        -      37
     Ditto of ditto second ditto two ditto ditto                                -      25
                     Total in one      year from one pair                       -    21[)
     The third female          race  of   the old dam, and               the  second of
 the    first    litter, seldom breed           the first       year,      but are early
 breeders in the spring following, when we might expect an
i icrease of the whole in proportion to the first pair, if pro
 perly attended to and protected.
     It is generally allowed, that hares are not more than one
fourth       as  prolific as rabbits, notwithstanding, agreeable to an
experiment tried by Lord Ribblesdalc, who enclosed a pair
of hares for one year, the offspring was (as I have been cre
dibly informed) 68: these animals,                      could they be exported
to Upper Canada with safety, and                        there     protected       within
enclosures for          a  few years,       would soon after spread over a
                                                                                   large

large extent of country          : the fur is nearly as valuable as that
of the rabbit.
     In that part of Upper Canada within the 45 degrees of
north latitude, and the southern and western boundaries, the
 climate is nearly the same as that of England, a little hotter
 a few days      in summer, and        a little colder   a few days in win

     The   increase    of most animals          appears    much   greater   in

 tention to.their breeding stock, which gives me hopes, that
 in a few years we shall be able to pay for our woollen cloths
 in wool.        Finding the     effect  of   soil and climate so    salutary
 to sheep,      &c., it may      be reasonably       supposed, that rabbits
 will answer the most sanguine expectations, as I understand
 the wool of the sheep retains all its nature the same as in
 England,         particularly its strength, and felting qualities
 among the hatters, which assures me that rabbit wool from
 those bred in Upper Canada will do the same ; and there
  are some millions        of acres within the latitude and boundaries
  which I have before described, suited to the nature of the
  warren rabbit ; nor do I apprehend that the wolves, foxes,
  &c., of Upper           Canada will be half so destructive           as the
  poachers     in England.
      The Guanaco, or camel.sheep of South America, no

  is a tame, domestic animal, very hardy, and used with
  much cruelty by the natives in travelling over the mountains
  with their burthens        ; it shears    a fleece  of wool of from 2lb.
  to   3lb., which      is  of dusky     red on the back ; on the sides
  inclined to white, and under the belly quite white; its tex
  ture is very fine, yet strong; its felting qualities very
  powerful, and is worth, when ready for use, from five to
  fifteen    shillings per pouud.         This animal would no doubt
  thrive, and do well in England, Upper Canada, and in par
   ticular I should suppose in New Holland.

                             Roasting     of Galena.
 It    is extremely difficult         completely to desulphurate galena
 by roasting: the affinity of its component parts for oxy
gen does indeed effect their disunion quickly enough ; but
that of      the new compounds,               Ike sulphuric acid and the
oxide    of  lead,    gives   birth   to a  new    combination, which re
 tains the sulphur, and thus forms an obstacle to the desul
 phuration     :   to this   same     affinity of the oxide of lead for
the sulphuric         acid, we must attribute the facility with
which this acid is formed in the roasting of galena.
    I   shall examine in detail the var'tous processes to which
this important decomposition gives rise, as I think they
will explain numerous and complex phaenomena.
    Whatever care is taken in roasting galena, it is impossible
to convert all ihe sulphur into sulphurous acid, and to avoid
the formation of sulphuric acid ; the result always gives a
mixture of oxide and of si.lphateof lead.
    In roastings performed upon-a               large scale,  and in a regu
lated atmosphere, the proportion               of sulphate of lead   is much

merous experiments made in I'Ecole des Mines incline me
tothink thai the roasted scldick of the Pezey ore contains
half its weight of sulphate of lead whence    follows, that ;                    it
even   supposing the whole galena to be decomposed, the
roasting has not separated the half of the sulphur con                                        it
tains.

action of the galena, as yetundecomposed, upon the sulphate

and result         of this action.
    Iput into     retort
                       a     mixture composed of one part of
                                     a
pulverized sulphuret    of  lead, and three of sulphate*, and                                          I
heated    at first .but slowly. When the retort was red-hot,
           it                                                                                              a
considerable disengagement of sulphurous acid gas took place
which lasted an hour, when the retort melted the residue                             ;
presented          a   mixture       of oxide          and        of sulphate of              lead.    I
ascertained that the sulphurous acid which had been collect

                   •   This mixture was made in the humid way.
                                                                                                      Thii

  This experiment demonstrates in an indisputable man
ner the decomposition of the sulphate of lead by the sul
phuret, or rather that of the sulphuric acid which it contains,
by the sulphur and the lead of the galena.   The sulphurous
acid cerlainlv proceeds both from the oxygenation of the sul
phur, and from the demi-decomposition of the acid, as                                  I am
convinced that no sulphate remained in the residue.                                    I    re
peated this decomposition,            employing equal                     parts of galena
and     of sulphate        ;     sulphurous acid disengaged was more
                               the
abundant,         and      there remained in the retort a mixture of
oxide and of sulphurct ; from which I concluded, that    in                           if,
the first experiment,  the proportion of sulphuret  of lead
was too weak,     was too strong in the latter.
                          it                     also made                 I
another attempt to attain some proportions rigorously suf
ficient for the mutual decomposition, and endeavoured at the
same time to assure myself                   of the oxidation of              the lead con
tained    in   the galena        in   a           gram
                                          metallic state.     I     put fourteen
mes of sulphate, well mixed with eight grammes of sul
phuret,      crucible, which
             in   a            allowed to become red-hot
                                                I
in   a   gradual          manner.         I     remarked           that   a    considerable
crackling      produced, occasioned
                 was                    the disengagement     by
of the sulphurous acid.  did not take the crucible from the
                                      I
fire until   I    saw its contents melted.               I    found two substances
well separated        ;   the one occupying the bottom                    of   the crucible
was merely melted              sulphuret of     any mixture
                                                      lead,    without
of ductile lead the other presented all the characters of the
                       ;
oxide of lead called glass   lead; this part was combina
                                           of                                  a
tion of oxide and of silex, proceeding from the materials of
the crucible, without any marks                    of sulphate of lead.
     This experiment            proved       that the lead of the galena was
oxidated at the expense of the sulphuric acid but     did                     ;      it
not show the quantity of galena necessary to the complete
decomposition             of   the    sulphate.         1     am    of opinion,       how
ever,    that     the proportion           of   one   part of       the   formeF to two
of   the lattersufficient
                   is       besides,  ; closely resembles the
                                                         it
proportion which  calculation  gives us of the composition of
these substances.
  The following are the natural consequences of these facts:
1st. The galena and the sulphate of lead are mutually de
                                                                                  composed

                         On the Desulphurution of Metals.                          81
      composed at a high temperature. 2d. This decomposition
      gives place to the formation and to the disengagement of a
     great quantity of sulphurous acid, and consequently to the
     separation of a considerable portion of the sulphur contain
     ed in the ore       *. 3d. The result is oxide of lead, when the
     proportions are proper ; and in the contrary case a mixture of
     oxide and of sulphat, or oxide and galena.                    The application
    of     these   consequences to the roasting of the sulphuret of
     lead in this reverberating furnace is very easy. I shall explain
     the theory       of this operation in        the way     1  conceive it.
         The pulverized galena, or the schlich of load, spread out
    upon the floor of the furnace in a layer of a few inches in
    thickness, the upper part of which is exposed to the action,
    produces the phenomena usually observed in the common
    roastings.          The heat vaporises a little sulphur ; the air
   converts that part upon which it acts into sulphurous acid,
   which is liberated ; but a much greater part is converted into
    sulphuric acid, which iscombined with the lead oxidized at the
   same time.        The   ores are stirred ; the sulphate         of lead is mixed
   with      the undccomposed schlich, and their decomposition pro
   duces sulphurous acid          ; the surface        of the layer which        has  .,
   been renewed, reproduces sulphate, which afterwards serves
   to produce a new disengagement of gas, and thus continues
   the desulphuration, to which we find there is no end except
   the complete decomposition             of   the galena.        If the  operation
'has       been well managed, and           if  too much sulphate of lead
   has not been formed,          the result      of   the   roasting wi'.l be al
  most pure oxide of lead; in the                   contrary case, some sul
  phate will probably remain, which charcoal                            will bring
  back to the         state  of sulphuret, and           the  decomposition       of
  which will        take    place like that of          the   galena.     We may
 judge        from this detail, how important it is to avoid melting
  the sulphuret of lead subjected to roasting ; for the action
  of the air upon the melted ore will soon be rendered null by
      • If  we admit that a mixture    of one part of sulphuret and two of sul
 phate      are entirely  decomposed and reduced to oxide of lead, the quan
 tity of sulphur separated will be two.fifths: so that one part of sulphate, in
 an indefinite quantity of galena, will separate one.fifth of sulphur; and one
 •f sulphuret in slilphate will  separate  three.fifths.

    The roasting of galena in          the   reverberating furnace i«
therefore reduced to the conversion of the sulphur which it
contains into sulphurous acid; and            as  it is  produced in a
great measure by the intermedium              of the sulphate of lead
which is continually formed, this          process   admits  of a much
more complete desulphuration than the others.
    The   same decomposition       of  the sulphuret    of lead  by the
sulphate, in my opinion, takes place also in the treatment
 Of the ores of lead in what are called Scotch furnaces : in
 Scotland    they roast and melt galena by one uninterrupted
 operation, employing coal and turf.
    This kind of furnace        is  employed with success        in   the
 mine at Pezey, in melting roasted galena containing at least
 4-
    of its weight of sulphate of lead. It gives ne mattes as
 a final result, which proves that it admits of the decompo
 sition of the sulphate        and   the separation of the sulphur
 contained in it.      I  am   of  opinion that the action of thr
 portion reduced to the state of subphuret by the contact of
 the coals upon the undecomposed sulphate, is one of the
  principal causes of the desulphuration produced.
     We have had occasion to speak of several kinds              of fnr-
  naccs, (the    Fahlun    and Scotch    furnaces   among   the rest,) in,
 which the metallic sulphurets will undergo a real roasting;
  but there are others where this effect is scarcely perceptible.
  I consider the present as a proper opportunity for intro
  ducing some reflections upon the differences they exhibit in
  this respect. They ought to excite the more interest, be
  cause they are intimately connected with            the present sub
 ject,   and   explain   some    phaenomena      which   cannot be ac
  counted for from the way in which the operation            of roasting
  has generally been regarded.
     It is a well-known fact, in foundries, that the highest
  furnaces are those which admit of desulphuration the least,
  or, in the language of the workmen, they produce the most
  mattes.     If  a convincing    proof of this is wanted, it will be
                                                               sufficient

                    On the Desulphuration       of Metals.                49
  sufficient    to mention,      that at Pezey there     have   been    seen
  Toasted   .^res  of   lead,  containing a gceat deal ot sulphate of
  lead,   uit  flux of which, in the Scotch furnace, gave n$>
  mattes, and yet they produce a great quantity when they are
  passed to the common furnace.
     If heat alone decomposes easily and completely the me
 talltc sulphurets, the upper part of the high furnaces wil.
 be very proper for operating the roasting of ores ; for besides
 the temperature being a little elevated, the air which ascends
 to that height, being deprived of a part of its oxygen, form*
 very little more      of  these   sulphates which are opposed to the
 separation of      the sulphur     : but it is quite different,    and in
 my eyes it is a new proof of the little effect of the action of
 caloric alone upon substances. The sulphur is separated
 from the sulphurets, as we have seen, in the state of sul
 phurous acid, and oxygen is indispensable to its formation.
 In furnaces not much raised, the air which touches the ore
 recently thrown         in, still   contains a great deal of oxygen ;
 the sulphurous acid         formed is soon subjected to the deox
idating action of the coals; if there be a small portion of it
decomposed, a new sulphuret is formed, which is afterwards
roasted lik? the mineral. In the Scotch furnace, for example,
when mattes are melted, they are thrown successively into
the furnace, and what has escaped one operation is decom
posed by a second. In high furnaces, on the contrary, the
ores placed in the upper           part undergo but    a very   imperfect
desulphuration, because the air which comes              in contact with
it contains but very little free oxygen, the sulphurous acid
formed in the interior is in a great measure decomposed by
traversing the whole height of the furnace filled with coals,
and    the   sulphuret is recomposed; the latter tends by its
gravity    to gain     the basin, where it does not arrive until
after a series     of decompositions,       wlilch cannot     take   place,
as we have in fact observed, without             there  resulting   a con
siderable loss in metal.
    All  these facts seem to leave no doubt as to the           following
proposition      : The decomposition of        the metallic    sulphurett
by roasting is produced by the oxygenation of its compounds,

§  III. Desulphuration     of the Metals independent of the Action
                               of the Air.
   The   varied affinities  of sulphur lor different mineral sub
stances, furnish     the   means of decomposing certain sul*
phurets   ; and   several   have   been   employed       in  metallurgy
with success.      In order that the decomposition of a metallic
sulphuret by    any  mineral should form the basis of a metal -
lurgic process, it is not sufficient that the affinity of this
mineral for sulphur should be greater than that of the metal ;
it must, besides the conditions required by ceconomy, also
possess several    other requisites absolutely necessary for the
success of the operation, which considerably limit the num
ber of the agents pointed out by chemistry : for instance, if
the sulphuret resulting from the decomposition is not fusible,
or but very little so, if it has the property of combining
with the metal required to be separated, or rather with the
still  undecomposed sulphuret, it is evident that we cannot
effect our purpose, namely, the isolation of the metallic
substance.     Hitherto little else has been used except lime
and iron.
    Desulplutration   of Mercury. — It       is very easy    to decom
pose   the  sulphuret    of mercury     ;  it being sufficient if we
present to the sulphur       a substance      capable of retaining it,
and volatilize the mercury alone.              It is thus that iron and
lime are employed together or separately in the treatment of
the ores of cinnabar.
    Desulphuration of Copper. — Pyritous copper is melted in
3ome foundries with lime, either in the common or in the
reverberating furnace;       but   the   process is not well     enough
known    as yet to enable us to     judge of    the efficacy  of lime  as
an agent in this case.
   I  was once   of opinion,    w'rtb some      metallurgists,  that the
well-known superior affinity of iron for sulphur over that
of copper for    the  same    combustible,      might determine      the
decomposition of the sulphuret       of copper by this mct3l, at least
                                                                      in

                    On the Desulphuration           of Metals.                64
in certain cases. The following experiments, however, did
not warrant me in continuing of this opinion.
    First Experiment. — I made a mixture of ten grammes of
pyritous copper, the composition of which I knew, with four
grammes of iron filings: I put this into a crucible, covered
with charcoal in powder, and heated it in the forge for three
quarters of an hour.           The proportion of the iron had been
calculated so accurately that it was sufficient for taking up all
the sulphur combined with the copper in the mineral em
ployed.       I found in the crucible a perfectly homogeneous
mass, weighing thirteen grammes, which did not contain
the smallest globule of' metallic copper,                nor any appearance
of separation, between the sulphuret                    of iron and that of
copper     *,
    Second     Experiment.     — Another trial       was made by employ
ing ten grammes of pyritous copper and five grammes of the
same roasted mineral. This is nearly the case with the fluxes
in which the ore or         the mattes       arc not completely desulphu-
rated ;     the  proportion       of  the    iron was still sufficient for
separating copper, which was very abundant in the mixture.
I kept up the heat for three quarters of an hour, and found,,
as   in the preceding experiment, a homogeneous mass, with
out any trace of metallic copper, nor of pure sulphuret of
copper ; this was a real matte of copper.
    Third Experiment. —On this occasion an equal mixture
of crude pyritous copper, and roasted copper, dipped in
olive oil, and heated strongly for half an hour in a crucible,
presented      nothing but a powder, which had not undergone
fusion, on account, without doubt, of the superabundance
of the iron.
    I think these few experiments are sufficient for proving
that the desulphuration of copper by means of iron will be
always very difficult, because there is formed a triple com
bination between          the sulphur,       iron and copper, or rather a
combination       between      the sulphnrets of copper and of iron,
which      prevents    the separation      of  the copper.
   * In the decomposition of gnlena by    trow, we observe, when the latter is in
too small quantity,   three distinct substances  of lead, sulphuret of lead, and
lastly, sulphuret of iron in the upper part.

   Desulphuration of Galelia. — This is one of the sulphurctl
which best yields to the decomposition in question ; the fu
sibility of the lead which facilitates its aggregation, as well
as the little affinity it has for sulphur, are the causes of the
successful trials that have been made on this subject.             Lime
and iron are employed in various circumstances in the de-
sulphuration of galena; the use of lime is not very general,
and it is impossible to judge of its effects from what is known
of  the  properties of the sulphuret of lime.             The treatment
of galena   by iron U more in use, and appears more advan~
tageous.
   The  above memoir        will,    I hope, suggest several experi
ments to those who are engaged in metallurgical pursuits.
   All  the experiments         I  have  detailed  were    performed  in
the laboratory belonging to the Council of the Mines, and
under the eyes of M. Descostils, by whose superior judge
ment I profited considerably during the progress of my
labours.

   Mrs. Dennison,        fEtat. 29, has     generally enjoyed a good
state of health till within about eighteen months, when she
had symptoms of dropsy of the ovarium ; the right side of
the abdomen enlarged most, was irregular, and has been
most painful during the continuance of the disease.
   The catamenia stopped about           a year since, when the abdo
                                                                    men

           Report of the City and Finslmry Dispensaries.         87
men enlarged more rapidly, and the health became very
bad   : she was received     into an hospital at the beginning of
the present year, and continued till May in such a weak
state that it was not thought advisable to operate.            Her
health being improved, the operation of paracentesis was
perforr-ed, butAonly about five or six quarts of a very thick
fluid were evacuated, and that with great pain, from the
violent pressure made use of to force it through the canula.
Its passage was naturally slow, and the operation was tedious
in the extreme.
    The inconvenience      she now    (Oct. 21, 1808,) experienced
from the great enlargement of the abdomen, induced her
again to solicit aid from an operation, hoping to experience
more benefit than before.
    The abdomen       was greatly enlarged in every part, but
more so on the        right side, which was unequal, and more
painful.     The fluctuation could not be distinctly felt by
myself, but Dr. Lidderdale thought it was evident.              The
 large-sized trocar was introduced about three inches below
the umbilicus       in the linca alba    ; but the contained matter
 was so thick as to prevent its passing along the canula, and
only about an ounce of a glary substance, as thick as gelly,
 but of a fibrous texture, escaped ; some part of which re
 sembled that kind of caseous          matter frequently   found in
 scropbulous abscesses.
    At   the upper part   of  the  abdomen near the scrobiculus
 cordis,   the undulating    motion of a fluid     was evident, but
 she could not be prevailed upon to be tapped in that part.
    May 1805.— Mrs.             , <;tat. 42. About twelve months
 before this time     she   thought herself pregnant ; but as the
.enlargement of the abdomen was attended with more pain
 than is usual in pregnancy, she applied for advice, and was
 placed under the care of Dr. Pincard, in the Bloomebury
 Dispensary, and was tapped by Mr. Blair ; when only a
 small quantity of a gelly-like substance passed the canula,
 and she died in four days after the operation.
    On opening     the abdomen, the right ovarium reached from
 the pelvis to the scrobiculus cordis, occupying the whole an
  terior part of the abdomen, the viscera of which were ob-

                  DECOMPOSITION        OF THE ALKALIS.
 On      this interesting subject, in addition to what we have
 given in this and our preceding Numhers, we have now to
 state that the French chemists have not only repeated Mr.
                                                                      Davy's

researches,      by obtaining       similar      results by    a  different pro
cess.
    MM.       Gay and Thenard            have     succeeded      in deoxidating
potash       by means of iron.             The      event    is announced in
Correspondance sur I'Ecole Imperials Poly technique,                     No. 10*,
in the following terms :
     "  A  letter from London, dated 23d Nov. 1807, announced
 that   Mr. Davy      had succeeded,       by means of a strong galvanic
pile, in decomposing the two alkalis of potash and soda ;
 and that Mr. Davy had read, to the Royal Society of Lon
don, a memoir, in which he concluded that these two alkalis
 were metallic oxides.
     "On       the   8th   of December,           1807,    Messrs.      Gay and
Thenard repeated at the laboratory of the Polytechnic School
the experiments of Mr. Davy, and actually obtained at the
 negative pole of a pile, with large plates, the two new metals,
 the existence      of which      had    not been even suspected previ
 ously to     Mr. Davy's experiments.
     " The     above two chemists,          however, continued            the    inr
 quiry in a new point of view ; they proposed to themselves
 the discovery of a substance sufficiently oxidizable to take
 off   the oxygen from the alkalis, which had been ascertained                     to
 be metallic oxides, and their experiments were followed                        with
 the greatest success.
     " On     the 7th   of March, 1808, Messrs. Gay                 and Thenard
 informed the Institute of France, that upon treating potash
 wilh iron, in the fire of a reverberating furnace, the iron
 deoxidated      the potash and made          it  pass to the metallic state."

 of seeing the new metal obtained from potash, I repeated, at
 their chemical laboratory, the experiment of Messrs. Gay
 and Thenard,       in  presence    of the   governor to the pages^
 M. d'Assigny.
     "   The apparatus is equally simple with that for the de
 composition of water by means of iron, and every thing
 proceeds in the same way as in this last experiment.           We
 put into a gun-barrel a quantity of iron filings sufficient to
 fill that part of it which was inserted in the furnace :
 caustic potash was introduced into one of its ends not in
 serted in the furnace, and the extremity was luted ; a tube
 of   safety  was   adapted   to the other extremity of the gun-
 barrel, and a strong heat was then applied.
     " The furnace I used upon the occasion was 25 centime
 tres   in diameter, with double blast bellows. While the fur
 nace was strongly heated, I cooled with ice that part of the
 gun-barrel which contained the potash : after continuing a
 strong heat for an hour, I melted the potash by means of a
 emall portable furnace of sheet iron ; the gun-barrel being
a little inclined towards the tube of safety, the fused potash
came in contact with the iron : in an instant the hydrogen
of    its  water of crystallization     was disengaged by the ex-
Jremity of     the tube    of  safety,  which was inserted under
water.
     "   This disengagement of hydrogen is a certain mark of
the success of the experiment.          When it slackens, from the
liquid potash having       cooled  the  iron, we may remove the
small furnace placed under the potash, which keeps it liquid,
and restore     to the   iron the temperature necessary     for re
ceiving new liquid potash.
     "  This last effect is, as we see, completely similar to
what takes place in the decomposition of water ; for if
we pour too much water on the red-hot iron, the metal is
cooled, and the water passes off in vapour without being
decomposed.
     " Before fusing the potash in order to bring it over the
iron, I placed in ice that part of the gun-barrel to which
the tube of safety is adapted, and which serves as a refri
gerant.
                                                              "la

    " In about half an hour from        the moment       at  which   the
potash is fused, the disengagement of hydrogen ceases, and
the operation is concluded.
    " When the furnace       is quite cold, the safety tube is taken
away, and the extremity of the gun-barrel is closed by a
plug. In order to extract the metal, the gun.barrel is cut
at the commencement of the part which has served for a
refrigerant, and the metal (potassium) presents itself in the
form of small brilliant laminae, adhering to the sides of the
gun.barrel : the greatest quantity is found close to the re
frigerant ; another portion is not condensed until it is very
close to the plug of the safety tube : this last portion ad
heres very slightly to the gun.barrel,         and the least effort is
sufficient to detach it   :   it is even partly oxidized by air ad
mitted during the cooling of the furnace ; and when the
whole is received over naphtha, the oxidized part is de
tached   in laminee,  and exposes to view a white ami          brilliant
metallic surface.
    " As   to the portion   of potash condensed nearer the fur
nace, it must be detached by means of a sharp chisel, and
in the largest pieces we can possibly break off; for if it be
in small molecules it inflames in the air, even at a very low
 temperature.     When it cannot be detached in large pieces,
it must be kept in a gas deprived of oxygen, or in naphtha:
it  was by plunging    it in oil that   I extracted   it from the gun-
 barrel.
    "We    also find in the gun-barrel portions        of amalgamated
 iron and potassium; they adhere very          strongly to the part of
 the gun.barrel which occupies the middle of the furnace ;
 they became green in the air, and are easily decomposed :
 the potash   returns in  a very    short time to its first state.
    " In order  to obtain the potassium conveniently,          and on a
 large scale, we must procure a gun-barrel of a large diameter,
 which must be heated throughout a great part of its length,
 and with a tube at its extremity, in which liquid potash is kept.
 This tube must be disposed in such a manner that we may
 be able to let fall whatever quantity      of oxide of liquid potash
 we please ; and we     should volatilize      it before putting it in
                                                                contact

 contact with the iron; we should place another gun-barrel,
in two   pieces, at the extremity of the former ; the barrel
composed of two pieces would serve as a refrigerant, and
could be opened in order to collect the metal."
     Mr. Davy informs         us that he has found the above process
to answer perfectly. The great precaution necessary        that          is,
the potash should be as dry as possible. The metal obtained
is rather heavier than that procured              by
                                        electricity, and seems

                  SUPPLYING CITIES WITH WATER.
   An abundant supply of good water       one of the most in»
                                                    is
dispensable requisites for the cleanliness and health of the
inhabitants of large towns. Till lately, collections of spring
water have been preferred for the purpose of supplying towns
 by   meansof pipes, from its supposed greater purity. But ex
perience  and  the progress of science have proved that spring
water    far inferior to river water for this purpose.
        is                                               River
water contains impurities visible to the eyes. — spring water
.contains them     in   a   state   of   actual   solution,   and   therefor?
invisible.     From     the    former the         impurities will separate
themselves almost entirely,              by   rest or    by filtration; from
the latter they cannot be separated               by   means adapted     to the
demands of common life.
     London, which    extremely healthy for its size, has long
                        is
been supplied with river water, and to this, more than to
any other circumstance, are the inhabitants indebted for the
liealth they enjoy, though few of them ever take the trouhle
to filter the water they use, even for culinary purposes. The
city of Glasgow, which, till lately, had no supply of water
but from wells*, has at length the prospect                    of   an    inex-
   • Dr. Ure, of Glasgow, has, we understand, been lately occupied in ana
lysing the wells and mineral waters m the neighbourhood of that city. Thy
former have been found to contain    asurprising quantity of heterogeneous
matters in solution.  We hope the Doctor will publish his analyses.
                                                                    baustible

haustible supply from the river Clyde by means of pipes and
steam engines.       Two companies have embarked in similar
undertakings.       One of them, under the direction of Mr.
Thomas Telford, civil engineer, undertakes to bring in a
large supply from the eastward of the town; the other, un
der the direction of       Mr. Robertson Buchanan, ^civil engi
neer, to bring in a similar supply from the westward.
     Both works are in considerable forwardness, and many
houses are already supplied with pipes : but the circumstance
which demands most attention from            the public, and which is
our principal reason for mentioning these undertakings, is the
 filtration of the whole supply of water, by means of reservoirs
constructed for the purpose. This salutary process is effected
by making the water filter through sand and gravel from the
large reservoir into which it is first elevated by the steam
engine, into a second reservoir posited a little lower, and from
which the conveying-pipes          receive  their supply.
     This is the first instance    we believe that has yet occurred
of water being filtered      on so large a scale ; and when its ad
 vantages,    nol only   to  the  health of the inhabitants, but to
bleachers, dyers, and other manufacturers, are duly consi-
dered, we cannot doubt that it will be adopted in all future
 undertakings for supplying towns with water. Hitherto all
 branches of manufacture connected with             the  use   of water
 have been obliged to be carried to the water,          and the neces
 sary hands along with them, and much expense               for carriage
 and extra labour has been added to the price.             But, should
 this system become general, manufactures will be carried on
 where the necessary supply of labourers can be most easily
 procured, and the goods find the most ready market.
     We believe   that the filtration    of water intended for public
 supply was first practised by a private individual at Paisley.
 This public-spirited adventurer was amply remunerated for
 his expenditure ; and we cannot doubt that similar specula
 tions on a larger scale, if properly conducted, will yield au
 ample return to the first subscribers. — We hope the example
 which has thus been given will be followed by public.spirited
 individuals    ia other    large   towns.    Its benefits  would soon.

   Sir, —-When     I  computed the ephemeris of Vesta, which
I sent to you last month, I had not at that time reduced
any of my late observations ; and I calculated the place of
the planet, from      the   elements    obtained, near         the   former
opposition.   On reducing those of the present year, I found
a considerable change in the place of the node, which affect
ed the latitude, and of course the declination. The quantity
of this change I cannot at present ascertain ; but having
again computed the ephemeris, which agrees with the late
observations ; and also laid down in the chart, all the stars
to the seventh magnitude which are near the path of the,
planet, (very few of which are contained in any catalogue,)
the place of the object may be very readily found, by those
who have instruments on an equatorial stand.
                         I remain your obedient servant,
   To Mr. Tilloch.                                 S.  Groombridge.

naked eye.    It is at present in the girdle of the constellation
Andromeda,     which is distinguished by three stars forming
a curve;  the brightest is of the second magnitude, called

     A   number    of the provincial     newspapers have of late
  had paragraphs respecting meteors. On comparing the
  accounts, thty seem all to refer to the same meteor, seen
  at places very remote    from each other, and, in all, at nearly
  the same instant    of time, viz.   a few minutes before eight
  o'clock P. M. Monday the 1 7th of October.          It passed in a
  north.easterly   direction,  and  apparently at no great altitude;
  but its real altitude must have been immense, or it would
  not have been seen in so many remote places at the same
  instant — It was seen as far north as Aberdeen, and as far
  south as Hull.      Its apparent diameter was somewhat less
  than the moon,      and in some places it seemed to have a tail
  throwing off coruscations of great brilliancy. It diffused a
  most vivid pale light, and was visible in its progress for a
  few seconds.

                                To
       SIR,
AT     has      been    observed,       that     "
                                 we are better painters and
worse architects than our neighbours the French :" but I
presume, that, of our architectural ability, it is difficult to
form adequate notions ; because in England many of the best
specimens are distributed about the country, and there
fore too far removed from each other to form a grand whole ;
whereas the contrary is the case in France. There, the go
vernment does every thing, and the individual scarcely any
thing; her architecture is consequently more public. Hence,
perhaps, it is that those who visit France, and compare the
talents of her architects with our own, forget the praise
which is due to England, where almost every thing is done
by the individual, and comparatively nothing by the govern
ment. That therefore which is done by him must be some
what limited   for it is by public works alone that real splen
                   ;
dour can be exhibited in architecture. Its operations are too
expensive for individual accomplishment, and of course be
yond the reach            of   that patronage which                  is,   and has been,
extended        to its promotion elsewhere.                    Is   it   then to be in
ferred, because there    poverty of public patronage, that
                               is   a
our architects want talent   Certainly not — let them be
                                            ?                           !
sure of employ,    they excel in taste, and no comparison
                         if
tending to raise one  an at the expense of another, will be
regarded. Whether the present times, which are warm in
the patronage of painting, will give rise to more liberal no
tions in architecture, cannot yet be known but, at any rate,        ;
there will be found no want of talent in this latter branch of
art,   if   a   sufficient stimulus             arises adequately           to employ it.
But our neighbours say,             that "        we have no taste for design            l"
and they refer our supposed                     want of    it   to national       causes.
Itwould be singular indeed    we, who excel if    poetry, in                in
painting, and in sculpture, (who even equal the antients in
these arts,   originality be admitted as the claim to equa
                 if
lity,) should in design              he defective          —

asked, Does   require more abilities to excel in design, than

in   thepractice of the other arts ? — No ! the greatest pro
fessors of them all have been also the greatest designers.
Is it not then fair to infer, that they who have excelled in the
one would likewise excel in the other                          if equally    employed ?
    If these assumptions be admitted, the                                  conclusion is,
that our supposed inferiority in this art is not to be at
tributed to      "
              national causes," or to " want of talent," but
to the absence of national discernment,                              which       creates       dis«
gust, and neglects to distinguish                        those    who by their taste
deserve public             patronage.         The French           excel us in this
discernment     any judgement c.m be justly formed of their
                     (If
new buildings); and this assertion will be borne out      all                               by
\vho have had an opportunity of viewing their capital during
the peace of Amiens. A Gallery.advocate may perhaps
answer,        "And        do not our     nobility,         to whom the arts alone
can look for patronage, extend                      it   liberally   ?  Have they not
established  British Institution
                a                                   ;    and     do they not     their by
munificence add            a   real value to its establishment,                       by   select*
ing and purchasing the best performances that arc therein
exhibited ?" Granted — But this has advanced one or twd
                                     :
branches of art only and has left the architect, whose ad
                                 ;
vancement forms                the purpose of this paper,         state of   in    a
total neglect. No              reflection can attach to the institution                          :
it has done immense service to the arts                          ;   and    it   is   only re
gretted, that, from the known liberality of its promoters,
they should not have adopted some mode of giving equal
encouragement to architecture.
     At Athens,       the birth.place           of the arts, architecture                   stood
the^«< in importance, as    did   perfection and glory — to
                                         it          in                                    :
expect Athenian encouragement in England may appear vain;
but       species of vanity which some have cherished, and
      it   is
           a
many expected to realize when that noble establishment was
first formed. —The beauties of this art are not confined to the
operations of the mere rule and compass, as some have ima
gined  ;nor are her greatest attributes, the orders, formed to
arbitrary proportions, as some have asserted.         would be               It
difficult indeed to fix on what those proportions consisted for                             ;
in all the remains of antiquity no two are found to be exactly
similar    ;   the required purpose alone directed the architect in
                                                                the

the    choice of his column.                 At Athens, for instance, the
columns      of the Parthenon, of Minerva, and of Theseus, all
differ, though the attributes of the several classes remain t
and the same may be observed of other remains.                            At the
restoration of the art,             Italy abounded in splendid relies,
which furnished          the restorers      with models     ;  hence arose the
notions     of seven, eight,         and nine diameters to express             the
proportions        of the several orders, Doric, Ionic, and Co
rinthian; which, having been published, spread soon through
the other nations of Christendom.                     "Now, as it fell to the
lot  of more      persons    to see the copies than the originals, that
proportion was received for certain, which had been adapted
for   convenience only. From such copies have all the arbitrary
notions concerning architecture been derived. Books after
books*, with various high-sounding titles, had issued from
the pre^s, all setting forth the boasted proportions : hence
the principles of the art became degraded to a mere under-
ttanding of the division of the parts ; and in ihis state it re
mained       till   travel   and     study    developed      the   source    from,
which amient architecture emanated. And let it ever he
recorded to the honour of the society called Dilettanto,                       and
to their travellers       Stuart and Reveley, that to them England,
nay Europe,           is indebted        for the genuine representation
of Grecian architecture. However glorious for the art the
disclosure of the Grecian remains might have been, some,
bigoted to the Roman manner, vented their zeal by denying
their accuracy        :  but  as  truth and beauty are superior to error
and deformity,          so have they risen above the prejudice of
their opponents.
    In England,         every thing is said to be a speculation ; and
with     respect   to   the  arts, in general, it has in truth been too
much so      :  by the prevalence of this spirit they have suf
fered even        more than by caprice.             Speculation has made
many of their professors intent more upon riches than emi
nence. The glory of their, art has been thus perverted, and
its legitimate purpose prostituted ; nor has architecture suf-
   * * Wei* a modern architect,"
                                        says Hogarth,
                                                       " to build a palace in Lap

fered less than the sister arts.            Such has been the perversion
in this art,    to which its professors have contributed largely,
that our villas, mansions, &c., have been metamorphosed ;
and, in too many instances, columns have been dismantled
and entablatures overthrown, to be replaced by a battle-
mented porch, a tower, or some other device from a Gothic
model.  By this daemon of innovation have some of our
most regular structures been destroyed ; and others con
tinue to be destroyed, to place in their stead a melange style,
adapted neither to give comfort nor elegance to the habitation
of man. That such a fashion should obtain a footing in onr
island at the present period of mental improvement, is not
to be accounted for upon the common principles of human
measurement. That our nobility, who affect to admire
every thing that is Grecian, should, instead of encouraging
classic architecture, surround themselves with pinnacles
and stained glass, the emblems of superstition and iguo-
rance, (and with these, too, of the most stupid and clumsy
imitation, without pretension to the character or chasteness
of    the   original,) will viewed, it is to be hoped, with
                                  be
astonishment at a period not very remote. Good taste has
its foundation in good sense ; but there is not much of either
in giving     to a modern gentleman's residence                 the   form of
an abbey or     of   a   castle   :   — fitness    should be the end ; but
this practice stands opposed to                   it,
                                    for that cannot be fit
ness which erects  towers and constructs forts, where nei
ther protection nor observation are necessary or anticipated.
A   statistical writer, speaking of this practice, says, he
"  would suggest the impropriety of making      house or anya
other object bear an outward appearance intended to contra
dict its inward use all castellated or gnthicised houses, all
                          ;
church-like bams, or fort-like pig-styes, he should con
ceive to be objectionable*              they are intended to deceive, and
they tell you that they are intended to deceive."      from       It   is
such practice as this, without principles, and consequently
capricious, that architecture has fallen, not only in com
parison with the sister arts, but likewise in public estima
tion  ;and    will continue so to do until its professors aim
               it
at   a   reputation more lasting than can be obtained                 by    such

     V. On    the Properties and Nature           of the Basis of Soda.
 J.  he  basis  of   soda,    as  I  have already mentioned,       is a solid
at common temperatures.                It   is white,  opaque,    and when
examined under         a film of naphtha has the lustre and gene^r
ral appearance      of silver. It is exceedingly malleable, and is
much softer than any of the common metallic substances.
When pressed upon by a platina blade, with a small force,
it spreads into thin leaves, and a globule of the -r^th or -^th
of an inch in diameter is easily spread over a surface of a
quarter of an inch *, and this property does not diminish
when it is cooled to 32° Fahrenheit.
    It conducts electricity         and heat in a similar manner to the
basis   of potash;        and    small globules of it inflame by the
voltaic electrical spark, and burn with bright explosions.
    Its specific gravity is less than that of water. It swims
in oil of   sassafras    of ro°6, water being           one,   and  sinks in
   * Globules may be easily made to adhere and form one mass by strong
pressure : so that the property of welding, which belongs to iron and platina
at a white heat only, is possessed by this substance at common temperatures.

102           On the Decomposition and Composition
naphtha of specific gravity .861. This circumstance enabled
me to ascertain the point with precision.           I mixed together
oil of sassafras and naphtha, which combine very perfectly,
observing the proportions till I had composed a fluid, in
which it remained at rest above or below ; and this fluid
consisted of nearly twelve parts naphtha, and five of oil of
sassafras, which gives a specific gravity to that of water,
nearly as nine to ten, or more accurately as '9348 to 1.
    The   basis  of  soda has a much higher point      of fusion than
the balls of potash ; its parts begin to lose their cohesion at
about 120° Fahrenheit, and it is a perfect fluid at about 180°,
so that it readily fuses under boiling naphtha.
     I have not yet been able to ascertain at what degree      of  heat
it  is volatile;  but it remains fixed    in a state of ignition at
the point of fusion of plate glass.
    The chemical phenomena produced by the basis              of soda,
are analogous to those produced by the basis          of potash ; but
 with such characteristic differences as might be well expected.
     When the basis of soda is exposed to the atmosphere, it'
 immediately tarnishes, and by degrees becomes covered with
 a white crust, which deliquesces         much more slowly than
 the substance which forms on the basis of potash. It proves,
 on minute examination,         to be pure soda.
     The   basis  of   soda   combines   with    oxygen slowly, and
 without luminous appearance         at all common temperatures ;
 and when heated, this combination            becomes     more rapid ;
 but no light       is emitted till it has acquired     a  temperature
 nearly that    of ignition.
     The  flame that it produces in oxygen gas is white,         and  it
  sends forth bright sparks, occasioning       a very beautiful effect j
 in common air, it burns with light           of the colour of (hat
  produced during        the  combustion    of charcoal, but much
  brighter.
     The  basis  of   soda   when heated    in hydrogen seemed to
  have no action upon it. When introduced into oxymuriatic
  acid gas, it burnt vividly with numerous .scintillations of a
  bright red colour. Saline matter was formed in this com
  bustion,   which,     as might have been expected, proved to be
  muriate of soda.
                                                                     Itt

                           of the fixed    Alkalis.                     103
    Its operation upon water offers most satisfactory evidence
of its nature. When thrown upon this fluid, it produces a
violent effervescence, \*ith a loud hissing noise ; it combines
with the oxygen of the water to form soda, which is dis
solved, and its hydrogen is disengaged. In this operation
there is no luminous appearance ; and it seems probable that
even in the nascent state hydrogen is incapable of combining
with it*.
    When the      basis  of soda   is thrown into hot water,        the de
composition is more violent, and in this case a few scintil
lations are generally observed at the surface of the fluid ; but
this is owing to small particles of the basis, which are
thrown out of the water sufficiently heated, to burn in pass
ing through      the atmosphere.          When, however, a globule i»
brought in contact with a small particle of water, or with
moistened paper, the heat produced (there being no medium
to carry it off rapidly) is usually sufficient for the accension
of   the basis.
    The  basis   of  soda acts upon alcohol and ether precisely in
a similar manner        witli the basis    of potash.     The water that
they contain is decomposed            ;  soda  is rapidly   formed, and
hydrogen disengaged.
    The  basis   of  soda,   when thrown upon the strong acids,
acts upon them with great energy.               When nitrous acid is
employed,      a  vivid inflammation is produced ; with muriatic
and    sulphuric acid, there is much heat generated, but no
light.
    When plunged, by proper means,               beneath   the surface    of
the acids, it is rapidly oxygenated ; soda is produced, and
the other educts are similar to those generated by the action
of  the basis   of potash.
    With    respect to the fixed and volatile oils and naphtha            in
their different states, there is a perfect coincidence between

104           On the Decomposition and Composition
of the  basis  of  soda being    of  a  darker colour, and apparently
less soluble.
   The   basis  of soda, in its degrees of oxidation, has pre
cisely similar habits with the basis of potash.
   When it is fused with dry soda, in certain quantities,
there is a division     of oxygen   between the alkali and the base ;
and a deep brown fluid is produced, which becomes a dark
gray solid on cooling, and which attracts oxygen from the
air, or which decomposes water, and becomes soda.
   The   same body is often formed in the analytical processes
of decomposition,        and it is generated when the basis      of soda
is fused in tubes of the purest plate glass.
   There is scarcely any difference in the visible phasnomena
of the agencies of the basis of soda, and that of potash on
sulphur, phosphorus, and the metals.
   It combines with sulphur in close vessels rilled with              the
vapour of naphtha with great vividness, with light, heat,
and often with explosion from the vaporization of a por
tion  of sulphur,     and the disengagement of sulphuretted hy
drogen gas.     The    sulphuretted basis of soda is of a deep gray
colour.
   The phosphuret        has the appearance       of lead,   and   forms
phosphate    or' soda by exposure       to air, or by combustion.
   The   basis  of  soda in the quantity      of T's., renders mercury
a fixed  solid of   the colour    of silver, and the combination is
attended   with   a  considerable degree of heat.
   It makes an alloy with tin, without changing its colour,
and   it acts upon lead and gold when heated.                I have not
examined its habitudes'         with any other metals, but in its
state  of alloy    it is soon converted into soda by exposure to
air, or by the action of water, which it decomposes with the
evolution of hydrogen.
   The amalgam of mercury and the basis of soda seems to
form triple compounds with other metals. I have tried iron
and plaiina, which I am inclined to believe remain in com
bination   with the mercury, when it is deprived            of  the new
substance by exposure to air.
   The amalgam of         the  basis   of soda and mercury likewise"
                                                              combines

VI.     On the Proportions of the peculiar Bases and Oxygen m
                              Potask and Soda.
    The facility of combustion of the bases of the alkalis, and
the readiness       with which      they   decomposed      water, offered
means fully adequate for determining the proportions                of their
ponderable constituent parts.
    I shall mention the general methods            of the experiments,
and the      results   obtained by the different series, which ap
proach as near to each other as can be expected in operations
performed on such small quantities of materials.
    For the     process in oxygen gas, I employed glass tubes
containing      small    trays made of thin leaves of silver or other
noble metals, on which the substance to be burnt, after
being accurately weighed or compared with a globule of
mercury, equal in size *, was placed : the tube was small at
one end, curved, and brought to a fine point, but suffered
to remain open ; and the other end was fitted to a tube com
municating with a gasometer, from which the oxygen gas
was introduced, for neither water nor mercury could be
used for filling the apparatus.          The oxygen gas was carried
through the tube till it was found that the whole of the com
mon air was expelled. The degree of its purity was ascer
tained by suffering a small quantity to pass into the mer
 curial apparatus.          The lower orifice was then hermetically
 sealed by      a spirit lamp, and the upper part drawn out and
finally    closed,   when the aperture was so small, as to render
the temperature employed incapable of materially influencing
the volume of the gas ; and when the whole arrangement
 was made, the combination was effected by applying heat to
 the glass in contact with the metallic tray.
     In performing         these  experiments many difficulties          oc-
    * When the globules were very small, the comparison with
                                                                    mercurv,
 which may be quickly made by means of a micrometer, was generally em
ployed as the means of ascertaining the weight : for in this case the globule
ribuld be immediately introduced   into the tube, and the weight of mercury
 lucerttined at leisure.
                                                                    curred.

 105           On  tine  Decomposition and Composition
curred.     When the       flame     of the lamp was immediately
brought     to play upon       the glass, the combustion     was very
vivid, so as sometimes to break the tube ; and the alkali ge
nerated partly rose in white fumes, which were deposited
upon the glass.
   When the temperature was slowly raised, the bases of the
alkalis acted upon the metallic tray and formed alloys, and
in this state it was very difficult to combine them with their
full proportion of oxygen;            and glass alone could not be
employed on account           of  its decomposition by the alkaline
bases ; and porcelain        is so bad a conductor    of heat, that it
was not possible to raise it to the point required for the pro
cess, without softening the glass.
   In all  cases the globules      of  the  alkaline bases were care
fully freed from naphtha         before they were introduced ; of
course   a slight crust of     alkali was formed before the com
bustion,    but this could not materially affect the result ; and
when such a precaution was not used, an explosion gene
rally took place from the vaporization and decomposition of
the film of naphtha surrounding the globule.
   After the combustion, the absorption of gas was ascer
tained, by opening the lower point of the tube under water
or mercury.      In some cases the purity of the residual air
vjJ& ascertained, in others the alkali formed in the tray was
weighed.
   From several experiments on the synthesis of potash by
combustion, I shall select two, which were made with every
possible attention to accuracy, and under favourable circum
stances, for a mean result.
   In  the first experiment 0-      12  grains of the basis were em
ployed.      The combustion was         made upon platina, and was
rapid and complete ; and the basis appeared to be perfectly
saturated, as no disengagement of hydrogen took place when
the platina tray was thrown into water. The oxygen gas
absorbed equalled in volume igo grain measures of quick
silver ; barometer being at 29-6 inches, thermometer 62°
Fahrenheit ; and this reduced to a temperature of 60° Fahr
enheit, and under       a pressure    equal lo that indicated  by 36
                                                              inches,

inches*, would            become       186-67   measures,    the weight      of
which would be about -0            1S 1  grains troy f, but -0 1 84 : • 1 384i :
 13-29 : 100; and according to this estimation 100 parts of
(potash will consist of 86-7 basis, and 13-3 oxvgen nearly.
     In the second experiment -07 grains of the basis absorbed
 at temperature 63° of Fahrenheit, and under pressure equal
 to 30- l barometer inches, a quantity of oxygen equal in.
 volume to 121 grain measures of mercury, and the proper
 corrections being made as in the former case, this gas would
 weigh -01189 grains.
      But as -07 + ,01189 = '08189:07 : : 100; 85-48 nearly,
 and 100 parts of potash will consist of 85-5 of basis and
 14-5 of oxygen nearly.               And the mean of the two experi
 ments will be 86-1 of basis to 13-9 of oxygen for loo parts.
      In the most accurate experiment that I made on the com
 bustion of the basis of soda -08 parts of the basis absorbed
 a quantity      of oxygen       equal to 206 grain      measures of mer
 cury     ; the thermometer            being at 563 Fahrenheit ; and the
  barometer at 29-4         ;  and this quantity, the corrections being
  made      as before      for the      mean    temperature and       pressure,
 equals about -02 grains of oxygen.
      And as -08 + -02 = -10: '08, : ': 100 : 80, and 100 part*
  of soda according to this estimation will consist of 80 basis
  to 20 of oxygen.
       In all cases of slow combustion, in which the alkalis were
  not carried out of the tray, I found a considerable increase
  of weight; but        as   it was impossible to weigh them except in
  the atmosphere,          the moisture attracted      rendered the results
  doubtful ; and the proportions from the weight of the oxy
  gen absorbed are more to be depended on.                    In the experi
  ments in which the processes              of weighing   were most speedi
     ** In the correction for temperature, the estimations of Dalton and Gay
  Lussac are taken, which make gases expand about yjj of the primitive vo.
  lume for every degree of Fahrenheit.
      f From experiments that I made in 1799, on the specific gravity of oxygea
  gas, it would appear that its weight is to that of water as 1 to 748, and to
   that of quicksilver as 1 to 10142. Researches Chum, ;md Phil, p 9 ; and with
  this estimation, that deducible from the late accurate researches of Messrs.
   Allen and Pepys on the Combustion of the Diamond almost precisely agrees.
   Phil. Trans.  1807,  p. 275.

  108         On the Decomposition and Composition
 ly performed, and in which no alkali adhered to the tube,
 the basis of potash gained nearly two parts for ten, and that
 of soda between three and four parts.
    The results of   the decomposition      of water by the       bases  of
 the alkalis were much more         readily and    perfectly obtained
than those of their combustion.
    To check the rapidity of the process, and, in the case of
potash, to prevent any of the basis from being dissolved, I
employed the amalgams with mercury.                  I   used   a   known
weight of the bases, and made the amalgams under naph
tha, using about two parts of mercury in volume to one of
basis.
    In the first instances    I placed the amalgams under            tubes
filled with naphtha, and inverted in glasses of naphtha, and
slowly admitted water to the amalgam at the bottom of the
glass ; but this precaution I soon found unnecessary, for the
action of the water was not so intense but that the hydrogen
gas could be    wholly collected.
    I shall give an account of the most accurate experiments
made on the decomposition of water by the bases of potash
and soda.
    In an experiment on the basis       of potash conducted with
every   attention  that  I could   pay to  the minutiae of the ope
rations, hydrogen gas, equal in volume to 298 grains of
mercury, were disengaged by the action of '03 grains of the
basis   of  potash   which    had   been   amalgamated       with about
three grains   of mercury.       The thermometer         at the     end of
the process indicated a temperature         of  56° Fahrenheit,        and
the barometer an atmospheric pressure equal to 29-6 inches.
    Now this quantity of hydrogen* would require for its
combustion     a  volume of oxygen gas about equal to that oc
cupied by 154.9 grains of mercury, which gives the weight
of oxygen required      to saturate the .08 grains      of  the basis   of
potash   at the mean temperature and          pressure    nearly .0151
grains. And .08 + .0151 = '0951 : .08 : :           100: 84.1 nearly.
    And according to these indications 100 parts of potash
coasist of about 84 basis and 16 oxygen.

   In an experiment on the decomposition of water by the
basis of soda, the mercury in the barometer standing at
30.4 inches, and in the thermometer at 52D Fahrenheit, the
volume of hydrogen gas evolved by the action            of .054 grains
of basis equalled that of 326 grains of quicksilver.              Now
this at the mean temperature and pressure would require for
its conversion into water, .0172 of oxygen, and .054 +
•0172   = '0712    : '054 : : 100  :  76 nearly ; and according       to
these indications,     100 parts     of  soda   consist  of nearly    76
basis, and 24 oxygen.
   In another experiment made with very great care, .052 of
the basis of soda were used; the mercury in the barometer
was at 29.9 inches, and that in the thermometer at 58° Fah
renheit.    The volume of hydrogen evolved was equal to that
of  302 grains    of mercury ; which would demand for its sa
turation by combustion, at the mean temperature and pres
sure, '01549 grains of oxygen; and 100 parts of soda, ac
cording to this proportion, would consist nearly of 77 basis,
and 23 oxygen.
   The experiments which have been just detailed, are those
in which the largest quantities of materials were employed ;
I  have compared their results, however,           with the results    of
several   others, in which      the    decomposition     of water was
performed with great care, but in which the proportion of
the bases was still more minute : the largest quantity of ox
ygen indicated by these experiments was, for potash 17, and.
for soda 26 parts in 100, and the smallest 13, and 19; and
comparing all the estimations, it will probably be a good
approximation to the truth, to consider potash as composed
of about six parts basis and one of oxygen; and soda, as
 consisting of seven basis and two oxygen.
VII.   Some general Observations        on the Relations   of the Bases
                of Potash and Soda to other Bodies.
    Should    the bases   of potash and       soda   be called metals   ?
The   greater   number of philosophical        persons to whom      this
question has      been   put, have     answered    in the affirmative.
They   agree with metals in opacity, lustre, malleability,         con»
                                                                ducting

   110            On tlie Decomposition and Composition
  ducting powers as to heat and electricity, and in their quali
  ties of chemical combination.
      Their low specific gravity does not appear a sufficient rea
  son for making them a new class ; for amongst the metals
  themselves there are remarkable differences in this respect,
  platinn being nearly four times as heavy as tellurium*; and
  in  the philosophical division of the classes of bodies, the
  analogy between the greater number of properties must al
  ways be the foundation of arrangement.
     On this idea, in naming the bases of potash and soda, it
  will be proper to adopt the termination which, by common
  consent, has been applied to other newly discovered metals,
  and which, though originally Latin, is now naturalized in.
  our language.
     Potasium and sodium are the names by which I have ven
 tured to call the two new substances : and whatever changes
 of theory, with        regard to the composition         of bodies, may
 hereafter take       place,    these  terms can scarcely express an
 error ; for they may be considered as implying simply the
 metals produced from potash and soda. I have consulted
 with many of the most eminent scientific persons in thre
 country, upon the methods of derivation, and the one I
 have adopted has been the one most generally approved, ft
 is perhaps more significant than elegant. But it was not
 possible to found names upon specific properties not com
 mon to both ; and though a name for the basis of soda might
 have been borrowed from the Greek, yet an analogous one
 could not have been applied to that of potash, for the an-
 tients do not seem to have distinguished between the two
 alkalis.
     The more caution         is necessary in avoiding any theoretical
 expression    in   the   terms,   because the new electro-chemical
phenomena          that    are daily   becoming      disclosed, seem di-
    * Tellurium i« not much more than six times as heavy as the basil of •' . ! ,.
There is great reason to believe that bodies of a similar chemical nature to
the bases of potash and soda will be found of intermediate specific gravities
between them and the lightest of the common metals. 0f this
                                                               subiect 1 shall
treat again in the tcit in some of the following pages,
                                                                    stinctly

Btinctly to show that the mature time for a complete gene
ralization of chemical facts is yet far distant ; and though,
in    the explanations        of the various results of experiments that
have been detailed, the autiphlogistic                 solution  of the     phae-
nomena has been                uniformly adopted,         yet the motive for
employing it has been rather a sense of its beauty and pre
cision, than a conviction of its permanency and truth.
      The discovery of the agencies of the gases destroyed the
 hypothesis of Stahl.               The knowledge of the powers and
effects of the ethereal substances may at a future time pos
sibly act       a similar part with regard to the more refined and
ingenious hypothesis of Lavoisier ; but in the present state
of our knowledge, it appears the best approximation that
 has been made to a perfect logic                of chemistry.
       Whatever future         changes     may take place in theory,         there
 seems however every reason to believe that the metallic bases
 of the alkalis,         and   the common          metals, will stand in the
 same       arrangement of          substances     ; and   as yet we have no
 good reasons for assuming the compound nature of this class
 of bodies *.
       The experiments in which it is said that alkalis, metallic
 oxides, and earths may be formed from air and water alone,
 in     processes of vegetation, have been always made in an in
 conclusive manner            f;   for distilled water, as 1 have endea
                                                                          voured
      • A phlogistic chemical theory might certainly be defended, On the idea
 that the metals arc compounds of certain unknown bases with the same mat
 ter as that existing in hydrogen ; and the metallic oxides, alkalis and acMs
 compounds of the same bases with water ;— but in this theory more unknown
 principles would be assumed than in the generally received theory. It would
  be less elegant and less distinct. In my first experiments on the distillation of
  the basis of potash finding hydrogen generally produced, I was led to com
  pare the phlogistic hypothesis with the new facts, and I found it fully ade
  quate to the explanation. More delicate researches however afterwards proved
  that in the cases when inflammable gases appeared, water, or some body in
  which hydrogen is admitted to exist, was present.

  in the growth of the willow, was completely overturned by the researches of

     In   the common processes          of Nature,    all the products of
living beings may be easily conceived to be elicited from
known combinations of matter. The compounds of iron, of
 the alkalis, and earths, with mineral acids, generally abound
in soils. From the decomposition of basaltic, porphyritic f»
and granitic rocks, there is a constant supply of earthy al
kaline and fertuginous materials to the surface of the earth.
In the sap of all plants that have been examined, certain
neutrosaline compounds, containing potash, or soda, or
iron, have been found. From plants they may be supplied
to animals. And the chemical tendency of organization
seems to be rather to combine substances                into more compli
cated and diversified arrangements, than to reduce them into
simple elements.
case  of vegetation in which the free atmosphere was excluded, the seeds grew
in white sand, which is stated to have been purified by washing in muriatic
acid ; but such a process was insufficient to deprive it of substances which
might afford carbon, or various inflammable matters. Carbonaceous matter
exists in several stones which afford a whitish or grayish powder ; and when
in  a stone  the quantity of carbonate of lime is very small in proportion to
the other earthy ingredients, it is scarcely acted on by acids.
   • Balcerian Lecture, 1806, page 8.
   f  In the year 1804, for a particular purpose of geological inquiry, I made
an analysis of the porcelain clay of St. Stevens, in Cornwall, which results
from the decomposition of the feldspar of fine.grained granite.      I could not
detect in it the smallest quantity of alkali.  In making some experiments on
specimens of the undecompounded rock taken from beneath the surface,
there were evident indications of the presence of a fixed alkali, which seemed
to be potash. So that it is very probable that the decomposition depends on
the operation of water and the carbonic acid of the atmosphere on the alkali
forming a constituent part of the crystalline matter of the feldspar, which
may disintegrate from being deprived of it.

JL HE facts and results intended to be communicated in this
paper,      are founded upon observations made, during the pre
sent winter,      at    the cotton-manufactory               of Messrs. Philips
and Lee       at Manchester,          where the light obtained by the
combustion       of    the gas from coal is used    large    upon a very
scale ;     the apparatusits production and application
                                for
having been prepared by me at the works of Messrs. Eoul-
ton, Watt, and Co., at Soho.
  The whole of           the rooms         of this cotton.mill, which               is,
                                                                                     I
believe, the most extensive in the united kingdom, as well
as its counting-houses and store-rooms, and the adjacent
dwelling-house of Mr. Lee, are lighted with the gas from
coal. The total quantity of light used during the hours of
burning, has been ascertained,                  by
                                     comparison of shadows,
                                                    a
to be about equal to the light which 2500 mould candles of
six in the pound would give       each of the candles, with
                                                ;
which the comparison was made, consuming at the rate of
4.l0ths of an ounce (175 grains) of tallow per hour.
   The quantity of light  necessarily liable to some varia
                                 is

to he perfectly equal at all times but the admirable pre

cision and exactness with which the business of this mill                                 is
conducted,   afforded as excellent an opportunity of making

a particular description       of         employed for pro
                                    the apparatus
ducing the gas; but I may observe generally, that the coal
is distilled in large iron retorts, which during the winter
season are kept constantly at  work, except during the in
tervals of charging ; and that the gas, ;is it rises from them,
is conveyed by iron pipes into large reservoirs, or gasome
ters, where it is washed and purified, previous to its being
conveyed through other pipes, called mains, to the mill.
These mains branch off into             a variety    of ramifications (form
ing   a total   length of several miles),           and diminish in size, a»
the quantity of gas required to be passed through them be
comes less.   The burners, where the gas is consumed, are
connected with the above mains, by short tubes, each of
which is furnished with a cock to regulate the admission of
the gas to each burner, and to shut it totally off when re
quisite.  This latter operation may likewise be instantane
ously performed, throughout the whole of ihe burners in
each room,   by turning a cock, with which each main is
provided, near its entrance into the room.
   The burners arc of two kinds ; the one is upon the prin
ciple of the Argand lamp, and resembles it in appearance;
tjle other is a small curved tube with a conical end, having
three circular apertures or perforations, of about a thirtieth
of    an inch   in diameter,    one at the point             of    the       cone, and
two  lateral ones, through which the gas issues, forming
three divergent jets of flame, somewhat like a fleur-de-lis.
The shape and general appearance of this tube has pro
cured     it,   among the workmen,             the name           of    the cockspur
burner.
     The number of burners employed                     in   all       the   buildings
amounts to 271 Argands,              and 633 cockspurs             ;    each      of the
former giving      a   light equal to that     of four       candles         of   the de
scription above mentioned    and each of the latter,
                                    ;                    light                    a
equal to two   and    quarter
                          a    of the same candles; making
therefore the total of the gas light   little more than equal
                                                    a
to that of 2500 candles. When thus regulated, the whole
of the above burners require an hourly supply of 1250 cubic
feet of the gas produced from cannel coal      the superior        ;
                                                                                  quality

  quality and quantity of the gas produced from that material
 having given it a decided preference in this situation, over
 every other coal, notwithstanding           its higher price.
    The time during which the gas light is used, may, upon
 an average of the whole year, be stated at least at two hours
 per day of twenty- four hours.            In some mills, where there
 is over work, it will be three hours ; and in the few where
 night-work is still continued, nearly twelve hours. But
 taking two hours per day as the common average throughout
 the year, the consumption in Messrs. Philips' and Lee's
 mill will   be 1250   x   2  = 2500 cubic       feet  of gas per day ;
 to produce which, seven hundred weight of cannel coal is
 required in the retort.       The price of the best Wigan cannel
 (the sort used) is \3{d. per cwt. (22*. 6d. per tor.), deli
 vered at the mill, or say about eight shillings for the seven
 hundred weight.       Multiplying by the number of working
 days  in the   year (313), the annual consumption of cannel
 will be 110 tons, and its cost 125/.
    About one.third of       the above quantity,      or say forty tons
 of good common coal,           value    ten shillings per ton, is re
 quired for fuel to heat the retorts ; the annual amount              of
 which is 20/.
    The 1 10 tons of cannel coal, when distilled, produce about
 70 tons of good coak, which is sold upon the spot at Is. 4d.
per cwt. and will therefore amount annually to the sum
of 93l.
   The quantity of tar produced from each ton of cannel coal
is from eleven to twelve ale gallons, making a total annual
produce of about 1 250 ale gallons, which not having been
yet sold,    I  cannot determine its value          ; but whenever it
comes to be manufactured          in large quantities,     it cannot be
such as materially       to influence the ceconomical statement,
unless indeed new applications of it should be discovered.
   The quantity of aqueous fluid which came over in the
course    of  the observations      which    I  am now giving an ac
count of, was not exactly ascertained, from some springs
having got into the reservoir ; and as it has not been yet ap
plied to any useful purpose,        I  may omit further notice     of it
in this statement.
                                    H   2                          The

    The interest of      the capital expended       in the necessary ap
 paratus    and    buildings, together with what is considered as
 an ample allowance for wear and tear, is stated by Mr. Lee
 at about 550/. per annum : in which some allowance is made
for this apparatus being made upon a scale adequate to the
 supply of a still greater quantity of light, than he has occa
sion to make use of.
    He   is  of opinion,    that the cost   of attendance upon candlc9
would be      as much,     if  not more, than upon the gas appa
ratus;    so that in forming the comparison, nothing need be
stated upon that score,         on either side.
    The ceconomical        statement    for one year then stands thus ;
       Cost of 110 tons of cannel coal                  -        125/.

                                 -----
          ing the value of the coak, and without allow
          ing any thing for the tar, is therefore            -    52
       And    the interest    of capital,  and wear and tear
          of  apparatus                                          550
making the total expense of the gas apparatus,                about 600/.
per annum.
    That of candles, to give the same light, would be about
2000/. For each candle consuming at the rate of 4-10ths of
an ounce      of tallow   per hour, the 2500 candles burning upon
an average      of  the   year   two   hours per day, would, at one
shilling per pound,        the present    price, amount to nearly the
sum of money above mentioned.
    If the   comparison were made upon an average of three
hours per day, the advantage would be still more in favour
of the gas light ; the interest of the capital, and wear and
tear   of   the   apparatus    continuing nearly      the same as   in the
former case ; thus,
    1250    x  3  = 3750 cubic      feet  of gas per day, which would
be produced by        lOf cwt. of cannel coals ; this multiplied by
                                                                       the

<henumber of working days, gives 168 tons per annum,
which, valued as before, amounts to    -     188/.
       And 60 tons common coal for burning under
         the retorts, will amount to                                 30
                          '                                         218

       Leaving the expenditure in coal, after deduc
         tion of the coak, and without allowance for
            the tar, at                                              78
Adding       to which the     interest     and wear and tear   of   appara
tus,   as   before, the total annual cost will not be more than
650L, whilst that of tallow, rated as before, will be 3000J.
   It will readily occur, that the greater number of hours the
gas is burnt, the greater will be its comparative ceconomy ;
although in extending it beyond three hours, an increase                   of
some parts of the apparatus would be necessary.
   If thececoncmical comparison were made                  with oils, the
advantages would be less than with tallow.
   The introduction of this species of light into the establish
ment  of Messrs. Philips and Lee, has been gradual ; be
ginning in the year 1805, with two rooms of the mill, the
counting-houses,   and Mr. Lee's dwelling-house.          After
which, it was extended through the whole manufactory, as
expeditiously as the apparatus could be prepared.
  At first, some inconvenience was experienced from the
smell of the unconsumed, or imperfectly purified gas, which
may in      a great measure              the introduction of
                               be attributed to
successive improvements  in the  construction   of the appa
ratus, as the work proceeded.     But since its completion,
and since the persons to whose care it is confided have be
come familiar with its management,               this inconvenience has
been obviated, not only in the  mill, but also m Mr. Lee's
house, which is most brilliantly illuminated with     to the     it,
exclusion of every other species of artificial light.
  The peculiar softness and clearness of this light, with its
almost unvarying intensity, have brought   into great it                  fa
vour with the work people. And its being free from the
                             H             3      incon

inconvenience           and danger, resulting               from     the   sparks and
frequent snuffing of candle?, is a circumstance                            of material
importance, as tending to diminish the hazard of fire, to
which cotton mills are known to be much exposed.
  The above particulars, it is conceived, contain such in
formation,         as may tend to  illustrate the general advantages
attending the           use of the gas light; but nevertheless    the
Royal Society may perhaps not deem it uninteresting to be
apprized of the circumstances which originally gave rise in
my mind to its application, as an ceconomical substitute for
oik and tallow.
  It is now nearly          years, since, in a course of ex
                               sixteen
periments I was making at Redruth in Cornwall, upon the
quantities and qualities of the gases produced by distillation
from different mineral and vegetable substances, I was in
duced by some observations I had previously made upon the
burning of coal, to try the combustible property of the gases
produced from           it,
                   as well as from peat, wood, and other
inflammable substances.   And being struck with the great
quantities of gas which they afforded, as well as with the
brilliancy of the light,             and the facility           of   its production,   I
instituted several experiments with                     the
                                                        a   view of ascertaining
cost at which      might be obtained, compared with that of
                       it
equal quantities of light yielded   oils and tallow.by
      My    apparatus         consisted       of   an    iron    retort, with tinned
copper and iron tubes through which the gas was conducted
to  considerable distance and there, as well as at inter
      a                                  ;
mediate points, was burned through apertures of varied
forms and dimensions.      The experiments were made upon
coal of different qualities, which    procured from distant
                                                    I
parts      of         for the purpose of ascertaining which
                the kingdom,
would give the most ceconomical results. The gas was also
washed with water, and other means were employed to pu
rify it.
      In   the year 1798,      I    removed from                Cornwall    to Messrs.

 cessive  nights was applied to the lighting of their principal
 building, and various new methods were practised, or wash

    These experiments were continued                                       with   some  interrup
 tions, until the peace of S02, when             1                     a   public display of this
 light was made                  by   me in the            illumination of Mr. Boulton's
 manufactory at Soho, upon that occasion.
   Since that period, have, under the sanction of Messrs.
                                       I                                                                  ,
 Boulton, Watt, and Co., extended the apparatus at Soho
 Foundry,           so as to give light to all the principal shops, where
it   is   in regular use, to the exclusion of other artificial light;
but  I     have preferred giving the results from Messrs. Philips'
and Lee's apparatus, both on account of its greater extent,
and the greater uniformity of the lights, which rendered the
comparison with candles less difficult.
   At the time commenced my experiments,
                             I                   was cer                               I

Jt ut into a glazed earthen vessel four ounces and a half
of gum arabic, and eight ounces (or half a pint wine mea
sure) of cold spring water ; when the gum is dissolved, stir
 in seven ounces of gum-mastich, which has been washed,
 dried, picked, and beaten fine. Set the earthen vessel con
 taining the gum-water,            and gum-mastich,             over a slow fire,
 continually    stirring and beating them hard with a spoon,                      in
 order to dissolve the gum-mastich : when sufficiently boiled,
it will no longer appear transparent, but will become opaque,
 and stiff, like a paste. As soon as this is the case, and that
 the gum-water and mastich are quite boiling, without taking
 them off the fire, add five ounces of white wax, broken into

small pieces, stirring and beating the different ingredients
together, till the wax is perfectly melted and has boiled.
Then take the composition off the fire, as boiling it longer
than necessary would only harden the wax, and prevent its
mixing so well afterwards with water. When the compo
sition is taken off the fire, and in the glazed earthen vessel,
it should be beaten hard, and whilst hot (but not boiling)
mix with it by degrees a pint (wine measure) or sixteen
ounces more of cold spring water, then strain the compo
sition, as some dirt will boil out of the gum-mastich, and
put it into bottles : the composition, if properly made, should
be like a cream, and the colours when mixed with             as                            it,
smooth        as   with oil. The method of using                     it,   is   to mix with
the composition  upon an earthen palette, such colours in
powder             in painting with oil, and such
              as are used                           quantity                        a
of the composition to be mixed with the colours as to render
them         ofusual consistency of oil colours then paint
                   the                                                          ;
with fair water. The colours when mixed with the compo
sition may be laid on either thick or thin, as may best suit
your subject, on which account, this oomposition          very                            is
advantageous,  where  any particular transparency  of  colour
ing    required but in most cases
        is               ;               answers best,     the
                                                           it                              if
colours be laid on thick, and they require the same use of
the brush, as     painting with body colours, and the same
                          if
brushes          in oil painting.
               as used            The colours     grown dry,                if
when mixed with the composition, may be used          putting                        by
a little fair water over them but         less trouble to put
                                                   ;      it    is
 some        water when the colours are observed                           to       be growing
 dry.         In painting with this composition                       the colours blend
 without difficulty when wet, and even when dry the tints
 may easily be united     means of   brush and

ration than mixing some fine plaster of Paris in powder with

canvass are best covered          with      some gray tint mixed                 with the
same composition of gum-arabic, gum.mastich,       and wax,
and of the same sort of colours as before mentioned, before
the design    begun, in order to cover the grain of the wood

of putting     seven   ounces of mastich, and when boiling, adding
five ounces      of wax, mix twelve ounces of gum-mastich                      with
the gum-water,         prepared as mentioned in the first part               of this
receipt : before it is pin on the fire, and wHen sufficiently
boiled and beaten, and is a little cold, .stir in by degrees
twelve ounces, or three quarters of a pint (wiue measure)
of cold spring water,          and afterwards strain            it.    It would   be
equallypracticable painting with wax alone, dissolved in
gum-water in the following manner. Take twelve ounces
or    three quarters    of   a pint wine measure    of cold spring water,
and       four ounces and      a    half of gum-arabic, put them into a
glazed earthen vessel,             and when the gum is dissolved, add
eight ounces of white wax.                Put the earthen vessel with the
gum-water and wax upon a slow fire, and stir them till the
wax is dissolved and has boiled a few minutes : then take
them off the fire and              throw them into          a   bason,    as by re
maining in the hot earthen vessel the wax would become
rather hard ; beat the gum-water and wax till quite cold.
As       there is but a small proportion         of water in comparison
to the quantity of gum and wax, it would be necessary in
mixing this composition with,the colours, to put also some
fair water. Should the composition be so made as to occasion
the ingredients to separate in tne bottle, it will become
equally serviceable          if shaken     before    used       to mix    with the
colours.
     I   had lately an opportunity         of discovering that            the com
position which had remained in a bottle since the year 1792,
jn which time it had grown dry and become as solid a sub
stance as wax, returned to a cream-like consistence, and
became again in as proper a state to                 mix with colours,            as
when it was first made, by putting a little cold water upon
it,and suffering   to remain on
                        it        short time.a    also lately         I
found some of the mixture composed of only gum-arabic-
water and gum-mastich,               of which

JAIII.       .I   HESE remarks         as to   the momentum of activity,
have originated an idea           with    me   of a principle of equilibrium
peculiar to the case where the forces exercised in the system
are attractions : I think my readers will not be displeased to
find it here ; it is in the following terms :
   Several bodies subjected to the laws of an attraction, ex
ercised in consequence of any function of distances, either by
lliese bodies themselves upon each other, or by different fixed
points being applied to any machine ;                   if
                                           we make this ma
chine pass        from any given position              to that   of equilibrium,
the momentum    of activity consumed in this passage by the
attractive forces with .which these bodies will be animated^
during this movement, will be a maximum,
     That   is to say,      this momentum              will be always         greater
than it would have been,               if,   instead   of making this         system
pass to the        position of equilibrium,            we had constrained         it   to
take  different route, and to pass into any other situation.

                                        is
we may regard as an attraction exercised towards point                   a           in
finitely removed, the attractive forces will be the weight*
applied to the machine    the momentum of activity which
                                  :
will   be exercised          by   these forces         when we make this ma
chine      change its situation,             will therefore      be equal to         the
total weight of the system multiplied                    by

the centre of gravity shall have descended or ascended du
ring this change of position              (XXXII).           Now the situation

    If attraction   was  always constant like ordinary gravity,
but,    if directed towards    a fixed point, placed at a finite
distance, we might easily conclude from the preceding prin
ciple, that in the case of equilibrium, the sum of the mo
menta of the bodies of the system, relatively to ibis fixed
point, is a maximum, i. e. the sum of the products of each
mass, by its distance to the fixed point, is less when there
is an equilibrium, than if the system was placed in any
other given situation.
    If the attraction towards the fixed point, instead of being
constant, was proportional to the distances from this body
to this fixed point, we might conclude in the same way
that the sum of the products of each mass by the square             of
the distance to this fixed point, is a maximum.
    We know that the sum of the products of each mass, by
the square of its distance to any fixed point, is equal to th«
sum of the products of each mass, by the square of its di
stance to the centre of gravity ; plus, to the product of the
total mass, by the square of the distance from the cen
tre of gravity to this fixed point : (this is a well-known pro
position in geometry, and easily proved ;) thus, in the case
of attraction under examination, the sum of these two quan
tities should, in the case    of equilibrium,  be a maximum, i. e.
its differential is equal to zero. Let us suppose, for instance,
that all the parts of the system are connected with each
other, so    as to  form only one body, and that this body is
suspended by      its centre of gravity, so that this point is fixed;
it is clear that each of the quantities mentioned will be con
stant ;   i.e. will    remain the same, whatever situation ,>c
give to this body, and the differential of their sum will con
sequently be null : thus there will be equilibrium ; i. e. if
all the particles of a body are attracted towards a fixed point,
proportional to their distances to this point, and if we sus
pend this body by its centre of gravity, it will remain in
equilibrium precisely as in the case of ordinary gravity.           It
must not be concluded from this, however, that in amachine
to which several bodies are applied, attracted towards a fixed
point, in ratio of the distances, the position of equilibrium
was that at which the centre of gravity of the system would

  126                    On Machines in General.
  be at the lowest point, i. e. the nearest possible from the fixed
  point ; for this only happens in the case in which all the
  parts of the system hold together and form but a single
  body : on the contrary, in the case of natural gravity, it is
  not necessary, in order that the centre of gravity should be
  at the lowest point, that the parts of the system sh'ould be
 united with each other.
     If  bodies were      attracted    towards the fixed point in the
 inverse ratio   of their distances      to this point, the principle
 alleged above would show that the situation of equilibrium
 is then the situation at which the sum of the products of
 each mass, by the logarithm from its distance to the fixed
 point,   is a maximum.             t.
     In genera* if the bodies m of the system are attracted in
 ratio of a power «, from their distances x, to this point,
 the situation of equilibrium will be that at which the quan
 tity 4 m x + will be a maximum, or greater than in any
              n    '
other situation ; i. e. when the difference of this quantity to
what it would be,        if the system was in a situation infinitely
near, is equal to zero.
    If there arc in the. system several fixed points, towards
each of which the bodies m are attracted, in virtue of a
power given from           their distances to this point; so that
x, y, x, &c. being       the  distances from m to these different
fixed pohits    Axn, By"", C«i,            &c. are the central forces
of TO towards    these different foci,     it will be the quantity
+ &c. which will be a maximum in the position of equili
brium.
    And if besides this, the bodies attract each other in ratio
of any given power of            the distances,'  in such a way that
X    expressing    the distance from        the molecule m to each
of the other molecules of            the system, FXr is the motrix
force   attractive   of m   towards   this other molecule, the situa
tion of equilibrium         will  be that where the quantity

                         On Machines in General,
  H           smzi     +  l + &c. is a maximum ; i.             e. greater    than
 in any other situation.
     It would     be easy still to extend these consequences              to other
 hypotheses of attraction ; but this seems useless.                         I shall
 therefore confine myself to remarking, that we may, ' by a
 principle general to what we have shown, establish that
      Whatever      be the   nature    of   the matrix forces applied to a.
 machine,       if we  make     it move in such a manner that it passes
 by the position      of equilibrium, the instant when it shall ar
 rive in this situation, will be that at which the momentum of
 activity     consumed       during     the movement,        by    these matrix
forces, shall lie greatest.
     That is to say, the momentum of activity which                      the pro
  posed powers consume during the movement, goes on al
  ways increasing until the machine has attained the position
  of equilibrium ; after which this momentum goes on di
  minishing in proportion as the system removes from this
  position when it has passed it ; whatever, in other respects,
  may be the route which we make this machine assume in
  order to bring it to that situation.
      Suppose, for example, that each               of the powers applied to
  a  machine are of       a  given    size,  and  that  besides this we know
  one of the points of direction which it should have in order
  that there be equilibrium : I say that this situation of equili
  brium is that at which the sum of the products of each of
  these     powers, given by the distance from the point of the
  machine where we suppose it applied to the fixed point
  given upon its direction, is the least possible*: this is easily
  deduced      from the preceding principle.
      All   these things are so easity proved, after what has been
  said in the course        of this second part,         that it seems useless
  to dwell upon them.              I shall therefore conclude this work
     * It must be remarked, that in all we have said on the subject of a ma
  chine considered in different positions, and of its passage from the one to the
  other; it must be remarked, 1 say, that these positions are always supposed
  to be such that we pass from the one to the other by a movement which i)
  at each instant  of those 1 have called geometrical   : otherwise  all these  pro
   positions would   be subject  to the same defects  with which (in V.) we have
   thought fit to reproach the   principle of Descartes, and of tevcral others.

   Reflections upon the fundamental Laws        of Equilibrium and
                             of Movements.          j,
     Among the philosophers who have been occupied with
  inquiries respecting the laws of movement, some make me
  chanies an experimental science, others a science purely ra
 tional ; i. e. the former, comparing the phsenomena of Na
  ture, decompose them, as it were, in order to know what
 they possess in common with each other, and thus to re
 duce them to a small number of principal facts which serve
 to explain all the others, and to prognosticate what should
 happen in every circumstance : the latter begin by hypo
 theses, then, reasoning consequently to their suppositions,
 attain the discovery of the laws which bodies would pursue
 in their movements, if their hypotheses were conformable to
 Nature; then comparing their results with the phenomena,
 and finding that they agree,      conclude that their own hypo
 thesis is exact, i. e.  that bodies in fact follow the laws which
 they had at first only supposed.
    The first of these two classes        of philosophers   set out
therefore in their researches from the primitive notions which
Nature has impressed upon us, and from experiments which
she continually presents to us : the second class set out from
definitions and hypotheses.          With the former, the names
of bodies, of powers, of equilibrium, and of movement,
answer to first ideas ; they cannot nor should not define
them : the rest, on the contrary, having every thing to draw
from their own sources, are obliged to define these terms
with precision, and to explain all their suppositions clearly:
but   if this method seems more elegant, it is also much more
difficult than the other; for there is nothing so perplexing
in most of the rational sciences, and particularly in the one
under consideration,       as to lay down at first precise defi
nitions,    upon  which    no ambiguity remains : it would in
volve me in metaphysical discussions far above my ability,
to investigate all those which have been hitherto proposed : I
shall content myself with examining the first and the most
simple.

     What     is a body      ?    It is, most    people   will tell us, an     im
  penetrable       extent ;    i.  e. which     cannot be reduced to a less
 space.     But is this property not common to the body and
  to the empty space          ?      Can a cubic foot of vacuum occupy a
 less space      ?    It is clear that it cannot.        Suppose a cubic foot
 of water, for example,                is contained    in a vessel capable of
 containing two cubic feet and closed on all sides: suppose we
 shake or roll this vessel as much as we please, there will
 always remain a cubic foot of water and a cubic foot of va
 cuum    :  here are two spaces,             of different nature indeed, but
 both equally irreducible : — it            is not in this therefore    that the
 characteristic property of bodies consists.                Other people tell
 us that this property .consists iamobility. The indefinite and
 empty space, say they, is immoveable, while bodies may be
 transported from one place of this space to another : but
when      the      body A passes into B for example, Has not the
empty space which was in B, passed into A ? There is not,
in my opinion, more reason for attributing the movement
lo the plenum which was in A, than to the vacuum which
was in B       ;   the rriovement consists in one            of   these   spaces
supplanting the other; and this supplanting being recipro
cal, the mobility is a property which belongs no more to
one than to another.                  Without departing from our first
supposition, When I shake the vessel half empty and half
full, is not the vacuum moved as well as the fluids ? I dip
a hollow ball of metal into a bottle; the ball goes to the
bottom,     Have we not here              a vacuum which       is moved in a
plenum, in the same way as bodies are moved in a vacuum ?
The full space does not therefore differ from the empty space,
either in mobility or in irreducibility ; the impenetrability
which distinguishes the first from the second, therefore, is
not the same with this irreducibility ; it is something which
we cannot define, because it is a primitive idea !
    The two fundamental laws from which I set out                         (XI.)
are therefore truths              purely experimental,      and I have      pro
posed them as such.                A detailed explanation of these prin
ciples   would       not  enter     into the plan of this work, and per
haps would have only darkened the subject : the sciences are

    XXII.   Description of improved Tram-Plates for Carriages

       Wales:
            SIR,
    J. have  forwarded to the Society of Arts, &c. a specimen of
    my new method of laying rails, or tram-plates, on such a
    plan as has met the entire approbation of those who have
    seen     it,   and are acquainted         with the principle on which such
    roads should be formed.                   Rail roads are daily increasing,
    from the great advantage they afford to those manufactories
    connected with mines and minerals, particularly to collieries.
    They      also
                promote agriculture,                      by
                                          occasioning lime to be
    procured from places almost inaccessible    any other means,   by
    or from whence     could be otherwise brought on moderate
                             it
    terms.
     I      have also sent        drawing of my method of laying the
                                    a
    tram-plates,          with an estimate of the saving that will arise to
    the public        by
                    adopting the said method, with necessary re
    marks on the principle on which          founded. itThe lead

    ing rail or tram-plate has neither tenon nor mortise over the
    plug.  The stop-plate terminates the specimen, which stop-
    plate should go in with some degree of tightness when laid

any impediment of that nature will be rectified or allowed
for.    I wish it to be understood, that a stop-rail is intended
to be placed at every 30 yards, at which distance any re
pairs may be made within ten minutes, which by the pre
sent mode frequently occupies more than twice that time,
exclusive of disturbing in some measure the Hue of road.
By my method,           the plates have a certain       degree   of play,
which is absolutely necessary to avoid that breakage which
too frequently takes place when they are fixed with nails and
plugs.
    The   plates which     I send have been fixed in       stone   blocks,
and are nearly as rough as when taken from the sand.                    If I
am favoured with any mark of the Society's approbation,                    I
shall hold myself bound to transmit such further communi
cations on this subject as may be required by them, or any
person desirous of adopting my plan.

    The train-plates, fig.      5 and   6, are fastened by means       of a
tenon and mortise        AB,     each   having  a correspondent bevel,
just sufficient    to keep     the end from rising up, so that the
 head of one       plate confines the end of the other : by this
 means, the workmen are obliged to form their road in right
lines, and maintain perfect levels, as the mortise and tenon
 confines them to the required exactness necessary to make a
 perfect road : curves or any given segment may be formed
with     the  same    nicety, by having two bevel          rails or plates
 made for such purposes.

minutes.      The plugs in dotted lines are shown in their pro
per positions within the sleepers E F G.
    The usual length of a tram-plate is three feet ; the flanch
or outside edge H, about one inch and half high ; the sole
or bed I, from three inches and a half to four inches broad,
and three. fourths of an inch thick; but these dimensions"
may be varied according to circumstances ; the most approved
weight has been 14 pounds to the foot, or 42 pounds to the
plate; the ends from which the plugs project, and to which
the tenons and mortises fasten, should be one.fourth of an
inch thicker than the other part of the plate.
    Fig. 7. A B, Show the under part of the tenon and mortise,
and the form of one of the sloping or bevel plugs.
    The diameter of the plug near the shoulder is one inch
and three      quarters, reducing to one inch, its length two
inches and a half, forming an angle of eight degrees, the
plate from which it projects is counter-sunk, so that the
shoulder of the plug may not receive any sharp pressure or
 prevent the plate from having a perfect bearing.            There is
a small groove in the whole length of the exterior of each
 plug,    to admit a wire to pass to    its   extremity, to draw the
 plug out     if  broken   by any accident, also to admit the ex
 pansion    of water, in  case  of severe frost.
    The blocks or     sleepers,  EFG,     on which the tram-plates
 are placed,     should by no means       be less than 120 pounds
 each in weight, but should be heavier on some kinds of
 ground : the depth of the hole for the plug should be three
 inches, and worked according to the inclination of the plug,
 for which purpose the stone-mason should have a standard
 cast-iron gauge ; there should be projections, K, cast with
 the flanch or outside      edge   of the   tram-plate, as shown at
 fig. 5, to make the plates lie firm on their sleepers.

                         General Observations.
    The advantage of laying plates on the above principle is
obvious ; the blocks being put in their places never 3ink be
low their intended level, the act of driving either nail or
 plug (which requires a considerable degree of force, and
too frequently destroys the level of the road,) being here un
necessary. In the common mode of making rail-roads,
from the irregularity of nails, particularly in forming their
heads, few can be driven exactly even with the plate, and
are perpetually obstructing the passage of the waggon ; the
workmen frequently not proportioning their holes and plugs
to the hole in the block, also occasions considerable break
age ; the exertion necessary to fix a rail or plate completely,
is great ; and numbers of plates, particularly when the iron
is short or brittle, are broken near the mortises by missing
the stroke of the hammer, which must be used with great
force.

XXIII.                         of Bark into Alburnum. By
                 On the Inconvertibility
     Thomas Andrew Knight, Esq., F.R.S. In a Letter
     to Sir Joseph Banks, K.B. P.R.S.*
         MY DEAR SIR,
An       a letter which     I had    the honour to address to you in the
end of the last yearf, I endeavoured to prove that the mat
ter which composes the bark of trees, previously exists in
the cells both         of their bark         and alburnum,        in      a   fluid state,
and       that this fluid, even             when extravasated,            is capable of
changing into a pulpous and cellular, and ultimately a vas
cular substance ; the direction taken by the vessels being
apparently dependent on the course which the descending
fluid sap is made to take J. The object of the present me
moir is to prove, that the bark thus formed, always remains
in the state of bark, and that no part of it is ever trans
muted into alburnum,            as      many very eminent naturalists have
believed.
  Having procured, by grafting, several trees of a variety of
the apple and crab tree, the woeds of which were distin
guishable from each other by their colours, I took off, early
in   the spring, portions         of bark of equal length, from branches
of       equal    size, and    I transposed these pieces of bark, in
closing   part of the stem of the apple tree with a covering
             a
of the bark of the crab tree, which extended quite round                                      it,
and applying the bark of the apple tree to the stem of the
crab tree in the same manner.    Bandages were then applied
to keep   the  transposed bark and  the alburnum in contact
with       each other   ;   and the air was excluded             by   a   plaster com
posed        of    bees- wax   and turpentine,            and   with   a      covering of
tempered clay.

      The interior surface of        the bark    of  the crab tree presented
   numerous sinuosities, which corresponded with similar ine
   qualities on the surface of the alburnum, occasioned by the
   former existence of. many lateral branches.                   The interior
   surface   of the bark of the apple         tree,   as well as the external
  surface of the alburnum, was,                on the contrary, perfectly
  smooth and even.           A   vital union soon took place between
  the transposed pieces of bark, and the alburnum and bark
  of the trees to which they were applied ; and in the autumn
  it appeared evident, that a layer of alburnum had been, in
  every    instance,      formed beneath the transposed pieces             of
  bark, which were then taken off.
     Examining        the organization      of the alburnum, which       had
  been generated        beneath  the transposed        pieces  of bark of the
  crab tree,    and     which   had    formed     a perfect   union with the
  alburnum of the apple tree, I could not discover any traces
  of the sinuosities I had noticed ; nor was the uneven surface
 of    the alburnum         of the    crab   tree   more changed by the
  smooth transposed         bark of the apple tree. The newly gene
 rated alburnum,         beneath    the transposed bark, appeared per
 fectly similar to that of other parts of the stock, and the di
 rection of the fibres and vessels did not in any, degree corre
 spond with those of the transposed bark*.
     Repeating this experiment, I scraped off the external sur
 face of the alburnum in several spaces, about three lines in
 diameier, and in these spaces no union took place between
 the transposed bark and the alburnum of the stock, nor was
 there any alburnum deposited in the abraded spaces ; but the
newly generated cortical and alburnous layers took a circu
lar, and rather elliptical, course round those spaces, and
appeared to have been generated by a descending fluid, which
had divided into two currents when it came into contact
    * Duhamcl having taken off, and immediately replaced, similar pieces of
the bark of young elms, subsequently found that the alburnum, which Wat
generated beneath such pieces of bark, had not formed any union with the
alburnum of the tree, beneath it. But this great naturalist did not employ
Ligatures of sufficient power to bring the bark and alburnum into close con
tact, or the result wouid have been different.

with    the spaces from which the surface had been scraped off,
and to have united agaiu immediately beneath them.
    In   each   of  these experiments,        a new cortical and albur-
nous layer was evidently generated ; and apparently by the
same means that similar substances were generated beneath
a plaster composed           of bees.wax       and turpentine,    informer
experiments*;           and the only obvious difference in the result
appears      to be, that the transposed         and newly generated      bark
formed      a  vital union with each other         :  and  it is sufficiently
evident, that if bark of any kind was converted into alburnum,
it must have been that newly generated. For it can scarcely
be supposed,         that the bark       of  a crab tree was transmuted
into   the alburnum         of  an apple tree,     or that the sinuosities
of  the bark of the crab tree could have been obliterated, had
such transmutation taken place. There is not, however, any
thing in the preceding cases calculated to prove that the
newly      generated      bark was not converted into alburnum ;
and the elaborate experiments of Duhamel sufficiently evince
the difficulty of producing any decisive evidence in this case ;
nevertheless       I trust that I shall     be able to adduce such facts
as,  in the aggregate, will be found nearly conclusive.
    Examining almost every day, during the spring and sum
mer, the progressive formation of alburnum in the young
shoots of an oak coppice, which had been felled two years
preceding, I was wholly unable to discover any thing like
the transmutation of bark into alburnum.                   The commence
ment of the aJburnous layers in the oak (qitercus rolur) is
distinguished by a circular row of very large tubes.                   These
tubes are of course generated in the spring; and during their
formation,       I found    the substance through which they, passed
to be soli and apparently gelatinous, and much less tena
cious and consistent than tbe substance of the bark itself;
and therefore,         if the   matter    which     gave existence to     the
alburnum previously composed the bark, it must have been,
during its change of character, nearly in a state of solution;
but it is the transmutation of one organized substance into
the other, and not the identity only of the matter of both,

for which       the   disciples    of Malpighi contend            ;  and   if the
fibres and vessels      of  the bark really hecame those             of   the al
burnum,      a very great degree of similarity ought to be found
in  the organization or' those substances. No such .. 'inilanty,
however, exists       ;  and    not any      thing at all corresponding
with   the circular row       of lanre tubes in the alburnum of the
oak is discoverable in the bark of that tree. These tu!,es are
also generated within the interior surface of the bark, which
is well defined ; and during their formation the vesse's of
the bark are distinctly visible, as different organs ; and had
the one been transmuted into the other, their progressive
changes    could not,       I think, possibly       have escaped         my ob
servation   :   nor does      the organization        of  the bark in other
instances, in any degree indicate the character of the wood
that is generated beneath it i the bark of the wych elm
(ulmus montana) is extremely tough and fibrous ; and it is
often taken from branches of six or eight years old, to be
used instead of cords ; that of the ash (fraxinus excelsior)
on the contrary, when taken from branches of the same
age,   breaks almost as readily in any one direction as in an
other, and scarcely presents a fibrous texture ; yet the albur
num of these trees is not very dissimilar, and the one is
often substituted for the other in the construction of agricul
tural instruments.
   Mirbel    lias endeavoured       to account for the dissimilar or
ganization of the bark, and of the wood into which he con
ceives it to be convened, by supposing that the cellular sub
stance of the bark is always springing from the alburnum,
whilst the tree is growine, and that it carries with it part of
the tubular substance (tiisu tululaire) of the liber, or in»
terior bark. These parts of the interior bark, which are
thus removed from contact with the alburnum, he conceives
to constitute the external bark or cortex, whilst the interior
part  of the liber progressively changes into alburnum.
   But   if   this theory (which I believe I have accurately
stated,   though I am not quite certain that I fully compre
hend its author*) were well founded, the texture of the al-

 bunuini must surely                    be much more intricate and interwoven
 than it    is,   and its lubes would lie less accurately parallel                                   with
 each other than they do                    :    and were the fibrous substance                            of
 the bark progressively changing into alburnum, the bark
 must of necessity be firmly attached to the alburnum during
the spring and summer                        by
                              the continuity, and indeed iden
tity of the vessels and fibres of both the substances.   This,
however,      not in any degree the case, and the bark
                  is                                        in                                       is
those seasons very easily separated                              from the alburnum                   ;    to
which      it   appears to be attached                      by   a    substance that           is   appa
rently rather gelatinous than fibrous or vascular   and the                                :
obvious fact, that the adhesion of the cortical vessels and
fibres to each other                  much more strong than the adhesion
                                       is
of   the bark to the               alburnum, affords another circumstance
almost     as     inconsistent with the theory of Malpighi,                                     as   with
that of Mirbel.
     Many of          the experiments                 of Duhamel are, however, ap
parently favourable to the                           theory of Malpighi, respecting.
the conversion of bark into alburnum                             Mirbel has cited
                                                                      ;   and
two, which he appears to                         think conclusive*. In the first
of these, Duhamel shows that pieces of silver wire, inserted
in the bark of trees, were subsequently found in their albur
num; but Duhamel himself has shown, with his usual
acuteness and candour, that the evidence                                    afforded      by   this ex
periment     extremely defective; and he declares himself to
                 is
be uncertain that the pieces of wire did not, at their first in
sertion, pass between the bark and the alburnum       in which                         ;
case they would necessarily have been covered                                        by   every sue-
cessive    layer        of alburnum, without                          any     transmutation               of
bark into that substance f.
  In the second experiment cited                                 by   Mirbel, Duhamel                has
shown that when               a    bud      of   a   peach tree, with           a   piece      of bark
attached        to     it,   is   inserted in        a   plum stock,            a   layer of wood
perfectly similar to that of the peach tree will be found, in
the succeeding winter, beneath the inserted bark. The state
ment of Duhamel        perfectly correct
                                  is      but the experiment     ;
does not by any means prove                           the    conversion             of bark into

an inserted piece        of bark can deposit a layer of alburnum, it
is at least    as difficult to conceive how the same piece of bark
can be converted into         a layer of alburnum of more than twice
its own thickness (and the thickness of the alburnum depo
sited frequently exceeds that of the bark in this proportion),
 without any perceptible diminution of its own proper sub
 stance.       The probable operation of the inserted bud, which,
 is a well-organized        plant, at the period when it becomes ca
 pable of being transposed with success, appears also, in this
 case, to have been overlooked ; for I found that when I de
 stroyed the buds in the succeeding winter, and left the bark
 which belonged         to them uninjured, this bark no longer pos
  sessed    any power to generate alburnum.                 It nevertheless
  continued to live, though perfectly inactive, till it became
  covered by the successive alburnous layers of the stock ; and
  it   was   found many years afterwards enclosed in the wood.
  It    was, however, still bark, though dry and lifeless, and
  did not appear to have made any progress towards conver
   sion into wood.
       In the course of very numerous experiments, which were
   made to ascertain the manner in which vessels are formed
   in the reproduced bark*, many circumstances came under
   jny observation which I could adduce in support of my opi
   nion,    that bark is never transmuted into alburnum ; but I
    do  not   think it necessary to trouble you with an account of
    thcin ; for though much deference is certainly due to the
    opinions of those naturalists who have adopted the opposite
    theory, and to the doubts of Duhamel, I am not acquainted
    with a single experiment which warrants the conclusions
    they have drawn ; and I think that were bark really trans
    muted into alburnum,           its progressive changes could only
    have escaped the eyes of prejudiced or inattentive observers.
     In the course of the ensuing spring, I hope to address to you
     some observations respecting the manner in which the al
     burnum is generated.             I am, my dear sir,

         SIR,
   AT   has often been a matter      of surprise to me that we should
   possess so scanty a share        of knowledge on the component
   parts  of pit-coal, or     at  least that so small a share of that
   knowledge should meet the public eye. Except the analysis
   given by Mr. Kirwan, I do not recollect any in our lan
  guage. After this short preface, I shall offer no apology for
  sending you the details that follow.
                Wehh Furnace Coal from Cyfartlia.
     The appearance of this coal is deep shining jetty black,
  possessed of an irregular crystallized fracture, rather in
  clining  to soft and friable.      Specific gravity 1.337.             ,
     340 grains of this coal, in small piece*, were introduced
 into a close fitted iron retort. It continued longer in the fire
 without inflaming than the common sort of English or Scotch
 coals, and afterwards burnt with a small quantity of light-
 coloured bituminous flame.           Upon examining the result, I
 found the pieces welded, though not run into one common
 mass;    the exposed angles were all rounded, but no great

VIII.    On the Nature         of Ammonia and alkaline Bodies in
   general : with Observations on some Prospects of Discovery
   offered by the preceding Facts.
Ammonia          is a substance, the chemical           composition   of
which    has always been considered          of late years as most per
fectly ascertained, and         the   apparent conversion of it into
hydrogen      and   nitrogen,      in the experiments of Scheele,
Priestley, and the more refined and accurate experiments of
Berthollet, had left no doubt of its nature in the minds of
the most enlightened chemists.
   AH new      facts must be accompanied however by a train           of
analogies, and often by suspicions with regard to the accu
racy of former conclusions.             As the two fixed alkalis con
tain a small quantity of oxygen united to peculiar bases,
may not the volatile alkali likewise contain it ? was a query
which soon occurred          to me   in  the course  of inquiry ; and in
perusing the accounts of the various experiments made on
the subject, some of which I had carefully repeated, I saw
no reason to consider the circumstance as impossible.                For
supposing      hydrogen and         nitrogen to exist in combination
with oxygen in low proportion, this last principle might
easily disappear in the analytical experiments of decomposi
tion by    heat and     electricity, in water deposited upon the
vessels employed       or  dissolved in the gases produced.
   Of the existence of oxygen in volatile alkali I soon satis
fied myself.       When charcoal carefully burnt and freed from
moisture- was ignited by the Voltaic battery of the power of
85,0-of six and four inches square, in a small quantity of
                                                                    very

    On the Decomposition and Composition                 of the Alkalis.   147
very pure ammoniacal gas*; a great expansion of the aeri
form matter took place, and a white substance formed,
which collected on          the   sides  of   the glass tube employed       in
the process       ;  and this matter,      exposed    to the action    of di
luted muriatic acid, effervesced,             so that it was probably car
bonate of ammonia.
     A  process     of another kind      offered   still  more decisive re
sults. In this the two mercurial gasometers of the invention
of Mr. Pepys, described in No. XIV. of the Phil. Trans,
for 1807 f» were used with the same apparatus as that em
ployed by Messrs. Allen and Pepys for the combustion of
the diamond,          and these gentlemen        kindly   assisted in the ex
periment.
     Very    pure ammoniacal         gas was passed over iron wire ig
nited in      a  platina tube, and two curved glass tubes were so
arranged        as to be inserted       into a freezing mixture ; and
through one of these tubes the gas entered into the platina
tube, and through the other, it passed from the platina tube
into the airholder arranged for its reception.
     The temperature of the atmosphere was 55°; but it was
observed that no sensible quantity of water was deposited in
the cooled glass tube transmitting the unaltered ammonia,
but in that receiving it after its exposure to heat, moisture
was very distinct, and the gas appeared in the airholder
densely clouded.
     This circumstance          seems    distinctly to prove the forma
tion    of   water in this operation for the decomposition of am
monia      ;  unless indeed it be asserted that the hydrogen and
nitrogen gases evolved, hold less water in solution or sus
pension than the ammonia decomposed ; an idea strongly
    • The apparatus in which this experiment was made is described in page
214, 1ournal of the Royal Institution.      The gas was confined by mercury
which had been previously boiled to expel any moisture that might adhere to
it.   The ammonia had been exposed to the action of dry pure potash, and a
portion of it equal in volume to 10980 grains of mercury, when acted on by
distilled water, left a residuum equal to nine grains of mercury only.      So
that the gas, there is every reason to believe, contained no foreign aeriform
matter ; for even the minute residuum may be accounted for by supposing it
derived from air dissolved in the water.

riments of Messrs. Desormes and Clement t.
   After      the gas had          been    passed    several times through the
ignited tube from one gasometer to the other, the results
were examined.    The iron wire became converted superfi
cially into oxide, and had gained in weight -^t- parts of a
grain, about T\ of a grain of water were collected from the
cooled glass tubes by means of filtrating paper, and 33-8
cubic inches  of gas were expanded into 55-3 cubic inches,
and by detonation with oxygen it was found that the hydro
gen gas in these was to the nitrogen as 3-2 to 1 in volume.
  It will be useless to enter into the more minute details of
this experiment, as no perfectly accurate data for propor
tions can be gained from them ; for the whole of the am
monia was not decomposed ; and as the gas had been pre
pared by being sent from a heated mixture                       of   sal ammoniac
and quicklime, into the airholder, it was possible that some
solution of ammonia might have been deposited, which, by
giving out new gas during the operation, would increase the
absolute quantity of the material acted upon.
  In examining the results of M. Berthollet's                      J elaborate       ex
periments on the decomposition of ammonia by electricity, I
was surprised to find that the weight of the hydrogen and
nitrogen produced, rather exceeded than fell short of that of
the ammonia considered as decomposed, which was evi
dently contradictory to the idea of its containing oxygen.
This circumstance, as well as the want of coincidence be
tween the results and those of Priestley and                      Van Marum on
the same subject, induced me to repeat the                         process      of   the
electrization of ammonia, and I soon found                         that the quan
tities of the products in their relations to the            apparent quan
tity     of   gas destroyed            were   influenced by many different
causes.
  Ammonia procured over dry mercury from a mixture of
dry lime and muriate of ammonia, I found, deposited mois

 and in passing the gas into the tube for electrization, it was
 not easy to avoid introducing some of this moisture, which
 must have been a saturated solution of ammonia, at the
 same time.
    In my first trials made upon gas, passed immediately from
 the vessel in which it had been collected into the apparatus^
 I found the expansion of one of ammonia vary in different
 instances from 2-8 to 2- 2 measures ; but the proportions of
 the nitrogen and hydrogen appeared                         uniform,    as determined
 by detonation of the mixed gas with oxygen, and nearly                                      as
 one to three in volume.
    To exclude       moisture entirely, I carefully prepared
                           free
 ammonia        mercurial airholder, and, after it had been
                  in   a
 some hours at rest, passed a quantity of it into the tube for
 decomposition, which had been filled with dry mercury.
 In this case 50 parts became 103 parts by electrization, and
 there was still reason to suspect sources of error.
    I   had used        iron wires not perfectly free from rust, for
 taking the spark, and a black           film from the mercury ap
 peared on the sides                of   the tube.    It was probable that some
ammonia        had         been       absorbed     by the  metallic oxides both
upon the iron and the mercury, which might again have
been given out in the progress of the operation.
    I   now      recently distilled mercury, which did not
               used
leave the slightest film on the glass tube, and wires of pla-
tina. The ammonia had been exposed to dry caustic potash,
and proved to be equally pure with that mentioned in page
147.      6o measures of                 it,
                              each equal to     grain of water,a
were electrized  till no further  expansion could be produced,
the gas filled  space equal to that occupied
                   a                               108 grains of   by
water.   The thermometer in this experiment was at 56°,
and the barometer at 30,    inches. The wire of platina trans
                                         1
mitting the spark was slightly tarnished*.     The 108 mea
sures of gas, carefully analysed, were found to consist of 80
measures     volume of hydrogen, and 28 measures of ni
              in
trogen.
  • This most    probably was owing to oxidation.       When platina                  made
positive in the Voltaic circuit in contact with solution of ammonia,          it is   is   ra»
pidly corroded.        This   is   an analogous instance.

    The   results     of  an experiment that        I made in 1799*        give
the weight of        100 cubic inches of ammonia,              as 18-18 grains
at the mean temperature            and pressure.        I   had reasons how
ever for suspecting that this estimation might he somewhat
too low, and on mentioning the circumstance to Messrs.
Allen    and Pepys, they kindly undertook the examination of
the subject, and Mr. Allen soon furnished me with the fol
lowing data. " In the first experiment 21 cubic inches of
ammonia weighed 4-05 grains ; in a second experiment the
same quantity weighed 4,0G grains, barometer 30*65, ther
mometer 54° Fahrenheit."
     Now    if  the corrections      for temperature and pressure be
made for these           estimations, and a mean taken, 100 cubic
inches      of ammonia will weigh               1 8-67    grains,    barometer
being at 30, and thermometer at 60°                 Fahrenheit;      and  if the
quantity used in the experiment of decomposition be calcu
lated upon as cubic inches, 60 will weigh 1 1-2 grains.                      But
the hydrogen gas evolved equal to 80 will weigh l'93f
grains,      and the nitrogen equal to 2SJ, 8-3. And 1 1-9
grains —      PQ + 8-3 = 10-2. and 11-2 — 10-2. = 1, all the
estimations       being made according to the standard                tempera
ture and pressure.
     So that, in this experiment on the decomposition of am
monia, the weight of the gases evolved is less by nearly
";ir than that      of   the ammonia employed             ;   and this loss can
only be ascribed to the existence of oxygen in the alkali                       ;
part of which probably combined with the platina wires em
ployed for electrization,          and part with hydrogen.
     After   these ideas the oxygen in ammonia                 cannot well be
estimated      at less than seven or eight parts             in the hundred     ;
and it possibly          exists   in a larger proportion as the gases
 evolved may contain more water than the gas decomposed,

 which of course would increase their volume and their ab
 solute weight*.
     In supposing ammonia             a triple     compound        of nitrogen,
 hydrogen, and oxygen, it is no less easy to give a rational
account of the phaenomena of its production and decompo
sition, than in adopting the generally received hypothesis of
 its composition.
     Oxygen,      hydrogen,      and nitrogen,       are   always present in
cases in which volatile alkali is formed ; and it usually ap
pears during the decomposition                of  bodies in      which     oxygen
is loosely attached, as in that            of the compounds of oxygen
and nitrogen dissolved in water.
     At common temperatures under favourable circumstances,
the three      elements may be conceived capable of combining
and of remaining in union : but at the heat of ignition the
affinity of hydrogen for oxygen prevails over the complex
attraction, water is formed, and hydrogen and nitrogen are
evolved ; and according to these conclusions, ammonia will
bear the      same    relations to the fixed alkalis,          as the vegetable
acids with        compound        bases     do to the mineral ones            with
simple bases.
     Oxygen then may be considered as existing in, and as
forming, an element in all the true alkalis ; and the prin
ciple of acidity of the French nomenclature might now
likewise be called the principle of alkalescence.
     From analogy alone it is reasonable to expect that the al
kaline earths are compounds of a similar nature to the fixed
alkalis,' peculiar highly combustible metallic bases united
to oxygen. I have tried some experiments upon barytes and
strontites; and they go far towards proving that this must
be the case.        When       barytes and strontites,         moistened with
water, were acted upon by the power of the battery of 250
of four and six, there was a vivid action and a brilliant light
at both      points of communication,              and an     inflammation at
the negative point.
   * In the present state of our knowledge, perfectly correct data for pro
portions cannot probably be gained in any experiments on the decomposition
of ammonia, as it seems impossible to ascertain the absolute quantity of water
in this gas ; for electrization, according to Dr. Henry 's ingenious researches,
etffers the only means known     of ascertaining the quantity   ot water in gases

    In  these cases the water might             possibly have interfered.
Other experiments gave however more distinct results.
    Barytes and strontites, even when heated to intense white
ness, in the electrical circuit by a flame supported by oxygen
gas, are non.conductors ; but by means of combination with
a very small quantity of boracic acid, they become conduc
tors ; and in this case inflammable matter, which burns with
a deep red      light in each instance, is produced from them at
the negative surface. The high temperature has prevented
the success of attempts to collect this substance; but there
is much reason to believe that it is the basis of the alkaline
earth employed.
    Barytes and strontites have the strongest relations to the
fixed alkalis of any of the earthy bodies * ; but there is a
chain of resemblances, through lime, magnesia, glucina,
alumina,       and silex.      And     by the agencies    of batteries    suffi
ciently strong,       and     by the     application    of proper circum
stances, there is no small reason to hope, that even these
refractory bodies will yield their elements to the methods of
analysis by electrical attraction and repulsion.
    In  the electrical circuit we have a regular series             of powers,
of decomposition from             an   intensity   of action,     so feeble as
scarcely to destroy the weakest affinity existing between the
parts of a saline neutral compound, to one sufficiently ener
getic to separate elements in the strongest degree of union,
in bodies undecomposable under other circumstances.
    When      the powers are feeble,         acids and alkalis,       and acids
and metallic oxides, merely separate from each other ; when
they are increased to a certain degree, the common metallic
oxides and the compound acids are decomposed ; and, by
means still more exalted, the alkalis yield their elements.
   * The similarity between the properties of earths and metallic oxides was
noticed in the early periods of chemistry.     The poisonous nature of barytes,
and the great specific gravity of this substance as well as of strontites, led
Lavoisier to the con;ecture that they were of a metallic nature. That metals
existed in the fixed alkalis seems hbwever never to have been suspected. From
their analogy to ammonia, nitrogen and hydrogen have been supposed to lie
amongst their elements.      It is singular, with regard to this class of bodies,
that those most unlike metallic Glides arc the first which have been demon
strated to be such.
                                                                           And

And       as   our knowledge of the composition of bodies
               far    as
extends, all substances attracted by positive electricity are
oxygen, or such as contain oxygen in excess ; and all that
are attracted by negative  electricity are pure combustibles,
or such as consist chiefly of combustible matter.
     The       idea    of muriatic acid, fluoric acid, and boracic acid
containing               highly strengthened by these facts.
                       oxygen,         is
And the general principle confirms the conjecture just stated
concerning the nature of the earths.
   In the electrization of boracic acid moistened with water,
I find that a dark-coloured combustible matter is evolved at
the negative surface; but the researches upon the alkalis
have prevented me from pursuing this fact, which seems
however to indicate a decomposition.
  Muriatic acid and fluoric acid in their gaseous states are
non.conductors : and as there is every reason to believe that
their bases have a stronger attraction for oxygen than water,
there can be little hope of decomposing them in their aqueous
solutions, even by the highest powers.    In the electrization
of some of their combinations there is however a probability
of   success.
     An immense variety of objects of                           research is presented   in
the powers and affinities                       of   the new metals       produced from
the alkalis.
   In themselves they will undoubtedly prove powerful agents
for analysis ; and having an affinity for oxygen stronger than
any other known substances,       they may possibly supersede
the application of electricity to some of the undecompound-
ed bodies.

decomposes              it,   and produces charcoal when heated      con         in
tact with carbonate               of lime.            It   likewise oxidates in muriatic
acid   ;   but   I     have had no opportunity                     of making  the experi
ment with sufficient precision to ascertain                            the results.

 XXVI.     Successful Application of the Magnet, employed to
    extract a Fragment of Iron out of the human Eye, which
    had been lodged there about Jive Months.             By Mr, WIL
    LIAM PIGRAM, Sen,, of Tenterden*              .
                                                            Tenterden,
                                                          July   12, 1808.
ABOUT       five months ago Charles        Milsted,   a blacksmith,        of
Tenterden, whilst in the act of striking the head of one
hammer against another, on a part of work which required
him to strike with great violence, a particle of iron about the
size of   a  small pin's head, flew off from the head of the
hammer, and' darted into the ball of his left eye; the acci
dent was attended with extreme pain, and continued without
any abatement.
    Some weeks after this accident, I applied a magnet to the
part injured, with an expectation that it might draw out the
particle, hut I could only draw out a mixture of powdered
 rust with the tears, I supposed the salt liquid of the eye had
dissolved this calx from the iron. This gave no relief, as the
fragment of iron was yet remaining in the eye.                 A surgeon
endeavoured to take it out with the point of a lancet ; but
the fragment was firmly fixed, and very near the pupil of
the eyr, so that it was impossible to touch it with any in
strument, but with extreme danger. Being informed the
young man was in great agony, and without any hope of
relief, I sent for him again this 12th of July, with a desire
to try once more what effect the magnet might have.                  I  was

the more     encouraged, knowing the          principle to be correct,
and the power to be employed             very great. I first examined
the eye with a powerful magnifying glass, and I could dis
cover a very small particle of black iron, but covered over
with the thin coating of the eye ; the surface was even, and
like   the other parts    of  the eye.   When I   had satisfied  myself
of the    exact situation,     and  of the impediments    which I   had
to surmount,       the eyelids   were   held open, and   I  applied the
north     pole of    a combined      staple magnet, possessing great
power, at the distance of about .^th of an inch from the
eye; then I used another magnet of less power, but of more
 convenient construction : thus I continued alternately to
 apply them both, and at last 1 could perceive the fragment
 of iron had projected above the surface of the iris of the eye.
 This   gave   me   some     encouragement, although there was a
 coating to cut its      way through, before the magnet could
 draw it out. To appearance it was as firmly fixed as a thorn
 in the flesh, and which prevented ii from being drawn out
 so instantaneously,       as the magnet, by its great attractive
 power,    might   hnve   done,   had the fragment been only loosely
 floating on the outer surface of the eye.
     During this operation the young man frequently thought
 he felt the fragment rush out of his eye, before it actually
 was so. This sensation on so tender an organ was most
 likely produced by the great force with which the magnet
 attracted   the fragment      of iron  ; and  as it was evidently dis
  lodged from its former position, I        was the more encouraged
  to be very earnest in my application.           After using magnets
  of different degrees of power, and in various directions, for
  the space of about ten or fifteen minutes, the particle of iron
  cut its way through the thin teguments of the eye, by the
  power of attraction, and was taken out by the magnet : I
  must confess that I was surprised to find so small a particle
   should have been the occasion of such long continued pain;
  but when the structure of that tender organ is duly consi
   dered, the wonder will cease : by the assistance of glasses,
   the fragment appeared of an imperfect octagon shape, and
  prmed with rough jagged edges.
    As soon   as the  fragment was drawn out, the eye was instantly
                                                                     free

    156       Successful Application     of the Magnet, t£c.
   free from pain,     although many months       before, both night
   and day, the pain had continued without intermission          ; and
   the young man was unhappy from an apprehension that he
   must lose the sight of that eye, which had been much im
   paired by the misfortune. A small scar remained on the eye,
  but it occasioned no pain. The weakest magnet which                 I
  used for this operation      will suspend a weight of about three
  pounds,     and  the   strongest will suspend a weight of about
  fifty pounds.      The weakest magnet by its construction, not
  being so unwieldy       to manage as the other,    gave me an op
  portunity of approaching more closely to the organ of sight
  than I could with the largest ; but I think they both had
  their use in forcing the fragment to cut its way through the
  teguments which enveloped it.           Not being a medical man,
 it  is probable   I may not    have given the description so accu
 rately as it might have been .given ; but the effect produced,
 and the manner in which it was accomplished, I think can
 not be misunderstood.
     I must here recommend to persons who may be induced
 to make use of the same means to discharge any particles of
 iron from the eye, not to be discouraged in their applica
 tion,   if the iron should not so suddenly be extracted as they
 might expect : they should take into consideration the de
gree of confinement, and every other existing obstacle be
tween the iron and the magnet ; and should not too hastily
decline the operation.
     I have   not stated    these particulars as in themselves ex
traordinary, nor as calculated to excite surprise. We all know
that the natural property of the magnet is such, as to attract
iron in every possible situation ; and we also know the pene
trating force of the magnetic fluid will, with a degree of
strength equal to the power communicated, make its pas
sage even through plates       of glass, when    any particle of iron
is   within the circuit of     its  influence.  I can therefore only
wonder that a means          so familiar, and    which seems to be
pointed     out by  a law  in Nature, should not more frequently
be used on such occasions.

     HAT may be the accuracy of the experiments detailed in
the last Number of your Magazine, by Dr. Sementini, re
lating to the incombustible man, I know not ; but of this
I am certain, that the Doctor has gone sadly out of his way
to account for the method employed by Senor Lionetto, to
render his tongue uninjured by the hot iron                                  which        he was
accustomed to pass over it.

fend the tongue with alum, sugar, soap, or any other sub
stance, for the purpose of rendering    insensible to the ac     it
tion    of red.hot iron.               I        have        repeatedly     seen   a   friend      of
mine pass over his tongue, without any covering,     red.hot                          a

out of the mouth,                 and that the poker be of course quickly
passed over it.
     The    cause      of this phenomenon                   I    conceive to be, that the
saliva    vaporized,

  but little surprise.      Any one, he said, might draw their fin
  ger through     melted   lead, if they did it somewhat quickly;
  and having in his hand a ladle full of melted solder, he in
  stantly passed his finger through it.           He said he had often
  passed a red-hot piece of iron over his tongue, and seen
  others do it without injury. In the first experiment, he said,
  it was necessary    that the finger should he perfectly dry — if
  otherwise, the person might get what he called a thimble, i. e.
  some    of the metal would stick to the finger and give a severe
  burn.     In the experiment of passing a red-hot iron over the
  tongue, the iron, he said, should be very red — if only of a
 black heat, nearly but not red-hot, it was sure to burn the
 tongue most severely. — The latter circumstance gives much
 countenance to the solution          of the phaenomenon offered by
 W.    S.    It seems   somewhat analogous to what takes place
 with a drop of     water let fall on a plate of red-hot iron, which
 takes a much longer time to evaporate than a similar drop
 let fall on hot iron which would hardly shine in the dark.
     I shall here   state another fact,     which may, perhaps, but
 not quite so satisfactorily, be explaiued on similar principles.
 A gentleman informs me that he has seen an iron founder
 skim melted iron with his hand. The founder stated that he
 could only do it when the iron was boiling hot: — if of a
 lower heat, it would bum him. — A.            T.     '

 Hydrocephalus           interims, or dropsy of the ventricles of
the brain, is fatal to many children, and some adults. When
this disease is less in quantity, it probably produces a fever,
termed     a nervous fever, and        which    is sometimes called  a
worm fever, according to the opinion of Dr. Gilchrist, in
the Scots Medical Essays. This fever is attended with great
inirritability, as appears from the dilated pupils of the eyes,
in which it corresponds with the dropsy of the brain. And
the latter disease has its paroxysms of quick pulse, and in
                                                                  that

                  Memoirs    of Erasmus Darwin, M.D.                        159
that respect         corresponds      with other      fevers  with    inirrita-
bility.
     The hydrocephalus internus is distinguished from                apoplexy.
by its being attended with fever, and from nervous fever by
the paroxysms being very irregular, with perfect intermis
sions many times in a day.               In nervous fever the pain of
the head generally affects the middle of the forehead ; in hy
drocephalus internus it is generally on one side of the head.
One of the earliest criterions is the patient being uneasy on
 raising his head from            the  pillow,     aud  wishing   to lie down
 again immediately ; which             I  suppose is owing       to the pres
 sure of the water on the larger trunks of the blood-vessels en
 tering the cavity being more intolerable than on the smaller
 ones    ;  for,   if  the larger trunks are compressed, it must in
 convenience          the branches also; but if some of the small
 branches are compressed only, the trunks are not so im
 mediately incommoded.
      Blisters on the head,         and mercurial      ointment    externally,
 with calomel internally, are principally recommended in this
  fatal disease.        When the patient cannot bear to be raised up
  in bed without great uneasiness, it is a bad symptom.
  So   I   believe   is deafness,    which    is commonly      mistaken       for
  stupor.        And when the dilatation of the pupil of either eye,
  or the squinting, is very apparent, or the pupils of both eyes
  much dilated, it is generally fatal.                  As by stimulating
  one branch of lymphaties               into    inverted    motion,     another
  branch is liable to absorb              its  fluid more hastily ; suppose
   strong errhines, as common tobacco snuff to children, or
  one grain of turbith mineral,                   (hydrargyrus vitriolatus,)
   mixed       with ten or fifteen grains of sugar, was gradually
   blown up the nostrils? I have tried common snuff upon
   two children in this disease ; one could not be made to
   sneeze,      and the other was too near death to receive               advan
   tage.     When the mercurial preparations have produced sali
   vation, I believe they may have been of service, but I doubt
   their good effect otherwise. In one child I tried the tincture
   of digitalis ; but it was given with too timid a hand, and
   too late in the disease,        to determine its effects.
       As all    the above remedies      generally fail of success,       I think
                                                                       frequent,

   frequent, almost hourly, shocks of electricity from very
   small charges might be passed through the head in all direc
   tions with probability of good event ; and the use of the
   trephine, where the affected side can be distinguished. When
   one eye is affected, does the disease exist in the ventricle
   of that  side ?
       Hydrops thoracis. —The dropsy of the chest commences
  with loss of flesh, cold extremities, pale countenance, high-
   coloured urine in small quantity, and general debility, like
  many other dropsies. The patient next complains of numb
  ness in the arms, especially when elevated, with pain and
  difficulty of swallowing, and an absolute impossibility of
  lying down for a few minutes, or with sudden starting from
  sleep, with great difficulty    of breathing   and   palpitation   of
  his heart.
      The numbness of the arms is probably owing more fre
  quently to the increased action of the pectoral muscles in
 respiration, whence they are less at liberty to perform other
 offices, than to the connexion of nerves.         The difficulty of
 swallowing is owing to the compression of the cesophagus
 by the lymph in the chest ; and the impossibility of breath
 ing in a horizontal posture originates from this, that if any
 parts of the lungs must be rendered useless, the inability of
 the extremities of them must be less inconvenient to respi
 ration ;    since, if the upper parts or larger trunks of the
 air-vessels should be rendered        useless by the compression
 of   the accumulated    lymph,    the air could  not gain admit
 tance to the other parts, and the animal must immediately
 perish.
     If the pericardium is the principal seat of the disease,      the
pulse is quick and irregular.        If only the cavity of the tho
rax is hydropic,' the pulse is not quick nor irregular.
     If one  side is more  affected   than the other, the patient
                                                                     '
leans most that way, and has more numbness in that arm.
    The hydrops thoracis is distinguished from the anasarca
pulmonum, as the patient in the former cannot lie down
half a minute ; in the latter the difficulty of breathing, which
occasions him to rise up, comes on more gradually;, as the
transition of the lymph in the cellular membranes from one
                                                                 part

part to another of it is slower, than that of the effused lymph
in the cavity of the chest.
    The hydrops thoracis is often complicated with         fits of con
vulsive breathing; and then it produces a disease for the
time very similar to the common periodic asthma, which is
perhaps owing to a temporary anasarca of the lungs ; or to
an impaired venous       absorption in them.        These exacerba
tions of difficult breathing are attended with cold extremities,
cold breath, cold tongue, upright posture with the mouth
open, and a desire of cold air, and a quick, weak, intermit
tent pulse, and contracted hands.
    These exacerbations recur sometimes every two or three
hours, and are relieved by opium, a grain every hour for
two or three doses, with ether about a dram in cold water ;
and seem to be a convulsion        of  the muscles     of respiration
induced     by the pain   of the dyspncea.
    M. M. A grain of dried squill, and a quarter of a grain of
blue vitriol every hour for six or eight hours, unless it vomit
or purge. A grain of opium. Blisters. Calomel three grains

 Puncture in the side.
     Can the fluctuation in    the chest be heard by applying        the
 ear to the side, as Hippocrates       asserts ?   Can it be felt by
 the  hand    or by the  patient  before  the disease  is too great to
admit of cure by the paracentesis ? Does this dropsy of the
 chest often come on after peripneumony ?             Is it ever cured
by making the patient sick by tincture of digitalis ? Could
it be cured, if on one side only, by the operation of puncture
between the ribs, and afterwards by inflaming the cavity by
 the admission of air for a time, like the cure of the hydro-
 cele ; the pleura afterwards adhering wholly to that lobe of
 the.lungs, so as to prevent any future effusion of mucus?
    Obesitas.  — Corpulency    may be called an anasarca      or dropsy
 of  fat, since it must be owing to an analogous cause ; that
 is,  to the deficient absorption    of  fat compared to the quan
 tity secreted into the cells which contain it.
     The method ef getting free from too much fat               without
 any injury to the constitution,      consists, first, in putting on
 a proper bandage on the belly,       so that it can be tightened

or relaxed with ease, as a lightish under waistcoat, with 2
double row of buttons. This is to compress the bowels and
increase their absorption, and it thus removes one principal
cause        of corpulency, which                      is the looseness         of the skin.
Secondly, he should omit one entire meal, as supper ; by
this long abstinence from food the absorbent system will act
^n the mucus and fat with greater energy.        Thirdly, he
should drink as little as he can with ease to his sensations ;
since,       if        of the stomach and bowels supply
                  the absorbents
t.heblood with much, or perhaps too much, aqueous fluid,
the absorbents of the cellular membrane will act with less
energy.   Fourthly, he should use much salt or salted meat,
which will increase the perspiration and make him thirsty;
and if he bears this thirst, the absorption of his fat will be
greatly increased, as appears in fevers and dropsies with
thirst   ;        this       I   believe     to    be more efficacious            than soap.
Fifthly, he may use aerated alkaline water for his drink,
which may be supposed to render the fat more fluid,— or he
may take soap in large quantities, which will be decomposed
in the stomach. Sixthly, short rest, and constant exercise.
   Brnnchocele, — Swelled                         throat.     An enlargement of              the
thyroid glands, said to be frequent in mountainous countries,
whete river water is drunk which has its source from dis
solving snows. This idea is a very ancient one, but perhaps
not on that account to be the more depended upon, as au
thors copy one another.  ' Tumidum guttur quis miratur in
alpibus?' seems to have beena proverb in the time of Juvenal.
The inferior people of Derby are much subject to this dis
ease, but whether more so than other populous towns,                                           I

water  of the Derwent, which arises      mountainous coun     in   a

abundant      springs near Bowbridge       ; the water from which
might be conveyed to the town            in hollow bricks,' or clay-
pipes, at no very great expense, and might be received into
frequent reservoirs with pumps to them ; or laid into the
houses.
   M. M. Twenty        grains  of burnt sponge with        ten of nitre
made with mucilage into lozenges, and permitted to dissolve
slowly under the tongue twice a day, is asserted to cure in a
few months; perhaps other animal charcoal, as candle-
snuffs, might do the same.
   I  have directed in the early state      of this  disease a mixture
of common salt      and water to be held in the mouth, parti
cularly    under the tongue, for a few minutes, four or six
times a    day for many weeks, which has sometimes suc
ceeded   :  the salt and water is then spit out again, or       in part
swallowed.       Externally vinegar of squills       has been applied,
or  a  mercurial plaster,   or   fomentations     of  acetated ammo
niac, or ether. Some empiries have applied causties on the
bronchocele,     and   sometimes,     I  have been told, with suc
cess ;  which should certainly be used where there is danger
of suffocation from the bulk of it. One case I saw, and
one I was well informed of, where the bronchocele was
cured by burnt sponge, and a hectic fever supervened with
colliquative sweats ; but I do not know the final event of
either of them.
   De Haen affirms the cure of bronchocele to be effected by
flowers of zinc, calcined egg-shells, and scarlet cloth burnt
together in a close crucible ; which was tried with success,
as he assured     me, by   a late  lamented physician,       my friend,
Dr. Small of Birmingham.
   Scrophula. — King's evil is known by tumours of the lym
phatic glands, particularly of the neck.           The upper lip, and
division of the nostrils, is swelled, with a florid countenance,
a smooth skin, and a tumid abdomen. Cullen. — The absorbed
fluids in their course to the veins in the scrophula are ar
rested in the lymphatic or conglobate glands ; which swell,
and after a great length of time inflame and suppurate.

and consequent inflammation        of   those lymphatic glands where,
they first arrive, as in the axilla and groin. There is reason
to suspect, that the tonsils frequently become inflamed, and
suppurate from the matter absorbed from carious teeth ; and
I   saw a young lady,   who had both the axillary glands swell
ed, and which       suppurated ; which was believed to have
been caused  by her wearing a pair of new green gloves for
one day, when she had perspired much, and was much ex
hausted and fatigued by walking: the gloves were probably
dyed in a solution      of verditer.
  These indolent tumours of the lymphatic glands, which
constitute the scrophula, originate from the inirritability of
those glands ; which therefore sooner fall into torpor after
having been stimulated too violently by some poisonous
material ; as the muscles of enfeebled people sooner become
fatigued, and cease to act, when exerted, than those of
stronger    ones.   On     the   same    account  these scrophulous
glands     are much longer in acquiring         increase of motion,
alter having been stimulated  into inactivity, and either re
main years in a state of indolence, or suppurate with diffi
culty, and sometimes only partially.
  The difference between scrophulous tumours, and those
before described, consists in this ; that in those either glauds
of different kinds were diseased, or the mouths only of the
lymphatic glands were become torpid ; whereas in scrophula
the conglobate glands themselves become tumid, and gene
rally suppurate after a great length of time, when they ac
quire new sensibility.
    These indolent      tumours
                             may be brought to suppurate
sometimes by passing  electric shocks through them every
day for two or three weeks, as I have witnessed. It is pro
bable, that the alternate application of snow or iced water
to them, till they become painfully cold, and then of warm
flannel or warm water, frequently repeated, might restore
their irritability by accumulation of sensorial power ; and
thence either facilitate their dispersion,         or occasion them to
6iippurate.

which is seldom of better quality than water gruel, with a
little coarse bread iu it. Scrophulous ulcers are difficult to
heal; which is owing to the deficiency of absorption on their
pale and flabby surfaces, and to the general                              inirritability of
the system.

  to a catheter, and      introduced beyond the stricture in her
 throat   ; after  a few days her spirits sunk, and she refused to
  use it further,    and died. Above thirty years ago I proposed
  to an old gentleman, whose throat was entirely impervious, to
 supply him with a few ounces of blood daily from an ass,
 or from    the human animal, who is still more patient and
 tractable, in the following manner:             To fix a silver pipe
 about an inch long to each extremity of a chicken's gut, the
 part between the two silver ends to be measured by filling it
 with warm water        ; to put one end into the vein of a person
 hired for that purpose, so as to receive the blood returning
 from the extremity ; and when the gut was quite full, and
 the blood running through the other silver end, to introduce
 that end into the vein of the         patient upwards towards the
 heart, so    as   to admit no air along with the blood.         And
 lastly, to support the gut and silver ends on a water plate,
filled with water of ninety-eight degrees of heat, and to
 measure how many ounces of blood was introduced by pass
 ing   the finger, so as to compress the gut, from the receiving
 pipe to the delivering pipe ; and thence to determine how
 many     gut-fulls    were   given from the healthy person to the
•patient.     Mr.          considered a day on this proposal, and
 then another day, and at length answered, that            " he  now
 found himself near the house of death ; and that         if he could
 return, he was now too old to have much enjoyment of life ;
 and therefore he wished rather to proceed to the end Of that
journey, which        he was now so near, and which he must at
 all events soon go, than return for so short a time."             He
 lived but a few days afterwards, and seemed quite careless
 and easy about the matter.

        DEAR SIR,
 HAVING        availed myself     of  the   opportunity      you procured
 for me, of making       a chemical        examination      of   the calculi
 contained     in the Hunterian         Museum,       as  well  as  those  in
 your own collection,        I  herewith      send   you an      account   of
 what I have done.
     Should the observations appear to you to throw any new
 light upon the formation of calculi, I request that you will
 do me the honour of laying them before the Royal Society.
     The collection which       I  have examined,        is not    only un
 commonly large, but the greater            part of the specimens        have
 histories of the case annexed to them.
    This circumstance enabled me not only to ascertain the
 situations in which the calculi were found, but likewise many
 of the circumstances attendant on their formation.
    I  have   therefore endeavoured          to form      an   arrangement
 upon these principles, with           a view to render the subject
more clear and perspicuous,

 Of   Calculi formed in    the Kidneys,      and voided without having

    These have the following properties :
    They are of a brownish yellow colour, sometimes of a
grayish bue, which seems to arise from              a   small portion      of
dry mucus adhering to their surface.
    They   are entirely soluble in a solution of pure potash, and
during   their  solution they seldom emit an odour of ammonia.
    When heated to dryness, with nitric acid, the residuum
is of  a fine and   permanent red colour.
    When     exposed to the action of the               blow-pipe,      they

blacken and emit       a strong odour of burning animal matter,
very different from that of pure uric acid. This arises from
a variable proportion of animal matter which they contain,
and which occasions the loss in the analysis                of these calculi.
Its relative quantity is liable to much variation,                as may be
seen from the following statements.
   A  calculus from the kidney,           weighing seven grains, was
dissolved in    a  solution of pure potash.           A quantity of TOUT
riatic acid (rather more than sufficient for the saturation of
the potash) was added, and the precipitate of uric acid thus
obtained weighed when dry 4.5 grains. No other substance,
except animal matter, which was evident on attempting to
obtain the muriate of potash, could be detected, consequent
ly the composition of this calculus was as follows :
                                                  On.
                        Uric   acid       -       4'5

                                                   7'0
   This   is the largest proportion of animal matter which I
have   met   with.^
   A small calculus from the kidney, weighing 3. 7 grains,
afforded by a like treatment 3'5 grains of uric acid, so that
it was nearly     a pure  specimen of that substance.
   The largest calculus of this kind which I have examined
weighed seventeen grains ; much larger ones have been
found, but there is no evidence of their not having remained
in the urinary passages for some considerably time. Thus
Dr. Heberden mentions            one weighing twenty.eight grains*.
   It  often happens that the ingredients are not united toge
ther so as to form a calculus, but are voided in the state qf
a fine powder, commonly termed sand. This consists either
of uric acid, or of         the ammoniaco.magnesian phosphate,
alone,   or  with   the  phosphate of lime.
   I am induced to believe that the last-mentioned substances,
although the production of the kidneys, and held in solution,
are never met      with in    a separate   state  till  the urine has been

at  rest, and therefore calculi from       the kidneys     are never
composed of the phosphates.
   In a few instances, calculi from the kidneys, composed of
oxalate of lime, are voided ; but this is a very rare occur
rence  :  of three preserved   in the Hunterian collection,       two
are extremely small and hard, having an appearance           of being
made up     of  several smaller calculi,  of a dark brown colour.
The third is of the size of a small pea,        its surface smooth,
and of a gray colour, and not very hard.
                             Section TI.
       Of  Calculi which   have been retained  in   the Kidney.
   When one or more of the calculi described in             the  pre
ceding section are detainedjn the infundibula or pelvis of the
kidney, it frequently happens that they increase in that si
tuation to a considerable size.
   This increase is of two kinds.
   1 . Where there is a great disposition to the formation of
uric acid, the calculus consists wholly of that substance and
animal matter, so      as frequently to form a complete cast        of
the pelvis of the kidney.
   2. Where there is less disposition to form uric acid, the
external laminae are composed of the ammoniaco-magnesian
phosphate, and phosphate of lime.
   In one instance, a small uric calculus had been deposited
in  the kidney,    in such a situation that its upper surface was
exposed    to a  continual stream of urine, upon which beau
tiful crystals of   the triple phosphate had been deposited.        It
would therefore seem, that, under common circumstances,
a stream of urine passing over a calculus of uric acid has a
tendency to deposit the phosphate upon it.

                 Of Calculi of the urinary   Bladder.
    Calculi met with in     the bladder are  of four kinds.
    1. Those formed upon nuclei of uric acid, from the kidney.
    2. Those formed upon nuclei of oxalate of lime, from the
kidney.
    3. Those formed upon sand or animal mucus,              deposited
in the bladder,

  I JO       On the Differencet in the Structure              of Calculi.
      4. Those formed upon extraneous bodies introduced into
 the bladder.
      They were arranged under the following divisions.
      1.  Calculi,   which from their external appearance                consist
 chiefly of uric acid.
     These calculi vary in colour from               a deep     reddish brown,
 to   a pale yellowish brown.
     They are either entirely soluble in a solution of pure pot
ash, or nearly so.                                                              * •
     During their solution they frequently emit the odour of
ammonia.
      When    acetic acid is added to their alkaline solution,            a pre
cipitate possessing the properties              of  uric acid is obtained.
     2.  Calculi, composed chiefly of the ammoniaco-magnesiaa
phosphate, or of phosphate of lime, or of mixtures of the two.
     These calculi are externally of a whiter appearance than
the former.
     Some perfectly white, others gray, occasionally exhibiting
small prismatic crystals upon their surface; others again soft
and friable, a good deal resembling chalk. They are further
characterized by their solubility in dilute muriatic acid.
     3. Calculi, containing oxalate of lime ; commonly called
mulberry calculi.
     These are distinguished by the difficulty with which they
dissolve in dilute acids, by their hardness, and by leaving
pure lime, when exposed to the action of the blowpipe.
     In  the examination      of    these calculi,      I was struck with the
small number        of those strictly belonging to the first division,
having      been   led, from the account of Fourcroy and Vau-
quelin*,      and the experiments of Dr. Pearson f, to believe
that calculi composed of pure uric acid were by no means
nnfrequent.
    The greater number of            the calculi examined by the former
chemist*, are stated to be completely soluble in the fixed al
kaline leys ; and of three hundred examined by Dr. Pearson,
a large proportion       is said to consist        of uric acid.

ferent calculi found in the bladder which I have examined.

     6                             chiefly of oxalate of lime.
  150
    To injure these calculi          as  little as possible, they were care
fully cut through with a            fine saw, and a portion     of the whole
cut surface removed           by a file ; in      this way all the different
ingredients of       the calculi were obtained.
    In the experiments upon uric calculi from the bladder,                   I
found in most instances, a far more considerable loss in
attempting to obtain their pure uric acid, than in the kidney
palculi ; which led me to suppose that they contained urea,
and that the presence of this substance, with some of the
salts    of urine,    and with small portions          of the ammoniaco-
magnesian phosphate, was the cause of the occasional evo
lution of ammonia when treated with the fixed alkalis, and
pf their easy solubility in those substances. .
    To determine this point, a small calculus weighing twenty-
five grains, and of the species commonly supposed to consist
of urate of ammonia*, was digested for two hours with water
in a very moderate heat. The water which had assumed a
pale yellow colour was filtered               off, and fresh water added to
the residuum three successive                 times, when it appeared that
every thing soluble in that fluid was separated.                  The inso
luble part of the calculus, being now carefully dried and
weighed, was found to have lost 5-5 grains.
                                        ¦
   *
      Fourcroy observes that urate of ammonia is easily detected by its rapid
solubility in the fixed alkalis, and the odour of ammonia, which is perceived
during its solution. — Vide Thomson's Syst, of Chem. vol. v. p. C91.
                                                                        The

      The   aqueous   solution was evaporated by a gentle heat,
  nearly to dryness, .and a substance was obtained having all
  the properties of urea, in combination with a small portion
  of muriate of ammonia,        and  of  the ammoniaco-magnesian
  phosphate.
      Sixty grains of another calculus of a considerable size,
.supposed, from a superficial analysis, to consist of nearly
 pure urate of ammonia, were digested at a low temperature
 in one ounce of alcohol.          In an hour the alcohol was de
 canted off, and fresh portions were         added  successively, as
 long as it appeared to act upon the calculus, which, after
 having been carefully dried in a temperature below 219°,
 weighed 54'8 grains, so that 5.2 grains had been taken up
 by the alcohol.
     On evaporating the alcoholic solutions, a substance was
 obtained having all the properties of urea, with a small por
 tion of saline matter, probably muriate of ammonia, as by
 the addition   of   potash  a  slight ammoniacal odour was per
 ceptible ; its quantity however was too minute for accurate
 examination.
     The remaining      portion of the calculus, weighing 54-8
grains, was treated with small portions of acetic acid, by
which six grains of the ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate
were obtained.
     The part of   the  calculus remaining after this treatment,
weighing 48.8 grains, was perfectly soluble in a solution of
pure potash ; it emitted no ammoniacal odour when acted
upon by the alkali, and possessed the properties         oj pure  uric
acid.
    The following therefore    is the composition   of this calculus.

     The mulberry calculus (oxalate of lime) I have but rarely
 met with.      In those preserved in the Hunterian collection,
 there is a large relative proportion of phosphate of lime, and
 of uric acid. The purest of them afforded

      When calculi of   the urinary bladder increase to a very large
 Size, they are generally composed of two or even three of the
 abovementioned varieties, the ammoniaco-magnesian phos
 phate being situated externally, and in the greatest abundance.
      The largest calculus which I have seen, weighed, when
  recently removed from the bladder, twenty-three ounces and
  twenty-six grains.      It consisted of a large mulberry or oxa
  late of lime calculus, the nucleus of which was uric acid,
  surrounded by a considerable quantity of the ammoniaco-
  magnesian phosphate in a very pure state.
      Another very large calculus, weighing fifteen ounces and
  a half, consisted of a nucleus of uric acid, enveloped in the
  ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate, not however pure, but
  intersected by several laminae of uric acid.
      Four distinct substanges are extremely rare in calculi ;      I
  have seen one in which the uric acid, the ammoniaco-mag
   nesian phosphate, the phosphate of lime, and the oxalate of
   lime, were all in perfectly separate and distinct layers.
      Four calculi, having the following extraneous substances
   for their nuclei, were examined.
       1. A common garden pea.
    • 2. A needle.
      3. A hazel nut.

    The deposition of calculous matter upon the bougie was
 covered with blood, and in very small quantity, the bougie
 having been removed by an operation soon after it had
 passed into the bladder.           It  appeared   to consist chiefly         of
 phosphate of lime.
    The incrustation upon the hazel nut was also destitute                    of
 uric acid.

      4. THE RHINOCEROS.
      The urine of this animal      is exceedingly turbid at the time
  it  is voided, and, when allowed to remain           at rest,   deposits
  2 very large proportion of sediment, which consists of car
  bonate of lime, with small portions of phosphate of lime
  and animal matter.
      5.   THE Doo.
      A large calculus from the bladder of a dog twenty years
  old, weighing sixteen ounces, was extremely hard, and of
 a gray cotour ; when cut through, it exhibited a nucleus
 about the size      of  a hazel nut,  partly made up      of concentric
 layers of phosphate of lime, and partly of crystals of the
 ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate.                 The part of the stone
 surrounding      the nucleus consisted      of
               Phosphate of lime          -         -       64.

    •6.   THE Hop.
    A    calculus from the bladder     of this animal weighed nine
teen drachms       ;  it was of   a pale gray colour        inclining to
white,      and so hard that it was      with difficulty cut through.
                                                                      lu

                                To  Mr. Tilloch.
       SIR,
 At    will  be found,     on comparing the tables in the various
 publications       that have    noticed the subject of artificial cold,
  (Cavallo's Experimental Philosophy excepted,) with the fol
 lowing tables; or with the tables in the Philosophical Trans
actions, where these experiments originally appeared,, that se
veral errors, respecting the effects of the frigorific mixtures,
have happened.           An error of this kind in one instance, viz.
in the ninth mixture, of the first table,              is no less than forty-
two degrees ; the result in that instance being               — 21°,    whereas
in   the copied tables      it  is rendered     21°.
     This error     seems to have arisen from the person who co
pied     the tables from          the Philosophical Transactions,             or
my publication, originally, having              overlooked     the  minus  cha
racters expressed in Table I. altogether.
     Various other errors, likewise,            will, on examination, be
detected,      particularly in the first four mixtures of Table II.
     Desirous that these errors should             be corrected      in  future
publications,      I have  taken the liberty of addressing this to you,
with a genuine copy. I am, sir, your obedient servant,

 being well calculated to initiate young people into a know
 ledge of the subject of which it treats.         The favourable re
 ception it has had with the public, justifies the opinion we
 gave of the former editions.          The present one has fresh
 claims to praise.      We    have examined    it with    some   degree
 of care,    and are happy to find that the author's industry has
 kept pace with the discoveries that have been made in this
 interesting and useful branch of knowledge.               Parents and
 teachers will derive assistance from this work, in their efforts
to impress upon young minds, along with what is highly
amusing       and  gratifying to an inquisitive pupil, some ideas
of     that power, wisdom and goodness which pervades the
universe — an aim of which the author seems never to have
lost sight throughout his pages.
         Review  of Publications of Art. Nos.       1, 2, and 3.
     The   above is the title of  a quarterly publication      confess
edly written as a successor to The Artist, a periodical work
which has now ceased, and from which we recently pre
sented the readers     of  the Philosophical   Magazine with      some
interesting Essays.
     The editors of the Review now before us have ably taken
up the functions of their predecessors in The Artist, and it
is but justice to give it as our opinion, that hitherto their
labours have been distinguished by sound judgement, and
more than common critical acumen. Their zeal for the en
 couragement of the imitative arts is evident from the in
trepid manner in which they discharge what they conceive
to be their duty, in censuring the tendency of modern artists
to flatter the prevailing prejudices     of fashion    at the  expense
•f    true taste and sound judgement.

  .1  HIS   society assembled after the summer vacation on
Thursday, Nov. 10th, 180S, the right hon. Sir Joseph Banks,
president, in the chair.        The  secretary   read a summary      of
                                                                 M.  de

M.    de   Luc's   paper on the action       of electricity   and galvanism,
or the electroscopical agency of electric and galvanic mat
ter.  In this paper M. de Luc proved that neither electricity
nor galvanism have any chemical action unless when com
bined with other bodies : that the galvanic and electric fluid
are essentially the same, as zinc has the greatest affinity
for electricity, and silver next to           it;
                                    so that, when these two
metals are separated            by
                         moistened paper, the reciprocal elec
tric attraction   called into action, in the same manner as
                     is
by the friction of the electric machine; and that          the          it    is
 action     and    re-action     of this attraction which           have      given
birth to the appellation of positive and negative electricity.
The simple electric or galvanic fluid, he also stated, passes
 through bodies without producing any chemical changes,
 unless the bodies were previously prepared and the electricity
 highly concentrated.
      November      17   — 24. The Croonian            lecture on the muscles
 of the heart       and    the motion    of    the blood,      by   Dr. Young,
 (Foreign Sec. R. S.) was read. This lecture was continua           a
 tion of the author's former paper on the motion of fluids in
 elastic or flexible tubes, which appears in the first part of
 the Transactions          of   the present     year.     Dr. Y. took       a   view
 of           of fever, and its effects on the blood, as well
      the nature
 as of blood.letting, which he considered as generally in
 adequate to produce the effect intended.     He also gave                           a
 theory  of mortification, which   the  Germans call   " cold           a
 burning."
      A    paper   by   Mr. Childers    containing some ob
                                       was     read,
  servations and experiments on the most ceconomical means
  of constructing very powerful galvanic batteries. From                             a
' number of experiments performed in the presence of Mr.
 Davy       and others,     Mr. Childers concludes, that            if   it   is   de-
 aired to act on substances          which are non-conduclors              of      gal
 vanism,      very broad plates of copper and zinc are preferable                     ;
 but   if   on substances which are good conductors, then nar
 row plates in greater numbers will be found most conveni
 ent the former continue to emit fluid for forty-eight hours,
       :
 the latter for     a    much shorter time      ;   but they emit        it   much
 quicker,      and arc better adapted to general experiments.                      Mr.
                                                                             C.    alse

  C. also recommends the having the plates moveable instead
  of being soldered together, as the trough can be much easier
  cleared      out after using it. He recommends to make the
  troughs of glass or Wedgwood's ware, in preference to the
  materials hitherto employed.
               WERNERIAN        NATURAL HISTORY SOCIETY.
      At    the meeting      of the Wernerian Natural History So
  ciety, 1st August, Dr. James Ogilby of Dublin read a very
 interesting account of the mineralogy of East Lothian, which
 appeared to have been drawn up from a series of observa
 tions, made with great skill, and was illustrated by a suite
 of 350 specimens laid upon             the table.    As  the county is  in
 general      deeply covered     with soil, and profusely clothed with
 vegetables,       the   determination    of the different formations
 must have          been a work     of considerable labour ; and the
 skill, judgement         and perseverance    of the observer must have
been frequently put to the trial.            The doctcr, after describ
ing     the  physiognomy       or external  aspect of the county, gave
 a particular account of the different formations of which it
 is composed.           They are as follows : — Transition ; Indepen
dent Coal ; Newest Floetztrap ; and Alluvial.                   When de
scribing       the  different transition  rocks,   he alluded  particular
ly to the supposed granite of Fassnet, (described by profes
sor Playfair in his Illustrations of the Huttonian theory,)
which he proved to be a stratified bed of transition green
stone.        The description of       the rocks  of  the newest floetz
trap formation was           particularly interesting, not only on ac
count      of   the beautiful transitions he pointed out, but also
as    it proved    the   existence of   a  considerable    tract of  these
rocks in Scotland,          where their occurrence had been disput
ed.       He enumerated and described the following members
of this formation : — trap-tuff; amygdaloid : clay-stone; ba
salt; porphyry-slate; and porphyry-slate inclining to green
stone.        He found the trap-tuff, which is a coarse mechani
cal deposite, forming the lowest member of the series, and
resting immediately on the coal-formation : on this tuff
rests amygdaloid          containing fragments : above this amyg
daloid is common amygdaloid free of fragments ; this, in
                                                                        its

ks turn,      is covered         with basalt     :   the basalt gradually passes
into, and                                and the porphyry-
                is covered with, porphyry-slate                      :
slate, in some instances, appears to pass into greenstone,
which forms the uppermost portion of the formation : — So
that we have thus            a   beautiful series of transitions                         from the
coarse mechanical,               to fine chemical            ;   that     is,
                                                                            from trap.tuff
to porphyry.slate           inclining     to greenstone.                  The doctor also
remarked, that                    contains crystals of felspar
                           the amygdaloid
which have an earthy aspect    the basalt, crystals of felspar
                                            ;
possessing the characters of common    felspar and the por                  ;
phyry-slate, glassy felspar — facts which coincide with, and
                                        ;
are illustrative of the increasing fineness of the solution, from
the oldest to the newest members                     of          the formation.           Jn       the
course of his paper, the doctor gave distinct and satisfac
tory answers to the following queries, which had been pro
posed     professor Jameson — 1. Does the Bass rock
          by                                :            the                                  in
Frith of Forth belong                to the newest floetz-trap                      formation       ?
2. Does the sienitic greenstone of Fassnet    East Lothian                 in
belong to the transition rocks, or to the newest floetz.trap
formation       ?   3.   Are     the geognostic relations  of the porphyry-
slate,    or clinkstone-porphyry,                of East Lothian, the same
as   in other countries? The doctor announced his intention of
reading, at the next meeting of the society,    description                     a
of the different veins that occur in East Lothian, and of
giving    short statement of the geognostical and (economi
          a
cal inferences to be deduced from the appearances which he
has investigated with so ranch care.           indeed only           It   is                        by
investigations  like those of Dr. Ogilby, that we obtain any
certainty respecting the mineral treasures of country      and             a                  ;
such  alone can  afford us  data for  legitimate theory of
                                                         a the
formation of the globe.
     At   the       same    meeting,        a   communication                   from colonel
Montagu was                read, describing  new species of Fasciola,
                                                     a
of   a   red colour,        and about an inch long, which sometimes
lodges in the trachea of chickens, and which the colonel
found to be the occasion of the distemper called the gapes,
so fatal to these useful tenants of the poultry-yard.  The
 knowledge of the true cause of this malady will,                                   it   is   hoped,
 BOOH be followed              by   the discovery        of      a   specific cure:           in   th§

   mean time,      a very simple popular remedy is employed in
   Devonshire    :  the meat of the chicks (barley or oat meal) it
   merely mixed up with           urine,   in place    of water;   and   thii
   prescription is very generally attended with the best effects.
      At the meeting of this Society on the 12th of November,
  the Rev. Andrew Jameson, minister             of St.Mungo, Dumfries
  shire, read Observations on Meteorological                Tables, with a
  Description of a new Anemometer.                   After some general
  remarks on the importance of meteorological observations,
  and on the merits and         defects    of  registers  of the weather,
  &c. he pointed out what he considered to be the best form
  of a meteorological journal, and then described the external
  form and internal structure of an extensive and complete
 meteorological observatory, and enumerated                  about twenty
 different instruments which ought to find a place in every
 establishment of that kind. The anemometer which he de
 scribed will, by     a very simple and ingenious arrangement of
 parts, enable the most common observer to ascertain the ve
 locity of the wind with perfect accuracy.
     At the same meeting, the Rev. John Fleming, F. A .S.Ed.,
minister of Bressay in Shetland, (who has for some time
 past been engaged in examining the mineralogy of those
 remote islands,) communicated an interesting account of the
 geognostic relations of the rocks in the islands of Unst and
 Papa Stour.
     After a general    account of the position, extent and exter
nal appearance       of  the island of Unst, he next described the
different rocks of which it is composed, in the order of their
relative antiquity, and remarked that their general position
is from    S.W.    to N.E.      The rocks       are   gneiss, mica-slate,
clay.slate,    limestone,     hornblende-rock,        potstone, and ser
pentine.      The gneiss in     some     places   appeared to alternate
with the     oldest mica.slate,       and in others to contain beds       of
hornblende-rock.          The mica.slate, which        is the most abun
dant rock in the island,         is traversed by numerous contem
poraneous     veins   of  quartz, and also of felspar, and passes
distinctly into clay-slate.         It contains beds of hornblende-
rock and of limestone.           The clay-slate occurs but sparing
ly.     The potstone usually accompanies           the serpentine.     The
                                                                serpentine

               JVernerian Natural History Society.             189
 terpentine  occurs in great abundance, in beds, in the oldest
clay-slate and newest mica-slate, and hence must be referred
to the oldest or first serpentine formation of Werner.
    The island of Papa Stour, situated on the west coast         of
the Mainland, (as the largest of the islands is called,) con
tains no primitive rocks, but appears to be entirely composed
of floetz rocks. These are conglomerate, greenstone, clay-
stone,    porphyrinic stone, hornstone, (perhaps clinkstone,)
and sandstone. The sandstone, as appears from observa
tions made in this island and other parts       of Shetland, pro
bably belongs to the oldest coal-formation       : it is uniformly
situated below the other rocks above mentioned.
    As Mr. 'Fleming     announced    his intention of again ex
amining the whole of the Shetland islands, and of construct
ing mineralogical mans of them, in which the rocks should
be laid down according to their relative antiquity and extent,
much valuable information may be expected.
    At the meeting of the Society on the 1 9th of November,
Mr. Mackenzie, jun. of Applecross read a short Account of
the Coal-formation in the Vicinity of Durham. From the
precise and accurate    description communicated by this gen
tleman, the rocks appear to belong to the oldest coal-for
mation of Werner.        During the course of his observations
 he  explained what is called the creep by miners, and exhi
bited specimens of the different rocks, with a section of the
 coal-mine of Kipia, in which both the miners' and the sci
 entific names of the different strata were inserted.
    At the  same   meeting, Dr. Ogilby, of Dublin, read the
continuation of his Mineralogical Description of East Lo
thian, describing the different veins which he observed in
that tract  of country.    These he considered as     of three dif
ferent periods of formation, viz. 1. Such as are derived from
 partial formations subsequent to the floetz -trap,which are of
 rare occurrence ; 2. Veins of the different rocks of the forma
 tion penetrating the older beds; and 3. Those of contem
 poraneous origin. He then enumerated and described, ac
 cording to the manner of Werner, veins of greenstone,
jasper, quartz, heavy-spar,      and calc-spar.

       At this meeting, also, Mr. P. Neill         read an   account of a
   great Sea Snake,      lately cast ashore in Orkney. This curious
   animal,   it appears, was stranded in Rolhesholm Bay, in the
   island of Stronsa.        Malcolm Laing, Esq., M.P., being in
   Orkney at the time, communicated the circumstance to his
   brother, Gilbert Laing, Esq., advocate at Edinburgh, on
   whose property the animal had been cast. Through this au
   thentic   channel    Mr. Neill    received   his information.       The
   body measured     fifty- five feet  in length, and     the   circumfe
   rence  of the thickest part might be equal to the        girth of an
   Orkney pony.       The    head was not larger than     that   of a seal,
   and was furnished with two blow holes.             From    the   back a
  number     of filaments (resembling in texture the fishing-
  tackle known by the name of silk-worm gut) hung down
  like a mane. On each side of the body were three large fins,
  shaped like paws, and jointed.             The body was unluckily
  knocked to pieces       by   a tempest   ;  but the fragments have
  been collected by     Mr. Laing, and are to be transmitted to
  the museum at Edinburgh.            Mr. Neill concluded with re
  marking, that no doubt could be entertained that this was
  the kind of animal described by Ramus, Egede, and Pon-
  toppidan, but which scientific and systematic naturalists
  had hitherto rejected as spurious and ideal.

     A  letter, dated Manchester, and signed John Bradbury,
 was laid before the Society, at their late meeting, stat
 ing that the proprietors of the Liverpool Botanic Garden
 had resolved on forming an establishment at New Orleans,
 America, with a view to collect the plants of Kentucky and
 Louisiana,     and to transmit to England        living duplicates of
 the plants which should be so collected and multiplied on
 such establishment ; and desiring to be informed if the
Dublin Society would, in consideration of             green specimens
of the    same,   contribute to the expense,        their quota not to
exceed     tool, per annum.

  W e have     received   a  second communication       with the sig
 nature O., and hearing the above title.         Had it come with
 the author's name, we should have given it insertion.            But
we cannot permit, in our pages, on anonymous authority,
 a repetition of such statements, after they have been once
 answered.   An honourable assailant       (and we mean not to in
sinuate that O. will show himself otherwise) can have no ob
jection to avow himself. Tf O. hesitate to give his own name,
he cannot be surprised that we should hesitate to lend ours.
    For the same reason we must         refuse  insertion to  a com
munication    signed S. To this communication we have also
to object, that several of the alleged facts are incorrect, and
consequently the conclusions unfounded.
    Another correspondent,       A.  C,   has sent us an article en

mands that we refuse this anonymous communication a place

  composition by electricity, and stated various new facts ob
  tained in consequence of the application of them.
      The    result3 of the experiments on potash and soda, as                       I
  stated     in my last communication to the Society, afforded
  me the strongest hopes of being able to effect the decom
  position      both of the alkaline and common earths                  ;  and the
  phaenomena obtained in the first imperfect trials made upon
 those bodies, countenanced the ideas that had obtained frcrm
  the earliest periods of chemistry, of their being metallic in
 their nature §.

     § Beccher is the first chemist, as far as my reading informs me, who di
 stinctly pointed out the      relations of metals to earthy substances ; See Phys.
 subt. Lipsiae, 4to, p. 61.     He was followed by Stahl, who has given the doc
 trine a more perfect form.     Beccher's idea was that of an universal elementary
 earth, which, by uniting      to an inflammable    earth, produced all the metals,
 and under other modifications formed stones.         Stahl admitted distinct earths
 which    he supposed might be converted into metals by combining         with phlo
 giston;   see Stahl Fundament.     Chyni. p. 9, 4to, and Conspect. Chem. 1, 77,

 phers seem to have adopted the opinion of the possibility of the production of
 metals from common earthy substances ; See Boyle, vol. i. 4to, p. 564, and
 Grew, Anatomy of Plants, lee. ii. p. 242. But these notions were founded
upon a kind of alchemical hypothesis of a general power in nature of trans
muting one species of matter into another. Towards the end of the last cen
 tury the doctrine was advanced in a more philosophical form ; Bergman sus
 pected barytes to be a metallic calx, Pravf. Sciagrap. Reg. Min. and Opusc.

 metallic substance, See Annates de Chimie, vol. x. p. 257. — Lavoisier extended

    Many difficulties however occurred in the way of obtain
ing complete evidence on this subject : and the pursuit of
the inquiry has required much labour and a considerable de
votion of time, and has demanded more refined and com
plicated processes than those which had succeeded with the
fixed alkalis.                   s
     The earths, like      the fixed alkalis,     are non.conductors        of
electricity    ;  but the fixed alkalis become conducting by fu
sion :    the infusible nature of the earths, however, rendered
it impossible       to operate upon them in this state : the strong
affinity of    their bases fpr oxygen, made it unavailing to act
upon them in solution in water;              and the only methods that
proved successful, were those of operating upon them by
electricity in some of their combinations, or of combining
them at the moment of their decomposition by electricity,
in metallic alloys, so as to obtain evidences of their nature
and properties.
     I delayed for some time laying an account of many of the
principal results which I obtained before the Society, in the
hopes of being able to render them more distinct and satis
factory; but finding          that for this end a more powerful bat
tery, and more perfect apparatus than I have a prospect of
seeing very soon constructed, will be required, I have ven
tured to bring         forwards the investigation in its present im
perfect state ;      and I shall prefer the imputation of having
published unfinished labours,            to that    of having concealed
any new facts from the scientific world, which may tend to
assist the progress of chemical knowledge.
II.    Methods employed        for  Decomposing the alkaline Earths.
     Barytes,     strontites,   and   lime, slightly      moistened, were
wrtion of Tondi and Ruprecht,      that the  earths might be reduced by char
coal ; and the accurate researches  of Klaprotli and Savaresi, who proved by
the most   decisive experiments, that the metals taken for the l',r o of the
earths were phosphurets of iron, obtained from the bone ashes and other
materials employed in the experiment, Aunnlc. de Clnmif, vol. viii. p. 18,
and vol. x. p. 257, 275.    Amidst all these hypotheses, potash and soda were
never considered as metallic in their nature : Lavoisier supposed them to con.
 tarn azote , nor at that time were there any analogies to lead that acuu
philosopher to a happier coniecture.
                                                                  electrified

                the Decomposition         of the Earths, &c.
electrified by iron wires under naphtha, by the same methods,
and with the same powers as those employed for the de
composition of the fixed alkalis'*. In these cases, gas was
copiously evolved, which was inflammable l and the earths
where in contact with the negative metallic wires became
dark coloured,        and exhibited small points having a metallic
lustre, which, when exposed to air, gradually became white ;
they became white likewise when plunged under water, and
when examined in this experiment by a magnifier, a greenish
powder seemed to separate from them, and small globules of
gas were disengaged.
  In     these cases there was great reason              to believe            that the
earths    had   been     decomposed ;          and     that their         bases    had
combined      with the iron, so as to form alloys decomposable
by the    oxygen of air or water ; but the indistinctness of the
effect, and the complicated circumstances required for                               it,
were such as to compel me to form other plans of operation.
   The strong attraction of potassium for oxygen, induced me
to try whether this body might not detach the oxygen from
the earths,     in   the same manner as          charcoal decomposes the
common metallic oxides.
 I   heated potassium in contact with dry pure lime, barytes,
strontites, and magnesia, in tubes of plate glass    but as               ;         I
was obliged to use very small quantities, and as   could not
raise the heat to ignition without fusing the glass,                     I I   obtained
in this way no good results. The potassium appeared to act
upon the earths and on the glass, and dark brown substances
were obtained, which evolved gas from water; but no di
stinct metallic globules could be procured from these cir :
cumstances, and other like circumstances,      seemed pro           it
bable, that though potassium may partially de-oxygenate die
earths, yet its affinity for oxygen, at least at the tempera
ture which   Iemployed,      not sufficient to effect their de
                                 is
composition.
I   made mixtures of dry potash in excess and dry barytes,
lime, strontites, and magnesia, brought them into fusion,
and acted upon them in the voltaic circuit  the same man-      in

ner    as that  I  employed for obtaining the metals of the alka-
 lis.    My   hopes were, that the potassium and the metals of
the earths      might be de-oxygenated at the same time, and
enter into combination in alloy.
     In this way of operating,          the   results   were   more distinct
than in the last      :  metallic     substances    appeared,    less  fusible
than potassium, which burnt the instant after they had
formed, and which by burning produced a mixture of potash
and the earth employed ; I endeavoured to form them under                        '
naphtha, but without much success. To produce the result
at   kll, required    a charge by the action          of nitric acid, which
the state of the     batteries did not permit me often to employ*;
and the metal       was generated only in very minute films, which
could not be detached by fusion,               and which     were   instantly
destroyed by exposure to air.
     I had found in my researches upon potassium; that when
a mixture      of potash and the oxides of mercury, tin, or lead,
was electrified in the Voltaic circuit, the decomposition was
very rapid, and an amalgam, or an alloy of potassium, was
obtained ; the attraction between the common metals and
the potassium apparently accelerating the separation of the
oxygen.
     The   idea that a similar       kind of action might      assist the de
composition of the alkaline earths, induced me to electrify
mixtures of these bodies and the oxide of tin, of iron, of                       1
lead, of silver, and of mercury ; and these operations were
far more satisfactory than any            of the others.
    * The power of this combination, though it consisted of one hundred
                                                                          platei
of copper   and zinc of six inches, and one hundred and fifty of four inches,
at this time was not more than equal to that of a newly constructed apparatus
of one hundred and fifty of four inches. It had been made for the demon-
itrations in the Theatre of the Royal Institution in 1803; and since that time
bad been constantly employed in the anuual course of lectures, and had
•erred in different parts., for the numerous experiments on the decomposition
of bodies by electricity, detailed in the Bakerian Lectures for 1806 and 1807,
and a number of the plates were destroyed by corrosion.         I mention these
circumstances, because many chemists have been deterred from pursuing ex
periments on the decomposition of the alkalis and the earths, under the idea
that a very powerful combination was required for the effect. This, how
ever, a far from being the case ; ad the experiments detailed in the text may
be repeated by means of a Voltaic battery, containing from one hundred to
•Be hundred and fifty plates of four or six inches.
                                                                      A mix-

                the Decomposition         of the Earths, &c.           197
  A     mixture of two-thirds        of   barytes and one-third   of oxide
of silver very slightly moistened was electrified by iron wires ;
an effervescence took place at both points of contact, and a
minute quantity of a substance, possessing the whiteness of
silver, formed at the negative point. When the iron wire to
which this substance adhered was plunged into water con
taining   a   little alum in solution,         gas was disengaged,   which
proved to be hydrogen ; and white clouds which were found
to be sulphate of barytes, descended from the point of the
wire.
  A     mixture   of    barytes and red   oxide of mercury, in the
same proportions,         was electrified in the same manner.   A
small mass of solid amalgam adhered to the negative wire,
which evidently contained a substance, that produced barytes
by exposure to air, with the absorption of oxygen ; and which
occasioned the evolution of hydrogen from water, leaving
pure mercury, and producing a solution of barytes.
  Mixtures of lime, strontites, magnesia, and red oxide of
mercury,           in
              treated the same  manner, gave similar amal
gams, from which the alkaline earths were regenerated by
the action of air or water, with like phenomena; but the
quantities of metallic substances   obtained were exceedingly
minute; they appeared as mere superficial formations sur
rounding the point of the wire, nor did they increase after
the first few minutes of electrization, even when the process
was carried on for some hours.
   These experiments were made previous to April, 1808, at
which time  the batteries were so much injured by constant
use, as no longer to form an efficient combination. The in
quiry was suspended for a short time : but in May I was
enabled     to resume     it,   by
                           employing   new and much more
                                                 a
powerful combination,    constructed in the laboratory of the
Royal Institution, and consisting of five hundred pairs of
double plates of six inches square.

moment of iU formation; and when                     by

] 98                Electrochemical Researches on
faces   of  the conductors, this power      of ignition  was modified,
yet still the amalgam was only produced in thin films, and
I could not obtain globules sufficiently large to submit to
distillation.      When the transmitting wires were of iron of
the    same thickness,      the iron acquired the temperature of
ignition, and combined with the bases of the earths in pre
ference to the mercury, and metallic alloys of a dark gray
colour were       obtained,    which   acted on water with the evo
lution of hydrogen, and          were converted into oxide      of iron,
and alkaline earths.
    Whilst I     was engaged     in these   experiments, in the be
ginning of June, I received a        letter from Professor Berzelius
of Stockholm, in which he informed me that, in conjunction
with Dr. Pontin, he had succeeded in decomposing barytes
and h'me, by negatively electrifying mercury in contact with
them, and that in this way he had obtained amalgams of the
metals of these earths.
    I  immediately repeated these operations with perfect suc
cess ; a globule of mercury, electrified by the power of the
battery of 500, weakly charged, was made to act upon a
surface    of slightly moistened barytes, fixed upon          a plate   of
platina.     The mercury gradually       became   less fluid, and after
a few minutes was         found covered     with  a white film of ba
rytes ; and      when the amalgam was thrown into water, hy
drogen was disengaged, the mercury remained free, and a
 solution of barytes was formed.
    The result with lime,       as these  gentlemen had stated,      was
precisely analogous.
    That   the same happy methods must succeed with strontites
 and magnesia,       it was not easy to doubt, and      I quickly   tried
 the experiment.
    From strontites I obtained a very rapid result ; but from
 magnesia, in the first trials, no amalgam could be procured.
 By continuing the process, however, for a longer time, and
 keeping     the   earth  continually moist, at last a combination
 of   the basis with mercury was obtained, which slowly pro
 duced magnesia by absorption          of oxygen from air, or     by the
 action   of water.
    All  these amalgams       I found might be preserved for a con
                                                               siderable

             the Decomposition      of the Earths, &e.             1 99
siderable   period under naphtha.         In a length of time, how
ever, they became        covered     with  a  white crust under this
fluid.    When     exposed   to air, a very few minutes only were
required for the oxygenation of the bases of the earths. In
water the amalgam of barytes was most rapidly decomposed :
that of strontites and       that  of lime next in order     : but the
amalgam from magnesia, as might be expected from the
weak affinity of the earth for water, very slowly changed ;
when a little sulphuric acid was added to the water : how
ever, the evolution of hydrogen, and the production and so
lution of magnesia were exceedingly rapid, and the mercury
soon remained free.
    I was inclined to    believe    that  one  reason  why magnesia
was less easy to metallize than the other alkaline earths, was
its insolubility in water, which would prevent it from being
presented in the nascent state, detached from its solution at
the negative surface.         On this idea I tried the experiment,
using moistened sulphate of magnesia, instead of the pure
earth ; and I found that the amalgam was much sooner ob
tained. Here the magnesia was attracted from the sulphuric
acid, and probably deoxygenated and combined with the
quicksilver at the same instant.
    The amalgams of       the other     bases of  the alkaline earths,
could,    I found,   be obtained in the same manner from their
saline compounds.
    I tried in this way very successfully, muriate and sulphate
of lime, the muriate of atrontites, and of barytes, and ni
trate  of  barytes.   The   earths separated at the deoxygenating
surface, there seemed instantly to undergo decomposition,
and seized upon by the mercury, were in some measure de
fended from the action of air, and from the contact of water,
and preserved by their strong attraction for this metal.
III.   Attempts to procure the Metals of the alkaline Earths          }
                       and on their Properties.
    To procure quantities of amalgams sufficient for distilla
 tion, I combined the methods I had before em ployed, with
those of M. M. Berzelius and Pontin.
    The earths were slightly moistened, and mixed with one-
                                 N   4                           third

200                  Electrochemical Researches on
 third of red oxide      of mercury, the mixture          was placed on a
 plate of platina,     a cavity was made in the upper part of it to
 receive a globule of mercury, of from fifty to sixty grains in
 weight, the whole was covered by a film of naphtha, and the
 plate was      made positive, and the mercury negative, by a
 proper communication with the battery of five hundred.
     The amalgams obtained in this way were distilled in
 tubes    of plate glass,   or in some cases in tubes         of common
 glass. These tubes were bent in the middle, and the ex
 tremities were enlarged, and rendered glpbular by blowing,
 so as to serve the purposes of a retort and receiver.
     The    tube   after the amalgam had been introduced, was
 filled with naphtha, which was afterwards expelled by boil
ing, through a small orifice in the end corresponding to the
 receiver, which was hermetically sealed when the tube con
 tained nothing but the vapour of naphtha, and the amalgam.
     I found immediately that the mercury rose pure by distil
lation from the amalgam, and it was very easy to separate a
 part of it ; but to obtain a complete decomposition was very
 difficult.
     For this nearly a red heat was required, and at a red heat
 the bases    of the earths instantly acted upon the glass, and
 became oxygenated.          When the tube was large in propor
 tion to the quantity of amalgam, the vapour of the naphtha
 furnished oxygen sufficient to destroy part of the bases : and
when a small tube was employed, it was difficult to heat the
 part used as a retort sufficient to drive off the whole of the
mercury from the basis, without raising too highly the tem
 perature    of  the part serving for the receiver, so as to burst
 the tube    *.
     In consequence of these difficulties, in a multitude of
trials, I obtained only a very few successful results, and in
no case could I be absolutely certain that there was not a
minute portion of mercury still in combination with the
 metals of the earths.
     In  the best result that    I obtained from the distillation         of
    * When the quantity of the amalgam was about fifty or sixty grains, I
found that the tube could not be conveniently less than one.sixth of an inch
in diameter, and of the capacity of about half a cubic inch.
                                                                        the

the amalgam of barytes, the residuum appeared as a white
metal of the colour of silver.                 It was fixed at all common
temperatures,        but became fluid at        a heat below redness, and
did not rise in vapour when heated to redness, in a tube of
plate glass, but acted violently upon the glassy producing a
black mass, which seemed to contain barytes, and a fixed
alkaline basis, in the first degree of oxygenation*.
                                                                         When
   * From thU fact,
                       compared with other facts that have been stated, p. 195,
it may be con;ectured, that the basis of barytes has a higher affinity for oxy
gen than sodium ; and hence, probably, the bases of the earths will be more
powerful instruments for detecting oxygen, than the bases of the alkalis.
   I have tried a number of experiments on the action of potassium on bodies
supposed simple, and on the undecompounded acids.             From the affinity of
the metal for oxygen, and of the acid for the substance formed, I had enter
tained the greatest hopes of success. It would be inconsistent with the ob;ect
of this paper to enter into a full detail of the methods of operation ; I hope
to be able to state them fully to the Society at a future time, when they shall
be elucidated by further researches ; I shall now merely mention the general
results, to show that I have not been tardy in employing the means          which
were in my power, towards effecting these important ob;ects.
   When potassium was heated in muriatic acid gas, as dry as it could be ob
tained by common chemical means, there was a violent chemical action with
ignition i and when the potassium was in sufficient quantity, the muriatic
acid gas wholly disappeared, and from one-third to one-fourth of its volume
of hydrogen was evolved, and muriate of potash was formed.
   On fluoric acid gas, which had been in contact with glass, the potassium
produced a similar effect ; but the quantity of hydrogen generated       was only
one-sixth or one-seventh of the volume of gas, and a white mass was formed,
which principally consisted of filiate of potash and silex, but which emitted
fumes of fluoric acid when exposed to air.
   When boracic acid, prepared in the usual manner, that had been ignited,
was heated in a gold tube with potassium, a very minute quantity of gas only
was liberated, which was hydrogen, mixed with nitrogen (the last probably
from the common air in the tube); borate of potash was formed, and a black
substance,   which became white by exposure to air.
   In all these instances there is great reason to believe that the hydrogen was
produced from the water adhering to the acids ; and the different proportions
of it in the different cases, are a strong proof of this opinion. Admitting this
idea, it seems that muriatic acid gas must contain at least one-eighth or one-
tenth of its weight of water ; and that the water oxygenates in the experi
ment a quantity of potassium, sufficient to absorb the whole of the acid.
   In the cases>of fluoric and boracic acids, there is probably a decomposition
of  these bodies ; the black substance  produced from the boracic acid is similar
to that which I had obtained       from it by electricity.   The quantities that I
have operated upon, have been as yet too small to enable mc to separate and
                                                                          examine

    When exposed to air, it rapidly tarnished, and fell into a
white powder, which was barytes. When this process was
conducted in a small portion of air, the oxygen was found
absorbed, and the nitrogen unaltered; when a portion of it
was introduced into water, it acted upon it with great vio
lence and sunk to the boltom,               producing in it barytes ; and
hydrogen was generated.             The quantities in which I obtained
it were too minute for me to be able to examine correctly,
either its physical or chemical properties. It sunk rapidly in
water, and        even in sulphuric acid, though surrounded by
globules of hydrogen, equal to two or three times its volume;
from which it seems probable, that it cannot be less than
four or five times as heavy as water. It flattened by pres
sure, but required a considerable force for this effect.
    The metal from strontites sunk in sulphuric acid, and ex
hibited the same characters as that from barytes, except in
producing strontites by oxidation.
    The metal from lime, I have never been able to examine
exposed       to air or under naphtha.          In the case in which         I was
able to distil the quicksilver from it to the greatest extent,
the tube unfortunately broke, whilst warm ; and at the mo
ment that the air entered, the metal, which had the colour
and lustre of silver, instantly took fire, and burnt with an
intense white light into quicklime.
    The metal from magnesia seemed to act upon the glass,
even before the whole of the quicksilver was distilled from
it.    In an experiment in which I stopped the process before
the mercury was entirely driven off, it appeared as a solid,
ciamine     the products ; and till this is done, no ultimate conclusion can b«
drawn.
   The action of potassium upon muriatic acid gas, indicates a much larger
quantity     of water in this substance, than the action of electricity in Dr.
Henry's elaborate experiments; but in the one instance the acid enters into a
solid salt, and in the other it remains aeriform ; and the difficulty of decompo.
aition by electricity, must increase in proportion as the quantity of water dimi
nishes, so that at the apparent maximum of electrical effect, there is no reason
to suppose the gas free from water.
   Those persons who have supposed hydrogen to be the basis of muriatic
acid may, perhaps, give another solution of the phenomena, and consider
the experiment 1 have detailed as a proof of tliis opiaion.               .
                                                                           having

               the Decomposition     of the Earths, &c.               203
having the same whiteness and lustre as the other metals of
the earths.      It sunk rapidly in water, though surrounded by
globules of gas, producing magnesia, and quickly changed
in air, becoming covered with a white crust, and falling
into    a fine  powder, which proved to be magnesia.
    In   several eases in which amalgams           of the metals of the
earths, containing only a small quantity of mercury were
obtained, I exposed them to air on a delicate balance, and
always found that during the conversion of metal into earth,
there was a considerable increase of weight.
     I endeavoured to ascertain the proportions of oxygen, and
 bases,     in barytes and strontites, by heating amalgams               of
 them in tubes filled with oxygen, but without success.                    I
 satisfied    myself, however, that when the metals of the earths
 were burned in a small quantity of air they absorbed oxygen,
 gained weight itl the process, and were in the highly caustic
 or unslacked state; for they produced strong heat by the
 contact of water, and did not effervesce during their solution
 in acids.
     The evidence for the composition of the alkaline earths is
 then of the same kind as that for the composition of the
 eommon metallic oxides ; and the principles of their decom
  position are precisely similar, the inflammable matters in all
  cases separating at the negative surface in the Voltaic cir
  cuit, and the oxygen at the positive surface.
      These new substances will demand names                  ; and  on the
  same principles as       I have named    the bases     of the fixed alka
  lis, potassium      and sodium, 1 shall venture to denominate the
   metals from the alkaline earths barium, strontium, calcium,
   and magnium ; the last of these words is undoubtedly ob
  jectionable, but magnesium*            has been already applied to
   metallic manganese, and would consequently have been an
   equivocal term.

   quicksilver, and the common metals, by which                    I had suc
   ceeded in decomposing the alkaline earths, on alumine and
   silex ;  but without gaining distinct evidences of their having
  undergone any change in the processes.
      Obliged to seek for other means of acting upon them, it
  was necessary to consider minutely their relations to other
  bodies, and to search         for analogies by which the principles
  of research might       be guided.
      Alumine very slowly finds its point of rest at the negative
  pole, in the electrical circuit ; but silex, even when diffused
  in its gelatinous       state through water, rests indifferently at
  the negative or positive poles.
      From this indifference to positive and negative electrical
 attractions, following the general order of facts, it might be
 inferred, that if these bodies be compounds, the electrical
 energies of their elements are nearly in equilibrium ; and
 that their state is either analogous to that of insoluble neu
 tral salts, or of oxides nearly saturated with oxygen.
     The combinations of silex and alumine, with acids and
 alkalis, as well as their electrical powers, were not incon
 sistent with either of these ideas ; for in some respects they
 resemble in physical characters, fluate and phosphate of
 lime, as much as in others, they approach to the oxides of
 zinc and tin.
     On the idea that silex might be an insoluble neutrosalinc
 compound, containing an unknown acid or earth, or both,
 and capable of being resolved into its secondary elements, in
 the same manner as sulphate of barytes, or fluate of lime, I
made the      following experiments :
     Two gold cones*, connected by moistened amianthus,
were filled with pure water, and placed in the electrical cir
cuit, a small quantity of carefully prepared and well washed
silex was introduced         into the positive cone : the action was
kept up from a battery of two hundred plates, for some
hours, till nearly half of the fluid in each cone was exhaust
ed ; the remainders were examined ; the fluid in the cone
containing the silex was strongly acid            ; that in the opposite

                                                                          cone

              the Decomposition          of the Earths, &c.                    205
cone was strongly alkaline ;              the two fluids were
                                                 passed
through bibulous paper, and mixed together, when a pre
cipitate fell down, which proved to be silex.
   On the first view of the subject, it appeared probable that
this silex had been formed by the union of the acid and the
alkaline matter in the two cones, and that the experiment
demonstrated a decomposition and recomposition of silex ;
but before such a conclusion could be made, many points
were to be determined.
  It was possible that the acid might be nitric acid, pro
duced as   in other electrical experiments of
                                            a similar nature,
and that this  acid might have dissolved silex, which was
precipitated by the alkaline matter at the other pole, which
might be either potash used for dissolving the silex, which
had adhered   to     it,
                   notwithstanding the processes of Iixivia-
tion in acids, or ammonia produced in consequence of the
presence  of the atmosphere or potash was present, was
                                     ;       if                             it
likewise possible that the silex might have been carried over
in solution, with this alkali, from the positive to the nega
tive surface.
  Minute experiments            were instituted and completed               in the
same manner as those detailed                in   the
                                               Philosophical               Trans
actions for   1   807, p.   7   *,which soon proved that there was
no reason to suppose            that the silex had been changed                   in
these experiments.
   The acid proved         to be nitric acid, which under             the      elec
trical action seemed        to have dissolved the silex;              the alkali
turned out to be principally fixed alkali               ;    and that      it    was
merely an accidental ingredient, and not                a     constituent of
the silex, appeared from this circumstance,                  that when the
same portion of silex was long electrified,                 by   degrees    it   lost
its power   of affording the substance in question               f.

                     taken place, the same plan of operation
     This result having
 was not pursuedwith respect to alumine, which resembles a
 saline compound less than silex, and the method which I
 now adopted of acting upon these bodies, was on the sup
 position of their being inflammable substances so highly
 saturated        with oxygen        as to possess         little or no positive   elec
 tricity.
    Alumine         and silex have both a strong affinity                  for potash
 and soda:         now supposing them to be oxides, it was reason
able to conclude that the        oxygen, both in the alkalis and
the earths, must be passive as to this power, which must
consequently be referred to their bases, and on this notion
it was possible that it might Jie made to assist their decom
position by electricity.
  After this reasoning,                T   fused a mixture        of one   part    of   si
lex, and six of potash in a platina crucible, and preserved
the mixture fluid, and in ignition, over a fire of charcoal ;
the crucible was rendered positive from the battery of five
hundred, and         a rod     of platina,       rendered negative, was brought
in contact with          the alkaline            menstruum.         At   the moment
of contact there         was a most intense light ; when the rod was
plunged  into the liquid an effervescence look place, and
globules which  burnt with a brilliant flame rose to the sur
face, and swam upon it in a state of combustion.     In a few
minutes, when   the  mixture was   cool,  the platina bar was
removed       :   after as much as possible               of the alkali and silex
had been detached              from it by        a   knife, there remained bril
liant metallic scales round                it,
                                     which instantly became cover
ed with   a       white crust in the air, and some of which in
flamed  spontaneously.  The platina appeared much cor
roded, and of   darker tint than belongs to the pure metal.

ness occurred,       which various trials demonstrated, depended
upon the presence        of silex.
    A similar mixture of potash and alumine was experi
mented upon in the same manner, and the results were per
fectly analogous ; there adhered to the rod of platina a film
of  a metallic substance, which rapidly decomposed water,
and afforded a solution which deposited alumine by the ac
tion of an acid.
    I tried several forms of this experiment, with the hopes of
being able to obtain a sufficient quantity of the metallic mat
ter from the platina, so as to examine it in a separate state;
but I was not successful. It was always in superficial scales,
which oxidated, becoming white and alkaline, before it could
be detached       in the air ;  it instantly burnt when heated,         and
could not be fused under naphtha or oil.
    I  tried similar experiments with mixtures              of   soda   and
alumine,       and soda and zircone, and used iron         as   the nega
tively electrified metal. In all these cases, during the whol*
process of electrization, abundance of globules, which swam
in a state of inflammation on the fused mass, were produ
ced.      And in the mixture, when cooled, small laminae of
metal were found of the colour of lead, and less fusible than
sodium, which adhered to the iron ; they acted violently
upon water, and produced soda and a white powder, but in
quantities too small to be minutely examined.
    I endeavoured      to procure an alloy     of potassium, and        the
bases    of    the  earths, from mixtures       of potash, silex,      and
alumine,       fused by electricity, and acted on by the positive
and    negative surfaces in the same manner as pure potash,
in experiments for the decomposition of that substance; but
I  obtained no good results. When the earths were in quan
tities equal to one-fourth or one-fifth of the alkali, they
rendered      it so highly non-conducting,        that it was not easy
to effect it by electricity ; and when they were in very minute
portions, the substance produced had the characters of pure
potassium.
    I heated small globules       of potassium, in contact with silex
and alumine,        in tubes of plate glass filled with the vapour of
naphtha     :   the potassium seemed        to act  at  the   same    time
                                                                     upon

                     Electrochemical     Researches on
   upon the glass and the earths, and a grayish opaque mass
  not possessed of metallic splendour was obtained, which
  effervesced   in water, depositing white clouds.           Here it was
  possible that the potash had been converted wholly or partly
  into protoxide, by its action upon the earths ; but as no
  globule was obtained, and          as  the plate   glass  alone might
  have produced the        effect,  no decided    inference of the de
  composition of the earths can be drawn from the process.
     I shall now mention the last trials that I made with re
  spect to this object.
     Potassium,      amalgamated      with about one-third       of mer
 cury, was electrified        negatively under naphtha, in contact
 with silex    very slightly moistened, by the power of five hun
 dred; after an hour the result was examined.                The potas
 sium was made to decompose water, and the alkali formed
 neutralized      by acetous acid ; a white matter, having all the
 appearance      of silex precipitated, but in quantity too small
 for accurate examination.
     I tried the same method of action upon alumine and gln-
 cine, and obtained a cloudiness, more distinct than in the
 case   of silex,   by the action   of an acid upon the solution ob
 tained from the amalgam.
     Zircone exposed in the same manner to the action of elec
 tricity,  and the attraction      of potassium, furnished still more
 satisfactory results ; for a      white and fine powder, soluble in
 sulphuric acid, and which was precipitated from sulphuric
 acid by ammonia, separated from the amalgam that had been
obtained, by the action of water.
    From the general tenor of these results, and the compari
son between the different series of experiments, there seems
very great reason to conclude that alumine, zircone, glu-
cine, and silex are, like the alkaline earths, metallic oxides,
for on no other supposition is it easy to explain the pheno
mena that have been detailed.
    The   evidences    of decomposition     and composition    are  not,
however, of        the same strict nature as those      that belong to
the fixed alkalis and       alkaline earths ; for it is possible, that

 V. On      the Production     of an Amalgam from Ammonia, and
                      on its Nature and Properties.                     »
    In the communication           from Professor Berzelius and           Dr.
Pontin, which I have already referred to, a most curioXis and
important experiment on the deoxidation and amalgamation
of the compound basis of ammonia is mentioned, which these
ingenious gentlemen regard as a strict proof of the idea I had
formed of its being an oxide with a binary basis.
   Mercury, negatively electrified in the Voltaic circuit, is
placed in contact with solution of ammonia.                    Under this
agency     it gradually    increases   in   volume,   and, when   expanded
to four or five times its former dimensions,               becomes    a soft
solid.
   And that this substance          is composed       of the deoxygenated
compound         basis  of ammonia          and  mercury, they think is
proved    :  First, By   the reproduction       of quicksilver and ammo
nia, with      the  absorption    of  oxygen, when it is         exposed to
air ; and, Secondly, by its forming ammonia in water, whilst
hydrogen is evolved, and the quicksilver gradually becomes
free.
   An operation, in which hydrogen              and nitrogen exhibit me
tallic properties,      or in which      a   metallic  substance   is appa
rently composed from its elements, cannot fail to fix the at
 tention of chemists : and the peculiar interest which it of-

 tl0                 Electrochemical Researches on
                                   theory of electrochemical
 fcred in its relations to the general
 science, induced me to examine the circumstances connected
 with it minutely and extensively.
      In repeating   the process   of   the Swedish chemists,    I   found
that to form au amalgam from fifty or sixty grains of mer
cury, in contact with saturated solution of ammonia, required
a considerable time, and that this amalgam greatly changed
even in the short period required for removing it from the
 solution.
    I   was however able, in this mode of operating, to witness
 all the results they have stated, and I soon found simple and
 more easy means of producing the effect, and circumstances
under which it could be more distinctly analysed.
  The experiments which I have detailed in the                  Bakerian
lecture for 1806,' proved that ammonia is disengaged from
the ammoniacal salts, at the negative surface in the Voltaic
circuit ; and I concluded that under this agency, it may be
acted on in what is called the nascent state, when it was rea
sonable to conclude it would            be more readily deoxygenated
and combined with quicksilver.
  On this view of the subject,           I   made a cavity in a piece   of
muriate of ammonia; into this    a globule of mercury, weigh
ing  about  fifty grains, was introduced.    The muriate was
slightly moistened, so as to be rendered a conductor, and
placed on a plate of platina, which was made positive in the
circuit of the large battery.   The quicksilver was made
negative by  means of a  platina wire.  The action of the
quicksilver on the salt was immediate ; a strong effer
vescence  with much heat took place. The globule in a
few minutes had enlarged to five times its former dimen
sions, and  had the appearance of an amalgam of zinc ;
and metallic crystallizations shot from as        it,
                                           centre, round a
the body of the salt. They had an arborescent appearance,
often became coloured at their points of contact with the
muriate   and when the connection was broken, rapidly dis
           ;
appeared,      emitting     ammoniacal       fumes,     and reproducing
quicksilver.
  When       a   piece    of moistened carbonate of ammonia was
used,    the appearances     were the same,      and the amalgam was
                                                                 formed

formed wilh equal rapidity.                In this process of deoxida-
tion, when the battery was in powerful action, a black matter
formed in the cavity, which there is every reason to believe
was carbonaceous matter from the decomposition of the car
bonic acid of the carbonate *.
    The strong attraction of potassium, sodium, and the me
tals  of the alkaline earths for oxyen, induced me to examine
whether      their    deoxidating       powers could not be made to
produce the effect of the amalgamation of ammonia, inde
pendently of the agency of electricity ; and the result was
very satisfactory.
    When mercury, united             to a small quantity       of potassium,
sodium, barium, or calcium, was made to act upon moisten
ed muriate of ammonia, the amalgam rapidly increased to six
or seven times its volume, and the compound seemed to con
tain much more ammoniacal basis than that procured by elec
trical powers.
    As in these cases, however, a portion of the metal used
for the deoxidation always remained in union in the com
pound ; in describing the properties of the amalgam from
ammonia, I shall speak only of that procured by electrical
means.
    The amalgam from ammonia, when formed                          at the tem
perature    of   70° or 80, is a soft solid,        of  the   consistence     of
butter;    at the freezing       temperature     it becomes     firmer, and a
crystallized mass, in which small facets appear, but having
no perfectly defined form f.             Its specific gravity is below 3,
water being      one.
    When exposed to air it soon becomes covered with a white
crust, which proves to be carbonate of ammonia.
    When thrown into water it produces a quantity of hy
drogen, equal to about half its bulk, and in consequence
   * The black matter which     separates at the negative surface in the electri
cal experiments on the decomposition of potash or soda, and which some
experimenters have found it difficult to account for, is, I find, carbonaceous,
and dependent upon the presence of carbonic acid in the alkali.
   f From the facet I suspect the form to be cubical. The amalgam of po
tassium crystallizes in cubes as beautiful, and in some cases as large, as those
mi bismuth.

SIS                 Electrochemical Researches on
of this action       the  water becomes a weak solution              of   am
monia.
     When it    is confined in a given portion         of air,   the air en
larges considerably in volume, and the pure quicksilver re
appears. Ammoniacal gas, equal to one and a halt or one and
three.fifths of the volume of the amalgam, is found to be
produced, and a quantity of oxygen equal to one-seventh or
one-eighth of the ammonia disappears *.
     When thrown into muriatic acid gas, it instantly becomes
coated     with muriate of ammonia, and a small quantity of
hydrogen is disengaged.
    In sulphuric acid it becomes coated with sulphate                 of  am
monia and sulphur.
     I attempted by a variety of modes to preserve this amal
gam.       I had hoped by submitting it to distillation out of the
contact of air, or water, or bodies which could furnish oxy
gen, to be able to obtain the deoxygenated substance which
had been united to the quicksilver in a pure form ; but all
the circumstances of the experiment opposed themselves                       to
such a result.
     It is well   known to persons accustomed to barometrical
experiments, that mercury, after being once moistened, re
 tains water with great perseverance,             and can only be freed
from it by boiling ; and in the cases of the decomposition of
ammonia, when a soft amalgam had been kept continually
moist, both internally and externally for some time, it could
 not be expected that all the water adhering to it should be
easily removed.
     I wiped the amalgam as carefully as possible with bibu
 lous paper ; but even in this process a considerable portion
 of the ammonia was regenerated ; I attempted to free it from
moisture by passing it through fine linen, but a complete
 decomposition was effected, and nothing was obtained but
pure quicksilver.
    * This experiment confirms the opinions I have stated
                                                           concerning the quan
 tity of oxygen in ammonia ; but as water is present, as will be immediately
 shown, the data tor proportions are not perfectly correct.
                                                                           The

                the Decomposition      of  the Earths, &c,               213
    The whole quantity of the         basis  of ammonia combined in
sixty grains of quicksilver, as        is evident from the statements
that have been made, does not exceed -t-J-^ part of a grain,
and to supply oxygen to this scarcely —uVi) Part °* a gram °*
water would be required, which is a quantity hardly appre
ciable, and which merely breathing upon the amalgam would
be almost sufficient to communicate.
    Hence, when       an amalgam, which had been wiped by means
of bibulous       paper, was     introduced into naphtha, it decom
 posed almost      as rapidly as  in the air, producing ammonia and
hydrogen.
    In oils it evolved hydrogen, and generated ammoniacal
soap; and when it was introduced into a glass tube, closed
by a cork, gas was rapidly formed, and the mercury remain
ed free ; and this gas, when examined, was found to consist
of from about two-thirds to three-fourths ammonia,                 and the
remainder hydrogen *.
    That more moisture sometimes existed attached                    to the
amalgam, wh«n wiped as dry as possible by bibulous                   paper,
than was sufficient for the effect of decomposition,                I   soon
found by an experiment of distillation.
    About a quarter of a cubic inch of an              amalgam nearly
solid was wiped very dry, and introduced into a small tube :
in this tube it was heated till the gaseous matter had expelled
the quicksilver ; the tube was then closed, and suffered to
cool, when moisture, which proved to be             a saturated   solution
of ammonia, had precipitated upon it.
    I  have   mentioned that the amalgams obtained from am
monia,      by means of the metals of the fixed alkalis or alka
line earths, seemed to contain much more ammoniacal basis
in combination than those procured by electricity : and when
they are combined with the metals of the fixed alkalis or of
the earths in any considerable quantities, they are much more
permanent.
    Triple compounds of this kind, when carefully wiped,
scarcely produce any ammonia under naphtha, or oil, and
   * In the experiment of the action of the amalgam upon a!r, tne oiygen Is
probably absorbed by nascent hydrogen, and reproduces water, which Is dis

them.
    I                 amalgam obtained from ammonia by
         heated a triple
potassium, and which had been wiped by bibulous paper in
a dry plate-glass tube over mercury ; a considerable eleva
tion of temperature was required before any gaseous mat
ter was emitted, but the heat was raised till gas was rapid
ly formed, and the whole of the amalgam expelled. from the
tube : in cooling, the mercury rose very quickly in       so                        it,
that  great part of the gaseous matter had been either mer
         a
cury or  water, in vapour, or something which the mer
cury had absorbed in cooling.    The small quantity which
was permanent, did not equal                     one half the volume of the
amalgam.

                               this result, which seemed to
prove the production of ammonia, independent of the pre
sence of any substance which could furnish oxygen to                                      it,
and to
        show^that
                  its amalgamation was       merely owing to its
being freed from water, and combined                         but with hydrogen      :
a satisfactory solution  of  the difficulty soon offered itself.
Exposing the triple amalgam procured from ammonia by
potassium to    concentrated solution of ammonia,

 amalgam moistened              by   it   into   a   glass tube,    it   had nearly the
 same   permanency as the amalgam which had been wiped
  before was introduced, little hydrogen only being evolved
             it                      a                                                    ;
. but on heating the tube gaseous matter was rapidly gene
rated, which proved to consist of two-thirds                            ammonia, and,
one-third hydrogen.
                                                                                          In

                the Decomposition       of the Eartlis, &c.           215
    In the instance in which the amalgam had been wiped, a
 small quantity of solution of ammonia, and perhaps of potash,
 must have adhered to it ; and though the amalgam docs not
 act upon this powerfully at common temperatures, yet when
 the water is raised in vapour, it tends to oxygenate both the
basis   of ammonia         and  potassium, and      hence    hydrogen is
evolved, and volatile alkali produced.
    I distilled   an amalgam procured          by potassium from     am
monia,     in  a tube  filled with the vapour of naphtha, and her
metically sealed,       in the same manner as in the experiments           ,
for obtaining the metals of the earths ; but in this case I pro
cured ammonia, hydrogen, and nitrogen only, and pure mer
 cury ; and the residuum was potassium, which acted power
 fully on    the glass tube.
    In another experiment of the same kind, I kept one part of
the tube cool by ice, at the time the other part was strongly
 heated, but nothing condensable except mercury was pro
 duced, and        the  elastic   products were      the   same as in the
former instance.
    I endeavoured      to procure an amalgam from ammonia,              to
which no moisture could be supposed to adhere, by heating
an amalgam of potassium in ammoniacal gas.                    The amal
gam    became     covered    with  a lilm   of  potash,  but   it did not
enlarge in its dimensions, and a considerable quantity of
non.absorbable gas, which was found to consist of five parts
of hydrogen       and one of nitrogen, was produced. The amal
gam    after   this  operation did not emit ammonia by exposure
to air ; hence it seems probable, that for the deoxygena-
tion of ammonia, and the combination of its basis with mer
cury, the alkali must be in the nascent state, or at least in
that condensed form in which it exists in ammoniacal salts,
or solutions.

all its metallic characters ; its colour, lustre, opacity, and con
ducting powers remaining unimpaired.
   It is scarcely possible to conceive that a substance which
forms with mercury so perfect an amalgam, should not be
metallic in its own nature*; and on this idea, to assist the

state, at the usual temperatures of the atmosphere, bodies of
the same character, as zinc and quicksilver would be in the
heat of ignition      ?
   Or are these       gases,           in their common form, oxides, which
become metallized                by    deoxidation    ?
  Or are the simple bodies not metallic      their own nature, in
but capable of composing     metal in their deoxygenated, and
                                             a

  These problems, ihe second of which was stated     Mr. Ca              by
vendish to me, and the last of which belongs to Mr.Berzelius,
offer most important objects of investigation.

dification of a phlogistic chemical theory might be defended
on the idea that the metals and inflammable solids, usually
called simple, were compounds of the same matter as that
existing in hydrogen, with peculiar unknown bases, and that
the oxides, alkalis,      and acids were compounds        of  the same
bases with water,       and that the phaenomena       presented  bv the
metals    of the fixed alkalis might      be explained on this hypo
thesis.
     The  same mode      of reasoning may      be applied to the facts
of    the metallization   of the  earths and ammonia, and perhaps
with rather stronger       evidences  in its favour, but still it will
be less distinct and simple,        than the usually received theory
 of oxygenation, which I         have applied to them.
     The  general facts    of the combustion,     and  of the action  of
 these new combustible substances upon water, are certainly
 most easily explained on the hypothesis of Lavoisier ; and the
 only good arguments in favour of a common principle of in»
 flammability, flow from some          of the novel analogies in elec*
 trochemical science.
     Assuming the existence of hydrogen in            the  amalgam    of
 ammonium,        its presence in one metallic compound evidently
 leads to the suspicion      of its combination in others.       And in
 the electrical powers of the different species of matter, there
 are circumstances which extend the idea to combustible sub*-
  stances   in general.     Oxygen is the only body which can be
  supposed    to be elementary,      attracted by the positive surface
  in the electrical circuit; and all compound bodies, the nature
  of which is known, that are attracted by this surface, contain,
  a  considerable proportion      of oxygen.    Hydrogen is the only
  matter attracted by the negative surface, which can be con
  sidered as acting the opposite part to oxygen : May not then
  the different inflammable bodies, supposed to be simple, con
   tain this as a common element ?
       Should future experiments prove the truth of this hypo
   thesis, still the alkalis, the earths, and the metallic oxides
   will belong to the same class of bodies. From platina to
   potassium there is a regular order of gradation as to their
   physical and chemical properties, and this would probably
   extend to ammouiuni» could it be obtained in the fixed form.
                                                                 Platina

    Platina and gold, in specific gravity, degree of oxidabilitr,
    and other qualities, differ more from arsenic, iron, and tin,
    ihati these last do from barium and strontium.                        The phx-
    nomena of combustion of all the oxidable metals are pre
   cisely analogous.             In the same manner as arsenic forms au
   acid by burning in air, potassium forms an alkali and cal-
   ciuui an earth ; in a manner similar to that in which osmium
   forms a volatile and             acrid substance         by the absorption        of
   oxygen, does the amalgam                of ammonium produce the vola
   tile alkali ; and        if  we suppose       that  ammonia is metallized,
   by being combined with hydrogen and                         freed    from water,
   the same reasoning will likewise apply to                    the other      metals,
   with this difference, that the adherence of their phlogiston
  or hydrogen would be exactly in the inverse ratio of their
  attraction for oxygen.               In platina* it would be combined
  with the greatest energy ; in ammonium with the least ; and
  if it be separable from any of the metals without the aid of a
 new combination, we may expect that this result will be af
  forded by the most volatile and oxidable, such as arsenic, or
  the: metals of the fixed alkalis,                 submitted to intense heat,
 under electrical polarities, and having the pressure of the atr
 jnosphere removed.
       Whatever new lights               new discoveries may throw upon
 this subject, still the facts that have been advanced, show that
 a step nearer at least has been attained towards the true
 Jcnowledge of the nature             of  the alkalis and the earths         f.

                                            lighter than their bases, hut potash and
*oda are heavier i this fact may be explained on either theory ; the density of
a compound will be proportional to the attraction of its parts. Platina,
having a weak affinity for oxygen, cannot be supposed to condense it in the
lame degree as potassium does ; or if platina and potassium be both com
pounds of hydrogen, the hydrogen must be attracted in platina with an
energy in&nitely greater than in potassiam..           Sulphuric acid is lighter than
sulphur; but phosphoric acid (where there is a stronger affinity) is heavier
than phosphorus.         The oxide of tin (wood tin) is very little inferior to tin in
specific gravity.      In this instance the metallic base is comparatively light, and
the attraction for oxygen strong ; and in a case when the metal is much lighter
and the attraction for oxygen stronger, it might be expected a priori that the
oxide would be heavier than the base.

I have  seen an account of tome very curious experiments of M. M . Gay Lus-
sac  and Thenard, (in number 148 of the Momtrur, for 1808, which, I have
;ust received,) from one of which they have concluded," that potassium may
be a compound of hydrogen and potash."
  These gentlemen are said tp have heated potassium in ammonia, and found
that the ammonia was absorbed, and that hydrogen gas equal to two-thirds
of its volume appeared, and that the potassium by this process had become of
a grayish-green colour.    By heating this grayish-green substance consider
ably, two-fifths of the ammonia were again emitted, with a quantity of hydro
gen and nitrogen corresponding to one-fifth more; and by adding water to the
mixture, and heating it very strongly again, they obtained the remainder of the
ammonia, and nothing but potash was left.
   In these complex processes, the phenomena may be as easily explained on
the idea of potassium being a simple, as that of its being a compound, sub
stance ; nor when the facts that have     been stated in this paper, and those
about to be stated, are considered, can the view of these distinguished che
mists, as detailed in the notice referred to, be at all admitted.
  Potash, as I have found by numerous experiments, has no affinity for am
monia, for it does not absorb it when heated in it ; it is not therefore (allow
ing their theory) possible  to conceive that a substance* having no attraction
for potash, should repel from it a substance which is intimately combined with.
it,and which can be separated in no other way.
  A part of the hydrogen evolved in their experiment, may be furnished by
water contained in the ammonia; but      scarcely possible that the whole of
                                            it   is
it   can be derived from this source, for on such an idea the ammonia must con
tain more than half its weight of water. There however no evidence that
                                                           is
the whole of the hydrogen may not be furnished by the decomposition
of the volatile alkali itself. Potassium in its first degree of oxygenation may
have an affinity for nitrogen, or potassium may expel portion of hydrogen at
                                                                a
the moment of its combination with ammonium            and as the whole of the am
                                                       ;
monia cannot be regenerated without the presence of water, hydrogen and a
little oxygen may be furnished to the remaining elements of the ammonia,
from the water, and oxygen to the potassium.
   Even before the conclusion was^formed, tha»         a   metallic substance      is   decom
posed in this experiment,      it   should have been proved         that the nitrogen     had
not been altered.
   That mere potash, combined with hydrogen, cannot form potassium,                        is,
                                                                                            I
think, shown by an experiment which     tried, in consequenceof the important
                                           I
fact lately ascertained by M. M. Cay Lussac and Thenard, of the deoxidation
of potash by iron.
  An ounce of potash was kept in ignition for           some    time in an        iron tube,
ground     into   a   gun barrel in which one ounce and         a   half of iron turnings
were ignited to whiteness     ;
                              a      communication was opened,           by   withdrawing        a
                                                                                          wire.

 wire which closed the tube containing the potash, between     that alkali   and
 the metal.
   As the potash came in contact witli the iron, gaseous matter was developed,
 which was received in a proper apparatus, and though some of it was lost by
 passing through the potash into the atmosphere, yet nearly half a cubic foot
 was preserved, which proved to be hydrogen.        In the tube were found two
 products, one in the quantity of a few grains, containing. potassium, combined
 witha small quantity of iron, and which had sublimed in the operation, and
the other, a fixed white metallic substance which consisted of an alloy of irom
and potassium.
  The first of these snbstances burnt wh«n thrown upon water ; and in it*
other characters resembled pure potassium, except that its specific gravity was
greater, its colour less brilliant, and when it tarnished in the atmosphere, it
became   of a much deeper colour than pure potassium.
  Now potash that has been ignited, is the purest form known of this al
kali ; but on M. M. Gay Lussac's and Thenard      theory, this potash mutt
contain water, not only sufficient to furnish hydrogen to metallize the alka
li,but likewise the quantity disengaged : dry potash, then, as it is procured
in our experiments, must on this theory be a compound, containing a con-
tidcrable  quantity of matter which can furnish hydrogen ; and what
would be its form or properties if deprived of this matter we are wholly un
able to judge, which brings this question to the general question discussed in
the text.
      Potassium   I
                find may be produced readily from dry ignited potash in elec
trical experiments   ; and the result of the combustion of potassium in oxygen
gas is an alkali, so dry that it produces violent heat, and ebullition when
water is added to it.
   In M. M. Gay Lussac's and Thenard's experiment on the action of potas
sium on ammonia, the hydrogen disengaged in the first process, and that ex
isting in the ammonia disengaged in the second process, exactly equals the
whole quantity contained in the ammonia.    But there is no proof of any hy
drogen being disengaged from the potassium, for the ammonia lost is not ge
nerated, nor potash formed, but by the addition of a substance, consisting oi
oiygen and hydrogen ; and as the three bodies concerned in this experiment
are potassium, ammonia, and water, the result ought to be potash, ammonia,
and a quantity of hydrogen , equal to that evolved by the mere action of water
on potassium, which is said to be the case.
   Even if there were no other proofs, the chemical properties of potassium
are so wholly unlike those that might be expected from a compound of potash
and hydrogen, that they are almost sufficient to decide the question. Potas.

water must be diminished by its affinity for hydrogen, to say nothing of the

     Other hypotheses might be formed upon the new electro
chemical facts, in which still fewer elements than those al
lowed        in the antiphlogistic          or phlogistic theory.might be
maintained.            Certain     electrical states always coincide with
certain chemical states             of bodies.     Thus acids   are   uniformly
negative, alkalis positive, and inflammable substances high
 ly positive ; and, as I have found, acid matters when posi
 tively electrified, and alkaline matters when negatively
 electrified,       seem      to lose all their     peculiar properties and
 powers of combination.                 In   these  instances the chemical
  qualities are shown to depend upon the electrical powers ;
 and it is not impossible that matter of the same kind, pos
  sessed of different electrical powers, may exhibit different
  chemical forms           *.
                              .                                            I  ven-

      Potassium burns in carbonic acid, and precipitates charcoal from it ;
  whereas hydrogen electrized with carbonic acid, converts it into gaseous oxide
  of carbon.
      Potash has a very slight attraction for phosphorus ; but potassium has a
  very strong affinity for it, so as to separate it from hydrogen, and according
   to M. M. Gay I ussac and Thenard, with the phenomena of mflamjnation.
   Potash has no affinity for arsenic, yet from the experiments of these gentlemen,
  it appears that potassium separates arsenic from arseniated hydrogen ; and
   hydrogen, which is supposed by them to exist in both compounds, can have
   no affinity for hydrogen, nor can hydrogen in one form,    be supposed    capable
   of separating arsenic from hydrogen in another form.
       Could not the experiment of M. M. Gay Lussac and Thenard be explained,
    txcept on the supposition of the hydrogen being derived from the potassium, it
   would be a distinct fact in favour cf the revival of the theory of phlogiston.
    It would not prove, however, that potassium is composed of hydrogen and
    potash, but that it is composed of hydrogen and an unknown basis l and that
    potash is this basis united to water.
       » Philosophical Transactions, 1807. Part I. p. 23.   The amalgam obtained
    from ammonia offers difficulties to both the phlogistic and antiphlogistic I. v.
    potheses.    If we assume the phlogistic hypothesis, then we must assume that
    nitrogen, by combining with one.fourth of its weight of hydrogen, can form
    an alkali, and by combining with one.twelfth more, can become metallic. If
     w« reason on the antiphlogistic hypothesis, we must assert, that though ni
     trogen has a weaker affinity for oxygen than hydrogen, yet a compound         of
     hydrogen and nitrogen is capable of decomposing water.
        The first assumption is however by far the most contradictory to the order
     of common chemical facts : the last, though it cannot be wholly removed, is

     I   venture to hint at these notions                   :   but      I   do not     attach
much importance to them ; the age of chemistry is not yet
sufficiently mature for such discussions ; the more suhtile
powers of matter are but just beginning to be considered ;
and all general views concerning them must                                as    yet rest upon
feeble and imperfect foundations.
   Whatever be the fate of the speculative part of the inquiry,
the facts however will, I hope, admit of many applications,
and explain some phenomena in nature.
     The   metals        of   the earths cannot exist at the surface                    of   the
globe, but it is very possible that they may form a part of
the interior; and such an assumption would offer a theory for
the phenomena of volcanos, the formation of lavas, and the
excitement and effects of subterraneous                             heat     *,   and   would
probably lead to              a general    hypothesis in geology.

phur under the same circumstances, has no action on water, and iron a very
.in-ill one. The compound of phosphorus and hydrogen is more inflammable
than cither of its constituents.
  Should a new theory of the dependence of the chemical forms of matter
Upon electrical powers be established, the facts belonging to ammonium would
admit of a more easy lolution. Ammonium might be supposed to be a simple
body, which        l>y
                 combining with different quantities of water, and in different
statesof electricity, formed nitrogen, ammonia, atmospherical air, nitrous
oxide, nitrous gas, and nitric acid.
   Water, on this idea, must be supposed constituent part of all the different
                                                 a
gases; but its electricities in oxygen aud hydrogen would probably be the
very reverse of what they have been supposed           by   M. Ritter,          and some inge
nious English inquirers.
   Water positively electrified would be hydrogen, water negatively electri
fied, oxygen   and as in the physical experiments of temperature, ice, added
               ;
to certain quantities of steam by an equilibrium of heat produces water, so
in the chemical experiment of the generation of water the positive and nega
tive electricity of oxygen and hydrogen in certain proportions would annihi
late each other, and water alone be the result. At all events ammonium,
whether simple or compound, must be considered as owing its attraction for
oxygen to its highly positive electrical state, which   shown by its powerful
                                                                    is

   The luminous appearance of those meteors connected with

of these wonderful phaenomena.                This effect may be ac

XXXIV. An          Inquiry Into   the Structure     of Seeds, and espe
   cially into the true Nature of that Part called by Gcertner
    tlie Fitellus. By James Edward Smith, M.D. F.R.S.
    P.L.S.s
VX«rtner,         so justly celebrated    for his anatomical and phy
siological inquiries info the nature of seeds in general, and
for his particular illustration of one thousand different kinds,
claims the merit of first giving a name and definition to a
part called by him the Vitellus, which, though not entirely
unobserved by preceding philosophers, had received no par
ticular description      nor explanation.        Before we enter upon
the investigation of this organ, it is necessary to consider
the structure and functions of the parts of a seed in general ;
and this it will be best to do physiologically.
    Three agents are necessary to the germination of seeds,—
moisture,     heat, and air.      A  seed committed to the ground
 absorbs, through the vessels of its base, the juices of the
 soil, or any other moisture that comes in its way ; while it
 receives, throughout its whole substance, a definite portion
 of heat, some      seeds requiring a greater       share     of the latter,
 for the purposes of vegetation, than others. Moisture and
 heai, however, are not of themselves sufficient to cause the
 germination of seeds.        It has long been known that air is

 the moments of incipient germination, from or through the
 surrounding soil.     Thus the bulk of the seed is increased,
 and its vital principle stimulated. It bursts its immediate
 integument, or testa, and in the first place sends forth the
 radicle, or young root, into the ground.     This part being,
 as Dr. Darwin well observes, most susceptible of the sti
 mulus of moisture, elongates itself in the direction in which
 it meets with that stimulus ; and descending into the earth,
 while it fixes the infant plant, assumes its own proper func
 tion   of imbibing nourishment for            the future support         of that
 plant.     But
              before any supplies can be thus obtained, con
 siderable demands   are made, even by the root itself; and
 not only an evolution of parts, but likewise an increase of
bulk,     takes place    in the young       vegetable.        For this    neces
sary    purpose     a store   is prepared        in the allumen,          a sub
stance either constituting           a body by itself, as in
                                         separate
grasses, corn, palms, &c., which, from a hard, dry, and
tasteless mass, changes, by the action of water and oxygen,
into a milky or saccharine fluid ; or the same substance is
lodged in, or united with, the bulk of another part, next to be
mentioned, the cotyledon, or, as they are generally of the
plural number, cotyledons.      As the root is the part stimu
lated by moisture,        the cotyledons. appear to be most stimu
lated by air, and they consequently raise themselves, for the
most part, out of the ground in order to receive                    it,   in the
form of seminal leaves well known to perform, for      time,             a

                                                  action of
light, to assume their green colour.   The allumen cannot
be said to be stimulated, or acted upon as  living body,  a                   by
the air or gas, which only produces chemical changes in it;
and the destination of this substance being soon accom
plished,    it   disappears   by   absorption.      Not   so the other parts
of   the seed, one     of which     becomes    the still descending root,
the other the nurse, or,       if   we may say so, the foster.brother
of  the young ascending plant, which last originates from
the extremity of the embryo opposite to the root, but always,
like that, most intimately connected with the cotyledons.

ascend out  of the earth, nor assume any of those functions
of leaves in which light is concerned. In the horse chesnut,

                             the tropceolum
plants, they always remain buried, no doubt acted upon by
the air or gas alone. Even in plants of the same natural
order, papilionacece, some, as lupinus, raise their cotyledons

                                       very conspicuous green

                            others,   as
ground, concealed in the black skin of the seed, quite out
of the reach of every ray of the latter. In these we know a
.farinaceous allumen is lodged, whether they rise into the
 light or not ; and the closest analogy leads us to conclude
 that their functions are otherwise similar, which can only

pears to be, in some form or other, necessary to all seeds.
Not to mention        the   tribes of vegetables allowed or guessed
to be without cotyledons,         and thence, for systematical con
venience, denominated    acotyledonous ; all, who have suf
ficiently considered the matter, know that in those called
monocotyledonous, what is vulgarly taken for the cotyledon
is really an albumen, a part fundamentally distinct in func
tions from what is proper to a cotyledon.      Thus even so
conspicuous   a family of plants as the archidece, which the
faithful Jussieu confesses were only presumed from analogy
to be monocotyledonous, or, as he guardedly expresses    to               it,

person   I    believe who has well       examined their germination,
to have in fact      an albumen,       but no cotyledon at all.  Nor
does   such ambiguity         or uncertainty        belong to this family
alone.    Many     plants are presumed         to be monocotyledonous,

presently endeavour to show ; but I must first speak                   of the
more immediate object of the present essay.
    Gaertner asserts the vitelltis of seeds to be             " distinct   from
the cotyledons as well        as.   from    the albumen,          and, for the
most part, situated between the latter and the embryo."
He considers as its principal diagnosties the three following
characters : " 1st, That it is most closely connected with the
embryo, so as not to be separable from it without injury to
its own substance : 2dly,That notwithstanding this intimate
connection, ir never rises out of the integuments of the seed,
as the cotyledons usually do, in germination, so as to be
come a seminal leaf, but, rather like the albumen, its whole
substance is destroy ed by the seedling plant, and converted
into its own nourishment : and 3dly, That if the albumen
be likewise present,     the vitellus        is always situated       betwixt
that and the embryo, in such a manner, however, that it
may be separated from the albumen with great ease and
without injury."      For which reasons this able writer con
siders the organ   in question as " allied on the one hand to
 the albumen, on the other to the cotyledons," but truly
 distinct in nature from both.      He proceeds to observe that
'" it is of all the internal parts of a seed the most singular,
and by far the most unfrequent."
    Now, to consider all        these points separately, in the 1st
place, The vitelltis    is   not more closely connected with the
embryo than the greater part of cotyledons are; according
to the figures and descriptions of Gartner himself, the fi
delity of which must be evident to any one in the habit of
using  his book, and especially to those who will take the
trouble of comparing a few of them with the seeds to which
they refer, while in the earliest stage of germination, at
which time the relative connection of the parts is best ascer
tained. 2dly, That the nitellun never rises out of the ground,
is a circumstance common to it with many cotyledons, al
lowed to be such       by Gaertner, as in the leguminous plants,
and others already mentioned.       3dly, That the vitellus is
situated between the albumen         the latter be present as.
                                           (if
a   separate organ) and the embryo,     only    necessary con

                Inquiry into         the Structure     oj Seeds.           227
 sequence    of   the    tnore     intimate    connection between it and
 the latter than either      of them has with any other part, which
 is also precisely true of the cotyledons and embryo, as above
 mentioned.       For these reasons I presume the vitellus to
 differ in no respect from the subterraneous cotyledons al
 ready described      ;  and that its office is to perform the neces
 sary functions      relative   to air or oxygen, till the leaves come
 forth   and  assume       those functions,          in greater perfection,
 with the cooperation of light. This seems more satisfactory
 than the opinion of Gcertner, that the organ under consi
 deration affords nourishment to the embryo ; because this
 is abundantly      supplied by the copious albumen of a multi
tude of seeds whose vitellus is very inconsiderable, as grasses ,
and because it is unphilosophical to recur to two causes,
 when one is evidently sufficient. In fact, the vitellus, as far
as  I can observe, only dwindles away when the leaves un
fold, exactly as happens to the subterraneous cotyledons.
The    same thing very often takes place              as   speedily  in those
which rise out of the ground ; the existence of the latter ap
pearing to be prolonged in some instances, merely by their
nearer approach to the nature of leaves, as in umbelliferous
and cruciform plants.             The difference of duration is still
more evident, and more instructive as to our present pur
pose, in the leguminous family, between such cotyledons as
rise above the ground,          like lupines, and those which remain
buried, like vetche3,         the latter decaying as quickly as any
supposed vitellus can do.               In  grasses    the   scale, taken  by
Gaertner   for a   vitellus,     is mostly so thin and         unsubstantial,
as  not possibly to contain any material portion of nourish
ment ; but its expanded figure is very well calculated, like
that of the leaves, for functions analogous to vegetable respi
ration, and     its     whole aspect conveys the idea of a primary
or subterraneous leaf, quickly rendered superfluous by the
production of real leaves, which, as well as the radicle, are
probably, in the first stage of their evolution, fed by the
abundant juices of the albumen.                    It appears that the pre
tended vitellus     is  not necessary       to all  plants furnished with
this distinct kind of albumen.                 The palms and orchideoe
prove to be destitute       of it.       On the other hand, I        can find
                                          P 2                              n*

no instance of a supposed vitellus, and a real cotyledon or
cotyledons, in  the same plant.   What Gcertner terms the
cotyledons of rhizoplwra, in his lab. 45, appears to me to be
the plumula, and in his descriptions of some of the scita-
m'mece, he evidently takes the latter for a cotyledon.
        By understanding            the    vitellus   as a    cotyledon,    all ambi
guity respectingr the component parts of any seed is removed.
Wbeil   the cotyledons are two or more, the only question is,
whether the albuminous matter is lodged in their substance,
or whether it forms            organ.    When the embryo is
                                  a separate
accompanied by a simple undivided organ or seed-lobe, we
know it to be a cotyledon by its strict union, or even partial
incorporation,  with the embryo, as in zamia* ; whereas the
pure separate albumen  of the true palms has, as in every other
instance, no more connection with the embryo, according
to Gaertner's just remark, than is absolutely necessary ; and
moreover evinces its true nature by the chemical alteration,
and speedy absorption, of its whole substance. The cotyle
don, as I consider    of zamia, as in numerous parallel in
                                  it,
stances, shrivels and shrinks indeed considerably, from the
absorption of its albuminous contents by the vegetating em
bryo, bat does not disappear, leaving only     skin behind,        a
like the albumen of grasses or corn, because that part of its
substance which              is
                    destined to perform the office, essential
tb   cotyledon, concerning air, merely decays when its end
        a
isanswered.      may further be observed upon this subject,
                        It
that the albuminous matter of seeds with two or more co
tyledons        is commonly of an oily nature, while those with
©ne         cotyledon or none at all, have more farinaceous, or
                                                        a
even stony,           albumen.          Still   the latter changes
                                                        milky or       to   a
oily fluid, previous to its absorption. When the vital prin
ciple of seed  a   extinct, its albuminous oil becomes rancid,

any injury to the cotyledons, even after they begin to rise

the admission of some                   atmospheric air            is   necessary      to the
preservation of many                  seeds.     The primary            cause     of   decay
therefore          in   seeds spoiled       by
                                            keeping may originate, not, as
I    have supposed,              in the extinction of their vital principle,
but in the corruption                 of their albuminous oils and this     ;              is
strengthened               by   the   experiments of the French chemists,
whose applications may much more readily be supposed to
correct and restore the albuminous juices, than to bring the
dead to life.
     This     of the albuminous matter, whether oily, muci
                 idea
laginous,   or farinaceous, being, when not       distinct and          a
separate body, always lodged in the cotyledons, throws ad
ditional light on the nature of the last-mentioned parts, and
in    a    very         beautiful     manner confirms          their analogy with
leaves.           The discoveries of         Mr. Knight          have provedthat the
nutritious fluid or sap of plants                  is   carried into the leaves, in
order to be there acted upon                     by
                                  air, light, heat, and mois
ture. After these agents have produced their effects, the
fluids are sent back, through the returning vessels, into the
branch or stem, to furnish matter of increase to the whole
vegetable          body. The chemical experiments, of Dr. Priestley

more especially, confirm this, by teaching us that carbonic-
acid.gas is absorbed by leaves in the day-time through their
upper surface, and decomposed by them, its carbon being
added to the sap,          and its oxygen emitted by the under sur
face.      In   the dark,     leaves are found to absorb oxygen.           Let
us apply all this to the germination             of  seeds.     The oxygen,
known,        as  I  have already said, to be       necessary    to this pro
cess,    being conveyed to the seed in its dark subterraneous
situation, is absorbed by its cotyledons, already stored, from
the constitution of the parent plant during their formation,
with albuminous matter abounding with the carbonic prin
ciple.      The chemical action of the oxygen on this albumi
nous substance, renders the latter            a more     or less saccharine,
and, with the addition of the imbibed moisture, a milky
fluid,    fit to be transmitted, through the returning vessels of
the cotyledons, into the stem of the embryo, especially as
 all these important parts have already begun to swell by the
 absorption of moisture assisted by warmth.                    Hence Ave see
why light is found hurtful to incipient germination, and why
 carbonic-acid-gas may be given out by seeds at that period.
We     perceive       also why the outside     of   seeds is so commonly
 dark.coloured,          or even black, as in canna, afzelia, and
 others,     it being the only part of the vegetable body, as far
 as I recollect, that is ever positively black, except                 perhaps
 the skins of some fruits.             It is, moreover, evident that all
 the indispensable functions of the cotyledons are best per
 formed under ground, and that when they rise into the air
 and   light, it     is not  till after their primary destination is ful
 filled, and then because, being fundamentally of the nature
 of leaves, they are also capable, inmost instances, of as
 suming their functions with respect to light.                    It is highly
 worthy      of   notice   that,   in consequence     of  the  original posi
 tion of the cotyledons in all seeds, the oxygen gas must al
 ways be imbibed by their under side, that very same part
 which in leaves gives out this kind of gas during the day,
 and probably absorbs it during the night.                    It would have
 evinced      a strange contrariety in the constitutions of two or
 gans    otherwise       so analogous, I mean the leaves and cotyle
 dons, if the upper surface of the latter, while in the unex-
                                                                        panded

 panded seed,    had been presented      to receive the oxygen gas.
 Where there is      a separate    albumen, without any perceptible
cotyledons, it is probable thai the stalk of the embryo may
answer the necessary purpose ; just as the stems of leafless
plants must be' presumed to perform the usual chemical
functions of leaves, though we cannot ascertain in what di
rection the different airs are imbibed      or discharged, there
being  no decided upper   or under  surface  in such stems, any
more than in ensiform leaves.      Such, however, are rare ex
ceptions, which   if not,  as  yet, found to throw any new
light on the subject, certainly do not overturn any important
part of the above hypothesis. That some part, immediately
connected with the embryo, must be stimulated in order to
excite the germination of a seed, this phaenomenon   being
dependent   on the vital principle, is evident. I conceive
that, when present,        the cotyledon or cotyledons are them
selves stimulated by the oxygen gas,          or rather       by    the heat
which chemists       inform us is produced by the absorption of
that gas,    so as   to set their fluids in motion, and thus to
propel the young root and           rising plumula.       But when the
cotyledons are wanting,        the embryo may        very well be con
ceived capable   of sufficient action       to imbibe     for itself -the
juices of   adistinct albumen, already become milky and sac
charine by the reception of oxygen and moisture, by which
merely chemical process, as in barley, so considerable a de
gree of heat is evolved, as must very powerfully excite the
vital principle of the budding vegetable.    In the few cases
where one or more cotyledons and a distinct albumen are
together present, it does not seem necessary that the gas
should act through the former upon the albumen, the two
organs being but little connected, and its operation on the
latter being independent of all vital or organic laws ; but
either the gas itself, or the heat produced, may very well
so stimulate the vital principle of the cotyledons, as to pro
pel their fluid* into the embryo and assist germination. This
opinion is the more probable, as those fluids must be sup
posed more truly of the nature of sap, and more immediaiely
fitfor the use of the infant plant, than the liquor of the               al
bumen.      However thi3 may be, the existence          of    a   cotyledon

or cotyledons,       together with a separate albumen, in seeds,
seems to me so unusual, as not to occasion much difficulty,
and I would define a cotyledon to be a vital organ, capable,
as such,     of being stimulated        by oxygen,     heat,   or both, for
the propulsion       of its contents ; while such           an  albumen is
merely a       repository of nutritious vegetable           matter, subject
to the laws of chemistry alone, and only passively resigning
those contents to the absorbing powers of the embryo, to
which it is attached.
    I must now, under the impression of what has just been
advanced, return to the arrangement of plants by their co
tyledons.
    Plants in general are dicotyledonous, having a pair of
these organs, which commonly rise out of the ground ; but
if they do not, it appears, from the consideration of the
leguminous tribe, that such a difference could scarcely serve
for a generic distinction, much less for that of a class or
order.      It   also appears that,       if  the  number    of cotyledons
exceeds two,        as  in pimis and     a  few other instances, the    dif
ference is     of little or no     use for    systematical purposes, and
of no physiological importance whatever. The cotyledons
of pinus all present their backs to receive the oxygen.
    Some plants appear to be really furnished with one sim
 ple cotyledon,        as zamia,    and according to Gaertncr's figures
 and descriptions,        the true scitaminece,      asamomum (his zw-
giber), alpinia,         &c.  ; while   cunna    seems  to have no cotyle
 don, but only an albumen.               Can this be true ? and if so,
 what is the value of such            a distinction in    a natural classifi
 cation   ?    The liliacece, palmce,          and now the orckidete,    are
 acknowledged to be acotyledonous, having only an albumCn;
 while   the grasses,      so nearly allied to them, have one cotyle
 don, for I      presume     their scale     must be admitted      as  such.
 Gaertner's phrase of embryo moiiocotyledoneus                    applied to
 these last. mentioned families may occasion              a mistake, which
 would be avoided by the term embryo simplex, or indiuisus,
 expressing his idea of the simple figure appropriate to this
 part in such plants, but which does not prevent its upper
  extremity being strictly analogous to the plumula of the di-
  cotyledones. It seems to me therefore that this learned writer
                                                                             is

is mistaken in saying the monocotyledonous plants never
have any plumula.    They have not indeed that feather-like
configuration in the ascending point of their embryo which
gave rise to the name, but the organ so called                                is,   and must
be, present.          To dispute about            the     term       is   as   little to the
purpose as to contend that the orchidece have no pollen,                                   be
cause   it   is   not of
                  powdery appearance.

   From Mr. Lindsay's account of the germination of fernt
in our 2d volume, this family must be deemed monocotyle
donous.           Their germination seems at first analogous to that
of   mosses,       as given      by
                               Hedwig in his Theoria, but the nu
merous       and     branched cotyledons            of     the       latter         overset all
analogy,       and indeed all classification         of plants  the num        by
ber of the parts in question.                 Nothing could be more unna
tural than to separate mosses for this reason from the other
cryptogamic vegetables,                and    therefore     Jussieu can scarcely
believe      these parts to be cotyledons;                yet   it   is   not possible to
call them any thing else, and to suppose them peculiar, and               a
hitherto unheard-of, organ, would but increase the diffi
culty. Gaertncr in             the   Introduction   to his great work, p. 157,
 tells us he has       seen many cotyledons    fuel also,   in   several
and that he suspects others of the more imperfect plants,
hitherto referred to the monocotyledones, may be similarly
circumstanced.      seems that too much,
                           It               far, has been             by
 taken for granted in this department, though the parts un
 der consideration form the great hinge upon which all natu
 ral systems turn.         It
                        only                 by
                                analogy that the great family,
                                 is
 or natural order, of lichenes has been judged monocotyle
 donous, an analogy which the fuel,     Gaertner be correct,

 render very doubtful.    The germination of the                               fungi      is    at
 least equally uncertain.
  I     mean not however               by   any means to         invalidate the im
 portance of the distinction between such plants as have two
 or more cotyledons, and such as have only one or none,
 however inaccurate the terms commonly used to distinguish,
 them may be. Much less am      inclined to throw any need

  avoidable in so abstruse    a study. No real friend to truth and
  knowledge ever foments invidious rivalships in philosophy.
  The field of science is now so vast, that its different cultiva

  students of physiology, of natural systems, and of artificial
  ones, may all powerfully assist each other.              Truth is pur

  along done, to enrich the scientific hive.         I would therefore
  conclude by recommending those who have leisure and op
 portunity for the purpose, to observe for themselves the ger
 mination of the principal families of plants, not only of such
 genera as are in dispute, but of all about which there can be
 any doubt, most of which will.easily be indicated by a com

    Parts of the urinary Passages; and           on the Effects that
    are produced upon them, by the        internal Use of solvent
    Medicines, from Mr. WILLIAM             BRANDE        to EVERARD

                        General Inferences.
J.T   appears  from   the  preceding observations, that calculi
formed in the kidneys, and immediately voided, are almost
always composed of uric acid ; and that the phosphates are
rery frequent ingredients in calculi of the bladder, more
especially in those which, from their situation, have been
exposed   to a continual current   of urine : they also uniformly
are deposited upon    extraneous   substances    introduced into the
bladder, but appear never to form small kidney calculi.
                                                                 N
                                                                    In

          On the Differences in the Structure    of Calculi.    235
   In what is commonly called a fit of the gravel, a small
uric calculus is formed in the kidney, and passes along the
ureter into the bladder.
   It is found from observation, that for some time after a
stone has passed from the kidney, the urine is generally un
usually loaded with uric acid, and deposits that substance
upon the nucleus now in the bladder. When this period,
which     is   longer  or shorter in different individuals,     has
elapsed,     the subsequent addition to the calculus consists
principally     of the phosphates.
   Where the disposition therefore     to form uric   acid in the
kidneys is very great and permanent,       the calculus found in
the bladder is principally composed of uric acid ; but where
this disposition is weak and of short duration, the nucleus
only is uric acid, and the bulk of the stone is composed of
the phosphates.
   Where the increased secretion of uric acid returns at in
tervals, the calculus is composed of alternate layers of uric
acid and the phosphates.
   Other small calculi being formed in the kidney, make their
way into the bladder, and afford fresh nuclei ; so that se
veral calculi are sometimes found in the same bladder, and
their composition is usually nearly the same.
   In other cases it happens, that a constant increased secre
tion of uric acid is going on from the kidneys, only in small
quantity, which will be more uniformly mixed with the
phosphates deposited in the bladder, and where the uric acid
predominates, the species of calculus denominated impro
perly, urate of ammonia, will be produced.
   We are entirely ignorant of the cause of the formation of
the oxalate of lime, or mulberry calculus. I have frequently
looked for oxalate of lime in the urine of calculous patients,
but have never been able to detect it ; and as it does not
exist in healthy urine, it must be regarded as a morbid se
cretion.      Its mode of formation seems to resemble      that  of
uric acid, since small kidney calculi, composed of oxalate
of lime, have in a few instances been voided ; and in these
cases,   as far as   my own inquiries go, the persons have been
                                                             much

  936     On the Differences in the Structure       of Calculi.
 much less liable to a return     of the complaint, than where
 uric calculi  have been voided.
     In some rare instances we meet with calculi         of the bladder
 which are destitute of uric acid and of oxalate           of lime, the
 nucleus being composed of       a little loosely agglutinated am-
 moniaco.magnesian      phosphate, and the whole calculus con-
 listing of that substance, with variable portions of phosphate
 of lime: in two cases I have met with calculi of this kind,
 composed of the triple phosphate only        :   they seem to be en
 tirely formed in the bladder.
    Having taken this short view of       the formation      of calculi,
 I  shall now inquire into the action of solvents, employed
 either with a view of effecting their solution, or of prevent
ing their formation and increase.
    Solvents are of two kinds.
     1. Alkaline.    2. Acid.
    In the exhibition of these, the practitioner is usually.
guided by the chemical composition of the calculous matter
voided by urine.
    The different kinds  of gravel voided by persons labouring
under calculous complaints, may be classed in two divisions.
     1. Uric acid, either in a pure state, or with a very small
proportion of the phosphates.
    2. The phosphates,    either pure, or with       a  small propor
tion of uric acid.
    The first species, which generally appears in the form of
minute crystalline grains, of a reddish brown colour, or of an
impalpable brown powder, is cither entirely soluble in pure
alkaline solutions, not emitting an ammoniacal odour, in
which case it consists   of   pure uric acid    :  or it does emit an
ammoniacal odour, and is not entirely soluble, in which case
it contains the triple phosphate of ammonia and magnesia.
    When this   substance   is observed in the urine,       the alkalis
are recommended. They are exhibited either in a pure state,
or as carbonates, and in each instance the uric sediment ge
nerally diminishes rapidly, and during the continued use of
alkaline medicines, occasionally disappears altogether.
    It however frequently happens that the matter voided is
                                                                    net

           On the Differences in the Structure       of Calculi.    237
not diminished in quantity by the use of alkalis, but thai its
form and composition are altered, and that it assumes the ap
pearance of a gray powder, and is composed of uric acid with
variable portions of the ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate.
     From these facts therefore, it cannot be doubted that the
internal exhibition of alkalis often prevents the formation of
uric acid,     and hence must likewise prevent the increase          of a
calculus in the bladder, as far at least as uric acid is concerned;
but it has also been supposed that the alkalis are capable of
 acting upon the stone itself, and even of effecting its com
plete solution. It is true that if we immerse a calculus, com
 posed   of uric acid, in    a dilute solution  of caustic alkali, that
 it will   be slowly     acted   upon, and after some time entirely
 dissolved.     If  however we attend to what would take place in
 the body, we shall find the circumstances very different.
     That alkaline carbonates and sub-carbonates exert no ac
 tion upon uric acid I consider to.be completely established.,
 both by the experiments of several eminent chemists, and
  those  I  have myself made       upon the subject; and as there is
 at all times a quantity of uncombined acid in the urine, it
  follows that although the alkali may arrive at the kidneys in
 its pure state,     it will there unite with the uncombined        acid,
  and be rendered incapable of exerting any action upon the
 calculus in the bladder. Besides phosphoric acid, the urine
  always contains a quantity of uncombined carbonic acid :
  this is proved by placing a quantity of recently voided urine
  under the receiver of an air.pump; during the exhaustion, a
  large quantity     of carbonic    acid gas  makes    its escape ; and
  when urine is distilled      at very low     temperatures, carbonic
  acid gas is given    off:  and  also,  when    lime water is poured
  into   urine,    a precipitate appears,    consisting   of phosphate
  and carbonate of lime.
      Lime-water, on account of the insoluble compounds which
   lime forms with carbonic and           phosphoric acids, is eyen
   more objectionable as a solvent than the alkalis.
      It may however be said, that if these means prevent the
   increase of a calculus, material relief is afforded to the patient.
   How    far the exhibition of alkaline remedies can be recom
   mended upon these grounds, will appear, when the circum
                                                                 stances

 238          On the Differences in the Structure                  of Calculi.
 •tances which attend the formation                      of   the second species         of
 calculus sediment or deposition in the urine, are considered.
   The ammoniaco.magnesian phosphate appears under two
 forms   it is either voided in a solid state, or in solution. In
          :
 the former case it bears a good deal of resemblance to a white
 sand, and is frequently mixed with variable porportions of
 phosphate of lime. In the latter it makes its appearance after
 the urine has remained undisturbed                           for some hours in an
open vessel,  generally in the form of a fine pellicle, or of
crystalline laminae, which when collected and dried bear
some resemblance to boracic acid.
   Its putting on this form is accounted for, from its being
held in solution in the first instance by carbonic acid, and as
this flies off, the triple salt makes its appearance. If a por
tion of the urine be preserved in a phial closely stopped, the
carbonic acid cannot escape, and consequently no phosphate
is observed to separate. There is also a quantity of phosphoric
acid present, which keeps another portion of the ammoniaco-
magnesian phosphate, and also some lime                             (in the state       of
super-phosphate of lime) in solution. „
     It is therefore obvious, that whenever                   the urine is deprived
of a portion of the acid which is natural to    the deposition     it,
of the triple phosphate, and phosphate  of lime, more readily
takes place        :   this   is   effected   by   the exhibition        of   the alkalis.
     may therefore be asserted, that although alkaline medi
     It
cines often tend to diminish the quantity of uric acid, and
thus to prevent the addition of that substance in its pure
state, to   calculus
               a       the bladder they favour the deposi
                                   in               ;
tion of the phosphates.
 It   cannot be doubted that the alkalis reach the tladder, since
in   cases where large doses              of sub.carbonate of potash hare
betn exhibited,         I     have seen evident traces   of in the urine.
                                                                     it
     Where      the phosphates only are voided,                 it   has been pro
posed to dissolve the calculus                 by   the exhibition        of acids, and
more especially the muriatic acid.
  During the use of the muriatic                        acid, the phosphates are
either diminished or disappear altogether and even some        ;
times the urine acquires an additional acidity solution of           :   a
that part of the calculus which consists of the phosphates
                                                     might

might therefore be expected ; but even then the nucleus of
uric acid would remain, and thus a great deal of time would
be lost without any permanent advantage.
    I  have also occasionally           remarked, that during the use of
acids, the uric acid reappears, and even seems to be aug
mented in quantity.
    Attempts have been made at different times to effect the
solution of calculi, by the injection of solvents into the blad
der. This subject has been more lately revived by Fourcroy
and Vauquelin, who, in their paper on the composition of
calculi, lay down rules for its practice. Independent, how
ever     of the impossibility of ascertaining             the composition       of
the calculus with sufficient accuracy, it is obvious that, were
the composition of the surface of the calculus known, the
frequent introduction of an instrument into the bladder, and
the long continuance of the process which would be neces
 sary, even where the calculi are small, are insurmountable
objections ; and whenever this mode of treatment has been
 adopted, it has speedily been relinquished,                   as  it always  ag
 gravates     the sufferings       of  the patient.
      It  has been shown that :n the majority             of cases, the nuclei
 of calculi originate        in  '.lie kidneys,    and   that   of these nuclei
 by far the greater number consist of uric acid ; the good
 effects therefore so frequently observed during the use of an
 alkali, arise,     not from any actual solution of calculous mat
 ter, but from the power which it possesses of diminishing
 the secretion of uric acid, and thus preventing the enlarge
 ment      of  the   calculus, so that, while of a very small form,
 it may be voided by           the urethra.

   J. hat    calculi in the human bladder are not dissolved by the
  internal     use of alkaline medicines, is an opinion which I
  have long entertained, but the grounds of failure so clearly
  pointed out by       Mr. W. Brande,            were not known to me          :  I

 only know from experience, that,            to whatever  extent the
 medicines are given, no such effect takes place.           The cir
 cumstance of the exterior laminae of calculi extracted from
 patients, who had persevered in a course of alkaline prepa
 rations, having been found softer than the parts towards the
 centre, has always been considered as a proof of the notion
 of the medicines upon the calculus, and led to the belief, that
where the stone was small, it might be wholly dissolved.
This, however, Mr. W. Brande has now proved to be a de
ception, and that the soft part is not a portion of the origi
nal calculus,   but   a  newly formed substance, in which the
uric acid is not deposited in crystals, but mechanically mixed
\vith the phosphates, and the animal mucus in the urine.
    Having met with cases, which confirm Mr. W. Brande's
observations, it will be satisfactory to state them, as they may
assist in doing away many erroneous notions generally en
tertained on this subject.
   The opinion, that calculi in the human bladder have been
entirely dissolved, has received its principal support from
instances having occurred, and those by no means few in
number, where the symptoms went entirely away while the
patients were using alkaline medicines, and never afterwards
returned. This evidence appears to be very strong, but it
will  be found   from the following cases that it is not so in
reality.   Since the fallacy has been detected in all the in
stances in which an opportunity was afforded of examining
the bladder after death. Two of these I shall particularly no
tice, because they were published during the patient's life
time in proof of the stone having been dissolved.
   Both patients   were     great sufferers from the   symptoms    of
stone for many      years ; but when they arrived      at the age  of
sixty-eight, or thereabout, the symptoms entirely left them.
The one had been taking the saline draught in a state of
effervescence,  under the direction of the late Dr. Hulme :
the cure   was attributed to      this medicine, and the case was
published   in proof  of  its  efficacy. When the patient died I
examined the bladder, and found twenty calculi ; the largest
of the size of a hazel-nut, the others smaller. It appeared
that the going off of the symptoms had arisen from the pos
                                                               terior

        Observations on    Mr.   Branae's Paper on Calculi.       241
 terior iobc   of the  prostate  gland having become enlarged (a
«hange which it frequently undergoes about that period of
 life), and having formed a barrier between the calculi and
the orifice   of the bladder, so that they no longer irritated
that part   either  in the act of making water, or in the diffe
rent movements of the body, but lay in the lower posterior
part of the bladder without producing any disturbance. Their
number prevented the pressure frdm being great upon any
one part of the intestine immediately behind the bladder, and
their motion on one another rendered their external surface
smooth, and probably prevented their rapid increase.             The
other patient was under a course of Perry's lixivium           ; and
when the symptoms            went away, he published the case in
proof of   the efficacy   of that medicine in dissolving the stone.
I examined the bladder after death, and found fourteen cal
culi ; the largest of the size of a nutmeg, the others smaller.
There was the same enlargement of the posterior lobe of the
prostate gland, and the calculi were exactly under the same
circumstances as in the former case.
    In  several cases,   in which I have examined the body after
death, calculi have been found inclosed in cysts, formed be
tween the fasciculi of the muscular coat of the bladder, so        as
to be entirely excluded from the         general  cavity, and there
fore had not produced any       of the common    symptoms of stone.
I have seen in the same bladder, two, three, and even four
such cysts, each containing a calculus of the size of a walnut.
    It is a circumstance deserving notice, that in the case
which    gave celebrity to Mrs. Stevens's medicine, and pro
cured her a remuneration from parliament, the bladder was
not examined after death.
    That calculi in the bladder do sometimes increase, while
the patient is using alkaline medicines, is fully proved by the
following examples, which          also show that the uric acid and
phosphates are formed in different proportions, according to
the peculiarities of the constitution.
    A  gentleman who suffered from symptoms of stone was
sounded and a stone was found in his bladder.             I put him
on a course of alkaline medicines, and he voided a small com
pact calculus,    composed     of uric acid,  and evidently formed

242        On I he Changes produced in Almosplwic               Air
in the kidney.        He   was desired to persist in the use          of   the
medicines,     which he did at intervals for four or five years,
suffering occasionally in a slight degree, but he did not pass
any more calculi.      He died at the age of seventy-five. OH
examining      the  bladder,    its whole cavity (the capacity of
which     was   equal to a pint measure)          was  completely      filled
with soft, light, spongy calculi, three hundred and fifty in
number, and of different sizes, from that of a walnut to a
small pea.      They were composed of a mixture of uric acid
in powder, the phosphates, and animal mucus ; and differed
so much from the calculus voided soon after the patient be
gan the use    of alkalis,   that they appear to have been formed
after that period in the manner mentioned by             Mr. W. Brande.
    A gentleman,     who was found to have           a stone  in his blad
der, was persuaded      that   it was so small that      it might    be dis
solved, and wiih this view he took the fossil alkali,               both in
its caustic and inild. state, for about three months          ;   but at the
end   of that period      the    symptoms       were increased, and he
submitted     to have   it  extracted    by    an  operation.      On ex
amining the calculus after it was extracted, the external part,
for the thickness of .r^th of an inch, was entirely composed
of triple phosphate, in       a state  of perfect spiculated crystals,
so as to present a very rough irritating          surface to the internal
membrane of the bladder, while              the inner parts    of  the cal
culus were made up of a mixture of uric acid and phosphates,
so that the alkali had prevented the formation of uric acid,
hut the phosphates were deposited more rapidly than before.
    A gentleman, in whose urine the uric acid appears in a
solid form, immediately after it is voided, has the same ap
pearance in the urine, even when nine drachms of soda dis
solved   in water, impregnated with carbonic acid, are taken
in twenty-four hours       ; so that in (his instance the alkali
does not even counteract the formation              of uric acid.

connected with our existence in life, that from its first rno-
           * From Philosophical   Transaction* for 1808.  Pan II.
                                                                    ments,

tnents, to the final close, sleeping and waking, this neces
sary action is constantly maintained : nor can it be suspend
ed even for a few minutes without considerable pain and- the
utmost clanger.       This important process has of course ex
cited the curiosity both of ancient and modern philosophers ;
among the latter we find the distinguished names of Mayow,
Priestley, Goodwin, Menzies, Spallanzani, Schccle, Lavoisier
and Davy, whose successive labours have thrown great light
upon this difficult subject, and prepared the way for further
investigation ; but it is impossible to take a review of what
has already been done, without perceiving that some im
portant points were by no means satisfactorily settled ; an
accurate method of separating the different gases, and as
certaining their exact proportion in any given mixture, was
still a desideratum when many of the experiments were
made, and it is only of late years that eudiomctry has at
tained its present perfection : the quantity of residual gas in
the lungs after a forced expiration was a matter in dispute
among     former experimenters, some making it one hun
dred    and nine cubic inches, and others only forty ; and
yet it is of  the   utmost consequence in all calculations upon
the effects produced, especially upon small portions of gas,
that the state of the lungs should be accurately determi
ned ; this constitutes      the great   difficulty in the investiga
tions.    We therefore commenced our labours by construct
ing  an apparatus,     in which we are able to respire from three
to four thousand cubic inches       of gas, conceiving, that in this
quantity^   the error arising from the residual      gas in the lungs
must be so much obviated as to permit the most satisfactory
results.
   The   apparatus    consists of  three gasometers,    two of which
are filled with mercury, and one with distilled water.
   The water gasometer which belongs to the Royal Institu
tion, is capable of holding four thousand two hundred cubic
inches of gas, and each of the mercurial ones three hundred
cubic inches    :  the  apparatus   was so arranged    that the Inspi
rations were all made from the water gasometer, and the ex
pirations into the mercurial gasometers alternately. Each of
the gasometers is furnished with a graduated scale, and they

gas inspired and expired could be immediately and exactly
ascertained       :   to each   of   the mercurial gasometers    a glass   tube

                 Manner of conducting           the Experiment.
     Our first     care was, to he certain that all the parts            of onr
apparatus        were perfectly        air-tight, and this, from the nature
of   it,   was very easily ascertained         ;   we agreed that the breath
ing should always be performed                  by
                                   one of us, and the regis
tering, &c.           by
               the other, as each would     that means ac by
quire      a   greater degree        of dexterity in performing his part,
and the results would be more uniform.
   The water gasometer being filled with common air to                         a
certain mark upon the scale, and the mercurial ones com
pletely empty, the person to breathe, whom we shall uni
formly call the operator, was scated upon  stool, with his   a
mouth even with the tube A., his nose being secured with                       a
steel clip.           lie   made as complete an expiration as possible
into the open air, then applying his lips to the tube, and
keeping his left hand constantly on the cock, fig. and his          1,
                                                                           right

right hand on the cock, fig. 2, he opened the communication
with the water gasometer, and made an inspiration ; then.
immediately closing               it,
                         he opened witli his right hand the
cock at     2
            ;           being also opened, he expired into
                   and that at        4
the mercurial gasometer G. 1.; then closing     which cut                 2,
off all eemmunication with the mercurial gasometer, he
opened       1,   in order to make           a   fresh inspiration   l    then closing
it,   he again opened            2,    and expired into the mercurial gaso
meter  and proceeding in this way, always taking care to shut
        ;
one cock before the other was opened, the air was made to
pass from         the water           gasometer, through         lungs of 'the
                                                                   the
operator into the mercurial                    gasometer, and this with great
ease, as the diameters                of   the tubes were purposely made large.
The   scale of the mercurial gasometer was carefully noticed,
and when nearly full, the cock      underneath was shut off:

and the expirations were received in G. 2.      While this was
filling, the number of cubic inches in G. was registered,      1                             a
portion saved in the mercurial bath, and the rest quickly ex
pelled. This operation was repeated until the contents of
about twelve or thirteen mercurial gasometers were taken
off: the operator always concluding with strong effort to       a
empty his lungs as completely as possible. The quantity
inspired from the water gasometer was then compared with
the quantities expired into the mercurial gasometers, and the
difference noted. The following are the results of the first
ten experiments.

  The breathing in             these cases was        as    nearly natural       as we
conceive it possible to be in any apparatus j the operator was
scarcely fatigued, and his pulse not raised more than about
one beat in a minute; the respirations however were deeper
and fewer than natural, amounting only to about 58 in eleven
minutes, whereas from repented observations at different and
distant times he makes 19 in a minute.   The sniallness of
the deficiency surprised us very much, as, from the reports
of other experimenters we had been prepared to expect a
much greater loss,              It might      be objected         that   the   air was
rarefied                                 this was almost
               by passing through the lungs ; but
immediately counteracted by the mass of quicksilver in the
gasometers, which amounted at least to one hundred and
fifty pounds; and we have repeatedly noticed, that air under
these circumstances has suffered no perceptible diminution
•by standing; for a considerable time ; in one case, in which
 air from the lungs was driven inlo the mercurial gasometers
for twenty-seven minutes, the temperature of the quick
silver at the end of the experiment was not raised half a de
gree of Fahrenheit's thermometer.     The deficiency, in our
opinion, principally            arises from the difficulty in bringing the
lungs precisely to the same state after, as before the                            expe
riment ; and it must be recollected that the operator                             com
menced by a forcible expiration into the open air, but finish
ed by a forcible expiration into the mercurial gasometer.
!Now, although this gasometer was counterpoised by weights
in    the scale attached         to    it,   yet we can         easily conceive that
more resistance           might be afforded to the complete evacuation
in the latter case than               in   the former,     and     consequently the
lungs might contain             a   few inches more after the experiment
than before   which it,             might      in   some    measure       account for
the deficiency.
      In   the eleventh     experiment, portions of gas were taken off
from each 'of         the   mercurial gasometers as they were
                                                                                  filled^

     To  prevent  repetition, we shall here state that all the trials
  were made in the same manner, and with the same appara
  tus, namely, the eudiometer, described in the Society's
  Transactions for 1807, in which one cubic inch is divided
 into one hundred parts ; and that in almost every instance
  we made two, and sometimes           three experiments on the same
  gas,  and  derived fresh confidence from the remarkable co
 incidence and uniformity of the results. No precaution was
 at any time omitted which appeared to us necessary to insure
 accuracy.
     One hundred parts of the expired gas being agitated with
 lime-water in the eudiometer, the lime-water became turbid,
 and 8-5 parts of the gas were absorbed, which were conse
 quently carbonic acid; the remaining 91'5 parts were treated
 with the green sulphate of iron, saturated with nitrous gas,
 as  recommended by professor Davy, and afterwards with the
 simple solution of the green sulphate, when 12'5 parts were
 absorbed, which were consequently oxygen, and the remain
 ing 79 azote.
       100 parts   of the expired     gas therefore consisted of
                            8-5 carbonic acid,
                          12* 5  oxygen.
                          79*     azote,
                         100
    The air contained in      the water gasometer, previous to the
experiment, being examined by the same tests, consisted, in
 100 parts,  of
                          21   oxygen.
                          79 azote.
                         100
    In trying common atmospheric air with lime-water, we
could never find any quantity of carbonic acid perceptible in
the eudiometer of 100 parts.

So that 292-14 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas were given
off in eleven minutes, or 26-55 cubic inches per minute, which
is almost exactly the estimate of professor Davy.

lungs of one person, we concluded that the next should be
performed upon our assistant.

Here,       as   usual, the lungs were exhausted                                 both before, and at
the clsse of the experiment.
   The excess of eleven cubic inches, in this case, no doubt
arose from the person not having been       the habit of ex                      in
hausting his lungs, so that they contained more when he
began than when he left off; his lungs appeared to be of
greater capacity than those of the usual operator.
     Portions          of  gas were saved from each of the mercurial
gasometers             as they were filled, which being mixed together,
for the average gave the following results                                   :

Consequently 28T43 cubic inches of carbonic acid                                                        gas were

it   returns   charged with about 8 per cent, carbonic acid.
The faster respiration is performed, the more carbonic acid
js given off, and consequently the more oxygen consumed :
jn this instance it was given off at the rate of fifty-one
pubic inches per minute.
                       Thirteenth Experiment.
    We now      proceeded   to carry on the respiration         of common
air for a much longer period than usual, and of course on a
much larger quantity.          The experiment was made by the
same operator who had performed all the other, except the
12th. Eleven mercurial gasometers having been filled, taken
ofl,, and registered,    the operator continued to breathe in the
 12th   until a mark was made by his colleague upon the scale
of the water gasometer,       and   it  was again filled with common
air to the usual division on the scale.             This occupied but         a
very short space of time.          The operator, without taking his
lips  from   the  tube, then   filled   twelve more of the mercurial
gasometers, which were registered as before, and he conti
nued to breathe in the 12th,           until   the water gasometer         was
again replenished ; eleven more were then filled, and por
tions saved from each : the experiment was completed by a
forcible expiration of 166 cubic inches into the !2th ; and
this last portion being left for an hour and a half was not
perceptibly diminished in volume.

The   breathing was so nearly natural            that the      operator was
scarcely fatigued, and thought that he could have gone on
for a much longer time.
    The smallness of the deficiency, notwithstanding the ex
periments occupied 24^ minutes, is a striking circum
stance, and leads us to suspect still more strongly, that
the    deficiency principally      arises    from the impossibility of
always bringing the lungs to the same state after forcible
fxpi ration.
                                                                   too   parts

                        100    : 8   : :   9972 : 789'76.
   So that 789'76 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas were given
   off in 24.iJ. minutes, which gives thirty-two cubic inches per
  minute.        But here it must be noticed that the respiration
   was more rapid than in the 11th experiment, and a larger
  quantity of carbonic acid given off in the same time. This
  agrees with the 12th experiment.
     We are very much inclined to               think that, in ordinary   re
  spiration,     a great part    of   the air is returned unaltered,     viz.
  that contained in the fauces, in the trachea, and probably a
  portion of that in the larger branches of the bronchia. If this
  circumstance be not adverted to in experiments upon small
 quantities of air, the results can never be correct.              There is
 even a considerable difference in the quality              of the first and
 last portions     of   a single    inspiration.      In some experiments
 made with a view to this subject, a small quantity              of the first
 portions, given off in a common and natural expiration, was
 received    in a vessel over mercury ; on examination, it only
 contained 3.5 per cent. carbonic acid ; in other experiments
 the first portions contain from three to five per cent. ; while
the generaf average appears by the 11th, 12th, and 13th ex
 periments, to be about eight.
    The operator, after rather more than              a natural inspiration
expired     204     cubic    inches      into  the   mercurial  gasometer,
making his utmost efforts to press as much as possible out
of the lungs, this contained 9-5 per cent. of carbonic
acid.     Here we are to recollect, that these 2O4 cubic inches
contained       the   first,  as  well     as the  last portions ; the first
portions have been proved to contain only from three to.
five per cent, ; consequently the last portions must contain.

                     and Oxygen Gas by Respiration.                                851
more than appears by the average ; that                     is,   more than 9'5
per cent.
    now appeared to us of consequence to ascertain exactly
     It
what happened to   given volume of atmospheric air, when
                           a
it   was inspired and expired         as   often   as   possible.
                          Fourteenth Experiment*.
  Three hundred cubic inches of atmospheric air were ad
mitted into the mercurial gasometer G. 1. the other, G. 2, ;
was empty.          The   nose being properly secured, and the mouth
applied to the tube           A,   as usual,     air was drawn           from      G.   1,
and       by   half turning    the cock, 2, was expired into             G.   2.   This
was repeated          until the contents of G.           1. had been          made      to
pass through          the lungs,    and       transmitted toG. 2. The air
was then inspired from             G.    2,   and expired into G.   until     1,
G.    2    was nearly empty.        This      was repeated     about eight or
ten times during three minutes,                 until respiration became ex
tremely laborious, and the operator desisted.
   The whoje 300 cubic inches must have passed eight or ten
times through the lungs; and we confidently expected, that
on examining the air we should have found an unusual pro
portion of carbonic acid.
JJut 100 parts gave only 9-5 carbonic acid.
                           5-5 oxygen.

Here was an increase of six parts in 100 of something which
the tests for oxygen would not take up, and also   loss of six      a
per cent. oxygen. This seemed to convince us, that under
certain circumstances, as during some peculiar alteration in
the vital functions, gaseous oxide of carbon, carburetted
hydrogen, or some other gas not absorbable        lime-water        by
or the tests for oxygen, might be given off from the lungs,
and we accordingly determined to repeat Cruikshank's     ex
periments   wilh hyperpxygenized muriatic acid gas.
     *   In this experiment there was obviously no occasion to make allowance for
 (he air contained in the tubes arid sockets.   We find its Volume to be eighteen
 cubic inches.
                                                                                     w«

  253        On the Changes produced in Atmospheric               Air
     We procured           the gas from hyperoxygenized           muriate   of
 potash by means of muriatic acid, and mixing it with a
 known portion of gaseous oxide of carbon in a flint stopper
 bottle, the mouth of which was immersed in mercury for
 twenty-four hours, the gaseous oxide of carbon was converted
  into carbonic acid gas, as was proved by its effects upon lime-
 water, which, when both the gases are pure, absorbs them
 entirely after they have remained together for twenty-four
 hours     ;  it  was plain,    therefore, that we had the means of
 detecting caseous oxide of carbon, and doubtless carburetted
 hydrogen, if any should be contained in the expired gas.
 From     a  conviction of the importance of these experiments we
 were determined to take nothing upon trust.
                            Fifteenth Experiment.
    We repeated          the 14th experiment with         a little variation.
 In this case we employed only             one   of  the mercurial     gaso
meters, into which exactly 300 cubic inches of atmospheric
air were admitted. The operator having made an easy ex
piration, applied his month to the cock at the top of the bell
glass, and the time being noted, began to breathe ; in less
than    a   minute he found himself obliged to take              deeper   and
deeper       inspirations ; and at last the efforts       of   the lungs to
take in air became so strong and sudden, that the glass was
in   some danger       of being broken against the side of         the gaso
meter.       A   great sense of oppression and suffocation          was now
felt in the chest, vision became            indistinct, and after the se
cond minute his whole               attention seemed to be withdrawn
from surrounding objects and fixed upon the experiment.
He now experienced that buz in the ears which is noticed
in breathing nitrous oxide, and after the third minute he had
only sufficient recollection to close the cock after an ex
piration.         This secured the result of the experiment ; but
he    became so perfectly insensible that, on recovering, he
was much surprised at finding his friend and the assist
ant on the table in the act of supporting him. It was
noticed that he had made thirty-five inspirations during
the experiment.           We now examined         the air which had been
bo treated.

   In  this experiment it is remarkable, that the air which had
been so often through the lungs, should only have furnished
10 per cent, of carbonic acid, while the air which passes them
but once contains from           8 to 8-5.
   Here    the oxygen       had lost    7  from   2 1 , and the    azote had
gained    7  upon 79.
   We knew by previous experiment *, that                 every cubic      inch
 of carbonic acid       gas required exactly a cubic inch          of oxygen
for its formation     ;  the  ten parts   of  carbonic  acid  may therefore
be reckoned as      oxygen, which would make the constitution of
the gas after the experiment            <

whereas before the experiment it was              <

    Now     we did     not suppose       the residuum       of   86 to be all
azote, though 79 might be ; therefore seven parts appeared
to have been added by this unnatural mode of respiring,
and we conjectured the addition might be gaseous oxide of
carbon.
    To  ascertain    this,    we   put 40 parts into a flint stopper
bottle, and nearly filled it with about 100 parts hyperox-
 ygenized muriatic acid, procured as before, and recently pre
 pared; the stopper being put in, over distilled water, we
 plunged it in quicksilver, and filled a second bottle in the
 same way, as a comparative experiment.
    We next procured          some pure azote, by absorbing the oxy
 gen  from    a portion    of  atmospheric air by the saturated green
 sulphate and simple green sulphate as usual ; 40 parts of this
 azote were mixed with the same proportion of the acid gas
 as in the    other experiment, and the whole suffered to stand
 for forty- eight hours       ; at the end of this time the azote was
 examined, by washing it first in distilled water, and after-
     * Sec the experiments on carbonic acid in the Society'* Transactions.
                                                                        wards

    154       fin  tJie Changes produced in Atmospheric      Air
   wards in the eudiometer with the tests for oxygen ; and there;
   were still exactly 40 parts left ; proving that the hyperox-
   ygenized muriatic arid gas has no action upon azote.
       We then examined         the   bottles containing the residuum
   from the air that had been so often respired, and found that
   it had not experienced       the slightest change ; it was therefore
   plainly azote ;      and on reflection, it occurred to us, that if a
   certain proportion of oxygen had been absorbed or lost in any
  way, while the azote remained unaltered, there must be an
  increased     proportion of the latter.
      Now we knew exactly both the bulk and the constitution
  of the air before the experiment ; but it was impossible to
  know    the bulk or volume after the experiment otherwise than
  by calculation.
      The 300 cubic inches of atmospheric air before the ex
  periment contained 21 oxygen, 79 azote in 100 parts, making
  the total quantity of oxygen 63 cubic inches,
                            azote 237
                                  300
      Now   if  the    lungs be capable of fixing permanently any
 azote from the atmosphere, it appears by our experiments
 that the      quantity must be very minute, seeing that in the
  1 1th, 12th, and 13th experiment, it did not disturb the pro*
 portion of azote, as shown by the eudiometer ; we shall there
 fore in the present instance assume the volume of azote after
 the experiment at 237 cubic inches, as before.
      But after the experiment, every 100 parts consisted of 88
parts azote, and )4 oxygen,            either in the form of carbonic
acid, or free.
                         86  : 14  ::  237   : 38'58.
Therefore       the total quantity of oxygen left after the expert
incut would have been 38.58 cubic inches.
            Then     237 azote + 38.58 oxygen       = 275.58;
the quantity      of gas after respiration      would   therefore have
been 275.58 cubic inches.
300 — 275.58 = the loss           of oxygen, or 24'42 cubic inches.
It   appears,   therefore, that 24.42 cubic inches of oxygen had
                                                                  been

               ,  and Oxygen Gas by Respiration,                   235
been absorbed by the system under the circumstances of this
experiment.
    Reviewing the 14th experiment, it appears that the gas
after respiration contained 85 per cent. azote, and 15 per
cent, oxygen, either in the state of carbonic acid, or free.

                         85 : 15 :: 237  :  41'82.
The total quantity of oxygen after         the experiment appears to
be 41-82 cubic inches.
           Then     237 azote  + 41•82 oxygen       =  278•82.
The    total volume after the experiment          appears to be 278-82
                                                                      »
cubic inches.
                        300 — 278-82 = 21-18.
    The   loss   of  oxygen in this case was 21-18 cubic inches.
     We   are disposed    to consider the    1 1th as a standard expe
 riment relative to carbonic acid gas, because the quantity of
 air respired in a given time is pretty near the average of the
 first ten experiments; and because it very nearly agrees with
 the statement of professor Davy.            In this experiment 292
 cubic inches of carbonic' acid gas were given off in eleven
 minutes    ; the barometer was 30-4, the thermometer 50°, the
 volume      being calculated at the mean, viz. barometer 30,
 thermometer 60°, will be 302 cubic inches given off in eleven
 minutes, or 39534 cubic inches in twenty-four hours, sup
 posing the production to be uniform during all that period ;
 and as 100 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas weigh 47-26
 grains,
                    100 : 47-26 :: 39534 : 18683-76;
  the weight of the carbonic acid gas amounts to 18683-76
  grains; and estimating the carbon in it at 28 parts in 100,
  according to Lavoisier, or 28-60, as calculated in the expe
  riments on diamond, recorded in the Society's Transactions,
             100 : 28-60 : : 18683-76 : 5363-55 grains;
  it will follow that 5363-55 grs. or above 11 oz. troy of solid
  carbon, arc emitted by the lungs in the course of twenty-
  four hours ; and that 39534 cubic inches of oxygen gas are
  consumed in the same time.          But when        we  consider  that
  in respiration perfectly natural,     a much smaller quantity       of
                                                                      air

 genized muriate of potash                          by  heat, care having been taken
 to clear all the tubes, &c.                      as   much as possible of common

consequently, 35P23 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas were
 formed in 9'-20", or 37-64 cubic inches in a minute.
    Here it is plain that a greater quantity of carbonic acid
was formed from oxygen than from common air, in the
same time     ; and hence we infer,          that one use     of azote  is to
regulate the quantity       of oxygen, which shall           be taken up   in
the act of respiration.
    The  gas inspired was 3260 cubic inches,               and of this 2-5
per cent. was azote.
                      100  :   4-5   :: 3260    :  81-50.
    The total quantity of azote in the gas inspired, was there
fore 81-50 cubic inches.
    The quantity of      gas expired was 3193            cubic inches, and
of this  every   100 parts     contained six of azote.
                       100   :  6 ::   3193 :    191-58.
    The total quantity of        azote in the gas expired, was there
fore 191-58 cubic inches; but the total quantity of azote be
fore respiration was only 81-50.
                     191-58 — 81-50 = 110-08,
therefore   1  10-08 cubic inches were added by the               process  of
respiration,    beside what little remained           in the lungs after the
experiment.
                       Calculation      for Oxygen.
The 3260 cubic inches of gas inspired contained 81-50 azote.
                     3260 — 81-50 = 3178-50,
and consequently the pure oxygen was 3 178-50 cubic inches.
The    3193 cubic inches       of  gas expired, contained 83 per cent.
of  free oxygen, and     11    per cent, in carbonic acid gas, making
together 94.
                     100 : 94     ::  3193  :   3001-42.
   The oxygen gas, found after the experiment, was there
fore 3001-4 2 cubic inches, and deducting this from the oxy
gen before the experiment,
                   3178-50 — 3001-42 = 177-08.
It appears, at first sight, that 17708 cubic inches of oxygen
were missing, but great part of this may be accounted for, by
adverting to the state of the lungs after the experiment.

    The addition of        1 10.08 cubic inches of azote, we consider
 as arising from that portion still retained            in the lungs, not
 withstanding       the   forced    expiration    at  the  beginning of the
 experiment, and considering that in the 14th and 15th ex
periment, where the same air was repeatedly breathed, the
 proportion of azote was in the one case 85, and in the other
 86 per cent.        It seems fair to presume, that the residual air
contained in the lungs after a forced expiration may amount
in   100 parts, to not more than 16 oxygen and 84 azote                   :  any
one who       reflects    upon     the   structure   of the lungs,    and the
minute ramifications of the extremities of the bronchial ves
sels;   and     when he also          considers that those parts of the
lungs with which             the air comes in contact, if spread out,
would present a surface equal to that of the superficies of the
whole body ; and lastly, that this viscus is so exceedingly
spongy and porous, that when once inflated, it is ever after
impossible       by ordinary        mechanical      means to expel the air
completely, he        will easily perceive, not only that        a large'   por
tion of air must remain for a considerable time in contact
with the internal surface of the lungs, where it is liable to
lose a portion       of its oxygen, but also that the residual quan
tity  of  air  in  the   lungs, after the most violent attempts at
expiration, may be very considerable.                 It is to this circum
stance   that   we    attribute   the  excess    of  azote   in the experi
ments upon oxygen, and pretty deep inspirations of this gas
having been made during 9'. 20", the azote must have been
in  great measure         displaced.      Admitting then that          the air
contained in the lungs, before the experiment, consisted of
16 oxygen, 84 azote, and at the conclusion of the experi
ment of 94 oxygen, 6 azote, then we have
                 8Jf azote    at the beginiug,

The deficiency noticed in the experiment         was 67, supposing
that the lungs were brought to the same state after as before
the experiment ; but granting that this was not the case,

and that at the close of the experiment the state of the lungs
was 141 -f- 67 = 206, still our approximation will come
within four or five cubic inches, for the azote contained in
the sixty-seven missing would be only about four cubic
inches.     We are aware that the temperature of the lung*
being 97, while that of the gas was 53% the 141 cubic
inches would occupy a space equal to 154 cubic inches ; but
this residual quantity must be greater or less according to the
exertion made, and also probably according to the state of
the muscular fibre at the time.
                      Seventeenth    Experiment.
    The water gasometer was filled to the usual mark upon the
 scale, with oxygen gas, prepared from about 9 oz. troy, of
hyperoxygenized muriate of potash, as in the former experi
 ment; the     gas being examined was          found to contain as be
 fore, 2-5 azote, and 97-5 oxygen, in 100 parts.
     The apparatus being found air-tight, and all the tubes, &c.
 cleared  of atmospheric air by passing oxygen through them,
 the operator prepared himself for the experiment ; but it
 must be noticed that he had been rather fatigued during five
 hours previous to respiring, and had not taken any refresh
 ment ; the weather was very warm ; his pulse 86 ; heat
 under the tongue g8f ; he felt no uncomfortable sensation
 during the process, but experienced a gentle glow and uni
 versal perspiration, breathing all the time with great ease ;
  his pulse after the experiment was 102, and the heat under
  the tongue 99°.

   The  13th gasometer was the whole       of  the last single and
forcible expiration ; portion's were saved from each of the
gasometers, and we first examined the state of No. 1.
      100 parts contained      9 carbonic acid,
                              25 azote,
                              66 oxygen.
                            100
   The large quantity of azote in this      case was a clear proof
that our conjecture upon the residual gas in the lungs was
well founded.
   We then examined     a mixture     of No.  2 and 3.
        100 parts contained     10* 5  carbonic acid,
                               10      azote,
                               79-5 oxygen.
                               100
Here the quantity of azote was diminishing, and the ratio of
carbonic acid increasing ; so that it appears necessary for the
lungs to be cleared of azote, before the increased proportion
of carbonic acid can take place.
   The 13th or last gasometer was now examined by itself:
      100 parts contained   12-5    carbonic acid,
                              5' 5 azote,
                             82-    oxygen.
                            100
Here the proportion of azote was only 3 per cent, more than
what existed previously in the gas ; and hence we may con
clude, that even seven minutes and a half was not a sufficient
time to remove the azote from the extremties of the bronchia.

     The azote expired,                beside what might be contained        in the
 lungs, at the close of                the experiment,      was therefore 263.10
 cubic inches.            Here it      is  plain, that the operator, at the be
 ginning of this experiment,                   had not brought his lungs to the
  same      state as        in the preceding; or that in consequence of
 fatigue,       and want of refreshment for several hours, the pro
 portion       of  azote in the lungs might be greater.
     tvery. Ki0 parts of oxygen, before it was inspired, con
  tained 2.5 azote.
                                                                                100

Consequently it contained 85.50 cubic inches of azote.

                   177.60 will be left for the increase        of azote.
Then supposing     as before, that the quality of the air in the
lungs, before   the   experiment, was 84 per cent. azote, 16
oxygen, and after the experiment 5.5 per cent, azote, 94.5

Hence it appears, that previous to the experiment, the lungs
contained in this instance 226 cubic inches; and if we suppose
them to be in the same state after, as before the experiment,
the quality  of the  gas in each case        will be as follows :

    The deficiency in this case, and in the former experiment
 with oxygen, though comparatively small, when contrasted
 with the quantity of gas respired, is larger than the average
 with atmospheric air : it seems probable, therefore, that a
 portion may be detained in the system. It must be remem
 bered that what we call residual gas, is not only that con
 tained in the substance          of   the lungs,         and in its appendages,
 but also that contained in           the fauces and mouth.

    On account of     an accident we cannot give the proportion*
contained in     2 to 10 ;   but the contents of the first and last
gasometers confirm the former experiment, and show that
the proportion of azote continues to diminish, as the expe
riment proceeds, and also that there is a larger proportion of
carbonic acid given off when oxygen is employed, instead of
atmospheric air.
    In this  recital of experiments, which      have occupied a con
siderable    portion of time and attention, we have endea
voured to give a plain statement of facts, from which every
one may draw conclusions for himself; we shall here, how
ever,   take the liberty     of briefly recapitulating  the principal
of   those facts, and    submitting     what seems to us the most
 obvious inferences.
     1. It appears that the quantity      of carbonic acid gas emit
ted is exactly equal,     bulk   for bulk, to the oxygen consumed,
and therefore there is no reason to conjecture that any water
 is formed by an union of oxygen and hydrogen in the lungs,
    2. Atmospheric        air once entering the lungs, returns
charged with from 8 to 8-5 per cent, carbonic acid gas, and
                                                                when

 J66    On the Changes produced in Atmospheric      Air, We.
when the contacts are repeated almost      as frequently as possi
ble, only 10 per cent. is emitted.
   The   12th and 13th experiments prove, that when the        in
spirations and expirations are more rapid than usual, a larger
quantity of carbonic acid is emitted in a given time ; but the
proportion is nearly the same, or about 8 per cent. The pro
portions of carbonic acid gas, in the first and last portions of
a deep inspiration, differ as widely as from 3'5 to 9.5 per cent.
   3. Considering the 11th as a standard experiment, it ap
pears that a middle-sized man, aged about thirty-eight years,
and whose pulse is seventy on an average, gives off 302 cubic
inches of carbonic acid gas from his lungs in eleven minutes ;
and supposing the production uniform for twenty.four hours,
the total    quantity   in that period would be 39534 cubic
inches,    weighing    18683 grains; the carbon in which is
5363 grains, or rather more than 11oz.troy; the oxygen
consumed in the same time will be equal in volume to the
carbonic acid gas ; but it is evident, that the quantity of
carbonic acid gas, emitted in a given time, must depend
very much upon the circumstances under which respiration
is performed    ; and here  it may  be proper to notice,   that all
the experiments were made between breakfast and dinner.
   4T When respiration is attended with distressing circum-
stances,   as in the 14th and 15th experiments, there is reason
to conclude that a portion      of oxygen is absorbed; and in
the last  of  these  experiments, we may remark, that as the
oxygen    decreases   in quantity, perception gradually ceases,
and we may suppose that life would be completely extin
guished on the total abstraction of oxygen.
   5. A larger proportion of carbonic acid gas is formed by
the human subject from oxygen, than from atmospheric air.
   6.  An    easy,  natural inspiration  is from   16 to 17 cubic
inches in the subject of these experiments, who makes about
 19 in a minute; this, however, will vary in different indi
viduals,   and perhaps we ought to estimate the quantity of
carbonic acid gas, given off in perfectly natural respiration,
at somewhat less, and most likely at considerably less, than
in the statement above, when we consider that in short inspi
rations the quantity of air which has reached no further than
                                                               the

                            On Commerce.                         gflT
the fauces, trachea, &c. bears a much larger proportion to
the whole mass respired, than when the inspirations are deep.
    7.   No hydrogen, nor any other     gas, appears to be evolved
during the process of respiration.
    8. The general averags of the deficiency in the total
amount of common air inspired, appears to be very small,
amounting only to about 6 parts in 1000, and we are in
clined to attribute it in great measure to the difficulty in ex
hausting the lungs as completely after an experiment as be
fore    it; the first expiration   being made    into the open air,
the last into the apparatus.
    9. The experiments upon oxygen gas prove that the quan
tity of air remaining in the lungs and its appendages is very
considerable, and that, without a reference to this circum
 stance,    all experiments upon small quantities       of   gas  are
liable to inaccuracy.
    Other important conclusions might perhaps be drawn from
 the' facts related in this paper : but having already trespassed
largely upon the time of the Society, we shall abstain from
any further remarks, until we bring forward a new series of
experiments.
   XXXIX.       On Commerce.       By  Mr. James Graham, of
                        Berw ick -upon- Tweed.
                           To  Mr. Tilloch.
       SIR'
 T?
 I.  rom    some   circumstances needless to mention,      I  did not
 see   your Maga2ine till a few days ago, in which some re
 marks are made on my Essay on Commerce.
    Before I again enter upon this subject, permit me to re
 turn my best thanks to Mr. Lapis, for the mild and candid
 manner in which he has offered         his remarks.    I am much
 obliged by his giving       me an opportunity     of further illus
 trating and proving the propositions I laid down in my for
 mer Essay; but after all, if it should appear that some of
 nay opinions were erroneous, the sooner my error is detected
                                                                  the

the better.    I have   long been      of opinion, that freedom of
discussion is the highest privilege that either a nation or an
 individual can enjoy, whether in regard to commerce, poli
ties, or religion.    Let error hide its haggard face, shrink
from inquiry, or shelter itself under laws, pains, or penal
ties. Truth has nothing to fear : the more it is tried, the
more it is examined, like a fair and upright character it will
only appear more amiable, and shine with a brighter lustre.
    It would appear from the remarks of Mr. Lapis, that             I
had not expressed myself in so clear a manner, but that some
doubt might arise as to the real meaning of the proposition
J  laid down relative to the laws of nature, pointing out the
true principles of commerce, and that in all our commercial
regulations we ought to keep those laws in the order of na
ture constantly in view.        In the diversified productions of
the world which we inhabit,         I endeavoured  to trace the first
principles   of commerce, by       every country  having some su
perfluities, and that there       was  no country   but had some
wants ; that a mutual intercourse was of reciprocal advantage ;
that all prohibitory laws, or excessive duties, were counteract
ing the benevolent dispensations of       the Supreme Being, that
no laws however severe,         nor any regulations however mul
tiplied,  would  prevent  illicit trade where there was too strong
a temptation ; that this was encouraged and supported by the
present impolitic laws,. and such had a very bad effect on
the morals of the people. To have illustrated all these in          a
full and proper manner would have required a volume :               I
only mentioned what struck me at the time as being most
evident, and generally understood by the middling class of
society.
    I will now endeavour to answer some of Mr. Lapis's ob
jections. He says that the laws or order of nature are the re
verse of what I had stated, because every country does, or
with proper cultivation will, produce all those articles neces
sary for the support, &c., of the inhabitants, and that the
natural produce of every country is the most congenial to the
health and support of the people.
    Now I fully admit the truth of Mr. Lapis's observation in
 a certain degree, but I do not conceive that it in the least
                                                              either

                          On Commerce.                         *fi9
either weakens or invalidates my former propositions, (viz.)
That there was no country, however highly it may be favour
ed, which can produce all that is necessary for the comfort,
health, protection, and security of its inhabitants.
    I will here  confine my observations to our own country :
at the same time. I am confident that in a great variety of
articles such observations are applicable to every nation.         I
believe none will deny that this country is highly favoured,
whether we consider the mildness of the climate, the pro
ductiveness of the soil, the astonishing improvements iu
agriculture, the skill and persevering industry of our manu
 facturers, the enterprising spirit of our merchants, &c, — Yet
 with all these how numerous are our wants ! It is a fact well
 ascertained, although not generally known, that this country
 does not on an     average raise as much corn as is absolutely
 necessary for the support of the inhabitants. When this is
 the case,   it would certainly  be worse than    folly  to  occupy
 any part of the land which is proper for the production of
 corn to any other purpose. How are we to procure our flax
 and hemp ? the consumption of which, I scruple not to say,
 is immense ; and I think it will be generally admitted, that
 the various purposes to which linen is adapted add much,
 very much, to our comfort, in almost innumerable instances.
  Now for protection, without these two articles what would
 become of our navy, the glory and boast of our country, as
  well  as  all the vessels employed in commercial concerns ?
  But this is not all ; for even in wood we are deficient, parti
  cularly for masts, as well as some other kinds needless to
  mention.     Another artisle for which we are entirely depen
  dent on foreign supplies is gunpowder, which in the present
  state of the world (and there is no appearance of its being
  better) is of the most absolute necessity. Must we not bring
  our sulphur from abroad, and our nitre from almost the ends
  of the earth ? I turn my eyes to our large bleaching-grounds :
  From whence     do we draw the principal materials for cleaning
  and whitening our linen, by which means it is rendered fit
  for all the various purposes to which it is adapted ? If I sur
  vey our more extended        print-fields in all their various de
   partments; but particularly     in the variety of those colours
                                                               where

      S70                       On Commerce.
     where the skill    of  the  artist almost rivals the blossoms of
     Nature,    Must we not procure the         greater    part from other
     countries   ? And unless the present        order of the universe is
     changed, no human art can cultivate, to any extent, many
     of the dveing.woods, and many other articles which are es
     sentially necessary in our manufactures.             Any person tole
     rably  conversant     with  these   branches    of trade  or manufac
     ture, will easily perceive that I might strengthen my argu
     ment by a ereat variety of observations : but for this my
     own time will not admit; besides, it would be occupying too
     much room in your useful Miscellany.
        I will now   beg leave to examine how far this country can,
    or actually does, produce all that is necessary for health. As
    I make no pretension to a knowledge           of  the materia medica,
    I will confine my observations to such        articles as are generally
    admitted to be essentially useful. Bark is certainly acknow
    ledged to be of very extensive utility, But from whence is it
   procured ? —from a far country.           Opium, however much it
   may beabused,      —  (and thisis no solid argument against its great
   usefulness,     indeed   I am apt to think, that in all the more
'
   excruciating pains and acute diseases to which the human
   frame is liable, it is of far more essential benefit than any
   other medicine) ; — even this commodity we have to procure
   from a distant country. Mercury and camphire likewise oc
   cupy   a largespace   in the apothecary's shop. Indeed I am apt to
   think, that by far the greater part of the medicines at present
   in most estimation are the produce of other countries : even
   wine, in    a  medical point of view, is in many cases of the
   greatest   utility.
       It may here be necessary       to observe,    that  Mr. Lapis ask*
  with considerable confidence, How long an English brick-
  maker could support himself upon wine in place of porter?
  I   never meant to say that wine, as a common beverage to a
  British labourer, was preferable to good English malt liquor.
  No : but my meaning was, that it was a very useful and
  often    a very necessary    article ; that the high duty was im
  politic   and  cruel,  as depriving all the lower orders, I may al
  most add all the middling class of society, of that which in a
  variety of circumstances is essentially useful.            But more of
                                                                      tbi«

                               On Commerce.                           271
this in another place. After the enumerations of such a
variety of foreign articles (and many, very many more might
be mentioned), absolutely necessary'in this country, Am                  I
not justified in saying that there is no country which can
produce all that is necessary for the comfort, health, pro
tection, and security of its inhabitants ? Or, in other words,
By having a reciprocal intercourse with other countries, we
make our security more strong, we increase the necessaries
of life, we enlarge our comforts, we multiply our pleasures,
we procure more means of preserving health and of mitiga
ting pain.
   But Mr. Lapis brings forth another argument, which,                  if
founded on facts, would certainly have great weight, (viz.)
That if any country did not produce all that was necessary
for the health, comfort, &c, of the inhabitants, such coun
try would be deserted, or no inhabitant would reside in such a
situation.     Now I cannot admit the truth of this observa
tion ; and to prove the contrary, I will not draw the atten
tion of your readers to the barren wilds of Lapland, or the
mountainous forests of Norway, or some more distant
 countries. — I will confine my observations nearer home,
where the facts      I  mention    can be more easily ascertained.
Let those who have not visited the Shetland Islands, only
read the accounts given by every traveller. The inhabitants,
with   a few exceptions, are in      a state  of inconceivable wretch
edness ; they every year        are dependent       on foreign supplies
for meal, and the distress which they often suffer for want
of this article is great in the extreme ; they cannot be said to
 have any one necessary        article of life in plenty except fish.
The making of kelp is the staple manufactory ; and it is
 principally with these two articles, fish and kelp, that they
 procure, as far as they can,          a  few, and but    a very  few,  of
 the most common necessaries           of life. Yet Shetland    is not de
 serted,  its inhabitants are    as much attached       to the place in
 which they     live   as the people     who   are  placed in far more
 favoured situations. Some may, however, suppose that this
 proceeds from their knowing no better, and being, from
 their insular situation,     cut off from any intercourse with the
 main land.       I will not at present stop to answer this objec
                                                                     tion'

 tion, (which might easily                  be done,)      but pass on to the
 Highlands of Scotland. This                is not a small spot detached       from
 the rest of the world, but a               large district above 200 miles           in
 length,         ihe very numerous
              besides                                  islands which stretch
 along the west and northern shores                    of Scotland, and some
 of them of         very considerable extent           : — the island of Lewis
 is 50 miles long and 30 broad ; Sky is not much inferior ;
 and Mull is a large island. The general appearance of the
 main land,         as    well as the islands, is      a   constant     succession
 of rocks     and        mountains ; the lower grounds are very        much
 covered      with        black   peat,    or moss and             which in
                                                              heath,
Scotland is called heather: the                 inhabitants, with a very few
exceptions, live in huts (for houses they cannot be called)
*without either window or chimney.    I will not stop to enu
merate the many distresses to which they are liable ; suffice
it to say, the privations they suffer are often great in the ex
treme, yet their attachment to the soil is stronger than that
of any people I have ever had intercourse with : nothing but
force or the most pressing wants will induce a Highlander to
leave his country.  Nor can his ignorance of more pleasant
and much more comfortable situations be argued as the
cause    of   his attachment         :   — the whole    eastern*   coast   of Scot
land is in a state of very considerable improvement; the
inns on all the principal roads arc good ; agriculture is in a
state of great forwardness.   It                is,
                                    however, needless here to
give a particular description of the country, any further than
to point out that the difference between the eastern and
western coasts of Scotland       great beyond all conception,
                                           is
but to those who have visited both districts   as the one runs:
close parallel to the other, the Highlander has constant op
portunities of seeing those more favoured situations; yet he
prefers his bleak mountains and smoky hut, to the fine cul
tivated fields and comfortable houses of the Low Countries.
   Upon the whole, as far as have experienced,, as well as
                                           I
from the information    of others,   am clearly of opinion,

that the   inhabitants of the more barren parts of this world
are more attached           to their situation than the people who live
where Nature         is   much more bountiful.               will not   at present

            present  object is to call the attention of our medical
gentlemen to a remedy, which, it is said, has been tried ia
Spain with success. This remedy is given by Fisher, in his
Picture of Valentia,          ou the authority of Cavanilles ; and as
the whole chapter on the subject is curious, I shall tran
scribe it:
     "  The inhabitants of        the district    of Hoya    de  Castalla,  in
(he    southern part of the province (of Valentia), possess an
excellent remedy against the bite of the viper, composed
of    the    sea   holly    (Eryngium       campestre),      viper's bugloss
(Echiiim vulgare), madwort (Alyssum spinosum) , and Cre
tan balm (Melissa cretica*), in the following manner:
     " The plants are taken when they are beginning to run to
seed,      and dried in the shade till        all their humidity      is  eva
porated.       On this,    each is pounded separately,         the powder is
passed through a hair sieve,           mixed in      equal   parts,  and put
away in well.corked          bottles.    It  is to be observed, that none
of   the roots must be employed except those               of  the sea-holly,
which possess very great strength.
    * Under this name the
                              plant is described by some botanists, and among
the rest by Lamarck ; but Cavanilles proves, from the structure of the calyx
and other circumstances, that it is properly the Neprta marifuiia.   See Anales

  " From time immemorial the inhabitants                         of this district
have       made     use      of this powder     as   a   specific Cor the bite of
vipers with universal success, till at length the celebrated

lost   considerable quantity of blood.

years not the least alteration has been observed      their                in

 man named Joaquin Fauro, were bitten, the two former on

 his daughter immediately applied to Don Thomas Sabater,

lived at another village, looked upon his wound as a mere
trifle, and took no further notice of it.
    "What was the consequence ? Baset and his daughter
were perfectly cured, and                 have       for these   three years expe

all the symptoms of the most confirmed hydrophobia.

other dogs, pigs, &c. The powder was administered to

whom the powder                   was    not given died raving mad in 25
days.
  " One dog to which was found impossible to administer
                                    it
more than four doses, did not go mad, but fell into kind                                 a

 XLF. A Description of           the Apparatus      by tvhich the     French
      Experiment     on the Decomposition       of Potash has    been made
      at the  Royal Institution *.
  J.  his   apparatus     (see Plate   VII.)    consists of    a   common
 gun -barrel     curved, to which         there  is adapted an iron tube
 of   the capacity    of two cubic inches for        the potash.      At the
bottom of this tube is         a very small hole, through which the
potash gradually        flows.
     In this experiment, the iron i turnings are first heated to
whiteness ; the potash is then slowly fused, and flows on
 the turnings, where it is decomposed, and its base is found
condensed near the other extremity of the barrel.
     The proportions from which the best results have been
obtained, are about          2} parts  of iron turnings,    to  1-J- parts of
potash.
     In order to the complete success of this experiment, some
precautions are necessary.             The whole of the apparatus
should be perfectly dry, clean, and impervious to air ; the
turnings free from oxidation, and the potash very dry ; which
last is effected by heating nearly to redness.             Pure or cry
stallized potash in its usual state of dryness            contains a suf
ficient quantity of water to occasion the failure of the expe
riment. The tube containing the potash should be surround
ed by ice until the turnings are white-hot; and that part of
the barrel where the potassium sublimes, should also be kept
cool during the whole of the process.                 The barrel must be
carefully luted.        It is proper to examine the lute after it has
been exposed       to  a  red heat, in order to repair any cracks
which the fire may have occasioned.                A tube of safety with
a   little mercury or naphtha should be cemented to the bar
rel, to prevent the communication '-of the external air.
     At   the commencement          of  the  decomposition,      hydrogen
gas is evolved, and continues to come over during the whole
of the process. Towards the end of the experiment a very

A he aeriform compounds of hydrogen                                 and carbon, which
were already entitled to accurate      investigation,                            as objects of
scientific      research, have derived an additional                             claim to the

278              Description         of   an Apparatus        for   the
chemical philosopher to decide the controverted question re
specting their composition.   Results, sufficiently multipli-*
cd and precise for this purpose, would                        require     a   larger   ap-»
propriation of time, than I have the prospect of being able
to bestow ; and I can only, on the present occasion, offer an
example of the method in which it appears to me that the
analysis of this class of substances will be most successfully
attempted.
     When            substance, composed (as may be as
             a vegetable
sumed to simplify the statement) of oxygen, hydrogen, and
carbon, united in the form of a ternary compound, is sub
mitted to distillation,         ata temperature  not below that of ig
nition,     the equilibrium      of affinities, which constituted the
triple combination, is          destroyed ; and the elements, com
posing     it,
           are united in             a    new manner.          Those,         which     are
disposed to enter into permanently clastic combinations,
escape in the state of gas. The carbon, uniting with oxy
gen, either composes carbonic acid gas, or, stopping short
of that    degree    of oxygenation which                is   essential       to change
it   into an acid,   is   converted into carbonic oxide.         The hy
drogen, combining with               a    portion of carbon, constitutes a
binary compound of those two ingredients, forming either
what has been called carbureted hydrogen gas, or super-
carbureted hydrogen, better known      the appellation ofby
olefiant gas.  Towards the close of the process,'    portion of           a
simple hydrogen gas     also mingled with the products. Per
                            is
haps in no instance   any one of the gases, which have' been

enumerated, obtained perfectly pure,     the distillation of a
                                                         by
vegetable   substance. The aeriform fluids, which are thus
generated, are found to be possessed of almost every degree
of specific gravity and to yield,
                       ;                           by
                                      combustion, extremely
different results, according to the temperature at which they
have been        formed;    the stage        of    the   process at which              they
have been separated; and other modifying circumstances.                                  It
becomes an interesting question, whether these gases, so
much diversified in their physical and chemical properties, are
mixtures of few binary compounds, with which chemists
                 a
are already acquainted          ;    or whether,      on the contrary, their
elements     are capable    of uniting        in   indefinite proportions, and
                                                                                        of

of composing ternary compounds of oxygen, hydrogen, and
carbon, or varieties of oxy-carlureted          h\drogen.     It would
encroach too much on the time of the Royal Society, to enter
upon this controversy.          And, as neither opinion admits, at
present,   of demonstrative      evidence, 1 may be permitted, in
explaining the following experiments, to assume that theory
which appears tome most probable; viz. that the aeriform
products of the distillation of vegetable substances, are mix-
hires of carbonic acid, carbonic oxide, olefiant, carbureted
hydmgen, and simple hydrogen gases ; or of two or more of
thes^   in various proportions.
   The analysis of        these  compound gases has hitherto been
attempted     solely bv their rapid combustion with oxygen
gas,   in  the   following manner : a mixture of the inflam
mable gas with oxygen gas in known proportions, is ad
mitted into a Volta's endiometer, inflamed over mercury by
the electric spark      ;  and the diminution    ascertained.    To  the
remainder caustic potash or lime.water is added, by which it
sustains a second diminution of bulk ; and the amount of
this denotes     the quantity      of carbonic acid formed by the
combustion.        The quantity of nitrogen gas, in the oxygen
employed,     as  well   as in the residue left by pota..h, being de
termined by     a  lit cudiometrical test, it is easy to infer what
quantity of oxygen        has bten absorbed    by ihe detonation.  And
as  it is pioved that oxygen gas sustains no change of bulk by
conversion into carbonic acid, we mav conclude that after
deducting from the volume of oxygen gas expended, that of
the carbonic acid which has been formed, the remaining
number shows how much oxygen has been employed in the
saturation of hydrogen.           If, tor example, 1CKi measures of
carbureted     hydrogen consume 200 of oxygen gas, and give
 100 of carbonic acid, it follows, that the carbonic'acid hold*
in combination        100 measures    of  the oxygen gag consumed       i
and that the remaining hundred have been applied             to the sa
turation of hydrogen. In this estimate it is assumed, that the
carbon has acquired, by Combustion, the whole of the oxygen
necessary for its acidification, and that no part of it existed pre
viously in the state of carbonic oxide, a proposition, in many
eases, perhaps, very far from being consistent with the truth.

view,     I  at length fixed upon one, which                 I  shall now proceed
to describe.
   The principal parts of the apparatus are two glass cylinders,
or air receivers *,bb and oo (Pl.VI.), of which the larger on<?
is intended to contain oxygen gas, and the smaller one, the
inflammable gas submitted to experiment.                           They are con
nected by a bent glass tube s s, the diameter                     of which should
not be less than           -f—   of   an inch,    to the      upper extremity        of
which      is cemented          an iron burner,       r, the orifice of which
is about      -j1},- of  an    inch, while      to the    lower end     a  socket is
 fixed, on which             may be occasionally screwed the cock r.
The     receiver o o       is contained in a larger glass jar n n, and is
 dosed at the top by              a brass    cap   p,   and    stop cock q.       The
 oxygen        gas     receiver is, also, closed by a brass cap e and
pocky,       the      lower     orifice of which is tapped internally, for
the purpose of receiving a small screw at the end of the
 copper wire g. This wire is in two parts, each of which
 screws into a moveable socket, connecting the two ; and, by
 this contrivance, the wire may be lengthened or shortened
 at pleasure.           To prepare the apparatus for use, the receiver
 o o is  partly filled with the combustible gas ; and is secured
by wedges of cork vv, in the jar nn, the level of the water
 in the latter being regulated by opening the cock x or z.
 The bent pipe ss, with                its cock   r,  is screwed     upon the top
 of the receiver, and partly immersed in the water of a pneu
 matic cistern, a a, so that theorificeof the burner may rise
 a few inches above the surface of the water. The receiver b b
 detached        from the situation in which it is represented                  in the
 drawing, is then exhausted by an air pump ; and,                                being
 filled with oxygen gas, is transferred (its mouth being                       closed
 during the act of removal with a piece of leather ;                           to the
 cistern a, and quickly inverted                     over the burner t.           By   a
    * I am indebted to Mr. H. Creighton, of Soho, not only for            a drawing of
 the apparatus, but for much valuable assistance         in the performance of the ex
 penments.
                                                                                  little

532                      Description    of an Apparatus for           the

little  common air. A transferring vessel is then screwed
upon the cock
cudiometrical
                            f
                    ; and a portion of oxygen gas removed for
                           examination.         To allow       room for            the   ex
pansion of the oxygen gas, the water is raised by a syphon
to a proper height within the receiver I, as appears iu the
drawing.
      The   apparatus           being thus disposed, the        cocky is connect
ed by the chain k, with the prime conductor                           of    an electrical
machine ; and    a rapid succession of sparks is made to pass
between the copper ball at the end of ihe wire g, and the
orifice of the burner. The cocks q and r being now opened,
the stream            of
              gas is kindled ; and in order to prevent the
flame from playing upon the wire, the jar nil is moved a lit
tle nearer to              the cistern a, which          brings the point of the
burner into the axis of the receiver.                    At    the same        lime, by
opening the cock                 x, water falls into    the   jar   72/1,   and finds its
way into the receiver,                through       two small holes w w drilled
near its mouth.
      The combustion continues,                  until either the whole of the
inflammable gas is consumed, or till the cocks // and r are
shut.  The wedges vv are removed; the receiver oo un
screwed      ;    and       the bent tube removed          from its place.  It is
at    this moment that the cock                 r   is useful, by preventing the
escape      of    the gas        from the receiver      I through       the tubes        s s.
The upper       of the receiver is cooled by the application of
                   part
a wet sponge.   Without waiting, however, till the gas has
attained the temperature of the atmosphere, a very small and
sensible thermometer is introduced into it                      ;   and      the    height
of the mercury              is noted, as      soon as    it becomes          stationary.
The volume of               the residuary gas is then observed,               and is re
duced by calculation,                 to the bulk which         it would occupy at
601    of Fahrenheit.                Either   the whole,      or an aliquot part of
it,   is   removed          by  transferring vessel, screwed upon the
                                 a
cocky,       to        mercurial cistern, where the proportion of car
                  is a
bonic acid             determined      liquid potash. The proportions
                                         by
of oxygen         and nitrogen gases,           in   the unabsorbed         residue, are
learned          by
            agitation with sulphuret                    of lime, observing the
precautions which have been stated                       by   De Marti.         The re.,
                                                                                   siduary

            Analysis of the            compound       inflammable Gases.                  283
sidnary oxygen being deducted from the quantity at the out
set of the experiment, shows how much oxygen has been ex
pended in the combustion of the inflammable gas. It is
scarcely necessary to observe, that the gases are carefully re
duced, at each stage of the operation, to a mean temperature
and pressure, (60° of the thermometer, and 30 inches                                    of   the
barometer) *.
      The   nrocess       of combustion,               as      thus stated  in general
terms, appears sufficiently simple. It                         is often, however, ren
dered  complicated by the imperfect combustion of the in
flammable gas, a part of which escapes through the orifice
of the burner, either wholly unaltered, or only partially
burned.  As this portion is not absorbed by sulphuret of
lime, it       gives a fallacious appearance                   ot an actual addition pf
nitrogen to the oxygen g^s remaining in the receiver I.       I
am unacquainted with any method of entirely obviating this
difficulty ; but its amount may be diminished by an attention,
to certain precautions. With this view, the pressure upon
the gas, contained in the receiver o o, should, on first open
ing the cocks q and r, be no more than is sufficient for its
gentle expulsion through the tube ss. When, however, the
stream is once kindled, the larger the flame, and the more
active the combustion, within certain limits, the more com
pletely is the gas consumed.    It is necessary, also, to stop
the combustion, before it is rendered languid by the admix
ture of carbonic acid with the gas in the receiver I, and by
the diminished   purity of the oxygen gas.    If this be not
 attended to, a large proportion of the inflammable gas to
 wards the ckise of the process, makes its escape unaltered into
 the receiver 4. In general I have found, that setting out with
 oxygen gas of equal purity, the more combustible the inflam
 mable gas submitted to experiment, the more complete is its
 decomposition by slow combustion.        The apparatus, there
 fore, is better adapted to the analysis ofolefiant gas, of car
 bureted hydrogen gas, or of mixtures of these two, than of
 carbonic oxide, or any gas of which that oxide forms a large
 proportion.

      The inflammable      gas, whichfound its way into the
                                          has
 receiver b, is always present in too minute a quantity to
 compose, with the residuary oxygen, after the removal of
 the carbonic acid, a mixture capable of being inflamed
 by the electric spark. To ascertain its precise quantity, it
 is necessary to have recourse to another operation.    After
trying, eudiometrically, the quality of an aliquot part of
the gas in the receiver b, let a similar aliquot part be de
prived of its carbonic acid, and then mixed with a portion
of pure hydrogen gas, not exceeding one-third     or one-
fourth the estimated bulk of the oxygen which it contains.
Detonate the mixture, and observe the amount of the di
minution after the explosion ; the products of the com
bustion ; and the quantity of oxygen gas consumed. After
subtracting, from the total expenditure of oxygen, half the
bulk of the added hydrogen gas, the remaining number shows
how much oxygen has been absorbed by the combustible
gas contained in the residue.     By the rule of proportion,
it may be determined, how much carbonic acid would have
been produced, by the oxygenation of the whole of the
combustible gas, and what quantity of oxygen it would have
saturated.
      The most obvious objection        to this method    of analysing
the compound gases is, that the real            proportion of the pro
ducts, resulting from their combustion, may perhaps be
disguised, in consequence of the absorption of a part of the
carbonic acid by the water, over which the experiment is
made.      By frequent trials,      however,    I find that this is      a
source    of error too trivial     to be deserving    of consideration   ;
and that  the proportion of carbonic acid, thus generat
ed, exceeds what is composed by the rapid combustion of
the same   gas over mercury.       When the operator has ac
quired sufficient dexterity, the interval of time, between the
completion of the combustion and the admeasurement          of
the    residue, is   too   small   to   allow an     absorption to any
notable amount.        It must     be observed,      also, that the car
bonic acid constitutes only a small part of the residue ; and
is, for that reason, very little acted on       by
                                             water, conformable

 with an attention to those observances, which are required
 in all delicate experiments on gases, and to the changing cir
 cumstances of temperature and pressure, this
                                                    apparatus is
 fully adequate to the purpose for which it is intended. It will
 be easy, however, for those who have the command                                 of a suf
ficient quantity of mercury, to adapt the apparatus to that fluid.
As an exemplification of the method of using             the sim       it,   in
plest possible case,   shall state the results of the combustion
                                 I

     At    the outset       of the experiment, there was contained   the               in
receiver     0   o,   a   quantity of hydrogen gas, equal, when reduced
to   a    mean temperature and pressure,                to   15-8 cubic            inches.
     Of    these, there remained uuconsumed                   2-5

  But estimating from the first diminution (viz. 49—43                                 :    5)
only 5-5 cubic inches of oxygen would appear to have been
absorbed; and the nitrogen gas,                        by
                                     eudiometrical experi
ments, would seem to have been increased 075 of an inch.
As  the hydrogen gas, however, had been prepared
                                                     from
zinc and sulphuric acid with extreme caution, and did not
contain an appreciable quantity of 'common air, no such
addition of nitrogen could have taken place.  The apparent
increase, then, may be fairly imputed to the escape of                                  j
                                                        0-7

                                                        is
the 13-3 cubic inches at the outset of the experiment     and                      :
hence the real quantity consumed will be 13-3 — 0'75 =

       In  the receiver b, were 43-4 inches          of oxygen      gas.     After
    the combustion,         there remained 38'2 cubic inches           of mixed
    gases,   of which 8'6        were    carbonic acid.     None of       the  in
   flammable       gas,     which passed through the bent tube, had
   escaped being       burned     ; for the quantity of gas in I, not ab-
   sorbable by sulphuret of lime, so far from having been in
   creased,     was    found to have sustained           a   trifling diminu
   tion.    Thte    oxygen gas, which was             consumed, amounted
   to 13'8     cubic    inches.      Reducing these results to centesi
   mal proportion, 100 cubic inches of this gas would give 200
  of carbonic acid, and absorb 325 of oxygen gas. This ex
  periment agrtes with Mr. Dalton's, as to the proportion of
  carbonic acid from the combustion of olefiant gas, but
  assigns    a  larger consumption of oxygen.                It may be ob
  served, however, that the specific gravity of the gas, which
  I employed, exceeded a little the statement of the Dutch
 chemists, who found its specific gravity to be 909, common
 air being     1000.
     Having     satisfied    myself, by repeated experiments,            of the
 accuracy of the         results which may be thus obtained,             I  pro

product, 100 cubic inches, corrected to a mean temperature
and pressure, weighed 24'28 grains.                          Hence its specific
gravity was to that of atmospheric air as "S3 to 1000. The
second product was much lighter, 100 inches weighing
only 10-4 grains, and having, therefore, the specific gravity
of 335.        The results are comprehended in the following
table.     The carbonic acid, stated to have been generated by
the second combustion,               was formed by adding to an aliquot
part    of  the residue, after the           removal of the carbonic acid,
a proportion       of hydrogen          gas  ;   detonating the mixture by

    The     early product       of   the    gas     from cannel coal, before
 being washed with lime-watei oroauvic potash, is a mixture
 of several different gases, viz. carbonic acid, sulphureted
 hydrogen, olefiant, and a fourth, which is either a gas siti
 generis, or a mixture of carbureted hydrogen and carbonic
 oxide.      To ascertain the proportion of these gases in any
 mixture,       is a problem      of    somfe    difficulty.     Sulphureted hy
 drogen and olefiant gases experience, it is well known, an
 immediate condensation, when mingled with oxy-muriatic
 acid gas, and in this way they may be separated from carbonic
 acid.      Again, sulphureted hydrogen                  and    carbonic acid are
 absorbed        by liquid potash, which has no action on olefiant
 gas.      If,   therefore, two equal portions of the gas from coal
 be mixed with oxy-muriatic gas, the one in its recent state,
  the other after being washed               with potash, the condensation
  of   the former will        be    found to        exceed    that    of   the washid
  portion.        By  the combined use            of  these agents,       we may at
                                                                                      tain

  882           Description    of   an Apparatus      for the
  tain an approximation, at least to the proportions in which
 carbonic acid, olefiant, and sulphureted hydrogen gas are
 mingled with the aeriform           product of coal.       The rule may
 be stated as follows      : To  a measured      quantity   of oxy-muria-
 tic acid    gas,   contained    in  a graduated      tube, add twice its
 bulk of   the recent coal gas,      and at the expiration      of one or
 two minutes observe the diminution             which has taken      place.
 Wash     an equal quantity with caustic potash ; note the            loss;
 and submit     the    residue to the action       of oxy-muriatic acid
 as before.    The second diminution, thus effected by oxy-
 niuriatic gas, divided by 2-2, gives the proportion of ole
 fiant gas.    Deduct this absorption from the first, and, di
 viding the remainder by 1-8, we obtain the quantity of sul
 phureted    hydrogen.       Lastly, to know the quantity of car
 bonic acid gas, subtract, from the diminution effected by
 potash, the amount of the sulphureted hydrogen gas. An ex
 ample, taken from actual experiment, will best explain the
 application of this rule.
    One    hundred      measures   of   the first product    of gas   from
cannel coal       lost,   by agitation with liquid potash, Q-7
measures.      The remainder, being mingled with one-fourth
it3   bulk of oxy-muriatic        acid gas, the mixture lost 10'4
measures.      This diminution, 10-4, divided by 2-2, gives
4-9 for the proportion of olefiant gas.            But 100 measures of
the unwashed gas sustained, by admixture with                 oxy-muria
tic acid, a diminution        of   20 measures.        Now,    deducting,
from this diminution, that occasioned by the condensation
of olefiant gas, (viz. 20 — 10-4,) there remain 9-6, which,
divided by 1-8, gives 5-3 for. the proportion of sulphureted
hydrogen gas.        And the diminution by potasli (= 9-7) —
5-3 gives 4-4 for the proportion of carbonic acid gas. Hence

  portion of olefiant gas, which       in them amounts to about
  one-sixth their bulk.
    2. Sulphureted hydrogen gas is, also, most abundantly
 produced at the early stages of the distillation. Its proportion
 then varies from 1 to 5 per cent. ; and towards the close of
 the process it disappears entirely.          It increases the illu-
 minating power of the coal gas ; but is by no means a de
 sirable product ; since it yields by combustion, a gas (the
 sulphurous acid) which is extremely offensive and irritating
 to the lungs.    By the distillation of coal, more sulphureted
 hydrogen is produced, than is discovered among the aeri
 form products ; for a part, uniting with the ammonia which
 is generated at the same moment, forms sulphuret of am
 monia,    a compound    which    I  have    found   among the con
 densed products.
    3.  Carbonic acid gas, like the two preceding ones, appears
 only at an early stage of the process, and in small proportion,
 never amounting to 5 per cent. A portion of this gas, also,
 unites with ammonia, and hence carbonate of ammonia is
 found in the condensed fluid.
    4. The gas from coal undergoes a gradual diminution of
 specific gravity and combustibility, from the commencement
 to the close of the process. This is best shown by inspecting
the results of the experiments on the Black.mine and Merlhyr
coal gas in Table II. because they were reserved in a greater
number of separate portions than usual. The progression
would, perhaps, have been more regular, in these as well as
in  the other instances,  if much of the gas had not been al
lowed to escape,    in consequence of the immense quantity
which was produced. The specific gravity of the coal gas
appears to afford a measure of its fitness for illumination,
sufficiently accurate for practical uses ; but does not bear an
exact correspondence to the chemical properties of the gas, as
ascertained   by combustion.        It may be remarked, also, by
comparing the two last columns        of the second table, that the
carbonic acid produced does not always bear the same pro
portion to the oxygen expended.         Thus the first product of
gas from cannel coal combines with 234 measures of oxygen
gas; and gives 139'7 of carbonic acid. But the gas from coal

tar, with only an equal consumption of oxygen, yields IS0
 measures of carbonic acid.
     5. The aeriform product of coal does not precisely answer
 to the characters of any one of the combustible gases with
which we are acquainted.                The first product, however, of
 the distillation of common pit coal, after being washed with
 potash, approaches very nearly in its properties to carbureted
 hydrogen gas. The gases, which surpass this in specific gra
 vity,     are mixtures    of  carbureted       hydrogen with olefiant gas,
 and perhaps         a  small   proportion of carbonic oxide. The
 lighter gases, in addition to carbureted hydrogen, probably
 contain a variable proportion of hydrogen gas and a emall
 quantity of carbonic oxide.              The extreme levity of some of
 the products, especially »,f         the gas from Merthyr coal, can
 not be explained on any other supposition.
     6. The products of the combustion of a cubic foot                     of coal
  gas,   of medium quality, viz. of the specific gravity 622, (such
 as   the    first products fron Newcastle on Tyne coal,) may be
                  ------
  stated as follows :
                                                                            Grains.

     By combustion, it yields 817.3 grains of carbonic
         acid, the carbon in which may be estimated *
         at                                                                 238.7
      Grains of hydrogen in        a   cubic foot of coal gas,           -    99.8
     But 99.8 grains of hydrogen are equivalent to the satura
 tion of 554'9 grains of oxygen, with which they form 654'7
 grains of water. Hence the oxygen consumed ought from
 calculation to be              817'3 — 233'7 = 573.6 + 554.y=1128
     And the quantity actually consumed appears by
         experiment to be             -                      -         -   ino.3

     The difference, in this example,              between     experiment and
 calculation is not greater, than, in such delicate processes,

 oxygen actually consumed may be ascribed, also, to a small
 portion of the inflammable gas being already in the state of
 carbonic oxide.
     Without repeating the particulars of a similar calculation
 made on gas of inferior quality, I shall annex a comparative
 statement of the specific gravities and composition of the good
 and inferior gases.

    The inferior gas, also, probably contains carbonic oxide ;
 for the quantity of oxygen gas, actually consumed, will be
 found, on calculation, less than it ought to be, if the car
 bon were not already combined with a portion of oxygen.
    The quantity of water, which was generated by com
 bustion, was not determined experimentally, but is merely
 estimated.        It must       be acknowledged that the decomposi
 tion of       the     inflammable        gases cannot lead to unques
 tionable      results, until the proportion of water, produced
by their combustion, be also accurately ascertained.                         With
the view of effecting this, I have already spent much
time, and employed many contrivance?, none of which
have satisfactorily answered              the purpose for which they were
intended.
    7. There       appears to be a considerable difference                 in the
specific gravity and combustibility of gas from various speci
mens of coal, even when taken at similar periods of the di
stillation.       The coal from Merthyr in South Wales, which
burns without flame or smoke, yields a gas which contains,
in an equal volume, scarcely half as much combustible mat
ter as the gas from           Wigan cannel. This will probably be
found to be the case with respect to all coal of similar qua
lity, among which may be reckoned the Kilkenny coal. The
most       important       difference among the varieties          of this mi-
                                        T  3                                 neral.

 294            An Invention for preserving             the Lives
 neral, connected with their application as sources of light,
 consists in the quantity of sulphureted hydrogen gas, which
 is mixed with their aeriform products; and it unfortunately
 happens that the coal, otherwise best adapted to this pur
 pose, yields generally the largest proportion               of this  offensive
 gas.    The only        effectual     method of purifying the coal gas
 from sulphureted hydrogen, on the large scale of manufac
 ture, will probably be found to consist in agitation with
quicklime and water, composing a mixture of the consis
tence    of cream.         Simple      washing with water by no means
effects the complete separation.
    In the experiments which were made on the products of
the distillation of coal, I purposely neglected the amount
and analysis of the condensible fluids, because they cannot
be advantageously          ascertained     by the same operation with
the elastic ones.        They may also be much better determined
on the large scale of manufacture, than by limited experi
ments.       For the same reason I was not solicitous to mea
sure even      the    aeriform fluids       ; and    on this subject, I be
lieve, more accurate information has been communicated by
Mr. Murdoch, than it was in my power to acquire.
XLIII.     Lieutenant        Bell's     Invention for preserving the Lives
                of Mariners in         Cases  of Shipwreck*.
X ublicity        having been recently given to some experiments
 off the eastern       coast of this island, for preserving lives in
 cases  of shipwreck, by          means      of   a rope attached    to a shell
 thrown from a mortar, the Society               of Arts, &c,    has thought
it incumbent       on them to remind the public, that so far back
 as the year 1792, a bounty of fifty guineas was given to Mr.
 John Bell,     then serjeant, afterwards lieutenant of the royal
 regiment     of   artillery, for his invention of throwing a rope
 on shore, by means of a shell from a mortar, on board the
 vessel in distress ; the particulars of which were published
 in the tenth volume of the Society's Transactions, page 204 :
   * From   Transactions  of  the Society Jot  the Encouragement  of Arts, Manu
factures, and Commerce,     for 1807.
                                                                             but

               of Mariners in    Cases  of Shipwreck.              295
 but   a descriptive engraving having been omitted at that time,
it is thought expedient to insert it in the present publication,
with some further particulars then omitted.
    Models    and drawings    of the whole apparatus    are reserved
in   the Society's repository,    for the inspection of the public.
    The several trials made before a committee of the Society
at Woolwich, on the 20lh of August 1791, of throwing a
line on shore on this principle, were as follow :
    From    a boat   moored about 250 yards from shore, the shell
was thrown       150 yards on shore, with the      rope  attached   to
it;   the shell    was  of cast-iron, filled with lead, it weighed
75 pounds,      its' diameter .eight inches; the rope in the trial
\vasa deep sea-line, of which 160 yards weighed 18 Ibs.
the angle of the mortar from whence the shell was fired
was 45 degrees. By means of the line, Mr. Bell and another
man worked themselves         on shore    upon his raft of casks .
there were many kinks in the rope, which were with ease
cleared by Mr. Bell, in which he was much assisted by hi>
snatch blocks.
   The second trial was repeated in a similar manner, and
with equal success, the shell falling within a few yards of
the former place; the gale of win.d was brisk, and the water
rough.      The direction of the shell was nearly from north to
south, and the wind blew nearly north-west.
    In the third trial, the mortar was elevated to 70 degrees ;
the rope attached^) the shell was an inch and half tarred
rope,    of which    every 50 yards weighed fourteen pounds and
a  half;   the shell  of the kind    above mentioned:     it fell 160
yards from the mortar, and buried itself about two thirds in
the ground ; the line or rope run out was about 200 yards,
and it required the force of three men to draw the shell out
of the ground at that distance.
   The grommet, in all       these trials, was  of white  three inch
rope; and in all the above trials, by means of the line, two
men worked themselves on shore upon the raft : each charge
of powder was fifteen ounces.
    A   fourth experiment was made by firing, from the same
mortar, a grapnel in a wooden case ; it did not retain its
hold in the ground         so well as the shell,   but amongst the
                                    T 4                    . crevices

296                     An Invention for preserving            the Lives
crevices         of rocks, or where              the vessel is near shore,       will      be
useful.
    Agrapnel of this kind may be fired from a common can
non with an endless rope, running in a pulley of small block
fixed thereto, by which a raft may be successively drawn to
and from the vessel either by the persons on board the ves
sel, or those on shore.
Observations             made by Lieutenant             Bell, vpon throwing       a   Line
                  o'n    Shore in case         of a Ship   'being stranded.
   1st. From the proposed construction of the piece of ord
nance, intended to throw the shot and line on shore, I sup
pose it will be between five and six hundred weight.
    The chamber                 is to contain one pound        of powder,        and the
bore to admit                 a leaden ball     of sixty pounds or upwards            ;   the
length of range, or distance, will depend                   of    upon the size
the line made use of; I suppose it will carry a deep sea-line
between three and four hundred yards distance.
    2d.   All ships that have iron ballast, may use this piece
as a    part of    and then there would be only the trifling dif
                        it,
ference of casting so much of the ballast into the form of the
piece; the leaden balls may likewise be used as ballast.
   3d.   am of opinion there are various ways, on board of
            I
a   ship, thai the mortar may be placed in                      a   proper position
for firing without                  a   carriage expressly     made for    it;   it       may
be placed upon                 a   coil of rope, or its trunnions      refvted        upon
       or any thing else, whereby the muzzle can be raised
coiii;,',
so high that the groove upon the trunnion appears vertical,
as the       piece in that              position    would be elevated       nearly 45
degrees.
    4th. As      I  imagine all ships carry deep sea-lines, on that
account      I    made use of    in the experiments at Woolwich
                                         it                                                 ;
but   if  should be thought too short for the distance, any
            it
other light line mav be added to the length of it.
   5th. Supposing    ship's owner to purchase such piece of
                                   a                                       a
ordnance    uh the leaden balls, and    block carriage;  doa                      I
not think the whole would amount to more than ten or eleven
pounds expense.
  6th. Where    ship          a         is   driving,   or unmanageable, near the
                                                                           shore,

                 of Mariners in               Cases    of Shipwreck.                297
shore,      it would    L,e    proper to have the piece loaded, the line
reeled upon hand-spikes or poles, and              laid upon the deck
ready    for firing          at any time it might be judged necessary.
The hand.spikes or poles,                         the line is reeled upon,    preserve
it in an horizontal form                ,    and they are not to be drawn out
until the instant of firing : in this manner the line will de
liver itself freely.
   The five water-casks should also be prepared in readiness,
by lashing them together, and a seaman's chest fixed upon
the top      of them, having part of                   its ends or sides cut out       in
order to let out such water as may be thrown into it by the
surf.   I dare undertake to land with such a float upon a lee
shore any       where         upon the coast, when it might be deemed
unsafe for      a boat to make               good its landing.
  7th. There is every reason to conclude that this contri
vance would be very useful at all ports of difficult access
both at home and abroad, where ships are liable to strike
ground before they enter the harbour, as Shields Bar, and
other similar situations, when a line might be thrown over
the ship, which might probably be the means of saving both
lives and property ; and moreover, if a ship was driven on
shore near such          a    place,         the    apparatus might easily be re
moved to afford assistance                    ;    and the whole performance is so
exceedingly simple, that any person once seeing                                it done,
would not want any further instructions.
                                                                          JOHN BELL.
    Woolwich, Aug. 39,         1791.
 Some       further    Observations                made   by Lieutenant     Bell,   upon
    the Application            of      the    Mortars      intended
                                                   throwing a         for
    Line on Shore, in case of a Ship being stranded.
     1st.In trading ships, this                     piece would answer for making
 signals of distress, by filling                    the chamber with powder, and
 well wadding          it,    as the        report would be heard           some    milet
 distance at sea.
    2d. Such   gun, being accompanied with
                  a                           few rounds of           a
 round and grape-shop, would defend    ship much better thana
a  longer gun, against any piratical or other hostile inten
                                                                                    tions,

tions, as, from its shortness, it would be more readily loaded
and fired with a larger charge each time.
    3d. Accidents from a gun bursting, which may arise from
an unskilful person loading with too great a proportion of
powder, is in this piece effectually guarded against, by the
chamber being constructed to contain but one pound of
powder, a quantity which is only about one-third of the
usual charge of a cannon.
    4th. From the small size of such      a gun and carriage, it
might be kept upon deck, without         much inconvenience in
working the ship, in order to be ready if necessity required;
and when the ship is out at sea, it might then be put below.
But from the number of dreadful wrecks, which so fre
quently happen along the coast, it certainly would be pru
dent to have it always upon deck when within sight of land,
and particularly in stormy weather.

       MY DEAR SIB,

and those    of which I          have given an account          in former me
moirs, afford sufficient evidence                that    bark deposits the
                                                         the
alburnous matter.          If        the succulent shoot of a horse ches-
nut, or other tree, be examined, at successive periods in the
spring, it will be seen that the alburnum is deposited, and
its tubes arranged, in ridges beneath the cortical vessels ;
and the number of these ridges, at the base of each leaf, will
be found to correspond accurately with the number of aper
tures through which         the        vessels   pass from      the    leaf-stalks
into   the interior bark, the alburnous matter being apparently
deposited (as I have endeavoured     to prove in former me
moirs) by  a fluid which descends from the leaves, and sub*
sequently secretes through the bark *. I shall therefore ven
ture to conclude that it is thus deposited, and shall proceed
to inquire into the origin and office of the albuftious tubes.
   The position and direction of these tubes have induced al
most all naturalists to consider them                  as the passages   through
which   the sap ascends          ;    and at their first        formation, when
the substance   which surrounds them                    is still soft and succu
lent, they are always filled with the fluid, which has appa
rently secreted from the bark. They appear to be formed in
the soft cellular mass, which becomes the future alburnum,
as receptacles    of this fluid,           to which they may         either aflbrd
a passage upwards, or simply retain it as reservoirs, till ab
sorbed, and carried off, by the surrounding cellular sub*
stance.  The former supposition                  is,
                                    at first view, the most
probable; but the latter  much more consistent with the
                                      is
circumstances that shall proceed Ui state.
                       I
   Many different hypotheses have been offered    naturalists     by
to account for the force with which the sap ascends in the
spring ;of these hypotheses two only appear      any degree      in
adequate to the effects produced.   Saussure, jun., supposes
that the tubes contract as soon as they have received the sap
in the root, and that this contraction, commencing in the
root, proceeds upwards, impelling the sap before      and              it:       I
have suggested that the expansion and contraction of the
compressed cellular, or laminated substance (the tissu eel*

lulaire of Duhamel and Mirbel) which expands and contracts
 with change of temperature* after the tree has ceased to
 live, might produce similar effects by occasioning nearly a
similar motion and compression of the tubes, the coats of
 which are, I believe, universally admitted not to be mem
 branous.     But both these hypotheses are inconsistent with,
 the facts that   I  have  now the pleasure         to communicate to
 you.
    Selecting parts of the stems of young trees, from which
 annual branches had sprung in the preceding year, I ascer
 tained by injecting coloured infusions into the stems, through
the annual shoots, that the tubes which descended from the
latter, were, at their bases, confined to that side of the stem
from which they sprang, and to the external annual layer of
 wood.     Deep incisions were then made              into   the stems   of
other trees immediately beneath the bases of similar annual
 shoots, by which I am quite confident that all communica
tion through the alburnous tubes, with the stem, was wholly
cut off: yet the sap passed into the annual shoots in the
succeeding spring, all of which lived, and some grew with
considerable vigour.       I, at the same time, selected many
 lateral branches, about three lines in diameter, in a nursery
 of  apple trees,   which  I could easily secure to the stems of
 the adjoining trees to prevent their being broken.                 I then
made an    incision,   more  than   two   lines  deep    in  each, on one
side, and at the distance of six or seven lines another inci
sion, equally deep, on the opposite side; and as I am quite
certain, from the texture of these branches, that the albur
nous tubes passed straight through them, I am equally cer
tain that every alburnous tube was at least once intersected.
Yet the sap passed into these branches, and their buds un
folded in the succeeding spring, the incisions having been
made in the winter.       But I have repeated the same experi
ment after the leaves have been full grown in the summer,
and still the branches have continued to live.
    All naturalists   have   agreed    in stating that trees perspire
most in the summer, when their leaves have attained their

 full growth,         and        of    coursethat much sap must ascend at
 this period ; yet          at    this period the tubes of the alburnum ap
 pear dry, and          to contain air only ; which induced Grew                                  to
 suppose    that the sap rose in the state         of vapour ; a supposi
 tion by no means admissible.                 Yet it is, I conceive, evi
 dent that the sap cannot rise, as           a liquid, through dry tubes,
 nor in any state           through intersected   tubes ; and therefore it
 appears probable that it does not rise at all through the tubes
 of   the alburnum,           and that those tubes are intended to                            exe
cute a different office.
   If the sap do not rise through the tubes of the alburnum,
it must rise through the cellular substance ; yet the passage
of any fluid through this has been denied by almost every
naturalist,       probably because                     coloured infusions              have   not
been observed          to penetrate              it,   and because many naturalists
have    considered          it    as      mere     compressed          medulla.          Mirbel,
however, contends that the fluid which                                 generates        the new
hark exudes from            it   ;     and although       fluid, capable of pro
                                                             a
ducing the same effects,                   exudes    from the bark, when de
tached from the alburnum,                    I     am much disposed to coincide
with him in opinion,   having observed   new bark to be ge       a
nerated on the surface of the cellular substance of pollard
oaks, in detached             spaces        *.     And     if    the    sap       in   sufficient
quantity    to generate               a   new bark can pass through                     the cel
lular   substance        of      an oak,
                              appears possible at least that
                                                 it
the whole of the sap may ascend through it.    Coloured in
fusions do not,   think, in any degree, pass through the
                      I
bark of trees, yet       evident that the sap passes readily
                              it      is
through    itand
              ;  therefore, should    be proved that such  it
infusions do not penetrate the cellular substance of the                                      al
burnum, the              which this circumstance would afford
                      evidence
would be very defective.
  Amongst other experiments that made to ascertain whe   I
ther the cellular substance of the alburnum would imbibe
coloured infusions,  took off branches of two years old with
                            I

oyster shells and cheese *, and this was covered with a mix
ture of bees wax and turpentine, so as to effectually exclude
all moisture. A part of the bark was taken off each branch,
in a circle round            it,   a   few lines distant from its lower end,
where the tubes had been closed                    ;   and each branch was then
placed in  decoction of logwood, in
                a                     vessel deep enough      a
to cover the decorticated spaces.   At the end of twenty
hours, or somewhat longer periods, these branches were
examined, and the coloured infusion was found to have in
sinuated itself between                  the alburnous tubes, in many in
stances apparently through the cellular substance.                                This    was
most obvious in the walnut tree, the young wood                                    of which

this experiment, was to detect the passages through which
I conceived the sap to pass from the bark into the alburnum                               f.
   From the preceding circumstances,   am disposed to infer
                                                          I
that the sap secretes through the cellular substance of the
alburnum   and through this
                ;             conceive that  Imust ascend               it
when        the tubes         were      intersected      in   the     preceding experi
ments, and in those seasons                   of the     year when the alburnous
tubes are empty,              though the sap must be rising with great
rapidity       :   and   I   shall endeavour to show that the presence
of the      sap     in   the alburnous tubes, during                   that part of the
year      in   which trees,        when wounded, bleed abundantly, does
not afford          any decisive evidence              of     the     ascent      of   the sap
through those tubes.
     In    the last spring,            when the buds          of      the sycamore first
began to prepare for unfolding,  found that the sap abound
                                                I
ed in the points at the annual branches   and at the same         ;
 time   flowed abundantly from incisions made into the
          it                                                                               al
 burnum near the root.   But when similar incisions were
 made at the distance of eight or ten feet from the ground,
 not the least moisture flowed                 ;   and      the     tubes    of   the albur-
     *
     I have found this composition, and this only, to be capable of instan
 taneously stopping the effusion of sap from the vine, or other tree, in the
 bleeding season.

  num appeared to contain air only.                I also observed that the
  sap  flowed    as  abundantly     from    the  upper   as from the under
  side of the lower incisions, if not more abundantly, and so
  it continued to flow to the end of the bleeding season.
     The sap must therefore have been, by some means, thrown
  into   the   tubes    above    the  incisions,     for the quantity dis
  charged from them exceeded more than a hundred times that
 which the tubes could have contained at the time the inci
  sions were made, even had every tube been filled to the ex
 tremity of the most distant branch.                   And, as it has been
 shown that the sap can pass up when all the alburnous tubes
 are intersected, there appears, I think, sufficient evidence
 that it must in this case have been raised by some other
 agent than those tubes.
     Through the cellular substance I therefore venture to con
 clude that the sap ascends, and it is not, I think, difficult to
 conceive that this substance may give the impulse with which
 the sap is known to ascend in the spring.                    I have shown
 that the bark more readily transmits the descending sap to
 wards the roots than towards the points of the branches*;
 and if the cellular substance of the alburnum expand and
 contract, and be so organized as to permit the sap to escape
more easily upwards from one cell to another, than in any
other direction, it will be readily impelled to the extremities
of the branches : and I have shown that the statement, so
often repeated in the writings of naturalists, of a power in
the alburnum to transmit the sap with equal facility in op
posite directions, and as well through inverted cuttings as
others, is totally erroneous t.
    If the   sap be raised in the manner          I have  suggested, much
of it will probably accumulate in           the alburnum in the spring;
because the powers         of  vegetable life are, at that period, more
active than at any other season          ;   and the leaves are not then
                          ofl, any part  of it by transpiration.      And
prepared to throw
the cellular substance, being           ihen filled, may discharge a
part of its contents into the alburnous tubes, which again
become reservoirs, and are filled to a greater or less height,
           * Philosophical Transactions for  1804, p. 5.     f  Ibid.
                                                                        ill

   in. proportion to the vigour of the tree, and tli* state of the
   soil and season : and if the tubes which are thus filled be
  divided, the sap will flow out of them, and the tree will be
  said to bleed.     But as soon as the leaves are unfolded, and
  begin to execute their office, the sap will be drawn from its
  reservoirs, and the tree will cease to bleed,       if wounded.
      The alburnous tubes appear to answer another purpose in
  trees, and to be analogous, in some degree, in their effects,
  to the    cavities in the bones of animals       ; by which any de
  gree   of strength,   that is necessary,   is given with less expen
  diture    of materials,     or the incumbrance        of unnecessary
 weight ; and the      wood of many different species of trees is
  thus made, at the same          time, very light,   and very strong,
  the rigid vegetable fibres being placed at greater distances
 from each other by the intervention of alburnous tubes, and
 consequently acting with greater mechanical advantage,
 than they would       if placed immediately in contact with each
 other.
      [ have  shown in    a former communication,        that the spe
 cific    gravity of the sap increases during its ascent in the
 spring, and that saccharine matter is generated, which did
 not previously exist in the alburnum, nor in the sap as it
 rose from the root : and I conceive it not to be improbable,
 that the air contained in the alburnous tubes may be instru
mental in the generation of this saccharine matter. For I dis
 covered in the last autumn, that much air is absorbed, or at
least disappears,     during the process of grinding apples for
the purpose      of making cider, and that during this absorp
tion of air, the juice of acid apples becomes very sweet, and
acquires many degrees of .increased specific gravity            ;  and a
similar absorption of air, with corresponding effects,            is well
known to take place in the process of malting.
     I shall conclude with observing, that in retracting the
opinion I formerly entertained respecting the ascent of the
sap     in the alburnous       tubes,  I  do not mean to    retract any
opinion that I have given in former communications respect
ing the subsequent motion of the sap through the central
vessels, the leaves, and bark ; or the subsequent junction of
the descending with the ascending current in the alburnum               :

    Anthony Salisrury, Esq., F.R.S. and L.S., by Tho
    mas Andrew Knight, Esq., F.R.S. and L.S.*
       MY DEAR SIR,
 J. hough     variegated   plants have long occupied the care and
attention of the gardener, it does not appear that the pecu
liarities which distinguish them have much attracted the at
tention of the naturalist; and I am not acquainted with any
experiments which have been made either to discover the
cause of variegation, or the effects produced by it.                 I am
therefore induced to trouble you with an account of few             a
experiments which I have made on one species of variegated
plant,   from which     I obtained an unexpected         and    somewhat
interesting result.
    There is a kind of variegated vine, well known to garden
ers (the Aleppo), which affords variegated leaves and fruit ;
and as the grape,      though small, possesses a very high fla
vour, and much richness, I wished to obtain some offspring
either from its seeds or farina, with the hope of procuring
berries of larger size, and at the same time of ascertaining
whether its variegation would be transferred to the offspring.
    With this object in view I extracted the immature sta
mina    of the blossoms of the white Chasselas,         and white   Fron-
tignac vines ; and at the proper subsequent period T intro
duced the farina of the Aleppo vine : from this experiment               I
obtained, in the succeeding spring, many seedling plants.
These plants, which were raised in a hot-bed, presented no
singularity of character on their first appearance; but early
in the succeeding summer I had the pleasure to observe pur
 ple stripes in the seed-leaves of several of them ; and in the
 autumn the leaves of many were variegated.               I did not hoiv-

ever obtain a single plant which promised to produce, or has
subsequently afforded, either coloured fruit, orcoloured leaves,
free from variegation.
   When, on the contrary, I have introduced the farina of
a black, or purple grape into the blossom of a white one,
none of the plants I obtained have ever been variegated ; and
the colour of the leaves    and  fruit, which  these in the first
year afforded, indicated with certainty the colour of all the
produce of such varieties, in'whatever toil cuttings taken
from them were     subsequently planted.     But in the varie
gated vines the result has been wholly different; and though
the leaves and fruit first produced      by some of them con
tained more tingeing matter than any of the coloured kinds,
they subsequently produced, even on the same tree, some
bunches almost entirely black, others perfectly white, others
lead-coloured with stripes of white, and others white with
minute black stripes; and grapes of all the preceding colours
arc very frequently seen on the same cluster.         The leaves
are also  subject to the same variations, and the colours in
them are in some instances confined to the upper, in others
to the under surface, and sometimes extend quite through ;
and both the leaves and fruit of some of the branches have
become permanently colourless.                                  ,
   It appears therefore obvious, that the tingeing. matter of
variegated grapes, though probably not essentially different
from that of others, is differently combined, and united to
the plant; and as the variegated grape afforded offspring si
milar to itself, and none similar to other vines, which per
manently afford coloured fruit, it may be confidently in
ferred, that the nature   of the  union   between   the tingeing
matter and the plants is very essentially different.
   All the variegated plants that I obtained from the farina
Of the Aleppo vine, are not only perfectly free from disease
and debility  of every kind, but many of them possess a more
than ordinary degree of hardiness and vigour ; and two of
them appear much more capable of affording mature fruit, in
the climate of England, than any now cultivated.            It is
therefore sufficiently evident that the kind of variegation
which I have described is neither the offspring of, nor con-

ference must not be drawn respecting other variegated plants ;
for variegation itself appears to consist of several distinct
kinds.   The leaves of a variety of the common cabbage are
often seen, in the cottage garden, curiously tinged with dif
ferent shades of red and purple, like the leaves of the vine*
which     I             but in the cabbage these colours
              have described         :

                             aYe separated
lours of the cabbage are transferred to its offspring, which is
perfectly hardy and vigorous.
  The spotted lettuce must also be classed                        with variegated
plants,       and the offspring           of this    is as hardy as those of other
varieties     :   but the most common                   kind of variegation,                in
which the leaves are variously striped with white and yellow,
though not the offspring, as some writers have imagined,
of disease,           is,
               however, closely connected with some degree
 of debility possibly owing to the imperfect action of light

XLVI.      Experiments relative to Coals and Cokes obtained

i. NEED hardly remark, that charcoal is composed of pure
carton, or diamond, combined with a certain portion of
oxygen — and is therefore considered as an oxide. Oxides of
carbon are furnished in greater or less portions, and of va
rious degrees of purity, by every substance in the vegetable
kingdom.            Almost every substance in the animal ceconomy
yields     it,   and frequently     state of comparative purity. In
                                     in      a
the mineral kingdom, in pit.coal, plumbago, mineral pitch,
naphtha, &c., we find    bearing   greater proportion to the

other ingredients of the compound than either       the ani                       in
mal or vegetable departments.
  The proportion of oxygen united with carbon to form
charcoals has not hitherto been ascertained but from the                ;
great dose necessary to form carbonic acid,                           it   is   probable that
some oxides contain from 30 to 50 per cent.
     This will        be made       to appear             highly probable, from the
combustion            or distillation of different substances                          in   close
vessels.         No direct experiment                has       been   hitherto      made         to
ascertain the precise quantity of oxygen united to the coaly
residue  obtained in the preparation of coke, charcoal, or
any species of coal but    ;             by

facture, we may form     pretty correct estimate of their real
                                a
value, or their approximation to the state of diamond.
     Fromnumerous experiments which       have made,    ap       I                      it
pears tome highly probable, that the oxide of diamond exists
ready formed in almost every substance    that yields  car                              a
bonaceous residuum.             It       has been conceived                 by   some,      that
the oxide        is formed   consequence of the ignition of the
                               in
substance        from which charcoal   meant to be obtained,
                                                     is                                          by

probable that this takes place to a certain extent, and that
all carbonaceous matter prepared in contact with atmosphe
ric air is inferior in point of purity, or, in other words, is
not so highly de.oxygenated as that prepared in close vessels.
I  do not    find, however, that, by having recourse to close
vessels where there is no contact of atmospheric air, the re
sulting product is materially altered as to colour and general
appearance,      or that the oxide of diamond apparently exists
in  a state  of diminution.      Its carbonating    effects, however,
become wonderfully changed by such a plan of procedure ;
and subsequent experiment, in various stages, develops many
characteristies not unworthy of an approach to the state of
diamond.
    This change of quality may       arise from another source than
simple distillation in close vessels,      and the prevention   of the
contact of external air.
    If  the   heat of the distillation is urged beyond a dull red
colour,    or even continued longer at the usual temperature,
the oxide begins to de-oxidate itself, and the product will be
found materially changed as to its usual affinities. It will be
found more difficult to ignite in common open air. Its com
bustion unless impelled with mechanical violence will move
on sluggishly, and under every circumstance a higher tem
 perature    and   longer contact will be requisite, to effect an
union with its usual relations. The extent of carbonaceous
 principle arising from      a given weight will, however, be in
 creased    in  the   same   proportion   as the  substance  has been
 de-oxidated.       A  greater quantity of carbonic acid gas will
 be obtained from the same weight of oxide, and of course a
 greater quantity     of carbon  set free.
    It is difficult to say to what extent this     de.oxidizinc prin
 ciple might be carried. In heats of 160 and 170° of Wedi*-
 wood, the increased density of the carbon, particularly if in
 the state of powder, and the uncommon depth of lustre
 which the black assumes,        are evidences   that some    material
 change has passed upon the arrangement of its constituent
 parts. There can, however, be no doubt that there exist
 certain fixed limits, unless a third affinity be interposed, be
 yond    which    caibonaceous     matter ceases to de-oxidate it
                                                                 self:

 self : or should its operation continue in temperatures when
we cease to perceive any material change, its progress most
probably would          be so slow    as   to  require ages before the
second portion        of oxygen was set free. This last will be regu.-
lated by the nature        of the affinities betwixt carbon and oxy
gen, and the        progress of their action upon each other during
the exposure.
   If the affinity of de-oxidation is supposed once to be
established, and the carbonaceous matter to be approaching
to the state of diamond, by sacrificing part of itself in com
bination with the oxygen, its tendency to do so will be di
minishing in the ratio of its continuance, unless some new
action, by increase of temperature, affinity or otherwise, be
excited. The ultimate period of de.oxidation will therefore
most likely be retarded by both a want of time and                means.
The difficulty arising from the former, and want                 of tem
 perature    to extract or give both         an  additional affinity that
would     clear the oxide       of its second and third portions of
oxygen, are evidently so great as to leave little hope          of form
ing any thing in this way purer than a highly incombustible
coal.
   The combustion            of wood or of pit-coal     to form coke or
charcoal may be considered as a principal step towards de-
oxidation.        In the natural state of wood and pit-coal, the
carbonaceous matter appears to be highly surcharged with
oxygen, which is in part carried off in burning.
    If the ignition has been performed in open fires             exposed
to external air, a greater portion of the original oxygen will
 remain fixed. On the contrary, when distillation is per
formed so      as  to secure the product from the contact of at
mospheric air, the portion of carbonaceous matter, which in
all cases is unavoidably lost, is here combined with the oxy
gen   of   the oxide, which is left in a state of comparative
purity,   in  place of being carried off in simple combustion by
the external air.
    Every oxide of carbon that has hitherto been examined
 contains a portion of foreign matter in the state of earths or
 salts, and it appears by experiment that even the diamond is
 pot entirely free from such an alloy.

     The coals found -in        the    extensive     coal country around
  Glasgow are divided into five workable measures, No. 1, 2,
  3, 4, 5. These are possessed of various local names, and
  their analyses in different places give different results.             Even
  the same measure always contains two and not unfrequently
  four different qualities, possessed of parts dissimilarly com
  pounded, and yielding different products when used as agents
  in experiments. Under such circumstances, a classification of
  these various qualities      will  serve better than an enumeration
  of every particular measure, to convey an idea how these
  oxides are compounded.
     The Scotch coals in general, in that quarter, may be short
  ly arranged under soft, mixed, and hard coals.
     The soft   may again be       divided     into   free    coal, t. e. coal
  that burns in the fire without welding             or caking; and into
  coal that in burning adheres more or less together, or that
  enters into a bituminous          kind of fusion and forms a firm
  compact cinder.
     Each of these varieties again yields a quantity of ashes,
 which in colour may proceed from pure white to deep brown
 ish red.      This distinction       is   of   the  utmost importance,
 and ought to be the subject of another division.                  So that in

   The 2d, or mixed class of coals, being in general less dis
similar      to each other, afford a less variety of alloy.              The
ashes   of     this  kind  of   coal are   in common     specifically lighter
than those of any other class, and vary from a blueish white
to  a  primrose colour.

   Coke, or oxide of carbon, obtained from bard coal, is ge
nerally combined with a pure white ash, and frequently pos
sessed of considerable density.           The quantity of this alloy
may be estimated       from the following results from 100 parts

   That particular variety of coal, which has been described
as  belonging to the hard coal class, under the name of
stony hard, after combustion leaves a white stone covered
with very fine white ashes of the same colour.                     In many
cases the proportion       that the alloy bears to the carbonaceous
matter is equal, and sometimes greater. — One hundred parts

       3 16         Remarks on Falco cyaneus and pygargus,
       timitd in obscurity, must, to those not in the habit of inves
      tigating nature, appear very extraordinary ; but the scruti
      nizing ornithologist will recollect how few opportunities oc
      cur   of proving, or controverting,              a generally received opi
      nion    by ocular demonstration.                Upon the present subject
     the mind        of   the scientific        world   has been so extremely
     oscillatory for want of proof, that most authors have re
     lated the opinions of others, or reasoned from concurring
     circumstances blended with parole evidence. In fact, it
    must be confessed, that although I had many reasons for
    believing the Hen Harrier, Falco cyaneus, and Ringtail,
    Falco pygargus, to be the same species, yet I could not ad
    duce any well-authenticated proof that this was really the
    fact, when        the     Ornithological       Dictionary   was   published.
   It    is true that   I  was assured by a most worthy and            scientific
   clergyman in Sussex, that the gamekeeper of general Pres-
   cott, in whose neighbourhood he resided, had actually shot
   both these birds from the same nest, and that they had both
   been preserved in one case, and were in the general's                     pos
   session.        That my friend         gave implicit credit to the keeper's
  assertion       I could not have the least doubt ; but as I had
  been assured from             another quarter, that not only the male
  and female Hen Harrier had been shot, which belonged to
  the same nest, but that the young which could just fly were
  also killed,      and were       of   the    same   cinereous-gray colour as
  the parent        birds   ;   Who,      perplexed    with such opposite as
 sertions, could determine               ? But, to close this discordancy,
 I    shall transcribe a passage from the latest publication on
 ornithology exclusively, that has appeared in this country,
 except the Second Supplement to the General Synopsis.                     The
 author's words are these             :
                                         "  It  has been   supposed   that  this
 and the       following      (relating to the two birds in question) are
 male and female ; but the repeated instances of Hen Harriers
 of both sexes having been seen, leave it beyond all doubt,
that they constitute two distinct species."
      Such    a  strong unqualified assertion appearing on public
record, stamped with the authority of the author without
reference       to the     nature    of   the    proof, should seem to pro-
teed from personal knowledge                 :  and as the only positive proof
                                                             /                to

                      and some other British Birds.                                 317
to be obtained in such case is by dissection, it might naturally
be presumed that the author had really determined this long
desideratum by the knife.
    That male Ringtails               have  frequently occurred has been
well and repeatedly             authenticated, but no well attested fact
of a female Hen Harrier                is, I     believe,        to be found.   Those
who have formed their own opinions upon this subject will
not readily adopt that of another, without direct and incon
trovertible proof   and since there are two opposite opinions
                          ;
founded equally upon pointed assertions,        will not be              it          al
lowed      one party that both the F. cyaneus and F. pygargits
          by
having been shot at the same nest,      direct proof of their
                                                           is
                                                           a
being the same species. Nor, on the contrary, will the other
be convinced of the fact              by
                             bare assertion that female Hen
                                            a
Harriers have been observed                     ;    for    it   may be said, that as
birds of  prey plunder                the    nests      of others, one of these
birds might be shot in that act                        of depredation. And the
circumstance of     single instance of
                          a            female bird appear     a
ing in the habit of Hen Harrier, may be disputed as equal
                               a
ly liable to objection, since instances have not been wanting
to prove that female birds have occasionally assumed the
male plumage.       Such difficult'uts could only be removed,
and the fact indisputably established,        finding the nest,     by
and    rearing the young             ;     and   I     am        happy in being now
enabled        to   lay   before     theSociety the result of an experi
ment      of this nature, which           must bring all controversy to
a   conclusion.           To   a   member of this Society, the Rev. Mr.
Vaughan, we are greatly indebted,                          as the
                                         discovery might yet
have       protracted to
        been              series of years, but for his kind
                                      a
communication and essential aid- towards the development of
the subject.
   About the latter end of June,                      in
                                     the year 1805, my friend
informed me that his servant had found the nest of        Hen                   a
Harrier in some furze, which contained three young, and an
addle egg   at this time the infant birds were very small, and
               ;
only covered with white down     was therefore  determined
                                                 :   it
to take them as soon as we deemed them sufficiently large to
be brought up             by   hand: when that period arrived, the servant
was     directed to shoot one, and              possible both of the old
                                                     if
                                                                                    birds

     birds, previously to his bearing away what was considered          a
     prize of uo small value.
        On the return of the man with the young, he brought with
    him also the Hen Harrier, which he assured us he had, under
    concealment in the furze, shot in the act of dropping a thrush
    into the nest, while the female (as he seemed to consider the
    other, and which .he described to be      a  brown    hawk) was co
   vering the young.        He afterwards shot at and wounded the
   female, but could not obtain it.
       Strong as this person's evidence was in our own minds,
   yet it conveyed no more to the public mind than what had
   been    so  repeatedly asserted on similar authority : being,
   however, in possession of the aerie, the means were in our
   power of fully determining the point in question ; and to
   enable me to observe and note the changes that might take
  place in the plumage,          I undertook    the  care  of the whole
  brood.
      At this time   the two largest had thrown out many feathers,

  ing ; the other, by its appearance,        must have been hatched
 much later.       In about a month it was evident from size,
  that there was but one male, so that all my hopes rested upon
 this single life.      As they became full feathered, there was at
 first no distinction     in plumage, but the eyes of the supposed
 male were      always lighter than in the others, whose irides
 were so dark as not to be distinguished at a small distance
 from the pupil.        In the dress of the Ringtail the whole con
 tinued through the winter, when the one which had been
 weakly from the first, died : this circumstance induced me
to force a premature change in some of the quill and tail
feathers of the others, fearing some accident might frustrate
my earnest       desire  of bringing matters to a decisive proof;
and about the middle        of June I was highly gratified by dis
covering an      appearance of the new feathers in the place of
those which had been plucked out, and that clearly evinced
the smallest bird to be a Hen Harrier, and the larger to be a
Ringtail.
     Thus I   had compelled nature to declare her secrets before
the appointed time ; for       in  every other respect their plumage
                                                                  was

was yet similar, excepting about the sides of the face, which
were paler in colour in the former, in which also the irides
were of a dull yellow, somewhat mottled, whereas in the lat
ter they still continued dark.
    The   shyness of these hawks had occasioned their breaking
most    of their larger feathers, although confined in a place ten
feet in length by five      in width  ; and as their regular moulting
 season was advancing,         they were turned into a garden sur
rounded by a wall, where, after some time, the female died
of the cramp in her legs.
     The male had about the 20th of July thrown out many of
the new feathers        naturally, especially the greater coverts of
 the wings, and       a  few gray feathers in different parts of the
body.      On   the 20th    of August, the greater part of the quill
 and tail feathers were grown to their full length, and a gra
 dual increase of gray feathers appeared on most other parts :
 the eyes also became more orange, but it was not till the
 middle     of October that it        had  attained that state which
 made it desirable to retain, as an existing fact of the change;
 it was then killed, and is now in my museum. In this state
  the plumage of the Ringtail or female still remains about the
 neck, the smaller coverts of the wings, the thighs, and
 part of the belly, intermixed with the male plumage : the top
  of the head and wreath have also a mixture of the feathers
  of both    sexes  :   the quills, scapulars, and tail, are complete
  ly masculine ; in the last of these there are a few small broken
  bars of cinereous brown on a white ground, in the three
   outer feathers, the exterior margins cinereous-gray ; the six
  middle feathers are almost wholly gray, and the markings are
  very obscure beneath.
      Having by the most powerful           evidence  traced  this bird
   from the egg to that state approaching maturity, which so
   clearly and satisfactorily proves that Falco cyaneus and py-
   gargvs are actually of the same species, two queries arise out
   of the observations       of different authors.    It  has been   re
   marked by Doctor Latham, that no author has mentioned
   the Hen Harrier as a bird of the American continent.              Do
   the females only migrate to those particular parts where they
   have beeh observed, after the breeding season ; or is not the
                                                                  trans

   transatlantic      Ringtail   a   distinct  species,  not differing   in-

  sexual distinction of the ash- coloured Falcon of the               Orn.
  Diet, which has been considered to be most probably the
  Northern Falcon, or Falco hyematis ; for although the male
  of this species has only occurred to me, yet, nothing having
  been related by any author to induce a belief            that the sexes
  are essentially different in plumage,          may we not reasonably
  conjecture that       the  female     F. hyemalis   has been mistaken
  for  a. F.  cyaneus,    and   possibly occasioned some of the ac
  counts related,      concerning the similitude in the plumage of
  both sexes     of the latter    ?   Indeed   the  F. hyemalis   has  ge
  nerally been described       to    be considerably larger    than those
  males     which    have   come under my inspection, — a circum
 stance serving to strengthen the opinion that the sexes are
 similar in plumage, (the females of this tribe being always
 the largest,) and may have been confounded with the cya
 neus,     as was the case     of   the two specimens which were sent
 to me.
     From     the account here given      of the Hen Harrier, it is quite
 clear that      the change of plumage is effected in the autumn
 after it leaves the nest ; and as it is between three and four
 months in the act        of moulting, it is certainly very extraor
 dinary that so few instances have occurred of its being killed
 in that state which might have been decisive. That such
has been taken is evident by the description of Falco Hudso-
nius of authors, which is doubtless this bird in change                 of
plumage ; and it will be observed, that mention is made                 in
the Ornithological Dictionary of some slight indication of such
a change       ; one had only a few gray feathers,        beginning the
change, and another had several brown feathers in the smaller
coverts of the wings, which now appear to be the last that
are changed.
     I have now only to remark that the nest            of this bird was
composed of sticks rudely put together, was nearly flat, and
placed on some fallen branches of furze that supported it just
above the ground.           The addle egg found in the nest is little
inferior     to that  of the Moor-Buzzard, and similar in shape
and colour, being spotless, but of a sullied white.

     In    the original description          of this  species  *, taken from a
cased specimen,              the greater coverts are,      by mistake, said to
have dusky-black              on the outer webs         towards their middle,
 forming         a  small     bar;    whereas   it will be now observed,        this
visible bar on the wing above is on the secondary quills, and
not on the coverts.
     The bird from which                  the above description is taken is a
 male     : it has the feathers behind the ears short,                 but no ruff
 continued round the head, as in the Hen Harrier.                       It was in
 good condition, and had in its stomach a sky-lark, and yet
 its weight was not so much as that of the Hen Harrier by
 three or four ounces ; though its length and breadth are much
 superior, by reason of its long wings and tail.                     It must also
 be remarked           that it appears to be at least a year old bird, as
 some of the qurlls are moulting ; the first and second feather
 of the secondary quills in each wing are not full grown, but
 are of the same colour as the rest, and possess the same three
 bars.
     I  am not enabled           to offer any thing further on the synony-
 rna than what has been given in another place ; it differs a
 little, it      is true,     from the Falco hyemalis         f  ; but when it is
 considered how little that species seems to be known, some
  allowance must be made for want of a more minute descrip
  tion   :  there seem, however, some marks                of such near affinity,
  that    I    trust  it  will    hereafter   be   found  the same.      Whether
  this is migratory with us is not at present to be fully deter
  mined ; the time of the year in which this was shot is rather
  too early to induce a belief that it is a winter migrant ; and

»                    Dartford Warbler. Lath. Syn.
     In  a paper     which   I had the honour to lay some time since
  before     the Linnean Society, some notice was taken of the
  discovery of this little bird in the southern parts of Devon
  shire: and I there remarked that, as it had been so frequently
  observed to be a winter         inhabitant,      a  circumstance not fa
 vourable to its being a migrative species, (as it was said to
 breed in Provence, on the continent so much further south,*)
 I  was not without hopes          of ultimately proving it indigenous
 to this part     of England.
     My opinion that this species of Warbler bred with us, wa9
 greatly strengthened by a letter which I had the pleasure of
 receiving from a scientific friend in Cornwall, well known in
 the literary world f» who assured me that his brother had
 observed       these birds for several      years to inhabit furze,       near
 Truro    ;   that last year, as well as the present, they were plen
 tiful during the summer season             ;   and   that he had not     o:ily
 seen them every month in the year, but had observed young
 ones soon after they had left the nest, though his search for
 the nest and eggs had been in vain.
    This information redoubled, if possible, my ardour, and                     I
 visited a large furze common in my neighbourhood, where I
had seen several the preceding autumn ; and upon close
 search on the sixteenth        of July,      three pair  of old birds    were
observed,       two of which had young evidently by their extreme
clamour,        and by frequently appearing with food in their
bills.      The boldness     and    excessive     garrulity of one pair     in-

and 7 east longitude; and therefore, as these birds have been also found in
England in latitude 5 1, and west longitude 5, there can be no doubt but all the
intermediate space, taking in nearly the whole of France, is inhabited by them
more or less, whenever the situation is congenial to their habits.

324         Remarks on Falco cyaneus andpygargus,
duced    me to believe that the nest was near       at hand ; but  it
was not without two hours strict attention to the actions         of
the parent birds,    that I discovered   a single young one on the
ground ; this appeared to be too small to voluntarily leave
the nest, which was probably within a few Feet, but which,
from the almost impenetrable thickness of the surrounding
furze, I was not successful in discovering.
    Oh the 1 7th my researches were renewed, and after three
hours watching the motions of another pair, I discovered the
nest with three young; it was placed amongst the dead
branches of the thickest furze, about two feet from the
ground, slightly fastened between      the.  upright or main stems,
not in a fork.
    On the  same day> close to where     I  found the single young
bird, two    were observed to be busied, carrying materials for
building ; and by concealing myself in the bushes, I soon
discovered the place of nidification, by the continued returns
of  the birds  with something in their bills, for making their
nest ; and, upon examination, I found it was just begun.
Extraordinary as it may appear, there is great reason to be
lieve that this was the same pair from which I had the day
before taken the single young one.          Is it not possible that
the inclination of the parent birds to propagate again, was
the cause   of the young leaving the nest prematurely, in de
fect of a sufficient supply of food, and that the other young
perished ? A circumstance so singular can no more be de
nied than positively asserted ; but as I could never observe
more than one pair near the place, there is reason to believe,
though extraordinary, that it was really the case, and that
they actually began a new nest the day after they were de
prived of the only surviving young.
    The nest appeared to be finished on the 19th, but it pos
sessed only one egg ori the 2 1 st in the afternoon, and on
 the 26th it contained four,       when the nest and eggs were
 secured.
    This  nest   was  placed near the top of the furze, in the
thickest part, about four feet from the ground, but so well
 concealed that, although the birds were repeatedly seen to
 fly in with building materials in their bills, it was with the

greatest  difficulty found.  The continued flirting of these
birds from bush to bush, and through them, is so extremely
deceitful, that it is scarcely possible to notice the spot,
amongst such an uniformity of cover, where they deliver the
contents of their bill, especially as they frequently retire
from a very different part.
   Like the other, this nest is composed of dry vegetable
stalks, particularly goose grass ; mixed with the lender dead
branches of furze, not sufficiently hardened to become prick
ly; these are put together in a very loose manner, and in
termixed very sparingly with wool.                           /In one of the nests was
a single partridge's feather. The lining is as sparing, for it
consists only of a few dry stalks of a fine species of carex,
without a single leaf of the plant, and only two or three of
the panicles.                       «.
   This thin flimsy structure which the eye pervades in all
parts, much resembles that of the whitethroat. The eggs are
also somewhat similar to those of Sylvia cinerea, but rather
less,      weighing only 22 grains; like the eggs                    of that species,
they possess a slight tinge of green ; they are fully speckled
all over with olivaceous-brown and cinereous, on a greenish-
white ground, the markings becoming more dense, forming
a zone at the larger end.
   Whether the Dartford Warbler usually breeds so late, is
not at present to be determined ; but as I found two pairs
with young               at the same time, and              have great reason to be
lieve another pair was sitting about the same period, it is
reasonable to conclude that they do not propagate very
early,- — or how are we to account for the loss of the first
nests      of   all these,       for there were no young birds to be found
flying amongst the furze                  ?
     I    shall now return to the young birds, which I considered
as       no small treasure : the first, which was found on the
ground, had been three days in my possession before the
others were fit to take *, and then being able to little,                  fly   a

so much did he like           the     warmth,         that     he    rested      perfectly
contented, and though he would for several day3 after       up                        fly
to the top of the box to he fed, yet he retired as soon as sa
tisfied with food, and cuddled amongst ,his companions.
   By experience, grasshoppers, which at this season of the
year are to be procured        abundance, are found to be an
                                      in
excellent food for all insectivorous birds  these, therefore,  :
at first were their constant food,                 and after five or six days                a
mixture of bread,           milk, chopped             boiled       meat,     and     a   little
finely pounded hemp- and rape- seed, made into thick paste,             a
was sometimes given, to wean them from insect food                                          by
degrees   this they became more partial to than even grass
          ;
hoppers, but they afterwards preferred bread and milk with
pounded hemp-seed only, to every other food, the smaller
house or window flies excepted.
  Before these birds left the nest                 I   pair of
                                                           put them into         a
scales,   and    found the four weighed nine drams, which on
an average      is two drams and   quarter each.
                                             a   At this time
they collectively ate in one day upwards of five drams of
grasshoppers, which     one dram and
                              is     quarter each, so that a
in two  days each consumed more than its own weight. Such
a repletion     almost incredible, and doubtless greatly be
                is
yond what the parent birds could usually supply them with,
which     observation appeared to consist of variety, and not
          by
nnfrequently small phaleiue their growth, however, was in
                                        :
propqrtion to this large supply of food.
  This interesting little family began to throw out some of
their mature feathers on each side of the breast about the
middle of August, arid the sexes became apparent. At this
time they had forsaken their grasshopper food, feeding by
choice on the soft victuals before mentioned.
    The nestling         attachment     is   very conspicuous              in   these little
birds towards the dusk of the evening, for    long time after       a

they all assemble,    repeating the same plaintive cry. In this
interesting scene, as warmth is the object of all, a consider
able bustle is observed, in order to obtain an inward birth,
those on the outside perching upon the others, and forcing
in between them: during this confusion, whi'h sometimes
continues for a few minutes, the cuddling note is continually
emitted, and in an instant all is quiet.
    Nothing  can exceed the activity       of  these little creatures    ;
they are in perpetual    motion the whole day, throwing them
selves into various attitudes     and gesticulations,      erecting the
crest and tail at intervals, accompanied by a double or triple
cry, which sccins to express the words cha, cha, cha. They
frequently take their food suspended by the wires, with their
head downwards, and not unusually turn over backwards on
the perch.    The males, of which         there were three out     of the
four, began to sing with the appearance of their first mature
feathers, and continued in song all the month of October,
frequently with scarce any intermission for several hours to
gether:   the notes are entirely      native, consisting of consi
derable variety, delivered    in  a hurried manner, but in a much
lower tone than    I have heard the old birds       in their natural
haunts.    This song   is different from any thing        of the kind   I
ever heard, but in part resembles most that        of  the stone-chat.
    The Dartford Warbler, like        the   whitethroat,    will   some
times suspend itself on wing over the furze, singing the
whole time : but is more frequently observed on an upper
most spray, in vocal strain for half an hour together.
    Buflon, who  appears to have been the first and perhaps the
only person on the continent who knew any thing of the
Dartford Warbler as a naturalist, seems to have known very
little more than the bird itself, and that it had been found
in Provence, (as his name evinces,) but nothing of its habits.
If he had not figured it in Pi. enl. 65o.              f.  1, it would
scarcely  be conceived   that   the  history   given   by  that   author
could be intended for this species. We must therefore con
clude that he, like other great men, was deceived in that
part of its natural history related by M. Guys of Marseilles,
from whom he seems to have collected, that this bird not
only feeds amongst cabbages          on the smaller lepidppteraus
                                    X  4                         insects.

328         Remarks on Falco cyaneus andpygargus.
insects, but that it roosts amongst their leaves, to secure
itself against the bat, its enemy.
    To this curious account, implicit faith cannot be given ;
for as on the continent furze is by no means uncommon,
except in the more northern part,         there can be no reason to
believe the nature of this little creature to be so different in
Provence from what it is in England, where it is only found
to inhabit the more extended tracts covered with that shrub.
]f indeed     it were necessary   to hide itself at  night from the
 hat, furze is better calculated for that purpose than cabbages ;
 but   I believe   there   is no  species  of that  genus in Europe
 sufficiently large to attack even our most diminutive bird,
 the golden-crested wren, which we may safely conclude has
 no occasion to hide itself from any European species of Ves-
 pertilio.
     Science, unfortunately, is too frequently blended with
 fiction, occasioned by too large a share of credulity ; the
 detection of such errors is a work of time, and a series of
 years are often       required to correct what, according to the
 general   merit   of  an author, has more or less been stamped
 with credit.
     Experience from ocular demonstration has at last been able
 to collect materials concerning the natural history of Sylvia
 Provincialis, which serves to evince that M. de Buffon was
 misled,     and that, in fact, little was known     of the habits  of
 this elegant little warbler till the present discoveries.

that a similar bird had been shot at Weymouth, in com
pany with several others ; and the skin of another was sent
tome, which had been killed at Sandwich in Kent , pro
bably belonging to the same flock, as the account of the
number seen last on the east coast tallied nearly with what
first was noticed in the west, allowing for those     which    are
stated to have been shot.

  of the absorption of mucus from its cells, as in anasarca,

 especially in feeble children ; at the same time less bile is
 secreted from the torpid circulation in the vena porta. And
 as the absorbents, which resume            the thinner parts of the
 bile from the gall-bladder and hepatic ducts, are also torpid
 or quiescent, the bile is more dilute, as well as in less quan
 tity.   From the obstruction of the passage of the blood
 through the compressed vena porta these patients have tumid
 bellies, and pale bloated countenances ; their paleness is
 probably owing to the deficiency of the quantity of red glo
bules in the blood in consequence of the inert state of the
bile.
    These symptoms in children are generally attended with
worms, the dilute bile and the weak digestion not destroying
them.      In sleep I have seen fleuke-worms in the gall-duct*
themselves among the dilute bile ; which gall-ducts they eat
through,     and   then produce ulcers, and          the hectic   fever,
called   the rot.
    M. M. Altera calomel purge, crude iron-filings are spe
cific in this disease in children, and the worms are destroyed
by the returning acrimony and quantity of the bile. A blister
on the region of the liver.          Sorbentia,   as worm-seed,     san-

    Chlorosis. — When the defect of the due action of both the
absorbent    and secerning vessels      of the liver affects women,
and is attended with obstruction         of the catamenia, it is call
ed chlorosis    ; and is cured by the exhibition of steel, .which
restores by its    specific stimulus the absorbent power of the
liver ; and    the menstruation,      which was obstructed      in con
sequence    of debility, recurs.
    Indigestion,    owing    to torpor   of the stomach, and a con
sequent too great acidity      of its contents, attends this disease ;
whence a desire of eating chalk, or marl. Sometimes a great
quantity of pale urine is discharged in a morning, which is
owing to the inaction of the absorbents, which are distri
buted on the neck      of  the bladder, during sleep.      The swell
ing of    the   ankles, which      frequently    attends chlorosis,   is
another effect      of deficient action of the absorbent      system    3
and    the pale    countenance is occasioned by the deficient
quantity of red globules of bloody            caused by the   deficient
                                                              quantity

quantity or acrimony of the bile, and consequent weakness
of the circulation.  The pulse is so quick in some cases of
chlorosis, that, when attended with an accidental cough, it
may be mistaken for pulmonary consumption.        This quick
pulse is owing to the debility of the heart from the want of
stimulus occasioned by the deficiency of the quantity, and
acrimony of the blood.
  M. M. Steel. Bitters. Constant                       moderate       exercise.     Fric
tion       with    flannel all over the body and limbs night and
morning.            Rhubarb five grains, opium half a grain, every
night. Flesh diet, with small beer, or wine and water. The
disease continues some                  months,      but at length subsides by
the treatment above described.                      A bath of about eighty de
grees,      as    Buxton Bath, is of service              ;   a   colder bath may do
great injury.
   Cardialgia. — Hearthurn originates from the inactivity of
the stomach, whence the aliment, instead of being subdued
by digestion, and converted into chyle, runs into fermenta
tion, producing acetous acid. Sometimes the gastric juice
itself becomes so acid                     give pain to the upper orifice of
                                       as to
the stomach             ;    these acid contents of the stomach, on falling
on     a   marble hearth, have been seen to produce an efferves
cence on       The pain of heat at the upper end of the gul
                  it.

                                  is
tents of the stomach,     to be ascribed to the sympathy be
                                       is
 tween these two extremities of the oesophagus rather than,
 to the pungency of the carbonic gas, or fixed air  as the                      ;
 sensation in swallowing that kind of air in water    of dif               is       a
 ferent kind.
    M. M. This disease arising from indigestion     often very            is
 pertinacious, and  afflicting and attended  with
                                               ;   emaciation
 of the body from want of sufficient chyle. As the saliva
 swallowed along with our fond prevents its fermentation, as
 appears     the experiments of Fringle and Macbride, some
                  by
 find considerable relief                by
                           chewing parched wheat, or mastic,
 pr    a    lock of wool,           frequently in     a   day, when the pain oc
 curs,      and         by   swallowing        the saliva thus effused
                                                                    tempo ;    a
 rary relief           is   often obtained from antiacids, as aerated alka
 line water, Seltzer's water, calcareous earths, alkaline                               salts
                                                                                     made

made into    pills  with soap, soap       alone, tin, milk, bitters.
More    permanent use may be had from such drugs as check
fermentation,    as acid of vitriol ; but still more permanent
relief from such things as invigorate the digestion, as a blis
ter on the back ; a due quantity of vinous spirit and water
taken regularly. Steel. Temperance. A sleep after dinner.
A   waistcoat made so tight as slightly to compress the bowels
and stomach. A flannel shirt in winter, not in summer. A
less quantity  of potation of all kinds.         Ten black pepper
corns swallowed after dinner.         Half a   grain of opium twice
a day, or a grain.     The food should consist of such things
as  do   not easily ferment,     as   flesh, shell.fish,   sea.biscuit,
toasted cheese.     I have seen toasted cheese brought up         from
the stomach 24 hours after it had been swallowed,              without
apparently having undergone any chemical change.
   Strabismus. — Squinting is generally owing to one eye
being less perfect than the other ; on which account the pa
tient endeavours    to hide the worst eye in the        shadow of the
nose, that his vision by the other may not be confused.
Calves, which have an hydatide with insects inclosed in it
in the frontal sinus on one side, turn towards the affected
side ; because the vision on that side, by the pressure         of the
hydatide, becomes less perfect      ; and the disease being recent,
the animal    turns round, expecting to get          a  more distinct
view  of objects.
   In the hydrocephalus internus, where both eyes are not
become insensible, the patient squints with only one eye,
and views objects with the other, as in common strabismus.
In this case it may be known on which side the disease ex
ists, and that it does not exist on both sides           of the brain  ;
in such circumstances,       as  the    patients  I believe never   re
cover  as they are now treated, might it not be adviseable to
perforate the cranium over the ventricle of the affected side 2
which might at least give room         and stimulus to the affected
part of the brain r
   M. M. If    the squinting    has    not been confirmed by long
habit, and one eye be not much worse than the other, a
piece of gauze stretched on a circle of whale-bone, to cover
the best eye in such     a manner     as  to reduce the distinctness
                                                                     of

               Memoirs    of Erasmus Darwin, M.D.                  333
of vision of this     eye to a similar degree   of imperfection with
the other, should be worn some            hours every day. Or the
better eye should be totally darkened by a tin cup covered
with black silk for some hours daily, by which means the
better eye will be gradually weakened by the want of use,
and the worse eye will be gradually strengthened by using it.
Covering an inflamed eye in children for weeks together, is
very ljable to produce squinting, for the same reason.
     Asthma humorale. — The humoral asthma probably               con
sists in a temporary anasarca         of  the  lungs,  which   may be
owing     to a temporary defect      of lymphatic     absorption.    Its
cause is nevertheless        at present very obscure, since a tem
 porary deficiency      of venous  absorption, at the extremities of
 the pulmonary or bronchial veins, might occasion a similar
 difficulty of respiration.      Or it might be supposed, that the
 lymph effused into the cavity of the chest might, by some
 additional heat during sleep, acquire an aerial form, and
 thus compress the lungs; and on this circumstance the re-,
 lief, which these patients receive          from cold air, would be
 readily accounted for.
     The paroxysms attack       the patient in his first sleep,   when
 the circulation through the lungs in weak people wants the
  assistance of the voluntary power.          And hence the absorb
  ents of the lungs are less able to fulfil the whole of their
  duty.     And part of the thin mucus, which is secreted into
  the air-cells, remains there unabsorbed, and occasions the
  difficult respiration, which awakes the patient.            And the
  violent exertions     of the muscles of respiration, which suc
  ceed,   are excited by the pain     of suffocation, for the purpose
  of pushing forwards the blood through the            compressed    ca
  pillaries, and to promote the absorption of the effused lymph.
      In this the humoral differs irom the convulsive asthma,
  as   in that  there   is probably no accumulated fluid to be ab
  sorbed ; and      the violent respiration is only an exertion for
  the purpose of relieving pain, either in the lungs or in some
  distant part, as in other convulsions, or epilepsy ; and in
   this respect the fits of humoral and convulsive asthma essen
   tially differ from each other, contrary to the opinion ex
   pressed without sufficient consideration.

 vulsive asthma find relief from cold air,             as   they generally
 rise out   of bed,    and   open     the   window,  and     put out their
 heads ; for the lungs are not sensible to cold, and the sense
 of suffocation     is somewhat relieved by there being more ox
 ygen contained in a given quantity of cold fresh air, than               in
 the warm confined air of a close bed-chamber.
    I have seen humoral asthma terminate              in confirmed     ana
 sarca,   and destroy the patient, who had been               an excessive
 drinker of spirituous potation. And M. Savage asserts, that
 this disease frequently terminates in diabetes; which seems-
 to show, that it is a temporary dropsy relieved by a great
 flow of urine.       Add    to this,     that these paroxysms       of the
 asthma are themselves         relieved by profuse sweats of the up
 per parts    of the body,     which would countenance the idea of
 their being occasioned           by congestions       of lymph in the
lungs.
    The congestion of lymph in              the lungs from the defective
 absorption of it is probably the remote cause of humoral
asthma ; but the pain of suffocation is the immediate cause
 of the violent exertions in the paroxysms. And whether
 this congestion of lymph in the air-cells of the lungs in
 creases during our sleep, as above suggested, or not; the
pain of suffocation will be more and more distressing after
some hours of sleep, as the sensibility to internal stimuli
increases     during that time. For the same reason many epi
leptic fits, and paroxysms of the gout, occur during sleep.
    In two gouty cases, complicated with jaundice, and pain,
and sickness, the patients had each             of them    a  shivering fit,
like   the   commencement          of   an ague,   to the great alarm     of
their friends ; both which commenced in the night, I sup
pose during their sleep ; and the consequence was a cessa
tion of   the jaundice,      and pain about the stomach, and sick
ness ; and instead       of that    the gout appeared     in their   extre
mities.      In   these   cases  I   conjecture,   that there was a me
tastasis not only      of  the diseased action from the membranes
of thejiver     to those   of  the foot ; but that some        of the  new
vessels,    or new fluids, which           were  previously produced in
the inflamed liver, were translated to the feet during the cold
                                                                        fit,

 fit, by   the increased     absorption of the hepatic lymphaties,
 and by the retrograde       motions of those of the affected limbs.
     This I think    resembles   in some respects a fit of humoral
 asthma,     where stronger motions      of the absorbent vessels of
 the lungs are excited, and retrograde ones of the corre
 spondent cutaneous lymphaties ; whence the violent sweats
 of   the upper parts of the body only are produced ; and for a
 time the patient becomes relieved by the metastasis and eli
 mination of the offending material by sensitive exertion.
      M. M. To      relieve the paroxysm a tea-spoonful      of ether

      In this  species   of asthma, there is great reason to believe,
  that the respiration of an atmosphere, with an increased
  proportion of oxygen, will prove of great advantage ; some
  well-observed and well-attested cases of which arc published
  by Dr. Beddoes ; as this purer air invigorates the circulation,
  and the whole system in consequence, perhaps not only by
  its stimulus, but by its supplying the material from which
  the sensorial power is extracted or fabricated. In spasmodic
  asthma, on the contrary, Dr. Ferriar has found undoubted
  benefit from an atmosphere mixed with hydrogen.
       Parturitio. — Parturition is not a disease, it is a natural
   process, but is more frequently unfortunate in high life than
   amongst the middle class of females ; which may be owing
   partly to fear, with which the priests of Lucina arc liable to
   inspire the ladies of fashion to induce them to lie-in in
   town ; and partly to the bad air of London, to which they
   purposely resort.
       There are, however, other causes,       which render parturi
   tion more dangerous to the ladies of      high life; such as their
   greater general debility from neglect of energetic exercise,
   their inexperience of the variations of cold and heat, and
    their seclusion from fresh air. To which must be added,
    that great source of the destruction of female grace and
    beauty,   as  well as of female     health, the tight stays, and
                                                                 other

 other bandages, with which they are generally tortured in
 their early years by the active folly of their friends, which,
 by displacing many of the viscera, impedes their actions,
 and by compressing them together produces adhesions of
 one part to another, and affects even ihe form and aperture
 of the     bones   of the pelvis, through which           the nascent child
 must be protruded.
       As parturition          not a morbid process, no me
                         is a natural,
 dicine should be given, where there is no appearance of dis
 ease.  The absurd custom of giving a powerful opiate with
 out indication to all women, as soon as they are delivered,
 is,    I
      make no doubt, frequently attended with injurious,
 and sometimes with fatal consequences.
       Another thing     very injurious       to the   child,   is the tying and
cutting the navel-string too soon ; which should always be
left till the child has not only repeatedly breathed, but till
all pulsation in the cord ceases.   As otherwise the child is
much weaker than it ought to   be ; a part of the blood being
left in the placenta, which ought to have been in the child ;
and at the same time the placenta does not so naturally col
lapse, and withdraw itself from the sides of the uterus, and
is not therefore removed with so much safety and certainty.

                             By M. Proust*.
JL he Prussian blue        used in commerce is rarely pure. Scheele
has already noticed this fact.              We often find in        it,   besides
alumine,      which forms part of           it,   silex, carbonate, and cal
careous sulphate, sulphate of potash, phosphate of iron, the
red oxide of this metal, sulphur, oleaginous ammonia, &c.

to resist the washing to a certain degree.    I do not think

we moisten        it it   with an acid.               In   the process usually followed,
it  frequently happens that the ochrey residue     preserves
either some residue of blue which has not been attacked by
the alkali, or  mixture of prussiate of potash, and of ferru
                      a
ginous alkaline carbonate, or even these three substances
confounded together.      shall now examine two of these

     If, for instance,          we try an acid upon                      a    residue well washed,
and which still retains some blue, this last will not be dis
covered in pulverulent particles, except in proportion as the

of   a,   maximum and minimum;            and   if   the mixture     of yellow
and blue sometimes presented              to us by these residues          is not
green, as might be       expected, it       is because the yellow oxide
always covers these remains of blue in a very great excess ;
at least I never found the latter to exceed one or two hun
dredth parts.
   I now proceed        to the second case.               A    residue,   if   well
pulverized, may contain no vestiges of blue, but it easily
retains the two salts mentioned above.    If we apply an acid
to it in this state, both give blue in abundance.   We shall
by and by examine the particular mixture of these two salts ;
but if it has been carefully washed, the acids can no longer
produce any salts from it. Indeed, nothing is more tedious
than this washing, for I was obliged to renew the boiling
water at least 20 times successively upon a single drachm of
residue before I obtained it completely pure : but when we
at last succeed, the acids dissolve it without giving blue.
     When     these residues       effervesce   with      the acids, it is be
cause they contain        carbonates       of potash or of lime.                By
washing, the first is carried off; by the application of vinegar
after washing, we discover the second. Thus it is not the
red oxide which occasions this effervescence : it is not sus
ceptible of being combined with the carbonic acid ; it cannot
therefore take it from potash in exchange for the prussic
acid which it receives from it. In nature, as well as in art,
the oxide     of iron   at the minimum solely may be united                    with
carbonic acid.
  One pound of blue of commerce of a fine quality gave
nearly nine ounces and a half of crystallized prussiate of pot
ash.   It is by no means rare to find in the mother waters,
when left to themselves, truncated octahedrons one inch in
diameter.   When this blue carries sulphuric acid with                           it,
there must be at least four crystallizations, order to purge   in
the prussiate of the whole sulphate of potash. These mother
waters contain alumine sometimes in abundance, sulphate
and phosphate   of potash, ferruginous alkaline carbonate. By
this we may judge why, in analyses,           of importance to
                                                     it   is
use crystallized prussiate, and not simple lixiviums of Prus
sian blue, as formerly made. The prussiate of potash                             is

unalterable in dry or humid air : the longest continued ebul
lition does not alter its nature in the least : the taste is
sweetish, slightly saline, and leaving a sensation of bitter-
uess behind  : alcohol does not dissolve it. If we mix some
of it with a solution, the prussiate is separated like white
flakes of snow, which preserve their lustre when dried, and
resembling the silvery kind of gauze presented by the ace
tate   of mercury.   When redissolved in water, it reproduces
an ordinary solution of triple prussiate.
   This salt, which I shall denominate triple to distinguish
it from the simple prussiate of potash, is equally constant
in its attributes with the most perfect neutral salts. It is of
a fine citrine yellow colour, which never leaves it until it
changes its state : for this colour, as well as for its two other
characteristic properties, of crystallizing and dyeing the red
oxide blue, it is indebted to a portion of black oxide, which
forms an essential part of its constitution. Without this ox
ide, subjected, like the two other elements of the triple prus
siate, to an invariable proportion, this prussiate could in fact
neither crystallize, nor form blue with the solutions of iron,
the base   of which       was at the maximum.           It   is,   in short, from
this very union that the principle which saturates the potash
of the triple salt extracts, as remarked           by
                                          Berthollct, proper
ties which singularly increase          its analogies with the acids.
  In this view we may add, that the triple prussiate occupies
the middle between the alkaline and the metallic salts. When
we reflect, however,         upon one property of this salt, which
we shall mention presently,           itwould be difficult to ascertain
whether    it   is   to the prussic acid, or to the simple prussiate
collectively,        that the oxide   of iron   attaches     itself when    it   is
raised to the state  of triple prussiate. What   certain, how-.
                                                             is
ever, is,  that we  arc still ignorant  of what aspect or what
properties    prussic acid should have, which should be united
                a
in precisely   proper proportion with that dose of black

prussiate. On treating   the prussic acid  with this oxide, we
may make Prussian blue, but not the ferruginous kind of
acid, which    proper for converting potash into triple salt:
                     is

Prussian blue is not of               a   nature to be combined                   without    &
residue with potash.  In a word, the triple prussiate, with
the exception of its alkaline base,         may so express     is,   if
                                                                      I
myself,   compound as to which we have as yet no data,
            a
and no idea which authorizes us to consider      rather as                  it               a
salt, the acid        of which would             have been particularly exalted
 by   its union with the oxide, than as                    a   combination        perfected
throughout all its parts              by
                             this same oxide.
   One property which seems to hinder us from admitting
the prussiate as   salt, the acid of which should be exclu
                       a
sively united to the black oxide,   that of its resisting the
                                                      is
power of the alkaline hydro-sulphurets.   If these re-agents,
which spare no other metallic salt, have no action upon the
triple prussiate, we are therefore to   certain extent war     a
ranted in presuming that the oxide of iron could not well
have been exclusively attached                    to the acid         of the triple prus
siate,unless we are willing to believe that the affinity of
this acid for the oxide not powerful enough to defend
                                     is                                                     it

conclude:         We shall        sec presently         that an affinity so extra

not an impossibility.  shall now proceed to the trial

of ferruginous carbonate,                 it   would be freed from               it,   because
the hydro-sulphuret              decomposes the latter                :   we may filter     it
if   necessary,    and yet the prussiate still crystallizes under the
accustomed form.                A    similar result leads us to discover, as
we originally                most particularly intimate com
                      insinuated,         a
bination between the three elements of the triple prussiate.
But we shall see these same hydro-sulphurets contribute in
enabling us to obtain,    all its purity, the white prussiate,

has been placed fifteen or eighteen grains of prussiate of pot

precipitate immediately produced which makes the liquor as
white as milk, and which remains so while the he.it con
tinues.       This    is the precipitate which            I   call white prussiate:
this is the prusgiate obtained by. Fourcroy, Vauquelin, Davy,

     Fill two    glasses    with       boiling water           : put a few drops of
prussiate into the one, and an equal                           quantity into the se

potash or of ammonia.    These two glasses being thus pre
pared, drop some nitrate of iron into them : the first yields,
as might be expected,              a complete blue ; but the second pre
sents the amusing                spectacle of a precipitate which, al
though  blue at first, rapidly quits this colour to become
white.  The theorv of these facts is so evident that I shall
not dwell upon           it,
                    nor shall    repeat all the other experi

ments mentioned in my first memoir, in order to establish
the existence of the two prussiates of iron.  If the prussiate
at the minimum has no colour when          not affected by the

none also. The absence of colour in one of these salts                            is
surely not more astonishing than its absence in the other;
and finally,   we obtain red oxide

                                     it   is
which  we extract from the white prussiate.   But these dif
ferences, which theory previously points out, perfectly co
incides with those exhibited                   by
                                the red and green sulphates
under similar circumstances.
     In my first memoir          I    advised the pouring       of the prussiate
of   potash     upon the sulphate in            a   flask, in order to avoid, as
much       as   possible, the mixture               of   the air, but I   succeeded
very imperfectly:          in    the first place because cold
                                                liquids                          al

acted with these salts.
     If,
      for example, we dilute the solution of green sulphate
with three or four times its volume of sulphuric or muriatic
acid, the excess of these acids does not in the least change
the result.  The white prussiate only wanting colour on ac
count of the want of oxygen, we should think that additions
like these are not made for the purpose of giving it. Acids
                                                                               more

more concentrated may alter the whiteness of the prussiate,
but will never bring it to a perfect blue.
    The marine acid, boiled over          prussiate   also does not make
it blue.
  This boiling acid is not without action upon the white
prussiate. The following is what I remarked on this subject :
Some white prussiate is destroyed, some prussic gas disen
gaged, and we find black oxide in solution : in this case
the little Prussian blue formed by the introduction of the
air during the interval of the mixtures, predominates over the
white, and changes its whiteness to greenish.
  The blue prussiate, boiled with the same acid, also gives
prussic gas and abandons red oxide, but less is destroyed of
it than white prussiate.   We may infer from these facts
that the muriatic acid, aided by heat, could, strictly speak
ing, decompose the prussiates, and resume over the prussic
its rights    more energetic acid : — this would not be an
                as a
astonishing, but it would be at least a tedious, experiment.

               a

liquor is thickened by the production of a white precipitate,
which    passes to the blueish. The gas being totally separat

its    own                 but the surplus was still greater
                   decomposition       :
when, instead of crystallized prussiate, we used a simple al
kaline lixivium of Prussian blue. Wc shall see the reason of
this presently.
      When             ley of common potash over Prussian
                   we pass    a
blue, a part of the alkaline carbonate is charged with red oxide;
there results a solution which answers to Stahl's         martial
tincture, and of which pure potash is not susceptible. This
solution, which may be also prepared by throwing some
drops of nitrate into liquid carbonate, may be mixed with
the prussiate of potash without occasioning the least change
even by remaining in it.    It is this same ferruginous car
bonate which,    as I  have said, is recovered in its mother
waters. Now if we add an acid to the mixture of these salts,
we precipitate perfect blue from                    it,
                                   because the new solution
of oxide which replaces the ferruginous carbonate decom
poses       in    its turn the prussiate         of potash,   as any solution    of
iron would do *.
   The instant, therefore, that we employ in any analysis                        a
prussic lixivium in place of crystallized prussiate, we do
                                             a
nothing else than add to the product; in the first place, the
red oxide, which formed part of the ferruginous carbonate,
then the black   oxide which          constant element of the
                                               is   a
triple prussiate contained in this lixivium.
   Chemists very soon discovered         the vicious effects of
these       lixiviums, although they did
                                      not at first perceive
that   they contained two very different ferruginous com
binations      the carbonate
                   :          already mentioned,   and   the
triple  pru*siate.   Several experimenters, even when  they
saw the blue they furnished with the acids, thought this blue
was natural, or,    other words, oxide or blue of Prussia
                             in                                                   ;
they endeavoured to precipitate                     it,
                                   however, without touch
ing    the alkaline prussiate, which they thought to be endow
ed with the property  of dyeing without owing       to the iron.  it
From their efforts arose the recipes for precipitated lixiviums
which we find in every book upon chemistry. But since
  •   It   is   the mixture of these same salts which prepares the mother waters of
soda, for giving Prussian blue when we add an acid to them.
                                                                                the

           Materials for      a History of     the Prussiates.          345
the inquiries      of Scheele   and Berthollet,      we have    ascertained
that these      recipes but imperfectly fulfilled the object in
view    : for it is easy to see that it was not enough to strip a
lixivium of the oxide which the carbonate introduced into it:
it still remained to provide against the black oxide which
belongs to the triple prussiate, and which we might so much
the less suppose to exist, since the addition of the acids, with
out the intervention of light or of heat could not render sen
sible the products of its decomposition.
     I shall  not stop to analyse the phaenomena             presented   du
 ring the preparation      of the hot or cold lixiviums     ; because, now
 that we are well convinced          of   the inutility of   the prussiates
with respect to the evaluation of the quantity of iron in ana
 lyses, the details are of little interest : for the same reason I
 pass over the liquid tests proposed         with ammonia, chalk, mag
 nesia,   &c,     because   they are    themselves triple prussiates, in
 which we cannot place confidence,               unless we employ      them
in   the same way as the counter-proof            proposed by Berthollet.
 I shall add, only because           it is a fact worthy of being re
 corded in the history of science, that, when the chemist
 would still take advantage of a lixivium or liquid test, which
 he had purified by means of an acid, we may be assured he
 has not attained (as he perhaps flattered himself,) the com
 plete separation of the iron; for it is certain that every lixi
 vium which gives        a  blue colour with      a solution of red oxide,
 contains     also black      oxide,   since  without   the assistance     of
 the same oxide it could not be dyeing prussiate: or, in other
 words, every prussiate of potash, which has not been tripled
  (trisule) by the black oxide ; consequently prussiate of
  potass, when pure and simple, is not capable of forming
  blue with a solution where the oxide is at the maximum :—
  this has occurred to those most experienced in analytical pro
  cesses.    It  is a truth which Scheele has perfectly established.
  I repeat,   therefore, that the saturated lixiviums or the al
  kaline prussiates cannot really serve as a dyeing (teignant) re
  agent unless a portion of black oxide has rendered them triple
  salts, the red oxide being by no means capable of supply--
  ing the place of the black oxide for this purpose. Finally,
  we may conclude from all these circumstances that the al
                                                                      kaline

   kaline prussiates or earthy triples should notfor thefuture en
   ter into the class of reagents useful iu analyses, for this plain
   reason, that they cannot discover the iron in any solution,
   without, at the same moment, adding their own : they
   ought only      to   he allowed to make a figure among             those
   which, like turnsole gall-nuts, Sec,          are confined to the class
   of  reagents proper       for indicating    merely   if  such and such
   a principle be presented.
      Diluted sulphuric acid, when applied to the triple prus
   siate, furnishes similar results with the muriatic. 100 part*
,  of   prussiate    restore   by  this method from         115 to  116   of
   sulphate of potash.           If we knew exactly how much al
   kali  there is in the sulphate, we might infer from the esti
   mate the base of the prussiate             of potash. 100 parts of
   crystals of prussiate lose ten of water by distillation.
      In order to complete its decomposition by the acids, the
  ebullition must be kept up at least half an hour, in order to
  dissipate the gas entirely, and to obtain the complete sepa
  ration    of  the white      prussiate which is formed during the
  operation.
      The   prussiate   of  potash is dissolved cold      in the muriatic
  acid, without        being decomposed.          This mixture requires,
  according to      Berthollet, the assistance of light or of heat.
      Vinegar     assisted    by ebullition also decomposes it : the
  prussic gas       escapes, and the white prussiate is formed ; it
  does not become blueish so rapidly as with the foregoing
  acids : in short, this prussiate, which does not appear ex
  cept at the very moment when the ternary combination be
  gins to be disorganized, strongly confirms by its whiteness
  that it is really the oxide at the minimum only, which has the
  privilege of entering into the formation of the triple prus
  siate   : this is one of those       truths which    Scheele   has com
  pletely established.          Notwithstanding      this, however, the
  distinction of the oxides in these circumstances is a point
  to which      subsequent chemists          have  not paid     proper at
  tention.
     Black     Oxide Element       of Prussian Blue. —We shall now
  prove that this oxide, in an invariable dose, is an             essential
  principle in the constitution of the triple prussiate ; but             it

is   a  point which also deserves some attention, when we see
that this same oxide can follow ihe prussic acid from one
combination to the other, without changing its state : when
we     see also  this oxide pass from prussiate to prussiale, re
turn from the latter to the former, circulate through even
the most oxidizing medium, without thereby losing the
state which constitutes          it  an oxide  at the minimum : this is
 also a point     in  the history   of prussiates, which in my opinion
 has not been attended to.
      If, for example, it would be correct to say, that without
 the assistance of the black oxide the prussiate of potash
 *would      neither be yellow, crystallizable, nor dyeing, we
 might assert with equal truth, that the Prussian blue could
 not be formed without the intervention of this same oxide ;
 and in fact when, with          a  solution of  red oxide of triple prus
 siate    of potash, we make Prussian blue, the black oxide               of
  this salt passes jointly with its acid into the new combina
  tion : whence it follows that this oxide, element of the prus
  siates   of potash, becomes         so afterwards   from   the   Prussian
  blue, and even        as we shall show from all the other metallic
  prussiates    which     are formed with this salt.
       This black oxide is found so solidly interwoven in the
  combination of Prussian blue, so well guarded by its al
  liance with the prussic acid from all ulterior hyper-oxida
   tion, that we never fail to recover it in this blue, such as it
   was formerly in the triple prussiate of potash.                T shall go
   further : if we make blue with this prussiate and the green
   sulphate, the oxide of this last will rise, as we know, to its
   maximum,        in proportion as the blue will be coloured by the
   impression of the air ; but will it be the same with the black
   oxide which passes jointly with the acid in Prussian blue ?
    Certainly not. This oxide will not renounce the quality of
    minor oxide which it had in the prussiate of potash : i. e. if
    during the exposure to the air the base of the green sul
    phate, and consequently that of the white prussiate, is raised
    from    28 to 48 per cent.,        the black oxide, the      inseparable
    attendant upon the prussic acid, will not participate in this
    hyper-oxidation, it will invariably keep to its 2S per cent.
        Not only     the atmosphere, which        so easily raises   to their
                                                                   maximum

                                                     iff
maximum the bases of the sulphate, of the muriate, and of
the white prussiate, loses all its activity with respect to the
black oxide in question     but still, neither the application of
                                   :
the boiling nitric acid, nor the oxygenated muriatic acid, can
succeed   in raising the oxidation of this last. These acids
may   in fact destroy Prussian blue, and even reduce  to red                       it
oxide  :  but while there remains some blue to be destroyed,
this last will preserve        to       the end       the black oxide,         in       all its
primitive integrity.
  If we    treat the red oxide with               prussic acid, we shall form
no kind of combination             ;   — this   is conformable to the obser
vation of Scheele      :   but      if     we make use           of black oxide,            we
shall obtain greenish prussiate which the air will convert
into perfect blue. The black oxide enters therefore into
the combination of Prussian blue.                           If   this oxide was            not
necessary, or   the red oxide could
                if                                          exclusively serve as              a
base to Prussian blue,             we    do not       see   why this oxide, and
even its           mixed with simple prussiate of potash,
           solution,
would not give Prussian blue.
I   have remarked     little higher that the affinity of the
                           a
prussic acid for this dose              of black oxide, which                  renders      il
proper for producing triple prussiate, might be powerful
enough for saving   from the destiny common to all the ox
                         it
ides which are combined with acids in general.
  It   appears to me, in short, that we draw this consequence
from the following experiment                :
   Throw into flask hydrosulphuret
                a                     of potash upon Prus
sian blue, and keep the mixture well corked        few days           :   in   a
we find the hydrosulphuret converted into triple prussiate,
and the red oxide of Prussian blue alone changed into black
hydrosulphuret   and hence we see that
                   :                       the red oxide has if
followed the  example of all the oxides when   the hydrosul
phuret finds them united to acids,           not so with theit   is
black oxide, which,           as      frequently said, passes
                                    we have       so
from the triple prussiate of potash into the Prussian blue.

state   of white prussiate,       as   it   does   the   red   sulphate.    This
fact I have published in my first memoir, and the power of
this reagent never passes beyond ; but the hydro-sulphuret
of potash totally changes the red and green sulphates into
black hydro-sulphureted oxide.     Why cannot the hydro-
snlphuret extend its action to the black oxide in question ?
There must be a singular affinity, and of which there are
few examples in chemistry, which enables the prussic acid,
the weakest  of the acids in so many respects, to protect
this oxide against the whole power of the alkaline hydro-
sulphurets.
   All the metallic solutions which give prussiates with the
triple prussiate of potash, certainly follow the example of
those of iron. The prussiates resulting from it will preserve
in all its purity the black oxide which the prussic acid car
ries with it.       But it   is now time to lay before                 my readers
the grand experiment which demonstrates                             that Prussian
blue is a triple salt, and that the black oxide, which had
passed from the triple prussiate of potash into the Prussian
blue, may still repass from the Prussian blue into the potash,
 without   having at any moment abandoned its quality                            of
 oxide at the minimum.
    I presume that this experiment is already anticipated by
 those who have conceived a clear idea of the nature of the
 triple prussiate of potash.
    Take a Prussian blue, for instance, which has undergone
 all the reactions which the atmosphere or the most highly
 oxidating acids may have produced upon it.         .Apply pure
 potash  to   it,
               and we  shall  procure  lixivium which
                                                   a   will only

                                       a        which we shall in
 find the prussic acid constantly associated with the common
 dose of black oxide.          If
                             this prussiate    really whatis have          I
 described    to be, which
             it             the  reader can scarcely doubt, there
 will   be no objection,     I    think, against         the new point     of   the
 ory which establishes
                               " that
                               the white or blue prussiates are
 triple combinations, as well as the prussiate of potash which
 has concurred to their formation."

elements of the acid destroyed.     The two others, the hy
drogen and azote, are employed in producing ammonia. As
to the carbonic acid and the gaseous oxide, it is equally evi
dent that these are the two oxidations,  major and minor, of
the charcoal furnished by the oxygen of the two oxides which
we have ascertained to exist in Prussian blue.
  This decomposition        takes place with such a moderate heat
that it has appeared to me very convenient when we wished
to procure gaseous oxide.   There is not the least ground for
suspecting any oil to be present : it is very surprising to see
that in the course of   destruction where charcoal and hy
                            a
drogen abound, there is not a single panicle of these com
bustibles which proceeds to constitute itself in any of the
respects   which can form oil.

the combination of iron with charcoal does not require a
very high temperature. The charcoal of the blood when it
is obtained by a very inferior heat, also contains iron in a
carburetted state ; for with muriatic acid it also gives aro
matic hydrogen.     I think Priestley has somewhere noticed
the bituminous smell of the hydrogen furnished by the fluxes
of charry substances.

 pour, which is condensed like farina in the neck of the re

    The triple prussiate cannot support an elevated tempera
 ture without being simplified in its composition.    It gets
jid of the black oxide, and passes to the state of simple
prussiate : but the latter can also be reduced to something
more simple, as we shall soon see : it then leaves potash in
its place, and the ordinary remains of the prussic acid,
which are ammonia and charcoal.                       A         of this last serves

                                           the triple and simple prus
siates    succeed     in subtracting     themselves, in proportion,
without doubt,       as   the carbonate makes them into a paste : but
it   likely that a long continued high temperature in strong
     is
vessels, would at last reduce these prussiates to two binary
combinations, which are ammonia and carbonic acid, with
potash, iron, and remains of charcoal, which the oxygen of
the iron and the humidity was not able to acidify.

to time, and the progress             of   the solution is ascertained            from
the alkaline     and bitter taste          of   the alcohol.         The lixiviums
of charcoal from blood or                  leather        are rarely free from       a

    that, like phosphorus, it can be fixed in the charcoal, but
    not in the iron which it contains ; for the smell of the
    aromatic hydrogen mentioned above gives                                     no indication         of
    the presence of sulphur.
      We        easily        recognise the simple prussiate by its double
    alkalino-bilter             taste, and by the aroma with which it fills
ihe mouth.                 It precipitates in yellow the solution of copper,
    and does not give blue with that               of red oxide ; but it pre
    cipitates ihcm in ochrey yellow, as a pure alkali would do*.
       Lastly, it gives blue with an ordinary solution of sulphate
    of iron, because there is at first constituted triple prussiate :
    afterwards it gives white or blue prussiate of iron.     If the
    prussiate be black, it is because the alkaline hydro-sulphuret
    introduces hydro-sulphuretted oxide into it ; but we get rid
    of it with        some drops               of acid,       and the prussiate           of iron   ap

    except in a closed flask.                       Scheele has shown,                  that   the car
    bonic acid is sufficient                     for separating it from the potash

nor comparable to any of those formed by the oxygenated
acids. It froths continually, and has something saponaceous
in its appearance.      A lighted candle brought near the beak
of  the retort burns this portion     of acid   :  but the loss is not
confined    to  this ;  the   acid which    this salt retains more
strongly, by the help of the potash which begins to predo
minate, also undergoes by the effects of heat a slow de
struction, which converts it into ammouia and carbonic acid.
At whatever period of the ebullition we take the product, we
always find carbonate of ammonia in it mixed with a little
prussic acid ; and latterly, when the water begins to disap
pear, this carbonate is condensed in spiculae in the neck of
the retort.
   If we   add more water in order to continue the           ebullition,
these same products are found in the water            of  the   receiver.
But   after four or five successive    and similar distillations,      we
cease to perceive them, although the saline residue            still con
tains prussic acid in a sensible degree.
   It must then be dissolved with alcohol          : part  of it is dis
solved, and the other totally resists        its action.      In the al
coholic liquor we in fact find prussiate          of potash, but the
saline mass undissolved is nothing else        but carbonate of pot
ash. The object of the two following experiments was to
remove all doubt as to the destruction of the simple prus
siate by the heat    of ebullition alone.
   This prussiate does not disturb the muriate of lime: but
that which has undergone a long ebullition precipitates it
abundantly in calcareous carbonate. There is a transforma
tion therefore of prussiate into carbonate of potash.
   Two quantities of prussiate, the one altered by a long
ebullition, and the other entire, were employed to precipi
tate ordinary sulphate      of iron. Both  gave a blue      colour; but
after being revived, the former quantity occupied three times
less room than the latter.
   If  we   make dry simple prussiate red-hot, there exhales
earbonate    of ammonia accompanied by an oleaginous vapour
resembling that of hartshorn.           The saline mass when dis
solved, separates charcoal, and it is still carbonate of potash
mixed with some indecomposed prussiate.

                              INFERENCES.
     All  these results certainly bear us out in the       conclusion,
that the simple prussiate of potash is, as Scheele has already
discovered, a fragile combination, the elements of which
are as easily separated as those        of complex combinations. We
 find,    in short, that   a part of the acid is removed from the
 potash by the sole force of dilatation ; while the other part,
 which is longer subjected to the action of caloric, is de
 stroyed in order to be changed into ammonia and carbonic
 acid. Let us now make the application of this conclusion.
      The triple  prussiate  or potash undergoes no derangement
 by repeated ebullitions.           The iixiviums employed in the
 manufacture of Prussian blue contain, as we shall presently
 see,    triple prussiate and simple prussiate. Besides, there is
 no ammoniacal salt in them.             We are of opinion, that the
 great excess of carbonate of potash which they contain
  would not admit of their presence ; but they exhale am
  monia while in a state       of ebullition.      From whence could
  this ammonia proceed,         if it was not from the decomposition
  of   the simple prussiate    ?    We may therefore conclude, that
  the   boiling or concentration of       the Iixiviums  exposes   them
  to be deteriorated by the destruction         of this same prussiate,
  which we cannot too much preserve : and as the carbonate
  of potash is also one of the principal results of this destruc
  tion, it does not cease to add to what is already there.
       Curadeau was well aware of the deterioration which the
   boiling of the Iixiviums produces, and he very happily pre
   vented the bad effects by adding a little sulphate of iron to
   them. This is conformable to Scheele's principle, who has
   shown that the simple prussiate changes into triple prussiate
   as soon as it can be associated with a portion of black oxide,
   and thereby be guarded         against decomposition.      As to the
   products from the destruction of the prussiate by fusion or
   by ebullition, there is certainly nothing extraordinary in
   them, since it is sufficient to know the nature of the prus-
    sic aeid in order to prevent them ; but it is not so with re
    spect to the carbonic acid which is presented         during one of
    these destructions. Whence comes the oxygen, for example,
    which, during      the ebullition   of  the aqueous  prussiatc, suc
                                                                    ceeds

ceeds  in acidifying the charcoal of the prussic a:.id ? Either
this oxygen will be, like hydrogen, azote and carbon, one
of the constituents of the prussic, and which is destroyed ;
or it must be supposed that there is a decomposition of
water.     is not time yet, as I think, to choose between
               It
these two opinions; but until we have some more light on
the subject,! shall say that if we reflect on the circumstances
accompanying the production of the prussic acid, we shall
adopt in the mean time the opinion of Berthollet in preference
to every other hypothesis.                    "
                              It appears difficult," says that
author,        "    to suppose the existence               of oxygen in         a substance
which contains elements                     so disposed        to form peculiar com
binations with           it,   as     hydrogen and carbon are, and which
can frequency                support        so great   a   degree    of    heat,       without
undergoing decomposition."    In truth, in order to admit
thai this acid an oxygenated product, we ought to suppose
                        is
that such an acid   capable of disputing the oxygen with
                                is
the carbon which envelops       on all hands, and we can
                                                  it
not do less than place  at the head, not of the acids, but
                                     it
of the oxides, which are known to be the most difficult of
reduction.

urgent. — His body was (to use his own expression) as stiff as

 curvation of the head and spine being more frequent and
 the stiffness of the muscles more general.    In the evening
 the sensation of          a   load at the stomach was so distressing that
 he took       a   dose   of antimonial wine, but             itdid not operate. —

 very bad night, and on the

was invited by another enema, which, however, producing
no evacuation, he was again plunged into the cold bath at
one o'clock.  He has occasionally had an involuntary spasm
of the tongue which thrusts it between his teeth, the jaw at
the same time closing upon it.    After the bath his pulse was
88 and the muscles about the neck were much relaxed. — Cap.

  took 60 drops of T. opii in a glass of wine. At eight o'clock

   from     that   particular      appearance    which has been remarked.
   It  was determined to endeavour to anticipate the spasms this
   evening by administering the bath and medicines before the
   probable hour of their return.             Two or three hours, how
   ever, before that time a very slight exacerbation came on, and
   after  a   similar    treatment with that of yesterday          evening he

by him) on the part.           At   seven o'clock    in the evening he
begged       to go to the    cold   bath ; after the use   of which the
spasm and the pains abated.—             His opiate    increased    to 100
drops.
     12th day. — Has      passed a good night     ; —universal    stiffness
much increased        : the pain, having removed        from the epigas
tric    to the inguinal    region, was again dispelled by the cold
bath.
     13th day. — Passed a tolerable night ; — says that the ab..
dominal pains have descended into his thighs.                 The mus
cles    of his  face are in a very slight degree relaxed       from their
first state, and the skin of that part is covered with a greasy-
looking perspiration.           His body is sufficiently opened and
bis appetite very good.
     In   the evening    an   eruption of the miliary kind was ob
served (this had made its appearance on the 10th day) on his
skin, — it was preceded by a pricking sensation ; it appeared
first in the neck, and now covers the whole body.                   Opiate
increased to 120 drops.

he is very little improved in respect of being able to open
his      mouth.     It is  observable    that he sleeps much ; and
more particularly after the bath.          Dose of opium this even

 hard to the touch. The muscles in general soft ; — takes now
 only 70 drops tinct. opii.
    It  appears that the muscles     of the tongue      and jaws are
 almost the only parts that have now for some lime been in
any considerable degree affected ; it appears also that the
integuments of that neighbourhood are alone subject to
sweating, which has ceased from the other parts in propor

 come on.
      24. — The pain increased; the patient had obtained no

     From   the 29th to the 31st she was much        better.   On the
  3 1st she sat up    in bed, and seemed inclined to have the ope
  ration performed.        The medicines were repeated.
     Nov. 3. — Pulse S0, and regular.                              ,
     8. She appeared much better, and seemed to be desirous
  of having the operation performed.
     10. — About ten o'clock this morning she was more un
  easy, and sat up sometime. On going to bed she slept some
 hours.     Her voice had changed, and her eyes had assumed
 a different appearance.        She continued uneasy     until   about
 two o'clock P.       M.  when she died.
     12. The body was examined in presence of Dr. Squire,
 Dr. Lidderdale, Mr. Grove, Mr. Taylor, and myself.
    We were informed by her friends, that she had been mar
 ried two years, but never had any children. She was thought
 to have been pregnant at the commencement of the disease.
    The tumour was encysted, and reached close to the scrobi-
 culus cordis   ;   the surface waa irregular, and bore marks of
 recent inflammation.         The omentum adhered to the upper
 and anterior surface.
    About four quarts of a glary fluid was found external to
the tumour at the upper part, with a considerable quantity           of
purulent matter. The viscera were obscured by the tumour,
 except a small part of the omentum and colon to which it
was attached.         The diaphragm was raised so high that its
 convex part reached to the third true rib, and the superior
part of the liver and stomach were opposite to the fourth
true rib, so that a very small space was left in the cavity          of
the thorax for the action of the lungs.
    The tumour consisted of several cysts, from the largest of
which about eight quarts of a glary tenacious fluid were
taken. One of the smaller cysts contained a fluid as limpid
4s water.     Others contained      a glary and Jilrous substance,
which could       scarcely  be pressed from the surrounding     parts.
Large irregular masses were observed,        part of them in   a state
•of suppuration.
    Over the anterior part of the tumour, and on the right
side a thick opaque substance was expanded, which, on dis
section, proved to be the uterus, but so changed in its
                                                            structure

structure and figure, that its parts were scarcely distinguish
able : this reached From the pelvis to the umbilicus, and
extended      about five inches in each side of the linea alba; the
Fallopian tube, round ligament, and ovarium, on the right
side were evident. The uterus was so altered that its cavity
could not be traced         : the  os uteri and     posterior part of the
vagina were lost in the diseased part, and no trace of them
existed.
     On cutting through        the anterior part    of  the uterus, its sub
stance seemed to have           degenerated      into  a  diseased    mass   of
 small irregular cysts, terminating in the large suppurated
masses before noticed. The liver adhered to the peritoneum ;
its surface bore strong marks of remote inflammation ; the
 stomach, intestines, peritoneum, and spleen, all had the
 appearance of inflammation.
     In   the operation on the 22d of October (see the former
 Report) the instrument had passed into one of the large ir
 regular masses which was contained in a cyst full of a thick
 viscid fibrous substance ; but it should seem, that if the in
 strument had been of sufficient length to have perforated the
 posterior part of that cyst, and to have entered the large one,
 several quarts of a viscid fluid would have escaped ; or, if the
 operation had been performed at the scrobiculus cordis, the
 fluid external to the sac would have been evacuated, as wa»
  suggested     at. the time.         . .
      Although      the dissection    of this   case proves that some re
 lief might      have been obtained by a trocar and canula                eight
  inches long, in order to perforate the largest cyst ; yet, from
  the extent of the disease, the operation would in all proba
  bility have been succeeded by violent inflammation, which
  would have proved fatal, as the parts did not possess elasti
  city enough       to regain their original situation ; neither could
   artificial pressure have supplied the want of support occa*-
   sioned by the evacuation of the fluid, which would have been
   upwards of three gallons.                        John Taunton,

Wm. Hyde Wollaston, M.D., and Humphry Davy, esq.,

    Afterwards the members of the Society dined together, as
usual, at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, in the Strand.
    On delivering    the Copleyan medal to Mr. Davy, to be
by   him   transmitted   to Dr. Henry of Manchester, the pre
sident, with his usual eloquence, expatiated at considerable
length on the propriety of the decision of the council, and
the meritorious      and successful researches      of Dr. Henry in
chemistry,     pursuing the same       course in which his father so
                                                               happily

happily led the way.         The right hon. baronet then took a
view of the various papers furnished to the Society by this
philosopher in 1797, 1800, and 1808; and concluded by
stating that Dr. Henry, with the most patriotic views, is now
devoting every moment, not engaged in professional duties,
to an investigation of muriate of soda, in order to ascertain
the real nature of this useful article, and develop the cause
why that of our own manufacture is not so effectual in pre
serving fish,      as the salt   of warmer climates. The success
which has hitherto crowned his labours in this important
research, induces him to hope that he will be able to ascer*
 tain the true cause        of the difference   between  English and
 foreign salt, and to point out the means of remedying iu
 defects, and improving this important part of our manufac
 tures.     The president then congratulated       the Society on the
  rapid progress      of science,  and the general tranquillity in the
 British dominions,         while the nations on the Continent are
 involved in misery and sanguinary war: — and reverted to the
  brilliant discoveries of Mr. Davy, which have shed a lustre
  on the present age.
      Dec. 8. The president in the chair. — A letter from          Dr.
  Henry     to  Mr. Davy, on the      existence of oxygen in ammo-
  niacal gas, was read.         Dr. H. inserted two pieces of platina
   wire in straight tubes       of glass hermetically sealed, placed
   them in a glass globe, and made the galvanic fluid pass over
   the ammonia, when a considerable portion of oxygen gas
   (about six per cent) was found to be disengaged, without
   the possibility    of its having   been furnished by the materials
   used   in the process.       The minute operations     and   experi
   ments performed by        Dr. H.,  to prove the existence   of oxy
                                                                        *
   gen in ammonia, tend to confirm fully Mr. Davy's opinions
   and experiments on the base of this substance.
      Dec.     15.    The reading of the Bakerian Lecture by
    Humphry Davy, Esq., Sec. R. S. " On some Analytical
    Researches, concerning the Elements of certain Bodies ; with
    someObservations      on Chemical   Theory," commenced. — In the
    Introduction, Mr. Davy observed, that his objects in these
    inquiries were to ascertain precisely, the nature of the ele ]
    ments of ammonia, and the alkaline substances ; to attempt
                                                                    the

    368                      Royal Society.
   the decomposition of sulphur, phosphorus, the boracic,
   muriatic, and fluoric acids ; and to ascertain the nature of
   the diamond,    plumbago, and charcoal.
      The second section was upon ammonia and its elements.
   —In this, he particularly examined the action of ammonia
   and potassium ; a process, fiom which M. M. Gay Lusiac
   and Thenard, had concluded that potassium might be a
   compound of hydrogen and potash. He showed, by a va
  riety of experiments, that their conclusions cannot be ad
  mitted ; and I hat in this operation, it is the ammonia, and
  not the potassium, which is decomposed.
      Mr. Davy described in the course of this investigation,
  two new substances, one a compound of the oxide of po
  tassium and ammonia, and the other a compound of the
  oxide  of potassium and nitrogen. This last inflames spon
  taneously by exposure to air, and produces potash and ni
  trogen ; and it acts violently upon water, and by its action
  upon water, generates potash and ammonia.
      From  the general  tenour of these experiments, Mr. Davy
 seemed inclined     to infer that nitrogen in its aeriform state,
 is not a simple body ; but that it contains oxygen, and in
 its combination with the oxide of potassium it possesses me
 tallic properties.
     Dec.  23.  The reading of Mr. Davy's Bakerian Lecture
was contiuued.        The third section was concerning the de
 composition of sulphur.       He detailed a number of elaborate
 experiments made upon it by means of Voltaic electricity,
and by the action of potassium ; from which he inferred,
that it is a triple compound of oxygen, hydrogen, and a pe
culiar basis.
     In this section he detailed an account of a most curious
fact, of the brilliant combustion of potassium in sulphu
retted hydrogen gass,      proving distinctly that this gas which
has long been       known to possess acid properties, contains
oxygen.
     The fourth section was on the decomposition of phospho
rus, which, like sulphur, enters into ignition, out of the
contact of air with potassium, and emits phosphurettcd hy
drogen gas \vh..ii acted on by electricity.
                                                              He

     He considered phosphorus as a compound of a small
 quantity of oxygen and hydrogen, with a peculiar basis ;
and both sulphur and phosphorus, as analogous to the resi
nous and oily bodies, except that the base of these last bo
 dies is carbon.
     In the fifth section, plumbago, charcoal, and the diamond,
were considered         as to   their affections by the new methods
of analysis.        Plumbago, Mr. Davy considers as a combi
nation of the pure carbonaceous element and iron.                   Char
coal, 'as a compound of the carbonaceous element and a lit
tle hydrogen      :   and    the diamond,     as  composed of the same
element with a minute quantity of oxygen.
   In the sixth section, the decomposition and composition of
 the boracic acid are detailed.          This acid is decomposed both
 by voltaic electricity and the action of potassium ; and its
base, by being combined with oxygen, reproduces boracic
  acid, — thus confirming former analogies.
     The reading of the remainder of the lecture            was deferred
 till the next meeting of the Society in January.
     By attending       to the second reading of Mr. Children's
 paper    on  galvanic batteries, we find that we reported it in
 correctly in our last number (p. 185 of this volume).                 Mr.
 Children stated that batteries with large plates should be
 used for operations on perfect conductors, and small plates,
 in great numbers, for operations on imperfect conductors.
This principle is of greac importance in the construction of
 the machine.

    At   the meeting      of this Society,     10th December,     the   se
 cretary read a communication             from the Rev, John     Fleming
of Bressay, describing a Narwhal or Sea Unicorn, of the
 sort denominated Le Narwal microcephale,                 by La Cepide,
which had been lately cast           ashore    alive at Weisdalc    Sound

posed some time ago by Professor Jameson, in regard to the
geognostic relations of the rocks of this tract of country.
The descriptions of the individual rocks, and their general
and    particular geognostic relations, were detailed with
ability;  and the interest      of the whole was increased     by acute
observations on the mode of examining and discriminating
rocks, — a subject of high value, particularly to those who
may be employed in examining the mineralogy of a country.

                         MR. DAVY'S THEORY.
       " MR.    TILLOCH, — SIR,
   XROFESSOR Davy this day, in his lecture on che
mical affinity at the Royal Institution, brought forwards
(not indeed for the first time) his theory, that chemical af
finity was the effect of opposite states of electricity.            This
theory he proposed with all that diffidence and hesitation
which are ever inseparable from the man of true science in
such matters. Having stated that bodies which are possess
ed  of chemical affinity     are   also    naturally in opposite states
of electricity,   and that this affinity is dependant upon their
state  of electricity,    he proceeded      to illustrate the  doctrine
in various ways, giving         examples of this dependence, and
showing that      bodies   which have their states of electricity
                                                                 altered

                             Mr. Davy's           Theory.                         371
altered by means of the galvanic apparatus, have at the
same time their chemical affinities also altered. Thus a body
which is naturally positive, but only in a low degree, will
have a very weak attraction for oxygen,   which is naturally
negative ; but exalt this naturally low positive state by
means of the apparatus, and its attraction for oxygen shall
be strong in proportion : — for example, silver, which is na
turally positive in a low degree, is incapable of acting upon
water ; but if you exalt this natural state of electricity, by
means of the galvanic apparatus, it will become capable of
extracting the oxygen from it.
   " As a further illustration of the theory he stated, that if
the states of electricity of bodies which naturally were pos
sessed    of strong chemical affinity            were by means        of   the ap
paratus     entirely reversed,         the  consequence would be a dis
union and destruction         of      the compound which they formed
in consequence of their natural affinities.
   "To prove this, the following experiment was performed :
— Moistened sulphate of potash was placed in the galvanic
circle, and presently it was decomposed ; potash appearing
at the negative and sulphuric acid at the positive side.  This
effect is produced, says Mr. Davy, by the action of the gal
vanic apparatus    inducing a state of electricity in the sul
phuric acid, the reverse of that which is natural to                       it,   and
the same       in
            the potash   and in consequence these two
                              ;                                                  sub
stances, instead of combining, actually repel each other, and
are found on opposite sides of the vessel in which they were
placed    in   combination,    the acid at the positive side and the
potash at the negative.
  " Mr.   Davy seemed to rely much upon this experiment                            ;
but his explanation of        it,
                              did not much misunderstand
                                    if I
him,     seems   militate against the doctrine he brought
                    to                                                             it
forward to support    for he explained
                         ;               upon this principle
                                                       it                          :
that the natural electricities of two bodies which were in
chemical union, being          by     means      of
                                                the galvanic apparatus
reversed, they would, as          a   natural consequence, repel each
pther, and thus be found            in a     separate state    in   the vessel     in
which the compound was placed.                   >.B

afford any support to the theory, nor does it appear to me to
offer a satisfactory explanation ; for in the first place, the sul
phuric acid and the potash being placed in the galvanic circle
in   a state    of chemical union, it                is not shown,      nor   is   it   easy
to conceive, how            a state      of   electricity contrary to the natural
one should be induced in the acid and potash, rather than
that their natural electricities should be raised and their union
rendered  stronger ; and secondly, supposing the change in
the electricities to have taken place, then the acid, having
become positive, ought, according to the true principles of
the theory, to unite with the potash which is become nega
tive; and this for precisely the same reason that they united
when the acid was negative and the potash positive.
  " lam inclined to think, however, that the true explanation
of the above-mentioned experiment                            is the   following     :    The
positive and negative points of the battery act upon the
moistened sulphate of potash precisely in the same way
that any neutral salt would act, which might bave the power
of decomposing              it,
                     the basis corresponding to the positive
side of the apparatus, and the acid to the negative.
   "Thus the basis of the neutral salt, which might be capa
ble of decomposing the sulphate of potash, would be, like the
positive side of the apparatus,     higher state of electricity
                                                    in   a
 than the potash, and consequently would attract the sul
 phuric acid from            it,
                     and the acid of the same neutral salt
 being also, like the negative side of the apparatus, in higher                a
 state of electricity than the sulphuric acid of the sulphate of
 potash, would attract the potash, and two new salts would
 thus be formed.
      "   It   is   thus,   I   conceive, that            the decomposition         of   the
 sulphate of potash                 in   the experiment         above   mentioned          is
 effected       by
             the galvanic apparatus  for the negative side, being
                                                     ;
 in   higher state of electricity than the sulphuric acid, will
      a
 attract the potash    and the positive side, being in
                                ;                          higher              a
 state than the potash, will attract the sulphuric acid.
      "   Hence the reason       that the sulphuric acid and the pot
 ash refuse to unite,        though stated to be    opposite states of
                                                                 in
 electricity,         and not because their natural states have been
 changed       ;    for the last reason        is   in   direct contradiction to other
                                                                                        fact*

     Mr.   Sowerby's Lecture on Chromalometry , — On the 12th
and loth of December, Mr. Sowerby, author of British
Mineralogy, 8cc., delivered his long promised Lecture on
 Chromatometry, at his house in Mead-Place, near the Asy
lum. This Lecture,        the object  of which  is to point out   anew
and very ingenious mode          of ascertaining    the  arrangement,
mixture,       and measure of prismatic tints,          and to show
their    correspondence with material colours, was accom
panied by an exhibition, in which the prismatic tints were
 produced, as from the sun, moon, and stars, the sun as seen
 from the different planets, and a productor, 60 feet long,
 measuring an infinite series : also the material and prismatic
 tints forming mixtures in union, with the effect as from cau
 dles, and flambeaus, and         a  sort of prismatic illumination,
 with different lustres, from metals, &c. The whole was
 elucidated with apparatus of a new and original kind, which
 promises to assist the philosopher in very much extending
 our knowledge on this subject. — Mr. Sowerby continues to.
 repeat the Lecture every      Monday,     and has announced a work
 illustrative of his discoveries.
