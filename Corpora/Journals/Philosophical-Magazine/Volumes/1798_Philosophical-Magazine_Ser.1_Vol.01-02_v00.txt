                     PREFACE.
XI. A VIN G            concluded      our   First Volume,       we
would       be  deficient   in gratitude did we      not return
thinks to the Public, in general, for the favourable
reception      our    labours     have    experienced j   and    to
those Scientific       Gentlemen, in particular, who have
assisted     us with Communications,           as well  as   Hints
respecting the future conducting           of the Work,
      As the grand Object of it is to diffuse Philoso
 phical Knowledge among every Class of Society,
 and to give the        Public   as  early  an   Account   as  pos
 sible   of every thing new or curious in the scientific
 World, both at Home and on the Continent, we
 flatter ourselves with       the   hope that the fame      liberal
 Patronage       we    have    hitherto    experienced   will be
continued;        and    that  Scientific   Men will afford us
 that    Support and Assistance         which they may        think
 our     Attempt     entitled   to.     Whatever    may    be our
 future Success,      no Exertions shall be wanting on our
 part to    r.nder the Work useful to Society, and espe
 cially to the Arts and Manufactures of Great Britain
 which, as is well known, have been much improved
 by the great        Progress that has lately been made in
 various Branches of the Philosophical Sciences.

  I. Account of Mr. Cartwright's Patent                    Steam   Engine.
  JL H E   steam engine is considered,            and with justice,    as the
first mechanical invention of modern times.                     The parent
idea  of this new and stupendous           power originated, it is well
known, in      the fertile mind     of  the marquis      of Worcester, in
the time of the Charles's       ;   though Captain Savary seems to
have been the first who actually pointed out to the public its
practical   application.      In    his hands, However,          it was but
 Hercules in the cradle.        Ncwcomen           and his associate have
the merit of bringing it to maturity, and giving lo its energies
a valuable direction. The principal improvements that have
 been added to it for the last thirty years, it has received from
 the hand     of the justly     celebrated        Mr. Watt.       From the
 many fruitless   attempts which have been made fince the date
 of Mr. Watt's      patent,    still further to improve the             steam
engine, the public has been led to believe, either that it has
 already arrived at its highest        state   of perfection, or that its
 defects  admitted not of remedy.               These delects,      as  every
 one knows, are an imperfect vacuum, much friction,                     and a
 complicated construction of parts           ;  liable, without great care
 and attention, to be frequently out of order.                It is  to these
 points Mr. Cartwright has immediately, and, we may add,
successfully,    directed   his attention.          His  first object seems
 to have   been   to obtain,      as nearly as may be,          an absolute
    Vol. I.                              B                         vacuum ;

vacuum       ; which, in consequence            of  the elastic vapour        that
separates from water injected in the usual mode of conden
sation, no one in the least conversant with the philosophy of
the     steam engine need           be told is impossible.             The con
densation, in Mr. Cartwright's engine, is performed by the
 application of cold to the external surface of the vessel con
 taining the steam.          Mr. Cartwright           is not,     however, the
 first who      tried  this method       ;  the   fame has been attempted
 by several ; but with         so  little success, that one of our first
 engineers in this line has been heard to give              it   as  his opinion,
 that, were      a  pipe to be laid across the Thames, the conden
 sation would        not be quick enough to work                a  steam engine
 with    its full effect.     The manner Mr. Cartwright                  manages
 this business is by admitting the steam between two metal
  cylinders lying one within the other, and having cold water
 flowing through the inner one, and enclosing the outer one.
  By   these means a very thin            body of steam is exposed to the
  greatest possible surface.         But this is not all      :  by means of a
  valve in the piston there is a constant              communication          at all
  times between the condenser and the cylinder, either above
  or below the piston,       so  that, whether it ascends or descends,
  the condensation       is always taking place.
      To   reduce the friction       of the piston, which, when                fresh
  packed     in  the common wav, lays a very heavy load upon the
  engine,      Mr. Cartwright        makes his solely      of metal,      and ex
  pansive. There is a further advantage in this method, from the
  saving    of lime   and expense in thepacking, and from thepiston
  fitting more accurately,          if possible,   the more     it is worked,
      Mr. Cartwright        has been equally attentive            in simplifying
   all the other parts of the engine ; his engine having only
   two valves, and those are          as   nearly self-acting      as  may be.
      But what will probably            be esteemed one        of   the most im
   portant circumstances attending              these   improvements, is the
   opportunity       they afford    of substituting ardent spirit, either
   wholly or in part, in the place of water, for working the
   engine. For, as the fluid with which it is worked is made to
                                                                          circulate

the ufing alcohol, after the firft fupply, can be attended with
little or no expense.               On    the contrary, the advantage                        will   be
great, probably equal to the faving                          of half        the fuel.        When,
indeed, the engine is applied, as Mr. Caitwright occafionally
purpofes, both as a mechanical power and as a ftiil at the
fame time, the whole fuel                  will    be faved.
     Afurther advantage of this invention is its applicability
to purpofes requiring only a fmall power, and for which any
other engine would be too complicated and cxpenfive.

in fuch quantity           as to force the float                 g    to fink, to      a     certain

         METHOD of            giving    a  fixed   red to cotton yarn, so
 much sought after by the Europeans in the present century,
 is now known in England, and practised in the southern
 parts of V ranee    :   but,  as  it is not universally known, and          as
 these processes are        not only        different, perhaps, from the
 oriental method, but like the one for dyeing cotton with
 madder described by Htllot,             far inferior to that practised by
 the Armenians at Astracan, the present information may not
 be superfluous.
     Professor    Oettinger     at   Tubingen made, long           ago,   in a
 small publication which appaired in 1764, a discovery which
might have led to the secret ot the oriental process for dyeing
with madder.         He there remarked that the beautiful dye of
the Turkish       yarn, which        withstands the strongest solvents,
becomes      immediately dissolved by common olive               oil, in such
a'  manner that the colour may be transferred from                  a  thread
of Turkey yarn         to  any other undyed             thread.    Hence      it
clearly appears,       that either the dye itself,         or the preparing
liquor (appret), or both, must be of              a fat nature, and soluble
in oil   : and an    ingenious artist        might     have built  with    ad
vantage on these grounds,            as will be sufficiently    seen  by the
following description of the oriental             process employed to dye
with madder, which           I  here give exactly as it was related to

                          Oriental Process for dyeing Red.
                                                                                                           5
  me, and        I   shall      leave     the improvement                     of it     to    those      to
  whose     department               it belongs, and                  who       have      a taste     for
  technical chemistry.
      The   greater part             of   the (ilk and cotton manufactories                              at
  Astracan are carried on by Armenians, the number of whom
  on account of the troublesome                          state     of       Persia is continually
  increasing;        and the dye-houses                   are kept going only from the
  first warm days in the spring till towards the end                                    of autumn.
 The     madder they employ coines partly by land over                                      Kitzlar
 from Terek, and partly by                     sea over        Derbent from the Persian
 Ghilan.         In both        places the plant grows                      wild in     the fields    in
 great abundance and great perfection, and is dug up also                                             in
 the uncultivated meads.                       The       roots are generally as thick as
 the barrel of        a   quill,     sometimes as one's finger, ami through
 out the whole spongy part of an agreeable pale reel colour :
 the bark on the other hand is for the moll part very thin, and
 appears to be            of little value.               At Terek            the fresh gathered
 roots are placed above each other in                              a stove,       or in   a   pit dug
 in   viscous earth which has been                         strongly          heated.          Earth is
 then thrown over the madder, and                                it must        sweat until         the
 stove or pit becomes cold                 ;   when the               roots,      the    second       or
third day, arc taken from                      it,   and either spread out or hung
up to dry. The same process                              is   usual         also in Persia, and
abundance of madder broueht          is                  from the remote parts                 of that
country to Russia.              At Astracan          it
                                                     is       fold, according to the im
portation, at from four to seven rubles for every forty pounds.

inner face of which                is   made to slope gently                      from the cir
cumference towards the centre, and                             a   groove goes round the
insideof this brick-work to receive                                   the    mill   stone.         The

the bottom rests                in a socket.            The         spindle         is turned by
means of an oblique beam passing through                                      it,   to the shorten
end   of which          is    fastened      a   mill- stone      moveable            like   a   wheel
round its axis, and                a   horse    is   yoked to the other end, which
reaches beyond the                 brick-work.              The madder, which                      has
been well dried in the fun,                       must be first coarsely broken                     in
the groove under the milestone, and afterwards ground oantil

     In   the fame mills are ground                      the        round       leaves       of the
sumach (rbus cotinus), which gives yellow dye, and which     a
isbrought to Astracan from the neighbourhood of Terek,
where   grows wild under the Tartarian name balga, or, as
           it
the Armenians express    beige, and      it,

sometimes            in the        preparation of Turkey leather.    These
leaves, when whole, have                     a   pleasant green           colour; but when
bruised       they exhibit that yellow dye with which they are im-»
pregnated,          and      which     is   produced         also        by   the woody part
and branches           :     but   as these arc       not    so easily cleaned,             they arc

     The    dye-stuffs         necessary         for dyeing red, besides the two
already       mentioned, are gall-nuts,                     alum, an indigenous bad
kind of soda, called kalakar,                        which    is    burnt in the wilds of
Kiflarand Astracan, from the salsuginous or soda plants, that
grow there in abundance, and lastly siih-oil.      The latter                                       is
boiled in the sistieries on the lower part of the Volga, and on
the Caspian        from the entrails of the sturgeon and other
                      sea,
large siili, but chiefly from those os the perca ludoperia, the
shad, and other kinds little esteemed        those parts.  The     in
proof of its being proper for dyeing                         is,   that when mixed              with
a   lixivium of        soda     it     must immediately assume                       a   milky     ap
pearance.        Should that not be the case,                       it   cannot be          used    by

the dyer*.        The   soda is burnt partly at      Kiflar by Armenians,
and partly in the wilds of Astracan by the Calmucks.                         The
latter, because it is very impure, fells          at Astracan      for only fif
teen copeks per pud, but the former is worth more than thirty.
     The cotton tobedved           red is first washed exceedingly clean
in running        water, and,     when the weather is clear, hung up
 on poles to dry.         If  it does not dry before the evening, it is
 taken into the house,           on account of the saline dews            so   re
 markable in the country around Astracan, and again exposed
 to the air next morning.              When it     is thoroughly dry         it is
 laid in   a  tub, and      fish-oil is poured     over it till it is entirely
 covered.        In this   state it must     stand all night,       but in the
 morning it is hung up on poles, and left there the whole
 dav    ; and this process is repeated for a week, so that the cot
 ton lies seven nights in oil, and is exposed               seven   days to the
 atmosphere,        that it may imbibe the oil and             free itself from
 all air.     The yam       is then ag*in carried       to a stream,     cleaned
  as  much     as possible, and      hung up on poles to dry.
      After this preparation        a  mordant is made         of  three   mate
  rials, which must give the grounds osthe red colour.                        The
  pulverised      leaves    of  the sumach       are first boiled in copper
  kettles   ; and when theircolouringmattcrhas                been sufficiently
  extracted     some powdered galls are added,                with which        the
  liquor must be again boiled          ; and bv these means it acquires a
  dark dirty colour.          After it   has been      sufficiently boiled the
  fire is taken        from under the kettle,           and     alum put into
   the still hot liquor, where it is soon di {solved.              The propor
   tion of these three ingredients I cannot determine with suf
   ficient    a .-curacy,   because the      dyers   make      use   of different
   quantities     at pleasure.      The powder of        the sumach      leaves is
   measured       into the kettle with ladles         ;  the water is poured
   in according       to a gauge,     on which marks are made to show
   how high        the water must stand in the             kettle   to soak six,
    eight, ten, 8cc. puds of cotton yarn. The g.ills and alum
    arc added iu the quantity of five pounds to each pud of cot-

 ton.      In     a word, the                   whole mordant must be sufficiently
yellow, strong, and                 of an           astringent        taste.
     As    soon as the alum is dissolved, no time must                                              be lost     in
order that the mordant may not be suffered to cool.                                                           The
yarn is then put into hollow blocks of wood shaped like a
mortar, into each of which such a quantity of the mordant
has       been poured as              may be sufficient                      to moisten             the yarn
without         any of        it being lest.                   As     soon         as   the workman
throws the mordant into the mortar, he puts a quantity                                                         of
the yarn into           it,   and presses               it   down with his hand till                     it   be
comes uniformly moistened,                               and the whole cotton yarn has
struck.         By this       it   acquires only               a    pale yellow colour,                  which
however         is   durable.          It       is   then hung up on poles                         in   the fun,
to   dry; again         washed             in        the stream, and               afterwards dried
once more.
     By    the yellow dye              of       the sumach             leaves, the madder dye
becomes brighter and more agreeable                                     ;      but the galls damp
the superfluous           yellow, and together with the alum prepare
the yarn for its colour.                        Some dvers however omit the                              use   of
these leaves altogether, and prepare their mordant from galls
and alum only,                by    first boiling the galls in due                             proportion
with the requisite quautity of water, then dissolving the alum
with boiling water in     separate vessel, afterwards pouring
                                         a
both liquors together into   tub, and suffering the cotton to
                                                    a
remain    them an hour,
            in            or an hour and half; after which                  a
it   is   dried      gradually,            then washed,                aud      again dried once
more.       By this process                     the      yarn acquires              a   dirty           reddish
colour.
     The   next part          of   the process                is   to prepare the madder dye.
The madder, ground                    to        a   line powder,         is    spread out           in    large
troughs, and into each trough                                 is   poured      a   large cup full of
sheep's blood, which                            the kind that can be procured                             with

the greatest          facility                  the dyers.            The          madder          must        be
strongly mixed           in    it               means         of    the hand, and then stand
ionic hour., m order to be thoroughly soaked                                            by   it.    The       li

     After this            process water is made hot in large kettles, fixed
in brick-work                   ; and as soon as                     it   is warm the prepared red
dye is put into                     it,     in   the    proportion of           pound to every
                                                                                       a
pound of cotton.                         The     dye        is   then suffered to boil strongly                    ;
and when            it     is   enough, which may be tried on cotton threads,
the fire        is   removed              from under the kettle, and the prepared
cotton         is   deposited near it.                       The          dyer places himself on the
edge      of    the      brick-work              that encloses the kettle                    ;    dips the cot
ton yarn, piece                     by   piece, into the dye                    ;    turns   it   round, back
wards and sorwards                        ;   presses        it   a       little with his hands           ;     and
lays each piece, one after the                                   other,         in   pails standing ready
for the purpose.                       As     soon as all the cotton has received the
first    tint,      it     is   hung up to dry                   :   as     the red, however,              is   still
too dull, the yarn which has been already dyed once, and be
come dry,             is    put once more into the dyeing-kettle, and                                         must;
be left there               to seethe for three hours over                               a    strong fire, by
which          it   acquires that b«autiful dark red colour which                                             is   so
much esteemed                    in      the Turkey              yarn.          The yarn          is   now taken
from the dye with sticks                          ;    the superfluous                 dye which adheres
to   it   is   shaken           off;      the hanks are put                     in   order, and hung up,
one after another, to dry.                                  When           it   is   thoroughly dry,          it   is
washed in the pure stream and again dried.                                                    The only fault
of      the     Astracan               dyers          is,    that the colour                   is      sometime*
brighter            and         sometimes              darker, probably                      because they do
not pay sufficient                       attention to the proportions,                                 or because
the madder                 isnot always of the fame goodness.

  some clean rags are pressed into their mouths, that the up
  permost skains    of yarn may not lie uncovered.    A   fire is then
  made in the sire-place below, and continued for twenty-four
  hours; and in the mean time the steam which arises from
  the jars is seen  collected among the rags in red drops. By
  this boiling the dye is still more heightened, and is made to
 strike completely ; every thing superfluous is removed, and all
 the fat matter which still adheres to the yarn is washed out           :
 nothing more is then necessary for completing the dye of the
 yarn but to rinse it well several times in running water, and
 then to dry it.
     That  the dye   of madder might   be made very penetrating
 by other methods, and through the means of other oiiy and
 resinous substances, is sliown by the process     of   the   Tungu-
 fians to dye horse', goat's and rein-deer's hair, which they
 use for ornamenting their dresses, of a beautiful red colour*
 by the roots of the cross-wort, or northern madder (gallium),
and narrow-leaved woodraof (aj'perula       tinfloria), which     have
a resemblance      lo those of madder.     They boil the fresh cr
dried roots with about the fame      quantity of agaric (agaricus
ojficinaruni),    which,    as is well known,     is  abundant       in
resinous gummy pnrticles, and is used by the people          of Jakut
instead   of  soap ;  they then lay in  it the white hair which
thev wish to dye, and suffer it to seethe flowly until           it  be
sufficiently red.
    Cotton cloth is dyed with madder at Afiracan in the fame
manner : but many pursue a fraudulent process, by dyeing
with red wood, and then fell their cloth        as that   which     has
been dyed in the proper manner.

all, or at least a number, of the colours which at present can
only be communicated                   to woollen.  We allude to the use
of     silh    oil and       sheep's    blood, both of which animal sub

     Mr. Vogler,            an able German chemist, after long and fre
quent trials to give to linen and cotton                      a lasting   black colour,
found that, to gain this end, it was previously necessary to
dip the yarn or stuss into a solution of glue in water, in such
proportion            as   to give to the water when warm, being tried
between         the singers, a sticky or glutinous                  consistence ; and
recommends that care be taken only to wring, not to wash
out the glue-water, part of which must be allowed to dry
upon the yarn.               Professor      Beckmann           has      noticed similar

                                           Assaying. By Pet. AC.

     demy of Sciences at Stockholm.
Oi'N          many occasions,          particularly in trying the fineness of
gold,    it    is    necessary to employ lead free from the mixture                     of
any other metal. For such experiments, above all, one must
not make use of lead which already contains gold or silver,
or both these metals, without knowing the quantity, which,
at all limes, occasions difficulty and often uncertainty. In
its natural           state lead,   for the most part,             is   found   so   mixed
                                                                                      with

  it                          Method          to   purify Lead for Assaying.
  with         these noble metals,                       that after being smelted if cannot
  be employed                   fur the above purpose ; and though there be
  lead ore which exhibits only a very few or no traces                                              of their
  presence,          and        in the first            case    the proportion must never be
  more than               a    quarter of           a   grain in the pound {mark),                     it    is
  exceedingly                 rare       in the common                   course   of mining         to find
 pieces        of    such a nature, and people often have not leisure to
 search         for them.                 As       I    have       sometimes         been exposed to
 great inconvenience                          for want of            a    proper piece        >f    lead,       I
 endeavoured                  to find out an easy method                  of procuring, with
 out      a   tedious process, such a                          quantity of pure lead as would
 be sufficient for the before- mentioned' test ; and as                                         I   do not
 remember to have heard of ite being any where described or
 employed,                I    have reason to think that an'account                           of it may
 be    of     some use, al least in the art                        of    assaying,    in case a more
 extensive application                        of   such a smelting process be not pos
 sible on a large scale, or                         if it   mould not be found profitable.
 When          one begins to reflect on this object, the first idea that
 occurs        is'   to       accomplish the end                    in    view,    by   dissolving      the.
 lead     in   an acid, and then precipitating either the lead or the
 finer metals         ;        but on closer examination there                          is   no process
 of this kind which will                           not be either too expensive,                 when        it
is    neccssaiy               to prepare           several pounds at once,                   or require
 longer t'me than one can possibly bestow. For these reasons
                                                         wag
I  gave up this method, and adhered to that only which
 performed meiely                        by   fusing     in    a   crucible with the aslisiance,
 of   a   requisite degree                of   heat.

before    I     proceeded further.                      I      then melted some ounces                  of
         with equal quantities of potash and tartar; but tho
litfiarrre

grain in the pound.           It was therefore of no use for proofs by
scoriflcution and for assaying ; and the principal point now
was to free the        litharge from its mixture.            This object       I
accomplished by        a  few meltings, in the followings manner :
   I  placed a crucible,        in which half      a  pound of litharge
found good room, and which was Cited with a close cover,
in a wind-furnace filled with dead coals. I then put into
the crucible a mixture             of four   ounces   of   potash    and the
fame quantity       of powder of flint.          When      the    whole was
well melted by strengthening the draught and making the
coals glow,    I took off the cover, and laid hold of me cruci
ble with    a pair of tongs, in order to take it out. and to suf
fer this very fusible glass to cover the inside of the crucible,
to secure it from the glass of the lead which I meant to
melt   in it.     The      superfluous     glass was    poured      out  ;  the
crucible    again placed on its foot,           and  half   a pound     of li
tharge thrown into it with           a (hovel.    The    cover was      placed
upon it while        the litharge was melting         j  and when       it was
thoroughly glowing and             fluid, charcoal dust was sifted into
the uncovered        crucible through       a  sieve, so   that the surface
of  the litharge was completely covered with it.                   This imr
mediately produced an effervescence, and the                 rising of bub
bles, by means of the             separation   of  the air occasioned        by
the reduction     of   the    lead.     During this     process    the   cover
was put on and        a few coals      thrown into the furnace        :  when
these were burnt every thing in the crucible was quiet, and
the melted mass was poured into a warm conical mould.
The crucible        was then again silled         with half a pound of
the fame     kind of litharge, and           put into the furnace, and
charcoal dust was several times sifted over the melted sur
face, till it was well covered before the mass was thrown
out, a sufficient space being every time left for the efferves
cence.     The   first mas* had, in the mean time, become cool,
and, on examination, contained four ounces of lead at the
bottom, and litharge at the top.               When this litharge was
induced with potash and crude tartar, the lead thence ob
                                                                       tained,

taincd, which weighed                                ounces, was found to contain lefi

then                       of       stiver in       the pound.             In     the second     mas»
there       was found                somewhat         more than fix ounces                    of lead,
which contained all the silver that had been before mixed
with the litharge, because in the lead which had been re
duced       from the                litharge in the above manner there were
no perceptible traces of silver.                                This      lead was then melted
over a slow fire, and cast into bars, which were rolled smooth
and formed into                     masses      of    a   known weight,               to be used for
assaying gold and silver, and for other purposes                                       of the fame
kind.       AH         thesemeltings were made in one crucible, which,
according              to every appearance, remained unhurt.    If the
fame experiments were made with red lead, the like result
would infallibly follow.
    The     cause        of this      process, and               of the     effects thence pro
duced,      is,   that when lead, which contains                            a     small quantity     of
stiver,    is    calcined and brought into the                            state    of litharge, the
stiver     in    it,
                   if     not scorified,             is   diffused       in infinitely       sin« par
ticles,     so   that    it    is   impossible       for   it    to fink through the melted
litharge         and settle at the bottom.                          When          the lead    calx   is
revived on the surface, the leaden grains,                                  as they are       formed,
fink down through                        the litharge, and                carry with them the
scattered grains               of     silver, in      so   far    as     this leaden mower,          if
I   may     so    name          compact and^powerful enough to col

a   calx   of     lead free from silver,                   when revived              by   tartar, ac
quires again, byjthe creation of new silver,                                         portion of that

thing of the like kind from the vegetable kingdom                                         ;    but on
this occasion    found no such effect produced.
                        I
                                      Second Experiment.
    With         the     same view os obtaining lead                          free from silver,      I
melted, in the like manner,                               half   a     pound of white            lead,
which       produced            half     an ounce          of    lead.      When       the litharge
standing over             it    was revived,                the lead obtained was still
                                                                                found

                  Method     to  purify Lead for Assaying.                    15
found to contain too much silver.                I  therefore     precipitated
another half pound of white lead by charcoal powder, after
the lead that fell from it had been separated                  ;   and then     it
produced, by reviving, a mass of lead without any mixture
of silver.
                             Third Experiment.
     Cupels, employed for refining silver,                 imbibe about the
 half of their weight of        lead calx.      One might therefore be
 lieve, that when this lead calx is revived it would produce
 lead free from silver.           Besides    the    observation     of others,
 which confirms        the contrary,     I have made        experiments with
 the ashes    of   such cupels      in which assaying had been per
 formed with the utmost accuracy              ;  but    I found   that the lead
 thence made into ingots contained sometimes more than one
 quarter of    a  grain of silver in the pound.              The   bone ashes,
 from which cupels are generally                cast, are,      by themselves,
 almost infusible      : and this, on account        of the   great number      of
  fluxes which must be employed to bring them to a fluid state,
  makes the fusion of them difficult and expensive.                    To four
  parts   of  sine pounded         cupel ashes,       1   put four     parts    of
  potash,   four parts of salt, three parts of tartar, and one part
  of clay, which mixed         together    produced, after being melted,
  lj part of lead,       making almost 44 parts in the hundred *.
  But this    still contained       the above-mentioned quantity of
  silver,  and could not therefore          be proper for the proposed
  end.
      As  the two    sirst-ment;oned       experiments will completely
   answer   the purpose,       it is perhaps       unnecessary      to seek    for
  other methods       ; as  it will be hardlv possible to find any            less
   complex, or easier to be put in practice.

                   as       part of this time, concerned
                         well   as been,
                                                      of clock         and watch-making
inan extensive manufactory of watches,    have had many                I
opportunities of observing  circumstance which has fur*
                                             a
prised every one in the trade as well as myself;                              that watches
of considerable price,           and from the hands                  of excellent work
men, often perform no better than                             a    plain one of inferior
workmanship and much lower price. Being anxious, as-may
naturally be supposed, to furnish my friends with watches or
clocks which would go well,                  I       made         it   my business to pay
particular     attention to whatever could contribute                                    to their
perfection.       With this view,            I       made almost numberless                     ex
periments and observations                  on the various escapements now
in   use, the different constructions                    of      balances,     pendulums,
pendulum springs and compensations, both for clocks and
watches, which have been applied                              by   very    ingenious me
chanics and excellent workmen                         to correct the errors in the
rate   of going,    especially       of watches,                 occasioned         by   the va
rious degrees of heat and cold, change of position, external
agitation, influence of oil, friction, variation                           of maintaining
power, and other causes.
     Some of these contrivances are extremely                              well adapted to
answer the intended            purpose      ;   but, notwithstanding all their
advantages,       the        maker and purchaser are frequently disap
pointed   in   the performance               of      the machine to which they
are applied.       Many         instances might be produced                     where the
best workmen have been employed,                              no expense            spared      by
the maker, and the above-mentioned improvements applied
with    the utmost           care and       attention        ;     and yet the           rate   of
going of the watch has been more irregular than in some
ordinary watche*.              When         such     a   circumstance occurs,
                                                                                            it

difficulties which the maker has to encounter, thinks himself
ill   used, and the latter suffers at the fame time in his repu
tation as an artist, and in his character as                     a   man    ; and     when
the watches happen to have been made for nautical purposes,
or for exportation, the whole community, in some measure,
become sufferers.
      The intention of           the present paper is to point out a defect
in    the    construction of time-pieces of every                      description in
which balances                are used,    and at the         same time a source            of
error in their performance,                    which has been hitherto little
if    at all suspected,         but which, where it occurs, completely
defeats all the ends intended to be answered by the applica
tion of the above-mentioned ingenious contrivances: and
that it does occur very frequently, will be made sufficiently
obvious by          a   simple detail      of   facts supported        by actual ex
periments.
      That    the balances          of watches, when manufactured                           of
steel, as they mostly are, might be in a small degree magnetic,
and consequendy have some influence in disturbing their
vibrations, has been suspected by some and denied by others :
but that       a   circular body, such as            a   balance     is,   should possess
polarity     ;     that   a   particular point in        it   sliould have        so strong
a                          and an opposite point an equal
      tendency to the north,
tendency to the south, as to be sufficient materially to alter
the rate         of going of           the machine         when put          in   different
positions,         has never,      I   believe, been even suspected.                   If   it
had,        the use     of steel balances would          have been laid aside long
ago, particularly where accurate performance was indispen
sable, as     in
           time-piecesfor astronomical and nautical purposes.
Though    have frequently examined, with great care, watches
             I
that did not perform well, even when no defect in their
construction            or finishing was apparent, and suspected the
balance to be magnetic, yet                     I    never   could have imagined
that this influence, operating                  as   a   cause, could produce               so
great       an effect as       I   sound   upon actual experiment                 ;   forI
did not expect to find that                a   balance, even when magnetic,

should have distinct poles.           Happening to have a watch in
my possession,           of excellent w&rkmanship, but which per
formed the most irregularly                      of any watch I had                    ever seen,
and having repeatedly                   examined every part with particular
attention,         without         being able to discover any cause likely
to produce such an effect, it put me upon examining whe
ther the balance might not be magnetic enough to produce
the irregularity observed in its rate of going.
  I took the balance out of its situation in the watch, and,
after removing the pendulum spring, put it into a poising
tool, intending to approach it with a magnet, but at a con
siderable distance, to observe                        the effect,        while at the fame
time the distance of the magnet should preclude the possibi
lity of       the magnetic virtue being thereby communicated to
the balance.             I    had      no sooner put it into the tool than                           I
                                                               it is,
observed it much out                of   poise ; that               the one       side appeared
to be heavier than the other                     :   but,     as        had been before ex
amined,        in   that particular,             by  a   very careful workman, more
than once,      I       was at     a   loss to determine what to                   think of th6
effect I      saw   ;   when happening to change the position of the
tool upon the board, the balance then appeared                                          to be       in
poise.        As    there could be no magic in the case,                           it   appeared
that the balance had magnetic polarity,                                  as    no other cause
could produce the effect                 T       had witnessed,             and    which       was
repeated as often as               I   chose to move               the tool from the one
position to the other.                  It   happened          that     I     was then sitting
with my         face to the south            :   a    circumstance that led me,                     in
placing the plane of the balance vertically,                                   to put   it   north
and      south,     and      of    course    the axis east              and west  the only
position in which                 the magnetic              influence could make itself
most apparent,               and which           will account for           the circumstance
not having been observed                      by the workman                   who examined
the    poiie of         the balance before               I    did   ;     for,    as   often   as
                                                                                                I
placed the plane              of    the balance vertically                 between      east   and
west     it   was in poise,            whichever end of its axis was placed
towards the south.
                                                                                         Naving

    Having pretty well                     satisfied myself as to the cause,                  I now
proceeded to determine the poUs                         of the balance.                With that
view    I   plated its axis in               a   vertical situation, and of course its
plane was horizontal                   ;   and   I was much        surprised to find that,
in lhat position, it possessed sufficient polarity to overcome
the friction upon its pivot ; for it readily turned on its axis
to place its north pole towards the north.                                Making a mark
on that fide that                I   might know             its north pole,   I then re
peatedly turned that point towards the south                                 ;   and, when left
at liberty, it as often resumed its former position, performing
a few vibrations before                      it quite       settled itself       in   its situation
and came to rest exactly as a needle would do                                        if suspended
in the      same manner.
    I   was extremely happy that                        I    had observed             these effecta
before       1   brought a magnet to make the experiment                                   I first   in
tended, as         I   might, and             as others also     might have concluded,
that the polarity had been produced by the approach                                            of the
magnet.           I now, however, brought                       a magnet into the (hop,
and, presenting its south pole to the marked fide, that                                          is,   to
the north pole of the balance, the balance continued at rest
but upon presenting the north pole to the marked place,                                                it ;
immediately                 rtceded from the magnet                 :   it   resumed          its for
mer position whenever the magnet was withdrawn.
   No doubt now remaining                              as to the facts, and being                      in
 possession of the position of its                     poles,  I   proceeded           to examine
the effects produced by this cause upon the watch's rate of
going.   Having put on the pendulum spring, and replaced
the balance in the watch,     laid the watch with the dial
                                                  I
upwards,  that    with the   is,
                           plane of the balance horizontally,
 and    in   such      a   position that the balance when at its place of                            rest
 should have its marked side toward the north                                :       in   this situa
 tion   it   gained         5'      in twenty- four hours.
                                   35"                        then changedI
 its position          so   that the marked side of the balance w hen at rest
 should be towards the south, and, observing its rate of going
 for the next twenty-sour hours,                             found   it   had lost          6' 48"
 producing,                by   its change of position               only,       a    difference       of
                                                   C   %                                             !»'

 la'  23*  in its   rate.       It must be obvious to every person, tltaf
even this difference,             great as it was,      would be increased or
 diminished      as the wearer should                happen to carry         in bis
waistcoat pocket a key, a knife, or other article made of
steel.    This circumstance, taken along with the amount of
the variation occasioned               by the polarity    of   the balance, was
fully  sufficient     to produce all the irregularity observed in the
going of the watch.
    I then took away the               steel  balance, substituted one made
of gold, and, having brought                 the watch to time, observed its
rate  of going,       and found it as uniform             as any watch       of the
like construction         ;   for, though it was        a  duplex escapement,
which    is perhaps         the best yet invented, at least for common
purposes,    it had no compensation for the expansion and con
traction occasioned by heat and cold, and therefore                      a  perfect
performance was not expected.                               »
    Steel balances being commonly in use, and, on that ac
count,    easiest    to be procured,           and being on many accounts
preferable to any other,                I was   unwilling     to abandon them
entirely  j but     resolved to take the precaution              of always trying
them before      I  should apply them to use.             The mode I adopted
was, to lay them upon              a  slice  of cork  sufficient    to make them
float upon water, and              I  was in hopes that out         of a consider
able number        I   might be able to select sufficient for my pur
pose ; but to my surprise, out                of many dozens which I tried
in this manner,         I    could not select one that had not polarity.
Some os them had it but in                a weak degree,     and not more than
one or two,      q<\\.  of     the    whole quantity,      appeared     to have it
so strong    as  the one which gave birth to                  these   experiments
and to the present paper, which is perhaps more prolix than
 could be wislied        :    but the subject appeared to be not unin
teresting,    and     I hope the remarks           1  have offered     will not  be
altogether    useless, as every thing that can tend to add                   lo the
perfectionof time-pieces, or to remove any cause that operates
against their perfection, is              of  some importance.

which I       at first studied for amusement                only, having never

a    demonstration, and         a   few diagrams to illustrate the fore
going experiments, and to cast some light on other branches
of this science particularly on the various escapements now

doing this     a   compensation for pendulums will be pointed out,

greater   improvements,          I    (hall look over my memorandums,
from among which              I    may perhaps be able to furnish you
with some,         on   a   variety of subjects,          for the amusement           of
your scientific readers.

      Physico-economique,                I793.
 AT       often happens that             people do not choose,                  or cannot
 employ oil-painting in the country, either because it does
 not dry soon enough and has an insupportable smell, or be
cause it is too dear.             M. Ludicke employed, with                    the greatest
success,       the
             following method for painting ceilings,                                    gates,
doors, and even furniture.
                                     The Process.
     Take     fresh curds,       the lumps on a grinding-
                                   and    bruise
stone or in an earthen pan or mortar with a
                                            spatula.    After
this operation, put them in a pot with
                                       an«equal quantity of
lime well quenched and become thick
                                     enough to be kneaded ;
stir this mixture well, without adding water, and
                                                     you will
soon obtain a white-coloured fluid, which
                                            may be applied
with as much facility as varnish, and which dries
                                                         very
speedily. But it must be employed the same day, as it will
become too thick the day following.
     Ochre,     Armenian bole,                and all colours        which hold with
lime, may       be mixed with             it,
                              according to the colour which
you with to give to the wood     but care must be taken that
                                                ;
the addition of colour made to the first mixture of
                                                     curds and
lime may contain very little water, else the
                                              painting will be
less durable.
     When two         coats    of this paint         have been laid on,         it    may be
polished with         a   piece    of woollen cloth or other proper sub-
stance, and  will become
                 it                      as   bright      as   vamisli.
                                                                            it It

that no kind of painting                 can be      so
                                                           cheap:    but            possesses,
besides, other advantages: in the fame
                                          day two coats may
be laid on and polished, as dries speedily and has no smell.
                                         it
If   it   be required to give       it   more durability,           in    places exposed
                                                                                            to

 VI.   On the Antiquity and Advantages of Encaustic Paintings

                           of the Proup employed in that Art by
    tbe Ancients. From a Treatise ent tied Antichita, Vantaggi

    Giov        Fabbroni,     See.         Ron. a, 1797.           Quarto.
  ITALY         is much indebted to the penetration                     of   the learned
Abbe Rcqueno for again bringing forward                              to the notice        of
modern painters wax-painting,                          spiitura encaujlaj           which
was forgotten, and considered                  as     entirely lost.
    The stimulus of curiosity always                      keeps alive and vigilant
that laudable ambition to which                        we owe the most valuable
discoveries      ; and   writers are ever ready to catch the new idea,
either to appropriate it to themselves,                         or at least to partici
pate in the honour            of     it.    By   the collision       of their various
attacks        on each other,         truth      is    thrust    forwards    so   as to   bo
more      distinctly     seen than before,                and     the discovery thus
acquires more value, and can be employed with more ad
vantage.
    No    sooner had Requeno,                whose merit entitles him to                  so
much praise, made known the result of his researches, than
a numerous body appeared to examine the advantages of                                     it,
or to (hare  the approbation bestowed on it.
                  in                           Some ex
plained the classics in         a     manner different from what he had
done, and others proposed methods which they considered as
superior.        Wax,    in   all probability,          forms the only ground             of
encaustic painting.             Requeno,            from his own ideas,              adds
mastic   ;     but Lorgna converts no                 less absolutely   his wax into
soap;     as   Bachelicr does with the alkali of (oda.                       The inge

less absolutely to add gmn and honey,                        as he      affirms that it
would render the wax                    far more yielding,         and much softer
for the brush.
     I
     contented myself with considering, in my closet, the re
sult of the laudable dispute of these able and meritorious
¦writers, and         thought       I    could clearly perceive           that none       of
them had come near enough to the mark, though each                                        of
them had done essential service to the art.
     Some of the ancient writers who have thrown                                    light on
this subject, among whom are Varro, Vitruvius, and Pliny,
expressly       ascribe      to the ancient painters               the   use    of Punic,
that is Carthaginian            wax.         It   was said lo be the best, as it
exceeded in whiteness               the Sardinian and Corfican; and the
reason of this probably lay in its being better purified ; for
the Africans, as Pliny tells us, were accustomed to use alkali
in order to render this substance whiter, and, in my opinion,
to free it from all greasy matter. It was then called Punic
wax, as Venetian tarpentine, soap, and wax, are now pre
scribed in books of receipts in order to signify the best ; and
 we must conclude,              if,
                          instead of considering the wax to
 have    been merely bleached, we convert                          it    into real soap,
 arising from the close combination of the wax with the alkali,
 that we change and pervert the meaning of these authors.
 The     idea     formed of the period of encaustic painting,
                which   I
 and the country where invented, was considerably different,
 and     I   have had       the pleasure          of finding      it   afterwards con
 firmed      by   experiments and facts.
     The knowledge            and use       of
                               encaustic painting  certainly                   is
 older than the time of the Greeks and the Romans, to whom
 the learned Rcqucno seems to assign the exclusive possession
 of this art because the Egyptians, who with the
                  ;                                 trufeans                   r
 were the parents           of the      greater part    of   the inventions           known
 among mankind,               and        from whom the            Greeks learned           so
 much, were acquainted with and employed encaustic paint
 ing in the ancient ages of their greatness and splendour, as                              is
 proved         by    the   valuable fragments               of   the    bandages        and
                                                                                    coverings

                         On Encaustic Painting.                               25
coverings of       a mummy painted in this manner, which, by
the favour       of our gracious prince,,        the noble patron and pro
moter       of   the arts and sciences,         is exposed to the view         of
every connoisseur,       in his elegant museum.               The  existence   of
wax on this Egyptian mummy may be discovered on a bare
view ; but I convinced myseif by other proofs of a less du
bious nature.
     Most of the mummies, however, preserved in collections,
 are painted with a size, which appears to be not unlike that
used      in paintings with   water colours (pittura a tempera) ; but
it is certain that the Egyptians differed               much in their orna
ments, and the bandages of the mummy above mentioned
are, on this account,           more valuable and more worthy of
notice.
     I   saw  in the British Museum        a mummy        which   was entirely
 covered       with  glassy   grains    ;  and the colour         of   some     of
 them gave me reason to conjecture that these ancient people
 were acquainted with the effects of cobalt in smalt, which
 has however been considered as             a   new invention.        I saw  an
 other mummy at Paris, which had formerly belonged to the
 celebrated       Count Caylus : among other singularities it had
 some ornaments of leaf gold upon a ground of chalk and
 bole, which is at present employed by the European gilders.
  In   the Royal Museum           at Florenee there        is,  besides others,
 one with gilding of the like kind and very lively colours. But
  I  will not    here enter into a panegyric          of the Egyptians,     who
  accomplished        so  great things,      and     much earlier than the
  Greeks or the Romans          ;  it will be sufficient to have shown, as
  a point unknown in the history of the arts, that these people
  practised encaustic painting, as appears beyond a doubt from
  the before-mentioned         fragment       :  but  I  will confess that this
  would be       a barren knowledge         if it   did not lead us to other
  useful researches.        I must observe, in the first place, that no
   oil-painting, perhaps of only two or             three hundred years old,
   exhibits a white paint that has kept               so well as that    seen   on
   the above fragment ; and this circumstance sufficiently proves
 .     .                                                                       the

 afi                              On Entau/tic Painting.
 the valuable advantage that method has over the common
 oil-painting, which, notwithstanding                             the       general opinion,
 cannot have been unknown to the ancients                             ;   for, besides olive-
 oil, they      were acquainted with that                   of    sesamum, turpentine,
 cedar, and nut oils.               It   is impossible that in              Egypt    and Ph
 nicia, where           so    much       use   was made           of flax, the oil pro
 cured in abundance from that plant should have been un
known.            Those who have kept oil, or who have                               spilt any
 of    it,   whether nut or lintseed oil, must have remarked that
it    possesses    the property of soon drying                       by   the effects of the
 atmosphere       ;     and    therefore       it    may be easily believed                     that
mankind must soon have conceived the idea of employing
 it,particularly for ships, which, as Herodotus fays, were
painted with red ochre in the earliest periods, and adorned
with     figures and ornaments.                     The    use    of oil afforded paint
ing    a     much simpler and easier method than that of wax                                  ;   it
must         therefore have been first adopted, and the                              transition
from oil to wax must be considered                          as   a   step    towards bring
ing    the art to perfection          ;    because         encaustic        painting       is   not
exposed to the irremediable inconveniencies                                 that arise in       oil-
painting, the value               of which         we extolled through ignorance,
aud praised        as   a    new invention.
   Oil in general,            and        drying oil which the
                                     in particular
painters use, has naturally     strong inclination to combine
                                               a
itself with the vital air or oxygen of the atmosphere, and                                         by-
imbibing oxygen              it   becomes          dry, and assumes the character
of resin; but the colour then                      becomes       darker,       as   is   the cafe
with transparent turpentine, which gradually                              becomes        a   black
pitch.
  According           to the new and more accurate                          method       of   de
composing bodies, oil consists principally                            of hydrogen             and
carbon.    By coming into contact with the atmosphere, and
absorbing its oxygen and light,   undergoes! flow and im

                                                      is
from the speedy and violent one which                        it   would undergo in the
common mode of burning.                        It    first passes,    by    imbibingoxy-

continuance ot the before-mentioned                              flow combustion the
carbon itself, as it were, b'Jinsalso                   :    is it     be strongly acted
upon by the light, it attr.ic la the oxygen os the atmosphere,
and again brings forward the carbonic acid or fixed air,                               which
gradually flies   oss.  By this, which I may call the second
degree      of combustion, the painting must become dusty and
triable,     like crayon painting               (il   pofietio)      ;   a   phenomenon
which may            be clearly perceived             on the oil-paintings               ge
nerally employed to cover wood and iron-work, that they
the better withiiind the atmosphere.
     The    ashes,    oxydes, or calces              of metals, which             are often
used as paints, are nothing else than metals actually brought
to   a   burnt or saline
                    state   different doses of oxygen.
                                      by               When
the oil, during the time of the before-mentioned combustion,
deprives them of some part of their oxygen         mean of its           by
well-known affinity,           the metal again proportionably assumes
its natural       state   and colour       ;   and    as the calces or ashes              of
the iron, and particularly white lead, return to their former
metallic chpracter, they become, in various ways, black,
by the loss ot the oxygen, which, as    well known,     drawn
                                                            is                    is

when strong.
  It     appears from the preceding theoretical observations, that
one can hope only for             a   transient or deceitful effedt from the
refreshing oi oil-painting* with oil, because the harmony of
the tones, which the painter establilhes as suited for the mo
ment, does not proceed with equal steps, and cannot preserve
itself in the like measure for the course of                     a   few years, as each
tint,    u they fay, ought        to increase, or, to speak more properly,
to burn     in   proportion to its antiquity.                It   thence follows, that
                                                                                       mere

the method of refreshing paintings,                      as it is      called, by daub
ing    over the surface from time to time with new drying                                   oil,   is
highly prejudicial           and   ill   calculated for the intended purpose,
since the oil when           it    becoms dry contracts in its whole sur
face, carries with           it   the paint under           it,   and occasions             ciacks
in   the painting.          New oil of this kind              gives occasion                to mi
neral paints to be restored              ;      but covers the picture                   with      a
new coat of resin, and then of carbon, which arises from the
gradual combustion, and always causes more blackness, and
the decay of the painting                      which    one       wishes      to preserve.
Wax, on        the other hand, undergoes                 a    change which               is   very
diflorent from that of drying oil.                      The wax,            instead      of      be
coming black           by   the contact         of   the atmosphere, increases                     in
whitness, and, according to its natural quality,                             is   not decom
posed       in the air, and        it   does not strongly attract the oxygen
of   the calces    or metallic ashes which are commonly used in
painting.       Moreover, the             so   called earths, which are                in   them
selves white, and are never variable either                            by   the presence or
absence      of oxygen,      ^cannot be employed
                                                                  in   oil-painting,             be

them to remain          as   it   were without body (corpo),                       and not to
produce the wistied-for effect.                      That beautiful white, which
may be observed on the before-mentioned Egyptian encaus
tic,   is    nothing    else      than    a     simple earth,          and according to
my chemical experiments                   a    chalk (creta), which                is   also un
alterable.        If we     consider this encaustic               fragment as belong

closedin wooden cases, which were more or less ornamented.
Many are of opinion, that an expression of the bishop of Hippo
gives reason to assert that the people in Egypt continued to
prepare mummies even till the fifth century ; but it must be
observed that the Egyptians then had adopted                             the   Christian
religion       ;    that   they no longer used hieroglyphlcal                     inscrip
tions, which in the time of Apuleius were said to be unin
telligible and forgotten ; and that it was not mummies which
were prepared              then,    but gabbara,          as St. Augustine fays           in
his Orations,              that    is,   dead     bodies dried after the manner
of mummies.                   If   Bochart and Menage be not mistaken,
the name mummiu                    is    derived     from maim,        which      signifies
wax       :   and    one might therefore believe                    that the dress of
embalmed bodies                   was    thus named         because      wax was em
ployed for painting                 it   ;   and thence     it   would follow, that
the fragment in question may be classed among the oldest.
    Mummies,               since the earliest periods         of   the Egyptian cere
monies, were exposed to                      a   vark-iy of situations   ;   for on cer
tain occasions they were taken up from the subterranean
repositories          in which they were deposited,                 and placed in the
highways, or at the                doors of       the bouses.      On other occasions
they were carried into the halls where entertainments were
 celebrated,          and     they were also given as pledges of fidelity
 in various transactions.                                                                     «
    After the fall of Egyptian grandeur,                           the mummies were
 left buried aud neglected in dark vaults, amidst                          a   damp foil,
 from         which they           were drawn          forth only at     a   late period,
  by by
          European curiosity, in order to ornament collections, or
          the avarice of the Mahometans,                        who hoped         to    make
 them an article of gain.

clothing.           I
                  can assign no other cause for the fragment in
question ;     and this would enhance the value of    and render                   it,
more important, as well as more useful, its great antiquity,
and the beautiful painting to be seen on it.
  In all probability the ancients,                          as
                                                             I    have already said, were
once acquainted with the                         use    of oil-painting,                 and   lost or
neglected      it       afterwards,        so   that   it   was perhaps employed only
sometimes           by   a   few.
     Petronius praises the fresh appearance which the valuable
works        of Zeuxis          and       Apelles       had, even in his time                  ;   but
Cicero, on the other hand,                         speaks        of   the paintings            of the
ancients having suffered from blackness. The former speaks
of wax painting,               and the latter certainly alludes to painting*
in oil.       It   is    well known that paintings with wet chalks                                  of
water colours do not become black                                by   age,    and that this         is
the cafe also with encaustic.                               Of this any one may                     be
convinced,              not only by the expressions of the above quoted
authors, but by one's own eyes on surveying the Egyptian
fragment alluded to.                      Galland proves,              on various grounds,
that     a   painting was             made with oil              so   early as the reign of
Marcus Aurelius                ;    and   if    no specimens of that period have
reached       us,       this   is   perhaps       to    be ascribed               to the frail and
perishable nature of this species of painting.
     Theoldest oil-painting now in existence,                                as   far as  I    know,
is   a   Madonna          and child on her arm with an eastern counte
nance.       It    has marked on            it   the date, which              is   thus expressed
3CCCI.XXXVJ.                   If   we express these with               Arabic characters,
it would make, in my opinion, 886, and the period of this
piece would fall about the time of Bafiliti* or Charlemagne.
This singular             and valuable painting, found in the old palace
(palazzo vtcebio) of the Florentine republic,    preserved at                      is

VII. Method of discovering whether Wine            hat been adulterated"
     with any Metals prejudicial      to the  Health. By   M. HAN HE-
     MANN.       From Bibliotheque Phyfico-economique.
   J. HE   property which liver      of sulphur (alkaline sulphurets)
 and hepatic air (sulphurated hydrogen)            possess  of precipita
 ting lead in a black form, has been long ago made public ;
 and this property has been employed to determine the qua
 lity of wines by means of          the liquor probatorius      Wirtem-
 bergenfis,    or Wirtemberg proving liquor.
     But, in trying wines    supposed to have been adulterated, this
 proof does more hurt than service, because it precipitates iron
 of the fame colour as the pernicious lead. Many wine-mer
 chants therefore      of the  greatest respectability,     rendered    by
  these means suspected,       have been ruined.
     There was wanting then a re-agent, which should discover
  in wine those metals only which are prejudicial to the
  health of man.
     The following liquor precipitates lead and copper in a
  black form, and arsenic of an orange colour, Sec. but does
 not precipitate iron.        The  last,    which is not noxious,     and
  rather salutary to the constitution, frequently gets into wines
  by accident.
              Method of preparing the Proving Liquor:
      Mix  equal   parts   of oyster shells     and crude    sulphur in a
  fine powder,     and put the mixture into        a crucible.    Heat it
                                                                         in

in   a wind furnace,        and increase the fire suddenly,           so as  to
bring     the crucible to a white heat, for the space              of fifteen
minutes.       Pulverise the mass when it is cool, and preserve
it in a bottle    closely stopped.
     To prepare    the liquor,      put 120 grains of this powder and
 1 20 grains of cream of tartar (acidulous tartrite of pot
ash) into a strong bottle ; fill the bottle with common water,
which boil for      an hour, and then let it cool ; close the bottle
immediately,       and     shake    it for  some time : after      it has   re
mained at rest to settle, decant the pure liquor, and pour it
into    small phials capable         of holding about an ounce each,
first putting    into each        of them 20 drops of muriatic acid.
They must be        stopped very closely with a piece             of wax, in
which there is      a small mixture        of turpentine.
     One part of this liquor mixed with three parts of sus
pected wine, will discover, by a very sensible black precipi
tate,    the least traces of lead, copper, &c. but will produce
no    effect upon iron,      if it contains any of that metal. When
the precipitate has fallen down,                 it may   still be discovered
whether the wine contains iron, by saturating the decanted
liquor with      a   little salt    of tartar (tartareous acidulum of
potash), by which the liquor will immediately become black.
     Pure wines remain clear and bright after this liquor has
been added to them.

     No other ancient writer, however,                             makes any mention               of
this great year          ;    but     Pliny in his Natural                  History      relates,
that Hipparchus had fixed the course us the sun and moon
at six hundred years ;                    which        seems to         refer to a period          of
that duration        :       and it is to he conjectured,                  that it was esta
blished by the ancients in order to compare the course                                       of the
moon with that of the sun, and to foretel for a considerable
time beforehand the phases of the moon.
     This, indeed,            was     one        of    the     principal        objects of the
ancient astronomy.                   Mcto invented                 the period of ninetceu
years,    because he believed                    that nineteen tropical solar years
made exactly 235                lunar months.                 Calippus quadrupled this
period, and made a new one                            of 76   years.      Hipparchus qua
drupled these 76 years, and by these means obtained a more
accurate period of 304 years.
  Now it may be readily supposed, that Hipparchus,                                           in the
hopes     of deviating          still less from the truth, at length doubled
his period, and brought it to 608 years : for, otherwise, why
should he have fixed his period even at 600 years ?
     According           to every conjecture, the great year is nothing
else   than the last doubled period of Hipparehus                                 ;   for though
Pliny    and his contemporary Josephus speak in round num
bers of 600 years, or six centuries, yet                                we know        that ma
thematical accuracy is not always observed in the language
of common life and of historians.
     Mr. Bailly explains                  the period          of   six hundred        vears in a
manner           totally different.               That        astronomer        finds, like all
those conversant              with the subject,               that 600 solar years form
no whole number of lunar months without                                     a   fraction     :    but
as     that would            be the       cafe    if the      year were assumed a little
longer,     as    it really         is,   he hence concludes that the year                         in
ancient times             was actually            so    long       as   the precision        of   the
period of 600 years                  requires;          and beside;, that those                  ages

produced very able and expert astronomers, who discovered
this period by an astonishingly long series of observations.
In this manner         every period,       however assumed at pleasure,
might      be justified.       It would     be only necessary to reckon
what lenoth of year it would require               ;  to assume a certain
acceleration in the revolution of the earth                  ; to  determine
thereby at what time the year had the requisite                      length    ;
and then to be astonished how accurate mankind                        were in
their astronomical calculations at that period.
   The      reader   may determine between both these explana
tions.      It might      still be supposed,     that the ancients really
had   a  period   of exactly 600      years, neither more nor less, and
that they deduced it from           a false  determination of the length
of  the    year.     But this would not agree well with the                rest
of their known periods.

JL  HAVE        for a   long time remarked         in different kinds of
sponge     (j'pongi<rJ,    particularly     the fpongia villosa,      and all
tough     sea   sponges,      and even the commonest sponge              em
ployed in bathing-houses, when not too much used, certain
remains of irritability, which, in these bodies kept                  so loner
out  of their own element, cannot be considered but                   as me
chanical.        If  the above sponges          be soaked in      cold water
until   they extend       to  their full magnitude, and hot water be
poured over a part, or the whole of them, they instantane
ously contract themselves,           particularly in the irritaled part,
with   a   wonderful velocity and force,           as  if alive.    As soon,
however,       as the  irritation of the heat ceases,        they  again ex
tend so    their former size. This experiment may be repeated
with    a sponge,      until its    whole consistence       and texture are
destroyed      by the hot water.       An accidental observation made
                                                                            oil

 W,HEN          we reflect on the rapid progress           which has been
of   late made in most branches         of natural knowledge, and
particularly in chemistry and mineralogy,               and consider how
much these may be facilitated by a competent knowledge                     of
 those regular forms      which   all mineral aud saline substances
assume, in certain circumstances         ;   it appears surprising that,
 though we have a number of books which treat on chemis
 try, we have not one Englisti work on the theory of the
 structure of crystals.       To  remedy        this defect in some de
 gree, and    as an  introduction to original papers on the sub
ject promised     to us by an eminent mineralogist, we think
 proper to lay before our readers the following translation of
      The Abbi    Hauy's Theory of Crystallization.                From
             Vol. XVII. of the Annales deChimie.
    I GAVE      in this Journal, some years ago,           a short  account
 of   the theory    of crystallization     ;   but   that   paper may be
 considered   only  as a  sliort sketch, and more calculated for
 those who wish not to be entirely ignorant                of the subject,
 than for those desirous of becoming             thoroughly acquainted
 with its principles and results.       In    the present     paper   1 pro
 pose to afford the latter au       opportunity       of obtaining their
 object, by presenting them with the theory required, and
 with all  the facts necessary     lo give them        a  just idea of the
 laws to which it is subject, and of the progress by which it
has been carried to such       a degree    of generality, that       an  im-

arranged,     as  if of themselves,     around    a single   one on which
they depend, and which serves to connect them all by mutual
relations.
    I confess,   however, that this theory can be well understood
only by the help of analytical calculations*,                  resides the
advantage which analysis has of involving in the fame for
mula the solutions of an infinite             number of different pro
blems, it alone can give to the theory             the character     of abso
lute certainty,       by producing       results perfectly agreeable         to
those we receive from observation.
    Notwithstanding         these considerations,     I thought it would
be belter for those unacquainted             with the science of calcu
lation,    if I   adhered      to simple reasoning, accompanied             by
geometrical figures, which are so useful in assisting the ima
gination to conceive the arrangement of those small solids
that concur to form a crystal,            but which      were wanting to
the first paper.
    This arrangement          I  czWstruclure,   as opposed     to the term
organization, which           expresses the far more compound me
chanism of animals and plants.
    If this  procedure      be less   direct, less  expeditious, and      less
precise j and       if   it requires us to attend        to   those    details
which     algebra      passes   over in order to conduct us speedily
to its   object, it is at least attended           with this     advantage,
that the mind by its means perceives better the connexion of
 the different parts of the whole under its consideration.

    It is known that the fame mineral substance is susceptible
 of  many different forms well defined, some of which do not
 present, on the first view, any common point               of resemblance
 that  seems to indicate their relation.             If  we compare,        for
example, calcareous spar in a regular               hexaedral     prism  with

   101 J°,        we shall, at first, be inclined             to believe that each           of
   these two forms is entirely foreign to the other.                               But that
   point of union which escapes our notice, when we confine
   ourselves lo the consideration of the exterior form, becomes
   sensible when we penetrate                   into the internal mechanism                  of
  the      structure.         Let    me    here     then be       permitted        to trace
   thing? from their origin, by relating how the observation
  from which I set out, and which has become the key of the
   whole theory, first presented itself to my mind.
       I  was holding in my hand a hexacdral                       prism    of   calcareous
  spar, similar to            the one     I   have      mentioned, and which had
  fallen from          a group of which             it formed      a part.      The      frac
  ture presented            a very smooth          surface, situated obliquely, like
  the trapezium            pfu     t  (Jig.    1), and which made an ancle                   of

psu       *,and       assisted by the strokes            of   a   hammer.           This attempt
was fruitless;                 but having tried the               fame operation towards
the-     following edge be,                 I   uncovered         a new    trapezium similar
to the first.              The fourth           edge a b resisted the instrument like
the second            ;    but the next one              a b yielded          easily to the me
chanical division, and presented                          a   third trapezium of                 as    fine
a polissi        as       the other two.            It   is almost      unnecessary to add,
that the          sixth edge           *   b remained indivisible, like the fourth
and the second.
     I   then proceeded to the inferior                       base    d esgk r,          and obser
vation proved to me that the edge* of this base, which admit
ted sections like the preceding, were not the edges                                        ef,   dr,gi,

This       section          is    evidently       parallel to that            of   the trapezium
fsu       t,   and        in   the like manner the four other trapeziums are
parallel two to two.                       But these different sections                    being          in
the direction of the natural joining of the lami.iæ,                                        I         easily
succeeded to obtain more sections                             parallel to each of them,
while      it   was impossible                     in any other

 by      twelve pentagons, parallel two to two,                            of which          those at

results     of    the mechanical division,                        and   had        their common
vertices        O,        F,   situated    in   the centres       of the      bases   of   the prism
(Jg.       1).        The       six lateral      pentagons         RSUXY, ZYRIG,                        8cc.

the triangles      YIZ, UXY,          &c. {Jig. 3).        Beyond that term
the sections happening to             pass over the surface       of   these tri
angles     diminiflied      gradually their extent, until, at length,
these triangles were lost ; and then the solid which arose
from the hcxaedral prism became                 a rhomboid      a c  {fig. 4) en

     A  result so unexpected        made me immediately conceive the
idea os subjecting the other calcareous cryltals                    to the fame
proof;      and all yielded to the mechanical division in such a
manner, that, when the external faces had disappeared,                          the
kind of nucleus which remained under the instrument was
still a rhomboid of the fame form as the first.                         The only
thing necessary          was   to   find    the   direction    of   the   sections
 which conducted to the central rhomboid.
     To extract, for example, this rhomboid from                         that spar
called commonly the lenticular, and which is                      a  much more
obtuse      rhomboid,       having      its   great   plane angle equal           to
 H40     18'  56', it was       necessary to begin at the two vertices,
 making the sections          pass    through the      lesser  diagonals of the
 faces.      If it  were wistied,      on the contrary, to get at the nu
 cleus of the rhomboidal spar with acute vertices*, it would
 be necessary to direct the sections               of the planes       parallel   to
 the edges adjacent lo the vertices, and in such a manner
 that c'ach of them should be equally inclined to the planes
 it cuts.
     These results are the more worthy of attention,                   as it would
  at first   seem     that crystallization, after having once adopted
  the rhomboid, in regard to one determined species of mine
  ral, ou^ht always to re-produce it with the (ame angles. Rut

   the course  of  the present article.

  the paradox arising from this diversity                 of   appearance       is ex
  plained bv the double          use    of  the    rhomboidal        form, which
  serves   here to disguise itself,        and which          conceals    fixed    and
  constant     characterising marks under a variable outside.
      If we take a crystal          of another nature,          such as a cube       of
  fluor spar, the nucleus will have                  a  different form.          This,
  in the present case, will be an octaedron, to which we (hall
  arrive by taking ossthe eight solid angles of the cube. Heavy
  spar will produce, for nucleus, a right prism, with rhomboidal
  bases  ;   feld spar an oblique-angled parallclopipedon, but not
  rhomboidal *        ;  the apatite or beryl a right hexacdral                prism ;
  the adamantine spar          a   rhomboid,        a  little sharpened      ;   blend
  a  dodecaedron, with rhomboidal planes ; iron of the island
  of Elba,    a  cube, &c. and each of          these    forms will be constant
  in regard to the whole species,            so that its angles       will undergo
  no variation of importance             ;  and   if an    attempt    be made        to
 divide the crystal in any other direction, we shall not be able
 to find    a  joining.       Nothing will be obtained but undefined
 fragments       :  in  a  word, it will be broken rather than divided.
     These solids, inscribed, each, in all the solids of the fame
 species, ought to be considered              as   the     real   primitive forms
 on which all the other forms depend.                       All minerals, I       con
 fess, are not susceptible         of being divided mechanically,                  but
 there    a greater       number than         I  at first thought;         and with
 regard to those crvltals          which     have hitherto resisted          my ef
 forts to find their natural joinings,            I  have remarked that their
 surface,     striated in a certain direction, or the relation               of their
 different forms among those which belong to the same sub
 stance, often present indications of their structure ; and that,
 reasoning from their analogy with                    other divisible crystals,
we may determine that               structure     at least with        great      pro
bability.
     I call secondary forms all those that differ from the primi
tive form.         We shall see, hereafter, that the number of these

  cording to the laws to which the structure of crystals is sub
 jected.
      The   solid   of  the primitive form, obtained by means                     of the
  operation above explained, may be subdivided                        in a direction
  parallel to its different faces            :   all  the enveloping matter is
  equally divisible by sections parallel to the faces of the pri
  mitive form.         It thence follows that            the parts      detached      by
  the help    of  all these sections are similar, and differ only                     in
  their bulk, which continues to decrease in proportion                          as the
  division is carried still further.              We, however,           must except
  those which are near to the faces                of  the secondary solid ; for,
  these faces not      heinj      parallel   to those    of   the primitive form,
 the fragments which              have one     of their      facets    taken    in the
 fame faces cannot entirely resemble those detached                           towards
 the middle      of  the crystal.       For   example, the fragments             of the
  hexaedral    prism      (fig.   1), the external        facets   of which       make
 part of the     bases     or of the planes, have not, in that respect,
 the same figure        as those      situated     nearer     the centre, and of
 which      the    facets      arc  all parallel      to the      sections   p  su     /,
 I qy v, &c.          But theory,         as   I  sliall show, removes all the
 embarrassment          which,       on the first view, arises from                that
 diversity,   and reduces the whole :o an unity                    of figure.
     But the division of the crystal into small similar solids has
 a term beyond which we stiould come to particles so small,
 that they could no longer be divided without analysing them ;
 that is to fay, without destroying the nature of the substance.
 I  stop at that term         ;  and I give to the corpuscula             we should
insulate, if our organs and instruments were sufficiently
delicate, the name of integral mnhncla.                        It is very probable
that these moleculæ are those which were suspended                             in the
fluid in which           the crystallization          was effected.         But my
readers     may judge for themselves.                    We may, however,
with truth, assert that, by the aslistance of these moleculæ,
theory reduces to simple laws the different metamorphoses                            of

crystals, and arrives at results         which exactly represent         those
os nature  ;   and this is the      only end I proposed.
    When   the nucleus is a parallclopipedon,               that is to fay, a
solid with fix parallel faces,         two to two, like the cuhe, the
rhomboid,     Sec.  and this solid does not admit              of any other
divisions than those made in the              direction of the faces, it is
evident that the moleculæ resulting from subdivision, both
of  the nucleus and       of  the enveloping matter, are similar to
the nucleus.     In other    cafes the form of the moleculæ differs
from that of the nucleus.            There are also crystals which, by
help of the mechanical division, yield particles                 of different
figures, combined together           throughout the whole extent             of
these crystals.      I  shall explain hereafter         my conjectures on
the manner of resolving             the difficulty      presented    by   these
kinds of mixed structures         ;  and it    will  be seen that this diffi
culty does not affect the theory at bottom.
                       II.  Laws of Diminution.
    I. Diminution       at the edges.
    The primitive form          and     that   of   the integral moleculæ
being determined, after the dissection               of the crystals,   it was
necessary    to discover      the    laws according         to  which     these
moleculæ were combined to produce, around the primitive
 form, those species of envelopes, terminated              so  regularly, and
 from which resulted polyedra            so different from each other;
 though originally       of  the    same substance.          But such is the
 mechanism of the structure subject to these laws, that all the
 parts of the secondary         crystal,     superadded     lo the nucleus,
 arc formed   of laminæ,      decreasing regularly by the subtraction
 of one or more           ranges     of integral moleculæ ; so that
 theory determines the         number of these ranges, and, by a
 necessary    consequence,       the     exact    form of the       secondary
 crystal.
    To give an    idea  of  these laws,     I  shall first make choice      of a
  very simple and very elementary example.                   Let  us conceive
                                                                            EP

E P (fig. 5)       to represent     a dodecaedron,     whose      faces   are
equal    and similar rombuses; and that this dodecaedron                 is a
secondary      form, which has     a cube  for its nucleus pr primitive
form.      The position of this       cube   may be easily conceived
by inspecting;    fig. 6, where it is seen that the small diagonals
DC, CG, GF, FD, of the four faces of the dodecaedron,
united around the fame solid angle L, form a square, CDFG.
But    there arc six solid angles composed          of  the four planes,
viz.    the angles     L, O, E, N, R, P, (fig.          5)  ;   and, conse
quently,     if sections are made to pass through the small diago
nals of the faces which concur to the formation of these
solid angles, we shall successively uncover six squares,              which
will   be the faces of the primitive cube, and three              of which
are represented       (fig. 6), viz. CDFG, ABCD,             BCGH.
    This   cube would evidently be an assemblage                 of integral
cubic molcculæ, and it would be necessary               that each of the
pyramids, such        as  LDCGF (fig. 6),       which    rest  on the faces,
 mould itself be composed          of  cubes equal to each other, and
 to those forming the nucleus.
    To make it more         apparent    how this might take         place,   I
 shall point out the means        of making   an artificial dodecaedron,
by employing        a certain number of small cubes, the assortment
of which will        be an imitation     of that of the moleculæ         em
 ployed    by nature in the formation          of  the dodecaedron         we
 are here considering.
    Let    ABGF (fig.        7)  be a cube     composed       of  729   small
 cubes equal to one another, in which cafe each face of the
 whole cube will contain 81 squares, nine on each side, which
 will  be the external faces     of as many partial cubes, representa
 tives   of inolecuix.      The cube in question will be the nucleus
 of  the dodecaedron        which we propose to construct.
     On   one of the     face,  such as   ABCD      of this cube, let us
 apply a square lamina           composed     of  cubes    equal    to those
 which form       the nucleus, but which towards each edge has a
 range    of cubes less than if it had been on a level with the
 adjacent faces BCGH, DCGF, 8cc. Tim is to fay, let this
                                                                      lamina

   44                         Theory   of Crystallization.
   lamina be composed only of 49 cubes,                  7  on each side, in such
   a manner that         if its inferior  base be   0  nfg     (fig. 8),   that base
   may fall exactly on the square marked by the same letters
   CÆr-7).
      Above this first lamina let us apply                a second composed        of
   25 cubes, five on each side, so that              if I m   p u  (fig.  9) repre
   sent its lower base, this base may be found situated                      exajtly
  above the square designed by the same letters                      (Jig. 7).
      Let   us,   in like manner, apply             a  third lamina upon the
  second ; but containing only 9 cubes, three on each fide, so
  that   v  xy   z   (Jig-     10) being the inferior base, this base may
  correspond        with       the square marked by the same letters,
  (Jig. 7).      Lastly, on the middle square r, in the preceding
  lamina, let us place the small cube r                 (Jig.    Ji),   which    will
 represent the last.
      It may    be easily seen that by this operation we (hall have
  formed upon the face             ABCD (Jig.       7)    a  quadrangular pyra
 mid, of which this face will be the base, and which will have
 the cube     r (Jig.       11) for its summit.       If we   continue the same
 operation on the other five faces of the cube (fig. 7) we shall
 have, in all, six quadrangular pyramids, resting on the fix
 faces    of  the nucleus,          which they will envelop on all sides.
But     as the   different courses or laminæ which compose                     these
 pyramids project beyond                 each   other   a   certain quantity, as
may be seen        jig. 2, where the parts elevated above the planes
                           1
BCD,        BCG represent the two pyramids which rest on the
faces    ABCD, BCGH (Jig. 7),                    the faces      of  the pyramids
will    not form continued planes             :  they   will   be alternately re
entering and salient            ;  and   in some measure will imitate a
pyramidal ascent of steps, which presents four faces (cfculier
a quatre faces)        .
     Let   us now suppose that the nucleus is composed                        of an
incomparably larger number of cubes, almost imperceptible,
and that the laminæ, applied               on the different faces, which           I
shall in suture call laminæ             of superposition, go on increasing
towards their sour edges,              by subtractions of one range of
                                                                              cubes

                      Theory     of Cryjlallization.                     45
cubes equal to those        of  the nucleus,      the number       of  these
laminæ will be found incomparably greater than in the pre
ceding hypothesis ; at the fame time the cavities (cannelures)
which they will form, by the alternate sallying and re-enter
ing of their edges, will be scarcely             sensible ; and    we   may
even suppose the composing cubes so small that these cavities
will    become imperceptible to our fenses, and              that the faces
of    the pyramids will appear perfectly smooth.
     Now    DCBE         {fig, 12) being the pyramid resting on
 the face    A  B C D {fig. 7), and C B O G {fig. \i) the py
 ramid applied on the neighbouring face BCGH {fig. 7), if
 we consider that every thing is uniform from E to O {fig. 12)
 in the manner in which the edges of the laminæ of superposi
 tion mutually project beyond each other, it will readily be
 conceived that the face C E B of the first pyramid ought
 to be found exactly in the same plane as the face                C 0 B of
  the   adjacent pyramid,        so  that the assemblage of these two
  faces   will form    a  rhombus E C O B. But for the six py
  ramids we      had    twenty-four        triangles, similar to      CEB,
 which, consequently, will be reduced to twelve rhombuses,
  from which will result a dodecaedron similar to that repre
  sented {fig. 5 and 6) ; and thus the problem is resolved.
      The cube,   before it arrives at the form          of   the   dodecae
  dron,   passes through     a  multitude      of intermediate modifica
   tions, one of which is represented^^.            13.    It may be there
   seen that the squares     p a   e 0,  klqu,    m n t s, &c. correspond
  to the squares    A   B  C D, D C G F, C B H G, &c. (fig. 6)
   and form the superior bases        of as many pyramids, incomplete
   for want of the laminæ by which they ought to be termi
   nated.    The rhombuses          EDLC, ECOB,               he. {fig. 5),
   by a necessary consequence           are reduced    to simple hexagons

   the secondary     crystal   is composed of twelve of those hexa

 law  of d ecrease,   to be spoken      of hereafter.
    If the   decrease   of  the laminae     of  superposition     took place
 according to     a more rapid law ;       if  each lamina for example
 had had on its circumference two, three,                or four ranges      of
 cubes less than the inferior         range, the pyramids produced
 around the nucleus, by this decrease, being more lowered,

       From tbe Transactions of the Manchester Society.
                       [IVitb   a Plate, No.      III.]
AFTER           examining      the works     of different authors who
have written on the subject          of making iron        and steel,    I  am
persuaded that the accounts given by them                 of  the necessary
processes and operations are extremely imperfect.                  Chemists
have examined and described the various compound                       mine
rals containing, iron with great accuracy, but have been                   less
attentive to their reduction.            This   observation    more parti
cularly applies to steel, of the making             of which I      have not
seen any     correct account.       It is singular to observe how very
imperfectly the cementation of iron has been described by
men os great eminence in the science of chemistry.                     Four-
croy   states  the length    of time    necessary for the cementation
                                                                             of

os iron to be about twelve hours                      ;   but it is difficult to disco
 ver whether he alludes to cast or lo bar steel                          :  for he fays,
 that short         bars   of iron        are to be put into an            earthen     box
with      a  cement, and closed up.                  Now     Heel is made from bars
of iron of         the usual length and thickness                  :  but   cast  steel   is
made according to the process described                           by Fourcroy,       with
 this essential difference ihe operation                        is begun      upon bar
 steel,     and not bar iron.
     Mr. Nicholson             is cquallv unfortunate in the account given
 In    his Chemical Dictionary.                       lie   fays that the usual lime
 required for the           cementation of iron              is from 6 to 10 hours,
 and      cautions        us     against      continuing       the cementation too
  long    ;   whereas      the operation, from the beginning to the end,
  requires 16 day? at least.                  In other     parts ot the operation he
 is equal I v defective,             confounding          the making        of   bar  with
 that    of   cast steel, and not fully describing either.                     In  speak-
 ine of       the uses     of    steel, or rather       of what     constitutes    its  fu-
 periority,       Mr* Nicholson is             also deficient.       He    observes that
 " its most useful         and advantageous              property is that of becom
ing extremely bard when                     plunged     into water."        F!e has here
 forgotten every tiling respecting                      the temper      and tempering
 of   steel    instruments, of which, however,                     he takes fume no
tice in the fame              pace.
                                            "  Plunging      into water"       requires a
little explanation           :    for,   if  very hot steel be immersed           in cold
water without            great       caution, it will crack, nay sometimes
 break to pieces.               It  is however necessary to be done, in order
 to prevent the steel from growing                       soft, and returning to the
state     of malleable iron; for,               were it permitted to cool in the
open       air,   the   carbon        which      it holds in combination would
be dissipated*.              I    sliall   at present      confine my remarks to
 the operations performed on iron in Sheffield and its neigh
 bourhood, from whence various communications                                 have been
 transmitted         to me by resident friends, and where I have my
self seen        the    operations repeatedly                performed.        The iron

 made    in that part of Yorkshire is procured from ores found
 in the neighbourhood, which are of the argillaceous kind,
 but intermixed with a large proportion of foreign matter.
 These, however, are frequently combined with richer ores
from Cumberland and other              places.        The   ore is first roasted
 with cinders far       three days  in the open air, in order           to expel
 the sulphureous or arsenical parts, and afterwards taken to
 the furnaces, some of which are constructed                  so that their in
 ternal cavity has the form of two four-sided pyramids joined
 base to base;     but those most commonly              used are   of a conical
 form,    from forty to fifty feet high. The furnace is charged
 at the lop    with     equal parts   of coal-cinder         and lime-stone.
The lime-stone         acts as a flux,    at the fame time that it sup
 plies a  sufficient quantity of earthy matter,              to be converted
into scoriae, which are necessary to defend the reduced metal
from calcination,         when it comes near the lower part of the
furnace.       The   sire is lighted at the bottom          ; and the heat is
excited by means          of two pair of      large    bellows blowing        al
 ternately. The quantity of air generally thrown into the fur
nace is from 10:0 to laoo square feet in a minute.                          The
air passes through a pipe, the diameter of which is from two
inches and     a  quarter to two and three quarters wide.                   The
compression      of air which     is necessary is equal to           a column
of water four          feet and a half high.           Tbe    ore   melts   as  it
passes  through the sire, and is collected at the bottom, where
it is maintained in a liquid stale. The slag, which falls down
with   the fused metal, is let off by means                of  an opening      in
the side    of the    furnace,   at the discretion        of   the workmen.
When       a   sufficient quantity of regulus, or imperfectly re
duced metal,        is accumulated at the bottom               of the furnace
 (which usually happens every eight hours), it is let off into
moulds, to form it for the purpose* intended, such as can
non or pig      iron.- Crude iron          is   distinguished     into white,
black, and gray.          The white     is the    kail   reduced, an     J more
brittle than the other two; the blaik is that                   with which      a
large   quantity      of fuel  has been used         5 and the gray is that
                                                                          which

which has been reduced with             a  sufficient quantity of fuel,    of
which it contains     a part     in solution.       The operation of      re
fining crude iron consists in burning the combustible matter
which it holds in solution ; at the same time that the re
maining     iron is   more perfectly reduced,             and   acquires     a
fibrous texture.      For this     purpose,      the pigs  of cast iron   are
taken to the forge, where they are first put into what is tailed
the refinery   ;  which is an open charcoal sire, urged by            a pair
of bellows, worked by water or a steam-engine ; but the
compression of air in the refinery ought to be less than that
in the blast-furnace.        After the metal is melted, it is let out
of  the fire by the workmen to discharge             the scoriae, and then
returned and subjected to the blast a^ before.                This opera
tion is sometimes repeated two or three times before any
appearance     of malleability (or what        the workmen call coming
into nature) takes place       ;  this they know by the metal's first
assuming     a granular appearance,           the particles appearing to
repel   e;ich   other, or at      least   to have    no signs    of  attrac
tion.    Soon afterwards they begin to adhere, the attraction
increases very rapidly, and it is with great difficulty that the
whole is prevented      from running into one mass, which it is
desirable    to avoid, it being more convenient to stamp small
pieces into thin cakes     : this is done by putting the iron imme
diately under the forge-hammer, and beating it into pieces
about sn inch thick, which easily break from the rest during
the operation.       These small pieces ara then collected and
piled to the height    of about      ten inches upon circular       Jlones,
which are an inch thick and nine inches in diameter. They
are afterwards put into a furnace, in which the sire is rever
berated    upon them until they are in            a semi-fluid state. The
workmen then take one out of the furnace, and draw it into
a bar under the hammer ; which being finished, they apply
the bar to another     of  the piles     of semi-fluid metal,     to which
it quickly cements,       is taken again to the hammer,             the bar
first drawn serving as a handle, and drawn down as before.
The imperfections in        the bars are remedied by putting them

into another fire         called the chafery,          and again subjecting
them to the action of the forge-hammer.
    The   above method is now most               in  use, and is called flou
rishing    ;   but the iron made          by this process       is in no respect
superior      to that   which I      am going to describe.           It   is how
 ever not so expensive, and requires              less  labour.
    The     process     for refining       crude    iron,    which     was    most
 common previous to the introduction                      of flourishing,     is as
 follows    :
    The   pigs    of  cast    iron are put into the refinery,           as above,
 where they remain until they have acquired a consistence
 resembling paste,          which happens in about two hours and a
 half.    The iron       is  then taken out of the refiner)', and laid
 upon a cast iron plate on the floor, and beaten by the work
 men with hand-hammers,                 to knock    off the cinders     and other
 extraneous matters which adhere                 to the metal.        It  is after
 wards taken to the forge hammer, and beaten first gently, till
 it  has obtained       a    little tenacity   ;  then     the middle part of
 the   piece     is drawn         into a  bar about half an inch thick,
 three inches broad, and four feet long, leaving al each end
 a thick fcpiare lump            of imperfect iron.          In this form it      is
 called ancony.         It  is now taken to the fire called the chafery,
 made of common coal ; after which the two ends are drawn
 out into the         form us the middle,              and    the operation       is
 finished.
     There is also a third method            of rendering crude iron mat-
 leable,which,       I think, promises       to be abundantly more advan
 tageous       than either of the two former,                as  it will  dispense
 both with the refinery and chafer)' ; and nothing more will
  be necessary than a reverberating furnace, and a furnace to
  give the metal        a   malleable heat,       about the middle of the
  operation. The large forge- hammer will also fall into disre
  pute, but in its place must be substituted metal rollers of
 different capacities, which, like the forge-hammer,                      must be
  worked either by a water-wheel or a steam-engine.
     It is by      the    operation of the forge -hammer                 or metal
                                                                            rollers,

                     Observatloni on Iron and Steel.                         51
rollers, that the iron is deprived          of the remaining portion of
impurity,        and acquires a fibrous texture.
    The iron      made by the three       foregoing processes is equally
valuable, for by any of them the metal is rendered pure                   ; but
after those different operations are finished,            it is the opinion
of many of the most judicious workers in iron, that laying
it in a damp place for some time improves its quality ; and
to this alone some attribute the superiority              of foreign iron,
more time elapsing between making and using the metal.
To the latter part of this opinion I can by no means accede,
as   il  is well   known that the Swedish           
                                                      ores contain       much
less    heterogeneous        matter    than    ours,   and    are    generally
much richer,         as they usually     yield about 70 per quintal of
pure      iron,    whereas    the average of ours is not more than
30 or 40 + : add to this, that the Swedish ores are smelted
in wood sires, which gives the iron an additional superiority.
   Iron instruments        arc case-hardened        by heating them in a
cinder or charcoal fire        ; but if the   first be used, a quantity       of
old leather or bones must be burnt in the fire,                to supply the
metal with carbon.              The  sire must be     urged    by a pair      of
bellows to a sufficient        degree os heat,      and the whole opera
tion is usually completed in an hour.
    The     process for case-hardening iron is in fact the fame as
for converting iron into steel, hut not continued                 so  long,   as
the surface only       of the article   is to be impregnated with car
bon.        Some attempts have been made to give               cast   iron, by
case-hardening,         the texture    and ductility    of  steel;    but they
have not been very successful.             Table and pen-knife blade*
hax'e been made        of it ; and, when ground, have had a pretty
good appearance         ; but the edges are not firm, and they soon
lose their polish.       Common table knives          are frequently made
of   thiii   metal.    The cementation of iron converts it into
   * Steel it commonly made of Swedish iron.
   t The     iron made from the ore found in the neighboui hood of Sheffield
contains a great deal of phosphate of non or >iJcn*.c, which renders         the
meUl brittle when cold.

   The furnaics for making f! eel are conical buildings; about
the middle of which are two troughs of brick or fire-stone,
which will hold about four                          tons       of iron in         the bar.       At   the
bottom is           a    long grate for fire.                    The        fleel furnace,          how
ever,    is not well adapted                      for description.                 I   shall therefore
avail myself os an accurate drawing,                                    which was communi
cated to me by             a    gentleman conversant with the manufacture,
and which is copied in the plate.                                   A     layer of charcoal-dint
is put upon the bottom                       of   the trough, and upon th;U a layer
of bar iron,             and        so   on alternately until the trough is full.                         It
is then covered over with clay to keep out the                                         air; which,        if
admitted, would effectually prevent the cementation. When
the fire is put into the grate, the heat passes round bv means
of flues,     made at intervals, by the sides of the trough.                                    The   sire
is continued until the conversion                                   is complete, which gene
rally happens in about eight or ten days.                                      There is      a   hole in
the side, by which the workmen draw out                                       a   bar occasionally,
to see how far the transmutation has proceeded.                                            This they
determine by the blisters upon the fin face of the bars.
     If they    be not sufficiently changed, the hole is again closed
carefully,          to exclude the air                   ;    but    if,   on the contrary,           the
change be complete, the                          sire    is   extinguished, and the               steel   is
left to cool for about eicht days more, when the process for
making blistered                    steel   is   finished.          For small wares, the bars
are drawn,              under the tilt hammer,                            to about       half    an inch
broad        and    -?,-       of    an inch thick.                 The      change      wrought on
blistered       steel          by   the tilt hammer,                 is    nearly similar to that
effected on iron from the refinery                               by     the forge hammer.                 It
is   made      of   a    more firm texture, and drawn into convenient
forms for use.                  German           steel   is    made        bv breaking the bars
of    blistered         steel    into small pieces, and then putting                            a   num

    required for use.               This      is also       called    shear     steel,  and   i<
    superior in quality to the common tilted steel.                              Call  steel is
    also made          from the common blistered                     steel.     The   bars are
    broken,       and put into large crucibles with                     a  flux.    The cru
    cible is then closed up with                a  lid of the same ware, and placed
    in   a   wind furnace.                By    the     introduction         of  a greater   or
    smaller quantity of flux, the metal is made harder or softer.
        When        the    fusion      is complete, the metal is cast into                 in
    gots, and then called ingot                 steel ; and that         which afterwards
    undergoes        the operation          of tilting,       is called tilled cast steel.
    The    cast steel     is the most valuable, as its texture is the most
   compail, and it admits of the finest polisti. Sir                           T. Franklaud
   has communicated a process,                     in the Transactions of the Royal
   Society*, for welding cast                  steel and malleable iron together;
   which, he fays, is done by giving                         the iron a malleable, and
   the steel      a   white heat         ;  but, from the experiments                  which
   have been made at my request,                         it appears that it is only soft
   cast steel,      little better, than common steel, that                      will weld   to
   iron: pure steel will not ; for, at the heat described by Sir
   T. the best cast steel either melts, or will not bear the ham
   mer.      It may        here be observed,               as   was mentioned before,
 that    steel  is an intermediate                state    between crude and malle
  able iron, c."Cv:pt in the circumstance                        of its reduction being
  complete      ;    for, according            to    the     experiments of Reaumur
  and     Bergman,         steel   contains more hvdrogen gas than cast
 iron, but      less    than malleable iron               ;  less  plumbago than the
  first,  but more than the latter                   ;  an equal       portion of man
 ganese with each             ;  less     siliceous earth than either              ; more
 iron than the first, but             less   than the second.               Its fusibility is
 likewise intermediate               between the              bar iron and the crude.
 When        steel has been          gradually cooled from a stitc                  of igni
 tion, it is malleable and soft,                      like bar iron ; but when ig
 nited and plunged into cold water, it has the hardness and
 brittlcness of crude iron.                  From the foregoing               facts  we are
justified in drawing the fame conclusions with Reaumur and

 Bregman, but which have been more perfectly explained by
 Vandermonde,         Berthollet, and Monge, that crude iron is                   a
 rcgulus, the reduction of which is not complete                   ; and   which
consequently will differ according               as   it approaches      more   or
 less to the   metallic state.       Forged iron, when previously well
refined, is the purest metal           ; for it is then the most malle
able and the most ductile, its power of welding is the greatest,
and it acquires the magnetic quality soonest.                      Steel consists
of iron perfectly       reduced and combined with charcoal ; and
the various differences          in blistered    steel,    made     of the fame
metal, consist in th greater or              less  proportion of charcoal
imbibed.       Iron gains, by being converted into steel, about
T^v    part of its weight.          In order to harden ste I, it mult be
put into     a  clean charcoal, coal         or cinder fire,        blown    to a
sufficient degree of heat by bellows.                     The workmen         fay,
that neither iron nor steel will harden                   properly without a
blast.    When       the fire is sufficiently hot, the instrument in
tended to be hardened            must be put       in,   and a gradual blast
from the bellows continued until               the     metal     has acquired     a
regular    red    heat   :  it  is then to     be    carefully quenched in
cold water.        If  the steel be too hot when immersed                 in wa
ter, the grain will be of          a rough and coarse texture;              but  if
of   a  proper degree of heat, it will be perfectly fine.                   Saws
and some other articles are quenched in oil.                      Steel is tem
pered by a ain subjecting it to the action                 of   the sire.     The
instrument       to be tempered          we   will     suppose to be a razor
made    of cast steel.       First rub it upon      a   grit- stone until    it is
bright,    then put the       bick upon th. fire, and in a short time
the ed^cwill become            of a light straw colour, whilst the back
is blue. The straw colour denotes               a   proper temper, either
for   a razor, graver, or pen-knife.              Spring knives require a
dark brown ; scissars a light brown or straw colour ; forks or
table knives    a   blue. The blue colour marks the proper tem
per for swords, watch-springs,            or any thing requiring elasti
city.   The    springs     for pen-knives are covered over              with oil
before they are exposed to the sire to temper.

                          Explanation of the Plate.
      Fig.   1 is a plan   of  the furnace, and fig. a is a section       of it
  taken at the line      A B.       The plan    is taken at the line     C D.
  The    fame parts    of the furnace      are marked   with the    fame let
  ters  in  the plan and       in the section.       ££   arc the     pots or
  troughs into which the bars of iron are laid to be converted.
  F  is the fire-place;       P    the sire-bars;     and   R the ash-pit.
  GG, &c. are the flues. HH is an                 arch, the inside of the
  bottom     of which corresponds with the line I III, fig. 1, and
 the top of it is made in the form of a dome, having a hole
 in the centre at K, fig. a. LL, &c. are six chimneys. MM
 is a dome similar to that of a glass-house, covering the whole.
 At N there is an arched opening, at which the materials are
 taken in and out of the furnace, and which is closely built
 up when the furnace is charged. At OO there are holes in
 each pot, through which the ends              of three or four  of the   bars
 are made to project quite out            of the furnace.    These are for
 the purpose of being drawn out occasionally to              see if  the iron
 be sufficiently converted.
    The    pots are made       of sire-tiles or fire-stone.       The bot
 toms of them are made of two courses,                  each course being
about the      thickness of     the single course which forms the out-
 sides  of  the pots.     The     insides  of the  pots are of one    course,
about double the thickness of the outside.               The partitions of
the flues are made        of fire-brick, which      are of different thick
nesses,    as represented     in the plan, and by doited Hues in the
bottom of the pots.           These are for supporting the        sides   and
bottoms of        the   pots,    and for directing     the flame equally
round them.          The    great object is to communicate             to the
whole an equal degree of heat in every part. The fuel is put
in at each end of the fire-place, and the fire is made the
whole length       of the pots,     and kept up as equally as possible.

XII.    Account of a Violet DyeproducedfromtheLeivcs nfSucre-
    trine Aloes, which rejijls theAclion of Oxygen, Acids and Al

    Vei.    xxv.
  X O      increase the number         of dyeing substances, and to be
able to vary the tone             and sliades of the different known
colours, is an object of no small utility.                 Several manufac
tures, a* is well known, have been indebted for their reputa
tion and credit to the         possession   of  a  particular dye.
    Without speaking of the Tyrian purple, who is ignornnt
how much value the modern scarlet has given to the Dutch
cloths and to those of the Gobelins               ?   Who     does not know
that the beautiful black of Florence,                 which    has never  yet
been imitated, has raised the Florentine stuffs all over Europe
to  a  price to which that of no other country ever attained               ?
    Scarlet and black belong to that class of colours called
ttobleoTJi-edy because they are not susceptible of being stained,
aud because they experience              no alteration either from the air
or from light.           The beautiful    red colour also given to silk bv
safflower       is   reckoned    among the noble colours, though it
diies not withstand the influence             of   these  two agents, which
soon destroy it or render it pale.
    Ail other       red dyes for silk, in order to be durable, must be
composed,         in p3rt, of cochineal,       which is a coluuring sub
stance cxccidintrly constant.
    Archileand         all the other lichens produce         a very beautiful
violet   ;   but the fun alters         this colour and makes         it turn
blue.
    I  am      of opinion,      therefore, that      if  means could be dis
covered       to compose,       without     cochineal, colours graduated
from the moll de'icate to the darkest violet purple, which
might be proof against the action of acids and of the air, in
finite advantages would thence result to the manufacturers of
cloth and to the public.

                      A   Dye from the Leaves             of the Aloe.                            57
     It   was    in   hopes     of discovering        such a colour that              I   directed
my researches towards                    a substance      which        hitherto has not
been ranked            amonsr,      those called colouring substances.
     I    was persuaded that the matter of the brilliant                                   colours
presented           to us in those fruits,              flowers, and plants, which
have       undergone           a spontaneous           alteration, pre-exists                  in the
mass       of   the fluids that circulate in those organs, where it is
dispersed or concealed               ;    and that to be able to turn                     it   to ad
vantage, nothing would be wanting but a method to separate
it,   and to modify            it   in   a   proper manner.
     The cochineal             insect, which lives on the nopal (ca8us coc-
ccnilifer), can extract with its proboscis                    the red        juice, or juice
susceptible         of becoming          red,   of   that plant   ;     which afterwards
communicates its colour to the insect,                         and       which, in my
opinion,         is   the fame as that exhibited to us naked                       in      the ripe
fruit of the          fame plant.
     The beautiful             scarlet colour assumed             by   the dead leaves             of
some        species       of    strawberry          blite (blitum)       is      not perhaps
brought forwards but                     in   consequence     of the decomposition
of       the dead leaf.          Would         it   be impossible        then for art to
                                                                  the like manner?
                                                          it
separate this colour, and to modify                       in
     Having         observed that the succulent leaves                      of   the aloe        fuc-
cotrina         .nguflifolta, as they dried on the plants, assumed an
agreeable  violet colour,   tried to separate the colouring mat
                                         I
ter, or principles of that fine colour, from the living leaves.
 I         found       by   experiments,             that acids        as well        as alkalis
speedily gave to this almost colourless juice                           a   red colour, and
formed          a     successive     precipitation         of colouring               molcculæ
which had the same colour.
   Oxygen gas produced the like effect; and             highly                   it   \s
pleasing  to tee  how  the juice of aloes, merely bv being ex
posed  lo the  air, with  or without the contact of the light*
successively reddens, beginning at the parts more immediately
in contact,           and   is   gradually converted           into      a    very dark and
lively violet purple.
                                                                                                 This

58                   A   Dye Jrom the Leavts of the Aloe.
     This juice then       produces a superb transparent             colour with
out body, highly proper for works in miniature, and which
when dissolved in water may                serve also,   either cold or warm,
for dyeing silk from the lightest to the darkest shade.
     Silk,   even without a mordant, strikes and becomes impreg
nated with this dye.             It    is equally attracted    by sulphurized
£lk, though          the latter is so little disposed to assume any colour
whatever.
     The     aloe, indeed, is not a plant indigenous in our climates ;
but this is an inconvenience which it has in common with
almost       all substances used for dyeing, and even with a great
number of those which serve us                   as food.     The juice might
be procured from Socotora itself, not such                    as it is found in
commerce inspissated by fire, but dried in the air, or prepared
by an acid.
     Besides,    as this plant grows without any difficulty                     in our
botanical       gardens, we may hope to multiply it enough by
cultivation, particularly             in the southern       parts of Italy, in
order to extract from it the juice ourselves.
     The     value    of this   new colour may be readily discovered,
when we observe that, by its property of not being altered
by acids or alkalis, it         possesses the     uncommon quality              of nor
being susceptible         of becoming       spotted.
     When       we consider also that the oxygen,            which discolour*
our cloths and silks            so as to   render them white,             is,   as one
may fay, the principle which develops the colour of the aloe                        ;
it   ought to be inferred, that the air cannot alter                      a   quality
which      it   communicates itself        ;   and we may therefore con
clude, that we have discovered                   in   the aloe one   of   the most
durable colours known            in    nature.

T,HIS         sublime part of knowledge,            though carried in all
appearance     to its utmost extent, still continues to make some
 progress.     Lagrange      has  finished a very important work,
which    he began several       years    ago,   entitled,     The Theory     of
the   Anulytical Functions, &c. in which                   he    (hows    that
every thing hitherto called the differential calculus, whether
one follows       the    method   of Leibnitz or that of Newton,
may be reduced to the          ordinary calculation of finite quali
ties.
    Astronomy.  Herschcl,              who has paid great attention
to the spots of the fun, considers         that luminary        as  similar to
the planets, and not a flaming body.             It contains mountains,
some    of which    he supposes to be 200        leagues in height.         Its
atmosphere is composed           of different     elastic fluids,     some   of
which arc luminous or phosphoric, and othirs only transpa
rent.    The former make the sun appear like a mass of light
or fire; but the parts of that atmosphere which are oi:ly
 transparent, suffer his body to be seen.                   These are the
 spots.  He   believes     the fun to be inhabited like the other
 planets.
    Lalande, on the other hand, thinks that the fun is really
a solid body, but that his surface           and part of his mass           are
composed     of an incandescent      fluid. This fluid, by any move
ment, leaves uncovered         sometimes      a portion of the body          of
the fun or his mountains, and these are the spots.                    Wilson
considers   the spots of the fun      as  eruptions or volcanoes.
    Shroeter has        shown that    in Venus        there are very high
mountains,       as   is the cafe on     the    earth and in the moon.
The   greater part     of these mountains in Venus,            like those    of
                                                                           the

   the moon,      are in the southern part           of that planet, while on
  the earth the greater part os the mountains are towards the
  north.     The    day in Venus appears to that astronomer to be
   a3 hours    ai minutes.         It differs      therefore    very   little from
   the sidereal day     of   the earth, which is 23 hours 56 minutes
  4 seconds.
      The volcano of the moon has been                  seen several     limes by
  the naked eye.          Caroche      saw    it at Paris on the        second    of
 March      1797.      It exhibited       the appearance      of   a candle just
 going out.        It  resembled       a  brilliant   spot less   sensible     than
  the greatest satellite       of Jupiter,       but larger.       Its   existence
  therefore can no longer be doubted.
     La Place     has published an excellent memoir on the move
 ments of the moon.
     Hennert     fays that the diurnal movement              of the   earth may
 undergo some variations             ;   but that its variations are com
 pensated     in  such a manner,           that they may be considered as
 uniform.
     Herschel has observed          around Saturn          a quintuple belt       of
 spots.     By   these means he has shown               the length    of   the day
 of  that planet, and determined its diurnal rotation,                       which
 he estimates at to hours          lfi minutes       a seconds.
    Lalande calculated the orbit of the 83d comet to the month
of December 1793 ; but an 8.4 th comet was seen by i^ode at
Berlin,    on the    nth of November 1795, near the constella
tion of Hercules.           It was seen also by Houvard, at Paris, on
the 14.1I1  ol'thc   fame month.            It was small, had no tail, and
was not visible to the naked eye.                Its orbit has been calcu
lated by Zach.           It  was in its perihelion on the 14th              of De
cember at 15 hours 32 seconJs mean time at Gotha.                               Its
distance then from the fun was 0,22.
    An   85111  comet was discovered in V irgo by OIbcrs, at Bre
men, who calculated its orbit.
    An 86th      was discovered        from the observatory at Paris, by
Bouvard, on the           14th    of August 1797, al          ten    o'clock     at
night.     It  was seen next day, at Lcipsic,             byRudigcr. It        was
                                                                              ften

seen also by various astronomers                                in other places.               It   passed
the earth fix times nearer than the fun, which was the cause
of its    apparent         motion being very rapid.                            It   was small, ap
peared           faint white spot, and had no tail.
           only like       a                        Zach,
at Gotha, makes the number of the comets now known to
be 90.
     One of the most difficult                        labours        of astronomy            is what re
lates to the stars.            Their immense number                          indeed is sufficient
to    deter        any    one        from the           taste    of numbering them                    ; for
those which we              sec,       and        we are far from seeing                      them all,
may be estimated                at    more than     Many    a    hundred millions.
of these it is well known have peculiar motions, some of
which arc very considerable.  It is to them, however, that
 we are obliged to refer all the motions                                  of   the fun, the pla
nets, and the comets.                   of importance then to endeavour
                                           It    is
 to determine the              motions of the stars ; and this object has
 at all times engaged the attention                              of astronomers.                   Maske-
 lyne has determined with                         the utmost precision                   the position
 of 34     stars.        Zach         has accomplished the same thing in re
 gard to 1200.             Lalande, with his nephew and niece,                                        have!
 undertaken          a    labour far greater,                    to determine the position
 of more then 40,000 stars, from the arctic pole to the tropic
 of Capricorn. This sublime task is already very much ad
 vanced,       as   the positions               of 43,700            are already known.
     Hydrostatics.  Venturi                                    has made interesting experi
 ments on the lateral efflux of fluids.                                      He      sliows that the
 efflux is more considerable, when                               a   pipe, rather        a   little long,
 is adjusted         to the aperture                  of   the vessel, than when there                    is
 no pipe, or only one that is sliort.                                 Thus, when one wishes
to draw wine, the                    jet   will       be more considerable                    by    putting
a    cock into           the aperture             of       the cask,       than     if       there were
 no cock       ;    and    if        the    cock be some inches in length,                              the
 quantity that flows out will be greater than                                       if   it   were very,
 short.
     It   is   well known,             that when                small     bits of camphor and
other substances,               such        as    the juice of the euphorbium,                          are
 placed upon water, they appear agitated in                                         a   verv remark
                                                                                                       able

6%        Hew    ofsome  late Discoveries       and Improvements
able manner.        Romieu ascribed this phenomenon to electri
city, but Volta has proved         that electricity has         no connec
 tion with it.    Lichtenberg was of opinion, that camphor,
losing   a great deal  by evaporation, continually             decreases in"
bulk,    and that these small fragments         of it change their con
figuration, which makes a        variation in their respective at
tractions.      Volta thinks that the vapours which exhale from
 these bodies strike the air and the water           with sufficient force
 to cause the moleculæ, from which these vapours are exhaled,
 to be agitated as above mentioned.
    Brugnatelli    has convinced     himself that this phenomenon
takes place    with all   substances    that contain much essential
oil,  such as the leaves  of laurel,  sage, thyme, vanilla, the nut
meg-tree, the rbus toxicodendron           (the poison-oak),       the rbus
vernix     (the poison-ash).    He found        also that small       bodies
which did not move on the water acquired that property
after being impregnated with essential oil          .  A   piece  of bread,
 for example, rubbed against a piece of lemon-peel and im
pregnated with essential oil of lemons, moved, after being
placed    upon water a little warm.
    These    experiments prove that it is jets           of   essential    oil
thrown      out with   rapidity from these bodies, which make
them move on the water.         These jets experience           a resistance
from the air and the water,       as a   lighted rocket experiences          a
resistance from the air by which          it is made     to ascend    ;  that
is to  fay, in a direction opposite to the        jet of  the flame.
    Vanturi, who    repeated all these experiments, made several
small sticks of camphor, which he placed on water, adding to
them a bit of lead by way of ballast. They all moved as usual ;
but he observed them become         a  little smaller above the sur
face  of the water,    and at length break in two.              This    effect
it more    speedy  if the water be a little warm, and               is occa
sioned by the continual evaporation           of the parts.
    Botany.  Though        the  number of plants is           so consider
able, being estimated at about twenty thousand, that the most
retentive    memory can scarcely remember their names, the
ardour for this branch of science          does not seem to decrease.
                                                                            La

    La Billardiere,       who went round the world with              d'En-
trecasteaux,      brought back with him a valuable collection in
every part of natural history. His herbal is most beautiful ;
and though nearly one fourth of it has been lost, he has still
 about three thousand plants,         of which from      twelve to fifteen
 hundred 3re new.
     He   carried    with him from the Friendly Isles twenty-two
 bread-fruit-trees, twelve of which were left at the Isle de
 France.       Of the eight brought to France,             five  died;  two
 have been sent to Cayenne ; and the other was brought                     to
  Paris, where it is now in the         Jardin   des  Plantes.
     La Billardiere brought with him             also about three      hun
 dred     birds, a third of which        almost    are   unknown.       His
  collection     of infects  has been much damaged ; but he has
  still a great    many in sufficient    preservation     to be described.
  Riche, who went on           the same expedition,           brought   with
  him    a variety    of objects, and particularly birds.           He died
  not long ago.
      Michau       has returned from South America,            and brought
  with him       a great number     of plants in excellent preservation.
   He will no doubt soon publish an account of them, as well
   as  of those which     he brought from Persia.
       Coulomb having ordered some poplars to be cut down in
   the spring time, observed,         that when the axe          approached
   the centre of the tree,      a very large    quantity of air was dis
   engaged,      but that none was disengaged when the instrument
   attacked     the other parts    of the tree.    It  is well known     thai
   the medullary part, in which the air circulates particularly,
   is situated      towards the centre.      From this medullary part
    proceed    those transversal vessels   which extend to the bark of
   the tree for the circulation        of the air.     The plant contains
    also other vessels for the circulation       of  the sap and    of all  the
    vegetable juices. There are also glands where the secretion of
    all these different liquors is performed to produce the propolis,
    pollen, &tc.     A  vegetable,  therefore,  in the   simplest case, may
    be considered as an assemblage of several pliable clastic fibres,

 which water, air, and various kinds of fluids drawn from
the bosom of the earth and the atmosphere,                                circulate.
      Light        also       has a great     influence on vegetation.                Hum-
boldt has shown that the light of                        a   lamp may, in this             re
spect, supply that                 of   the sun ; and that plants which receive
the light of              a   lamp are coloured green,               as   if they    received
that of           the fun.          Excess    of light hurts plants, especially
when they begin to rise.
  According to Ingcnhouz, plants suffer oxygen to be dis
engaged in the light, and the carbonic .acid in darkness.
Senebier is of opinion that the latter changes the oxygen in
to the carbonic acid, by furnishing it with carbon.

  Medicine. The carbonate of barytes and pure caustic
barytic earth are most active poisons. Pelletier killed several
dogs by making them take from twelve to eighteen grains
of    these       substances.
      Mankind             have been long employed in attempting                       to dis
cover means for the                     prolongation of life.         Valli,   after      lay
ing down principles well known, viz. that old age comes ou
naturally, because the calcareous  phosphate or calcareous
car'oonate          is continually         accumulating in the greater part of
the solids, such as the bones,                    the arteries, veins,              tendons,
&c.        fays,    that        this accumulation can           be    guarded        against
only two ways                  ;   either by preventing that              substance from
being formed in the mass of the fluids, or by expelling it                                  as
soon is it is formed.
      1.    To     prevent too abundant             a    production of that earth,
one must use                  aliments     which contain the hall quanlit)                  of
it,   such as vegetables,                milk, tiili (but     fishes contain         a   great
deal of the phosphoric acid).

with ice.            In flinrt,     he considers           the oxalic    acid    given in
small doses as the best remedy.                          That acid,    fays he, decom
poses the calcareous phosphate: the oxalate                             of lime which
thence results will be carried into the torrent of circulation,
and     will    be driven outwards.
   Vauquelin and Brogniard have proved that the acetic acid
dissolves the vegetable gluten and the animal fibres.
   It   is well known that there                      is a disease    called by nosolo-
gists malacojleon, or mollities qfiium, where the bones become
entirely soft.          The   calcareous              phosphate      is almost entirely
carried away, and there scarcely                          remains any thing but the
cellular      tissue   ofthe bones, with              the gelatinous and greasy part,
or the marrow.              Were it               possible to find out the means       of
dissolving, gradually, in this manner the calcarcousphosphate,
without         depriving the bones of their solidity, and without
hurting        the other animal functions,                     the fountain     of youth
would be discovered.                     It       appears therefore    that it may not
be altogether impossible                  to retard age at least.
   Phtsiology. Spallanzani                             having destroyed the eyes of
bats and set them at liberty in an apartment, observed                               that
they could guide themselves from one place to another as
before.         They     avoided every obstacle that was presented                     to
them, and even                through rings which he placed before
                          passed
them     :    and for this reason he asks, " May not these animals
possess a fense         with which we are not acquainted, and which
may supply that of fight                      ?    or, May not smell be sufficient
for that purpose ?"
  Jurine        is of opinion that it is hearing which supplies the
above        want.    He filled with wax one of the ears of those
animals which he had deprived of sight, and he observed tha
they flew about with difficulty : when he filled both their
ears, they could not               sly   at all.

              XIV. An         Account of twojingulut Meteors.
£~\ LUMINOUS                      body was observed           in the canton        of
Calvirc, on the evening of the 8th of March last.                     It appeared
to direct its course from the               east  to the west,    traversing     the
heavens from Calvire to               Mont-d'Or, where it fell.            It made
itself be distinguished            in its course by     a noise    like that of a
long and violent discharge of mulketry.                      Lalande has pub
 lished the       following      note respecting      these singular meteors :
      "   One frequently observes,"            fays he,
                                                          "  globes   of sire in the
 atmosphere.            I  have mentioned above 36 instances                 of that
 kind in the Connoiffances des Temps for the year 1779. That
 observed on the 18th of Ventosc (March 8) in the depart
 ment of Ain, at seven in the evening, was attended with
  some      singular circumstances.              The    heavens      were    serene,
  and a large globe, as big as the moon,                   was seen to proceed
  ffom the east, and to advance with a rapid motion towards
  the west.          It was followed by a train of light, the rays of
  which,        collected     into bundles, were          terminated by small
  globes.         Six   or seven sprigs       of  stars were seen     on each     side
  of    the train.        At   the end     of some seconds there was an ex
   plosion     like   a  lengthened clap of thunder, or the loud report
   of   a   cannon.        This     meteor diffused      such a   light,    that day
   seemed to have            returned, and people           in dark apartments
   could     fee each     other.
       "   This globe       was at such a height,          that it could be seen,
   at the same time, in places seven or eight leagues asunder.
    A   description of it was sent to me by citizen Kiboud, at Jos-
    seran, and        citizen Langeron, at Thorsey.              Had it been      at a
    greater distance, it would have appeared only like those falling
    stars   which are observed           so frequently.      The common         cause
    of    these phenomena appears to be hydrogenous ga*, set on
    fire, by some means, in the atmosphere."
         On   the 25th     of March       the  following curious phenomenon
     was observed at        Niort    :   Between the hours of fix and eisiht
     in  the morning the fun appeared accompanied by two radi
                                                                                    ant

ant circles resembling two other suns, one on the right and
the other    oil the left, and which          with   the real fun as a base
seemed     to compose        a  triangle.     These two supernumerary
suns were so exceedingly bright, that it was impossible to keep
the eyes fixed on them for any length of time.                      They dis
appeared gradually         ;  that on the      east disappeared     first,  and
at the end     of two     hour3 they were both invisible.
    The wind for       ten days had been        E.N.E.,    and a cold much
greater than usual for the season             had some days       before suc
ceeded mild weather accompanied with a little rain.                     On the
 1 8th of March      the mercury in the barometer had               fallen     to
26,8.      On   the 20th       of the same mouth there were              several
heavy showers of large hail at different times.                  On   the 24th
the electrical      machine emitted very strong sparks almost
without being solicited ; and at the time when the phenome
non appeared, a few clouds scarcely perceptible were to be
 seen  in the high regions of the atmosphere.                                  .
     Phenomena of the above kind, though not frequent, have
 been seen at different periods.            Augustine takes notice of
 two mock funs which were              seen     before    the christian aera,
 Zonarae mentions two             seen  after   the death of Christ,        Pal-
 menus three      seen    in 1466, Surius three funs, i. e. two par
 helia   seen at  Wirtenberg in          1514,      Fromundus      three     suna
  seen  in 1619, Cardan three at Venice                in  1532.
     In Britain, if     we may      credit our old chronicles,         five funs
  were plainly seen at one time, and a great distance from one
  another, in the year 346: three were seen in 812; three
  in 953 ; and five in 1233.            Lilly mentions three seen on
  the 19th    of November           1644; and three        seen on    the   28th
  of February     1648.        A   most remarkable phenomenon              of this
  kind, where     five parhelia were        seen   al once, is mentioned
  in the 8th volume of the N'ew Transactions of the Imperial
  Academy      at    Petersburg; an account of which, with an
   engraving, will be given, in a subsequent number.

 XV.    On a new Acid procured from Animal Subjlancea, called
     the Zoon.c Acid.        By Mr. BerthoLLST-                From the An-
 .   nates de    Chimie, Vol.      XXVI.
   JL  HE    liquid procured by distillation            from animal sub
 stances has appeared         hitherto to      contain only carbonate of
ammoniac         and an   oil; but I       have found in it an          acid, to
which I have given the name of the zoonicacid.                      I  observed
thii   acid   in the liquid obtained from the gluten                of wheat,
the yeast    of   beer,   bones, and woollen rags,            distilled for the
preparation of       the muriate      of ammoniac.           I think myself
thertfore authorized to consider it            as produced      by the distil
lation of all animal substances.
     To  separate this acid,        I mix quicklime with         the    distilled
liquid    after having separated the oil,           and then boil or distil
the mixture.         The carbonate of ammoniac is              exhaled ; and
when the odour          ceases  to    be stiarp (piquanl),       I  filter, and
add a little quicklime        to the   liquid, which       I  boil again, til]
the smell    of the ammoniac         goes oft" entirely.      What remains
is zoonate of lime, which            I filter again.     I  then pour upon
it water impregnated with carbonic acid, or I blow into                       the
liquid with my mouth,             through a tube, in order to precipi
tate, by the carbonic          acid   of  the respired air, the quicklime
which may be "held           in solution without being combined.
Zoonate of lime may therefore be employed to effect com
binations by complex             affinities;    but to obtain the zoonic
acid pure      I  make     use  of   the following    process    :  I  mix the
solution     of zoonate of lime in water,              made pretty        stroi g
 {rapproebte)     in  a tubulated     retort with the phosphoric acid            ;
 1   then distil it.      The distillation,      as  the zoonic acid          hnt
ury litile volatility,     requires     a degree    of  heat nearly cqtut
to that of boiling water.            The liquor     must then be made lo
boil.     If two   vessels be adapted, one after the          other, nothing
will   pass  into the second.         It  appears that    a part   of the    acid
is dcflrovul     by the action      of  the. heat  ; for the liquid which

                  Memoirs      of  the late   P. Niruwland.                 69
 is  in ebullition    becomes brown, and grows black at the end
 of   the operation.        It may thence         be concluded that (his
 acid contains parbon.            1   have not been able to collect the
 other principles        which      are disengaged     during the decom
 position.
     The zoonic acid          has an odour like that        of mc.it when
 frying, and is indeed formed during that process.                   It has au
 austere taste.      1  have been able, as yet, to make on this acid
 only   a  small number        of experiments, which exhibited no
 remarkable properly.             It gives a strong red colour to paper
 tingled with turnsol, and produces an effervescence with al*
kaline carbonates.           It did not     appear to me to produce       with
alkaline and earthy bases salts which crystallize.                It forms    a
white precipitate in         a solution of aectite of mercury in wa
 ter, and in that      of  the nitrate      of lead;   so that it has more
 affinity with the oxyde of mercury than the acetous acid,
 and with the oxyde         of  lead than the      nitric acid.   It   acts on
 tbe nitrate     of silver only by complex affinity; and ttie pre
 cipitate   it then   forms grows brown with time, which (hows
 that   this precipitate contains hydrogen.                The zoonate of
potash calcined did not form prufllate os iron with                a  solution
of that metal.          A  liquid, which        had all the indications      of
acidity, separated from          flesh   which   I  kept a long time in a
Hate    of putrefaction, but it was an ammoniacal salt with
excess    of acid : this acid combined with lime appeared to m*
like zoonate of lime; but I had too little of it lo establish
exactly its identity with the zoonic acid,

Dicmermeer,                 a   village near Amsterdam, on the 5th of No
vember 1764.                    His father, by trade a carpenter, having a
great fondness for books, and being tolerably well versed in
the mathematics, instructed his son himself till he attained
to his eleventh year.                     Young Nieuwland         appears to have dis
played strong marks os genius at a very early period. When
about the age of three, his mother put into his hands some
prints by John Luiken, which had fifty                            verses at the   bottom
of them by way of explanation. These                            verses she read to hii.-i
aloud} without any intention that her son should learn them ;
and (he was much surprised some time after to hear him
repeat         the whole from memory with the utmost correct
ness, on being only shown the prints.                            Before he was seven
years     of age       he had read more than fifty different books, and
in    such a manner that he could frequently repeat                               passages
from them both in prose and in verse.                       When about the age
of eight, Mr.           Aeneae at              Amsterdam, one of the greatest, cal
culators of the age, asked him if he could tell the solid content
of a wooden             statue       of Mercury which           stood upon a piece      of
clock-work. "Yes,"                        replied young Nieuwland,          "provided
you give me             a   bit of the fame wood of             which the statue was
made      ;    for   I will cut       a   cubic inch out of     it,   and then compare
it   with the statue."                    Poems which display the utmost liveli
ness     of imagination,                  and which he composed           in his tenth
Vear, while walking                       or amusing himself near his father's
house, were,, though written at so tender an age, received                           with
admiration and inserted in different poetical collections.
     Such an uncommon genius must soon burst through those
obstacles            which       confine it.          Bcrnardus and Jeronimo de
Bosch, two of the first and wealthiest                          men     at Amsterdam,
became young                NicuwlandV benefactors,              and contributed very
much          to call       forth his latent            talents, and to enable the
powers of his mind to expand.                              He    was taken       into the
house         of   the former             in   his eleventh   year,    and he received
daily     instruction                from       the   latter for the     space    of four
years.         While            in   this situation he made considerable             pro
                                                                                     gress

greis     in  the   Latin   and     Greek languages, and he studied
philosophy and the mathematics under Wyitenbavh.                         In the
year 1783 he translated the two dissertations of his celebrated
instructors,      Wyttenbach         and  de Bosch,       on    the   opinions
which       the ancients entertained       of  the Hate      of  the foul after
death, which had gained the prize of the Teylerian theologi
 cal society.
     From the month of September 1784 to 1785, Nieawland
 resided at Leydcn as a student in the university, and after
 wards applied with great diligence, at Amsterdam, to natural
 philosophy and every branch of the mathematics, under the
 direction of Professor van Swinden.                In  these pursuits,      in
 deed, he had scarcely any occasion             for  a master ;     for he pos
 sessed    the peculiar     talent of uniting different sciences,           and
 of comprehending           their principles with the utmost facility.
  Ik   had     scarcely begun to turn his attention              to chemistry,
  when he made himself mailer of the theory of the much-
 lamented Lavoisier, and could apply it to every phenomenon.
 He could        read a work through with uncommon quickness,
 and yet retain in his mind the principal part of its contents.
     Nieuwland's attention          was directed to three principal pur
 suits  :  poetry, the pure mathematics, and natural puilolophy.
 In   the latter part of his lile he added to these also alironomy.
 Among        the poems     which he published, his Orion alone has
 rendered      his name immortal in Holland.                 Of   the small es*
 says which he published in his youth, the two following arc
  particularly      deserving   ol notice   :  1. A    comparative     view of
 tbe   v.lue of    tbe different branches     ofscience    :  and 3.    1 be best
 means to render general, not learning, but

 ment and good tajle.
     One of his great objects was to bring the pure mathema
  tics nearer to perfection, to amend many faults in them, to
  clear up and connect their different parts,              and in particular
  lo  apply them to natural philosophy and astronomy.                   Corne
  lius Douwcs        discovered     an easy   method of determining the
  .atitude of a place al      sea,  not by the meridian altitude of the

sun, but by two observations made at any other period of the
day.    This method, however, being                   still imperfect,        Nieuw-
land turned his thoughts towards the improvement of                                 it,
and in the beginning of the year 1789 wrote paper on the           a
subject, which he transmitted to M. de Lalande at Paris,
from    whom        it   met with great approbation.                   In    the year
1793, when Nieuwland                resided two months at               Gotha with
Major von Zach,            these two learned men often conversed on
this method     of finding        the latitude, and calculated the result
of observations which            they had made with           a    sextant and an
artificial horizon.           The   above paper,       enlarged        by   these ob
servations,    was inserted          by   Major von Zach with Nieuw-
land's name in the first Supplement to Bode's Astronomical
Almanack, Berlin 1793.
  The above, however, was not                  the only service rendered            by
this learned man to astronomy. Newton was the first philoso
pher who spoke of the mutual attraction of the heavenly bo
dies, and who explained thelaws               of this attraction from mathe
matical principles. D'Alembert,Euler, and Clairaut brought
still nearer to perfection what Newton had not sufficiently
illustrated, and described the motion of the moon, the mu
tual effect which the planets have on each other, the per
turbations     that      must thence          be produced         in their courses
and the periods          of their revolutions,         and    also the laws to
which    these perturbations are subject.                There however still
Temained      to be explained        some irregularities in the pheno
mena of the planets, and that flow variation which takes
place   in the inclination of the ecliptic.                   De       la   Place also
made some very accurate              calculations on this subject.                All
these gieat men adopted             a     truth, which        they knew only
from observations,          that the axes       of   the planets do not stand
perpendicular, but inclined to the plane of their orbits. The
axis of the earth, for example, makes with the plane of its
orbit, that   is,   with    the ecliptic, an angle           of   almost sixty-fix
degrees and    a    half, and this inclination            alone produces the
seasons; whereas,        if   the axis   of   the earth stood perpendicular,
                                                                                   we

we should      continually     have   the same season, and the days
and the nights always equal.             The  cause, however,    of this
inclination    was still unknown       to all the great astronomers.
Du Sejour fays, in his analytical treatise on the apparent,
motion of the heavenly bodies, that it is highly probable that
this phenomenon depends on some physical cause ; but he
does not venture to mention it.           Nieuwland    proceeded    fur
ther.     He laid down principles from which              he drew this_
 conclusion, that the above phenomenon is intimately con
nected with the whole system          of attraction.   On   these prin
ciples he made calculations, the result of which was exactly
equal to the angle of the inclination of the earth's axis to
the plane of its orbit.        Nieuwland communicated his disco
very with much modesty           to the celebrated   Professor Damen
at Leyden, who proposed some objections to it which                  dis
couraged     Nieuwland,      and induced him to revise his calcula
tions with more accuracy.           Major von Zach     transmitted   the
 paper which contained them          10  M.  de la Place at Paris, and
 caused   it  to be printed also, for the opinion      of  the learned,
 in the Supplement        to Professor Bode'*    Agronomical Alma
nack for the year       :
                          793.
    Nieuwland's     talents and diligence soon recommended          him
to the notice of his country.           When in his twenty- second
year, he was appointed         a member of the commission chosen
by the College      of Admiralty     at Amsterdam for determining
the longitude and improving marine charts.              On this labour
he was employed eight years, and undertook also to prepare
a nautical almanack, and to calculate the necessary tables.
The mathematical         part was in general entrusted      to  Nieuw
land   ; but he  assisted also  his two colleagues,  van Swinden and
van Keulen, in the departments assigned to them, with such
assiduity,   that most of the work       published on the longitude,
together with the three additional parts, were the fruits of
his labour.      In  the second edition     of the explanation us the
nautical almanack, he had also the principal share, and he
was the author, in particular, of the oxpl        amiion of   the equa
                                                                    tion

  piece, and   of calculating    the declination    of the moon.
       Soon aster Nieuwland      engaged in this employment it ap
  peared    as if  his destination was about to be changed.              In
  the year 1787 he was chosen by the States 6f Utrecht to suc
  ceed Professor Henncrt ; but on account of certain circum
  stances this appointment did not take place.             He   was how
 ever invited to Amsterdam by the magistrates               of that city,
  to give lectures on the mathematics, astronomy, and naviga
 tion.     While in this    situation   he wrote his useful and excel
  lent treatise on navigation, the first part of which was pub
  lished at Amsterdam in 1793, by George Hulst van Keulcn ;
 and it is much to be wislied         that  Al.  van   Swindcn      would
  complete this work from the papers bequeathed               to  him by
 his deceased friend the author.
      In astronomical pursuits, Nieuwland applied not only               to
 the theoretical but also      to the    practical part;     and in this
 iludy he was encouraged and assisted by Major von Zach,
 with whom he resided some time in the course of the year
 3 792, after the death of his wife, and who instructed him in
 the proper    use  of  the sextant.    This  affectionate   friend pub
 lished also all his observations     and calculations in the before-
mentioned Supplement toBode's Astronomical Almanack.
      In the year 1789     Nieuwland      was   chosen   member       of  a
 learned society whose object was chemical experiments              ; and
so     apt was    his genius for acquiring knowledge, that in a
little time he made himself completely master of the theory
of chemistry. A proof of this is the treatise which he read
on the 24th of May 1791, in the society distinguished by the
motto ot Felix Meritis, and which has been printed in the
first part of the     New General Magazine           (Xu<w Algemeen
MagaaynJ.          At  the fame time he was able to examine the
important discoveries        made by the society, to assist in pre
paring an account of them for the press, and to publish them
with sufficient      accuracy   in the French language. Three
parts of this work appeared under the title of Recbercbes

                       of the late P. Nuvu/land.                         75

afterwards re printed in the Journal de           Physique. The second
was published       in 1793, and the fourth in 1794. Some let
ters of his on chemistry may be found also in the Messenger
(Let ter bode).
    This ingenious       and diligent man was       of  great service also
in   the philosophical department to the above society,               Fesix

  advantage     in trigonometrical operations,         and by   which, in
  calculating     the longitude, one could deduce the real from

  made     considerable    improvements in nautical charts, and
  filled up his vacant hours with (he study of philosophy and
  chemistry.      In   the month     of July  1793  he was   invited to
  the university of Leyden, to he Professor            of Philosophy,
  Astronomy, and the Higher Mathematics,              in the room      of
 the celebrated Damen        ;   and the Admiralty     of Amsterdam
 requested him to continue his nautical researches, which lie
 did with great assiduity till the period of his death.             The
 only variation which he now made in his studies related              to
 natural philosophy, for with the mathematics he was already
 sufficiently acquainted.         He applied therefore  to the experi
mental part, and spared no pains nor labour to become perfect
 in it ; which would certainly have been the cafe, had he not
been snatched from science and his friends at the early age
of thirty. He      died  of an inflammation in his throat, accom
panied    with   a fever, on the 13th     of November    1794.
     In his external  appearance,    Nieuwland was not what might
be called handsome, nor had he ever paid much attention to
acquire that       ease  of deportment which distinguishes those
who     have  frequented polite company.         His behaviour and
conversation were however agreeable, because he could dis
course    with facility on     so many subjects, and    never   wished
to appear      but under his real character.        On   the first view
one might have discerned that he was a man              of  great mo
desty and the strictest morality.        His father  was a  Lutheran,
and his mother a baptist ; but he himself was a member                of
the reformed      church, and always showed the utmost respect
for the Supreme Being both by his words and his actions.

any other proper substance, is to be put with a little water.
B a bottle containing sulphuric acid, and having its neck
ground to              sit   in the first bottle at C, and acock a by which
any quantity                  of   the acid can be introduced to the chalk                                     of
other subdance.                      As     the gas is extricated,               it   passes        through
the tube        D into             the vessel     E, which contains                 the liquid to be
saturated       :      the gas by its                 elasticity     presses        the liquor, and
forces it through the tube                            F into G.        At      II     is a small        hol
low glass ball I with a stem ground to sit the mouth of the
      G, which it sliuts as a valve by the pressure of the li
vcssitl
quor,      assisted            with a spiral spring,                 until the water or other
liquid,      which has been forced through the tube F into G,
presses     down by its weight the ball I, and returns back into
E.        When it accumulates                         to a certain point in              E,        the valve
is again shut, and it rises through the tube                                    F     as before.
     At    b is a stopper               to which             hangs    a small         weight, about
half      an ounce, which acts as a safety valve                                      to prevent           the
pressure from reaching that point which would endanger the
bursting of the                 vessels.
     The    advantage which this apparatus possesses,                                    is,   that   it   not
only gives the fame pressure                            of the       gas upon the surface                      of
the liquor to be impregnated, which the common machines.
do, but,         by      the constant agitation which                       is   kept up,             by   the
ascent and descent                     of   the fluid,        continually           exposes         a   fresh

liquors may              be as      fully saturated in two hours as they can in
twelve,                                                 common use.

absolutely different from any hitherto known,                               and to which
he gave the name of tellurium, as                    a   companion to the urani
um and titanium,                   new metals discovered           some time ago              by
the same chemist.                   M. Muller of Reichcnstein had,                    so   early
as 178.J, suspected that this ore contained                     a    peculiar metallic
substance,           and his suspicion        was confirmed            by   Bergman,          to
whom he had sent some of the ore                        ;   but an account of the
small quantity with which he had made his experiments he
would not venture to decide,                      whether      it    contained        a     new

ingenious experiments made by               M. Klaproth on      a more con
siderable quantity         of the ore, which     had been transmitted to
him by       M.    de Reichenstein, fully confirmed the conjectures
of    the latter as well as those        of Bergman.
             Process   for obtaining     the Metaljrom     the Ore.
     1.   The   ore is gently heated       with  six parts  of the muriatic
acid    ; three parts      of  the   nitric acid being    then   added,   the
mixture is boiled        ;  upon which there arises     a very considerable
effervescence,        and a complete solution is obtained.
     2.   The   filtered   solution is diluted with     as  much water at
it can     bear without becoming turbid,            which is    a very small
quantity,       and    a solution    of caustic potash is then added to
the liquor, un<il the white precipitate which is at first formed
disappears       again, and nothing remains but a brown flaky
 sediment.
     3. This last precipitate is the oxyde of gold mixed with the
oxyde of iron, and a separation is effected by the common
 means.
     4.   The muriatic        acid is added to the alkaline solution (1)
 in sufficient      quantity to saturate the alkali entirely: an ex
 cels    of  the    acid must     be avoided.       A   white    precipitate,
  which, by heat, settles at the bottom of the vessel under the
  form of a hcavv powder, is produced in great abundance.
  After the precipitate has been washed and dried, it is formed
 into a kiwi of paste with a sufficient quantity of any fat oil;
  and this mass is put into a small glass retort, to which a re*
  ripient is (lightly silted.          When this arrangement         is made,
  it is gradually brought         10 a red heat; and in proportion as the
  oil  is decomposed,        there are observed, as in the distillation     of
  mercury, brilliant andmetailic drops which cover the upper
  part of the retort, and which, at intervals, fall to the bottom
  of the    vessel, and are    immediately replaced by others. After
 it   has cooled, metallic fixed drops are found adhering to the
  ides of     the retort and      at the bottom     of  the vessel, and the
                                                                   remainder

remainder        of the metal           reduced and melted with a                           brilliant
surface,      and     almost always crystallized.
           Essential cbaraflening                Marts of this new Metal.
   I. It    has the white colour      of tin, approaching to the gray
colour of lead.          Its metallic splendour is considerable,  and
its fracture laminated.                It
                                      highly brittle and friable. By
                                            is
suffering     it to   cool quietly and gradually, it readily assumes a
crystallized surface.
   a. Its specific gravity is 6.1 15.
   3. It belongs to the class of the most fusible metals.
   4. When heated by the blow-pipe upon charcoal, it burns
with a very lively flame of a blue colour, inclining at the
edges to green.          It is so volatile           as to rife entirely              in   a whitish
gray smoke, and exhales                  a disagreeable                  odour like that of
radishes.        On     ceasing to heat               it,    without having entirely
volatilized the small portion subjected to this operation, the
button which remained, retained fora long time its liquidity,
and, by cooling, was covered with                           a   radiated         vegetation.
   5. This       metal amalgamates                   easily with mercury.
   6.   With sulphur       it      forms         a   gray fulphure             of     a    raditated
structure.
   7. A solution of    the nitric acid

                              in          transparent and                is
colourless. When concentrated,    produces,    time, small
                                                       it                        in
white light crystals, in the form of needles, which exhibit                                           a
dendritic aggregation.
   8. The new metal dissolves                        m the nitro-muriaU,c                       acid*
When      a   large quantity       of    water        is    added to such             a    saturated
olution, the metal            is   precipitated             in the       state    of an oxyde,
under the form of         a   white powder, which,                            in this state,          is
soluble in the muriatic                acid.
   9.    By mixing cold,           in   a   well-stopped             vessel,     a   small quan
tity   of this   metal with        a    hundred         times its weight of con
centrated sulphuric acid, the latter gradually assumes                                     a   beau
tiful crimson red colour.                   By means            of   a   small        quantity of
water      added, drop        by   drop, the colour disappears, and the
                                                                                               small

                   On a new Metal called Tellurium.                          81
small quantity of the metal dissolved,                deposits itself under
the form of black flakes.             Heat     destroys   the solution     :   it
makes the red colour disappear, and disposes the metal to                    se
parate in the state       of  a  white oxyde.
    10.   When, on       the other hand,      the concentrated sulphuric
acid is diluted with two or three parts of water, and                 a small
quantity      of   the  nitric acid    has been added,       a considerable
quantity of the metal will then be dissolved.                  The solution
is transparent       and colourless,     and is not decomposed        by the
 mixture of      a  larger quantity of water.
    11.   All   the pure alkalis precipitate from acid solutions              of
this metal an oxyde, of a white colour,               soluble  in all acids     :
by an excess       of alkali,   the precipitate which is formed is en
tirely re-dissolved.        If carbonate be employed instead          of pure
 alkali,   the fame phenomenon            takes   place  with   this differ
ence, however, that, by excess of the latter, the precipitate
 formed is re-dissolved only in part.
     12.   Exceedingly        pure prustiate      of  potash   produces no
 precipitate in solutions of this metal.
     13. Alkaline fulphurets mixed with               acid solutions occa
 sion a brown or blackish precipitate, according as the inetal
 is combined with more or            less  oxygen.      It  sometimes    hap
  pens that the colour         of  the precipitate has a perfect resem
  blance to mineral kermes, or red sulphurated                 oxyde of an
  timony.
     When      the sulphuret      of tellurium     is exposed on burning
  charcoal, the metal burns with a blue colour conjointly with
  the sulphur.
     14.   The infusion of gall-nuts,            combined with the fame
  solutions,     gives   birth to a flaky precipitate of an Isabella
  colour.
      15.   Iron   and   zinc precipitate tellurium from          its acid so
  lutions in     a   metallic state, tinder the form of          small   black
  flakes, which resume their splendour by friction, and which,
   on burning charcoal, melt into            a  metallic button.

       1 6.  Tin    and    antimony          produce the same phenomenon
  with    the acid solutions        of   the new metal.
      The precipitate formed by               the antimony proves,           in  a strik
  ing manner,         that tellurium is not           a disguised      antimony,        as
  has been supposed.            A solution of tin in the muriatic acid,
  mixed with a solution of tellurium in the same acid, pro
  duced also a black and metallic precipitate.
      17.     The oxyde of tellurium,                obtained from acid solu
  tions by alkalis, or from alkaline solutions by acids, are both
  reduced      with   a  rapidity      resembling detonation,             when they
  are exposed to heal on charcoal.                 It burns,    and is volatilised,
 as has been already          mentioned.
     18.     By heating for        some time this oxyde             of tellurium in
 a retort, it melts,        and appears,         after cooling, with a yellow
 straw colour, having acquired a sort                  of  radiated     texture.
     19.     Mixed      with fat bodies, the oxyde                of tellurium is
 perfectly reduced         by the method above pointed out.

XIX.      Some curious        Circumstances        respecling   the two   Ele
    phants brought        to  Paris from       the Hague.        From   a  late
    French Journal.
  JL HE place for their reception had been long prepared.
 It isa spacious hall in the Museum of Natural History, well
aired and lighted.         A   stove is placed       in it to warm it during
the winter,      and it is divided         into    two apartments, which
have a communication             with each other by means of           a large
door resembling a portcullis.                 The     enclosure   round these
apartments consists of rails made of strong thick beams, and
a second    enclosure, breast-high,            runs round them, to keep
the spectators     at some distance, and preserve them from ac
cidents.
    The morning after their arrival these animals were put
in possession of their new habitation. The first conducted
to it was the male, who             issued   from his cage with precau
tion,    and seemed       to enter      his apartment with         a degree  of
suspicion.      His   first care was to reconnoitre the place.              He
examined each bar with his trunk, and tried their solidity
by sliaking them.         Care had been taken to place on the out-
fide the large screws by which they are held together. These
he sought out, and, having sound them, tried to turn them,
but was not able. When he arrived at the portcullis, which
separates the two apartments, he observed that it was fixed
only by an iron bar, which rose in               a  perpendicular direction.
He    raised it with   his trunk, pushed up the door, and entered
into the second apartment, where he received                    his breakfast.
He   ate it quietly,     and appeared to be perfectly easy.
    During this time         people    were endeavouring to make the
female enter.       We      still recollect the mutual attachment            of
these two animals, and with what difficulty they were parted
and induced to travel          separately.     From the time of their de
parture they had not          seen each     other; not     even  atCambray,
where they      passed the winter.           They had only been sensible
that they were near        neighbours. The male ne\er lay down,
                                       G 3                                 but

but always stood upright or leaned                       against the bars          osh'w
cage, and kept watch for his female, who lay down and slept
every night.           On     the least noise, or the smallest alarm, he
sent forth    a    cry to give notice to his companion.
     The joy which they experienced on                    seeing each other after
so   long   a separation        may be readily imagined.
     When     the female entered,             stie    sent forth a cry expressive
only of the pleasure which                  (he felt on finding herself at               li
berty.       She did not at first observe the male, who was busy
feeding in the second apartment. The latter also did not im
mediately discover that his companion was so near him ; but
the keeper        having called him, he turned round, and imme
diately the two animals rushed towards each other, and sent
forth cries of joy            so animated      and loud, that they shook the
whole hall.            They breathed         also through their trunks with
such violence, that the blast resembled an impetuous gust                                 of
wind.       The joy of           the female was the most lively                :   (he ex
pressed
            it,   by   quickly flapping her ears, which                    she made       to
move with astonishing velocity, aud drew her trunk over tht
body of the male with the utmost tenderness.                             She, in parti
cular, applied         it   to his ear, where (he kept          it  a   loug time, and,
 after     having drawn             it   over the whole body of the male,
would often move               it   assectionately      towards her own mouth.
The male did           the fame thing              over the body        of   the female,
 but his joy was more concentrated.                            He   seemed to express
it    by   his tears, which fell from his eyes                   in   abundance.
     Since ihat moment they have never been separated,                                and
 they occupy together the same apartment.                                The   society        of
 these two animals, their habits, their mutual tenderness,                            and
 their natural attachment,                 still     excited     by   the privation           of
 liberty, will hirnisli curious                observations         for the history of
 their species.
   These two elephants, which are natives of Ceylon, were
 brought to Holland when very young. They are about
 fifteen     years     of   age.       Th«ir height        is   seven feet and some
 inches.          Their       tusks,    which are         very      (hort,     have   been
                                                                                   broken     ,

The tail of    the male hangs down to the ground              :  that  of  the
female is much shorter.
XX.       Some Particulars     reftekTmg the late         Embassy      of  the
         Dutch East India Company          to the  Court of Pekin.
V-ylTIZEN M. L. E.             Moreau       de Saint     Men-    has    lately
published, at Paris, an extract from Van Braam's Journal of
the Embassy      of the  Dutch    East   India Company          to the Em
peror   of China, in     the  years    1794 and       1795, one volume
quarto, being the first.      The   second, accompanied with maps
and engravings, is announced            as  about to appear.
    The principal object of      those who give an account          of their
travels to the public, ought to be to make known the usages,
public and private manners, the legislation, arts, indullry,
productions, the temperature, commerce, religion, and go
vernment of those countries which they traverse.
    Those of Citizen Van Braam have not been written accord
ing to this system     ; nor indeed could they, for the members
of  the embassy were hardly suffered to have any kind                  of in
tercourse with the natives.        His work,      as the title announces,
is only  a journal, containing     an account      of the different    places
through      which the author      passed    in going from Canton to
Pekin,     and returning by the fame route.
    If this  Journal, which    seems to have been written only for
the private satisfaction     of the author, does not give an          exten
sive and    profound knowledge of China, it contains,                 at any
rate, several details    which may be useful to those who wilh
to collect information respecting         this singular and interesting
country.
   There arc three ways of travelling in China. By water,                   ii>
vessels called   yachts ; by land, in palankins carried by men
called   coulis, or in small carriages made like whcel-barrows.
The   establishment     of posting,    and     suspended carriages, are
                                  G 3                             unknown

86                       Dutch Embassy        to China.
unknown in that country.               The     horse, the most        beautiful
anil useful animal in Europe, is despised there.                     Buffaloes,
mules, and dromedaries, are the animals principally employed
for transportation.
    In nocountry        does agriculture flourish so much as         inChina.
This art       is   there beheld with        almost religious      veneration.
On this      subject there arc treatises,        brought to perfection by
application and the experience of several ages               :  these treatises,
suited to the soil       of  each canton, are deposited in the           hands
of the mandarin who            acts as    first magistrate     ; and he takes
care that the neighbouring            farmers shall be made acquainted
with,    and turn to advantage,          the lessons which these treatises
contain.
     Citizen    van Braam speaks         of    the monuments          which he
frequently met with on his route, and which he characterizes
under the name of triumphal arches, and octagonal or hexa
gonal towers consisting of seven or eight stories.                     He    does
not explain the         use  of  these towers,     which    appear to be in
China what          obelisks    were   among the Egyptians.
    With regard        to the triumphal arches,        Citizen      van Braam
fays     that they are monuments              erected  to    the memory         of
warriors who rendered             services   to their  country, and some
times to private citizens who signalized themselves by their
virtues.       Some have been erected also lo young women and
 wives    :  to the former on account of their chastity, and to the
 laser    on account      of their fidelity.
     If nrepetual     virginity could be made to accord with nature,
 it would be no great merit in China to devote one's                      self to
 jt ; for the manner in which women arc there treated,                     is not
 much       calculated to awaken in young persons of that                   sex  3
 desire     of being    chaste.     Parents carrv on       a    kind of traffic

 give them        in exchange tor a large          down-,      which they put
 into their own pockets : others sell them like merchandise,
 without caring what becomes of them.                    The wives of          the

   animals which        assist us.
        The emperor is revered as a god. The power of the
   sovereign and of a high-priest are both united in his person.
   The same homage is paid to the edicts which he issues, the
  dispatches      which     he signs,    and   the    presents which       come
   from him,      as are paid    to himself.     That   is to fay, the people
  prostrate themselves         before  a piece   of paper, or silk, as they
  do when they are in his presence.                 The embassadors were
  several times obliged to          make ridiculous salutations           before
  the remains       of bad provisions, or pastry,        which    the emperor
 had sent them from his table              as a mark      of particular con
  sideration     and savour.
       The court of Pekin        presents nothing striking.          The    most
  remarkable object is the wall by which it is surrounded.                    All
 the apartments are narrow and mean, and confusion prevails
  in all the ceremonies, which              are conducted        without     any
 order whatever.
     The entertainments         to which the embassadors were invited,
 consisted      of a few  breakfasts   where the emperor was present.
 Some boiled meat, confection?, pastry,                   a beverage      called
samson,        and   another called     bean-milk, served up on           tables
 around which the              guests squatted      down upon cushions,
 formed the chief articles at these morning collations.
      It appears that the people       of China make        very    bad cheer.
 The want of         the pleasures    of  the table is not supplied           by
 others.        The Chinese      spectacles   consist only    of  a   sew seals
 of tumbling, and extemporary farces.                 And    these spectacles
even are not public.            They arc exhibited only inlhe interior
part     of the   palace, and     in the houses of sonic of ihe chief
mandarins.
      In this country      there is no social communication             among
the inhabitant?,          who live insulated       and   confined to their
own homes.

    Though the embassadors remained more than a month
at Pekin, Citizen van Braam fays nothing of the manners,
commerce, or monuments of that city. This will not appear
astonishing, when it is known that the members of the em
bassy,    like those which preceded them from England,                   were
confined       to   their hotel,     as if they   had   been    in prison j
that they were         narrowly watched ;         that the letters which
they sent to some missionaries             of their acquaintance         were
inspected       at the post-office ;     and that they never went out
in order      to go to court, at three or sour o'clock in the morn
ing in    the middle       of winter, without being      escorted by con
ductors.         Such is the jealousy which the Chinese entertain
of Europeans of             every   description,   ever   since     a  former
 emperor, expressing           his surprise to a Spanish Jesuit, who
 had   less   cunning than his associates,        at the immense power
 and territory        which     the   king of Spain      had   acquired- in
 South America, was informed                by the latter,    that, having
 once gained         an establishment in the country,          missionaries
 were sent among the people to convert them to the Roman
 Catholic faith, after which their subjugation followed as a
 matter      of course   !                                     
     The     people to whom Confucius           preached    his simple and
 sublime morality,           the  people who erected temples to that
 philosopher, ought to be rational in their worship               :   but they
 arc vilified and degraded          by the most absurd idolatry ; their
 pagods       are filled    with idols of the      most    monstrous and
 whimsical figures.
     If the    Chinese, however, are idolaters, they arc not into
  lerant   ;    for Citizen van Braam speaks of a Christian to
  whom they have erected temples, and whom they style a
  faint.

XXI.     Chemical Experiments respecting different Methods of
    rendering Paper and the Writing on it indeftruclible by Fire,
    By Mr. L. Brugnatelli.                        From          CrcH's     Chemical
    Annals for 1797.
o,'F      all the substances      1   have tried,          liquor of flint is that
which, after     a series  ef experiments,           appears to me to be the
most    incombustible,      and the most proper to secure paper
from destruction by fire.           I  dipped     the sheet        of  paper several
times in the above liquor, fresh made, or, I daubed it several
timts over the whole paper with a hair brush, and dried it in
the sun or in an oven.           Paper prepared in this manner loft
some of its softness, became a little rougher than before, and
 acquired     a lixivious    caustic taste.           In other respects it was
 not different from common -white paper. When this paper
 was laid upen glowing coals, it did not burn like common
 paper,    but became red, and was converted                      to a coal, which
 however did not fall into              ashes     like the coal of common
 papery' fo that it might         therefore be considered as petrified
  papen.     This   coal, however, is            exceed'm.^Iv          friable   ;  for,
  when it is taken between the fingers,                    or   pressed   together in
 any manner whatever, it drops to pieces.
      As the chemists     consider      incombustibility             as one      of  the
  principal characteristics of saline substances,                    I made experi
  ments with       different kinds of salts,                 to  try whether they
  would render      paper incombustible,               like this liquid siliceous
  potash,    which is not     a salt,    but   a  combination consisting of
  two substances.
      I took several sheets of common white writing-paper,                           and
  dipped each    of them, in      the fame manner as I had proceeded/
  with the above liquor        of flint, in         a   particular salt, and ob
   served   how the different leaves withstood the                          sire   when
   thrown into it.      I   shall    here give         an account         of my ob

it waa converted     into    some grains       of   3 very   white colour,
which, by the chemical         test,   I discovered     to be sulphure    of

of paper which    had been     dipped in dissolved sulphite of pot

burnt in the fire, and was converted             to a black coal,     which
soon after glowed, and was then totally destroyed.                  It how

       From   the above        observations      it   appears,    that   white
  salts do not deprive paper         of   its combustiblcness like the       li
  quor of flint.        Some of them also, instead of defending it
  from the action of the fire, tend rather to accelerate its de
  struction, as, for example, the sulphites.                The sulphureous
 acid which they contain loses             with   the inflammable body its
 oxygen, is converted            into sulphur,        and  produces    a little
 liver of sulphur, which is destroyed               at the fame    time with
 the paper by the flames.

 XXII.       Report made to the Council         of the Mines in Spain       re
     spiting    a new Wood proper          for Dyeing, called Faragua-
      tan. By     D.    DOMIXIC      GARCIA      Fernaxdez, Inspector of
      the Mint.      From the Annales de Cbimie.
 XN      compliance with the orders of the Supreme Council of
 Commerce and the Mines,             I   undertook a chemical examina
 tion of a wood known in Guiana under the name                       of Para-
guatan.       This examination          I  carried to such     a length as     I
thought necessary for acquiring               a knowledge of its nature,
and     of the advantages that may be derived from it in dyeing.
I   observed in the first place that the bark, the wood properly
so    called, and the leaves of the paraguatan produce different
colours.      The    leaves, however, do not merit much attention,
as they     communicate         only   a  fading and not very agreeable
colour.       My   researches have, therefore, been directed chiefly
to the bark, as that part is the most important, and my obscr-*
                                                                      ration*

                  Account of a new Wood                       for Dyeing.                 tfo
vations respecting the bark may be applied also to the wood ;
for, though the latter produces a different colour, it exhibits
almost the fame phenomena as the bark.
  If the bark          be boiled in water, the coloured extract thence
resulting, when exposed to the action of the sulphuric, muri
atic and nitric acids, resists them much longer than an ex
tract of brasil or logwood.                     The colour,          after being destroyed
by   a   combination            of acids, may           be revived         by (he means of
alkalis.
     Vinegar,      lemon-juice,              and    tartar render this dye more,
brilliant,       and    communicate                to    it   a fine rose colour,       while
these acids, on the other hand,                         destroy the colour           of brafll
and logwood altogether.
  The feculæ of the bark                        of the paraguatan attach therrf-
felves and adhere to woollen, cotton, aud silk.                                   The colour
is more brilliant on silk than woollen, and more brilliant on
the latter than on cotton.
     The   fame feculæ             dried may be afterwards dissolved                         in
 alcohol, and communicate to it a tint similar to that obtained
 from cochineal.
     By mixing alum with                    a    highly concentrated decoction                 of
 the fame        substance a species                of    lake may be produced, but
 neither    so    lively nor        so    pretty as that obtained from cochi
 neal by     a   like process.
     The    fame decoction mixed with that                            of gall-nuts furnish
 ed me with a precipitated pigment                            of a   weak rose colour.       An
 infusion of brasil or logwood, mixed with an infusion of
 galls, assumes             a   darker and browner tint; mine on the other
 hand became clearer by                    it,   and assumed         a   delicate rose colour,
 or one somewhat similar.
     It   must indeed be acknowledged, that the dye extracted
  from the paraguatan                has not       a     strength equal to that         of   co
  chineal.        It    is      however superior to those of madder, brasil
  and logwood, since               it    resists   vinegar, lemon-juice and tartar.
  Soap even does not destroy                       it    so   speedily as    it   does those    of
  brasil and logwood.
      The bark         is   attended with this advantage, thatby employing
                                                                                                it

      By  examining the external form              of a piece  of the paragua-
  lan, it  appears to me to be the fame tree as that which Francis
  Correal fays he observed in the province osPopayan*,                     which
 is not far from Guiana.               The     fame author relates that this
 tree is different from that           of Brazil    ;  that the trunk, which
 is the size of one's thigh,            is thirty   or forty feet in height        :
 that its hark is full ot longitudinal              grooves; that the wood
 when dripped          of its bark    is  of a  beautiful red   ; and that the
-Indians employ the wood mixed with a red earth to dye the
cotton which they             use  for dresses.
     The colour extracted from paraguatan does not resist the
 action of light: no colour indeed can stand that test. This
colour, however, will stand much longer than that                        of  b ra
ft 1 or logwood      ;   but, on the other hand, these two trees fur
nish colouring matter in greater abundance.
     I consider    the paraguatan, therefore, as one             of those valu
able productions which America furnishes to                    Spain. It may
be employed        with     advantage      in  the art of dyeing throughout
all Lurope.         It   is to be wished that         search   may be made
for it in Popayan,           and that some       of the earth mentioned by
Correal may be sent over to us.                   The governor of Guiana
ought also to collect every information possible that may re
late lo the paraguatan, and to transmit it to us, as well as
other specimens of the wood, with some os its leaves and
flowers, in order that its species may be determined.
     A   knowledge of this wood begins to be extended, as                         I
lately received        a  portion of its bark and of a red substance,
which were brought from Guiana by an Englishman named
Milncs.       It is to be presumed          that this substance is the tune
as that mentioned by Correal in his voyages.

"V,A RIO US              artists     have   already     presented     several
¦models    and machines,         destined  for giving assistance to the

  wishing to neglect nothing in an object of             so  much import
 ance to humanity,        has considered     it as a duty to make        it  the
 subject of    a prize.                                                         :
     It  invites therefore ingenious men and artists to present
¦either   models or descriptions of machines,               or to point out
 any means which may be used for giving assistance to every
  story  of   a house on fire.        These means must be of such a
 nature, that they can be transported           with facility to different
 quarters of a city or town ; that they can be speedily erected
 before the house to which assistance is to be given, and that
 women and children may be able to descend by them from
 the highest     stories  without      any danger.       It is  desired tha^
 these    means may be as little impediment as possible to fire-
 engines, and to the manuvres destined to check the progress
 of   the   flames.    The competitors         are   requested to procure
information      respecting    the practices followed        at present,      in
 different towns, in tbe like cafes.             They   are requested also
 not to neglect to point out particular means which, though
 not    generally used, may be employed in many cafes                  ;    but
these means must be simple, and easy to he put in practice.
     The prize will be a kilogramme of gold.

   Third Prize. To point out the earthy                        substances         and
processes proper for manufacturing earthen-ware, capable of
standing sudden transitions from heat to cold, and so cheap
as to be    within     the reach   of every   class   of citizens.
  This art is      still far from being carried             to that degree         of
improvement       so desirable     for the public benefit, while some
neighbouring      nations who do not make porcelain, manufac
ture   earthen-ware exceedingly useful, and superior to that
made in France.           The Institute       requests the competitors to
examine the composition of the best earthen-ware; the quality
of those natural       earths which may serve to form               it,   or that of

     To determine       the   influence os signs on the formation of
 idens.
     The   picefcs   received on this subject       not having answered
  the conditions of the question, though several of them con

 fame subject for the 7th year, and invites to the competition
  those, above all, whose first efforts have merited its attention.
      The prize will be 5 hectogrammes of gold llruck into a

     On the      suggestions,    however, of some men, of genius, it
has been found necessary to abandon inquiries into the                       first
causes, and to direct our attention to the means              of improv
ing the understanding.
     But the most powerful means of the progress of the hu
man mind have been observed in signs.
  The first philosophers who turned their reflections to the
characters of writing,           the accents and articulations          of    the
voice, the movements of the visage, the gestures and different
attitudes of the body, saw in all these signs only means,
either established by nature or invented by men, for the com
munication of their thoughts.
     A    more profound examination showed that signs were not
merely destined to       serve as a   communication between minds.
Notwithstanding         the authority    of some   great men, who con
sidered     them as sliackles to the justness       aud    rapidity of our
conceptions, these philosophers           dared to advance that a man
separated       from any commerce with his fellows, wouid still
have      occasion    for signs to convey      the full meaning         of bis
ideas.
     In   short, some have imagined that they observed in signs
a much more astonishing service rendered to reason                 ;   that    is,
that the existence of the ideas themselves               supposed the ex
istence    of   signs, and that men would be deprived         of   all ideas
if   they were deprived     of   all signs.
  So that they have judged signs necessary not only for the
communication ofideas, for combining ideas newly acquired,
and tor forming new ideas, but still for having first ideas  the
ideas which proceed more immediately from the sensations.
     Isa certain influence of      signs on the formation     of ideas isa
thing incontestable and universally acknowledged, the case                      is
not the fame with the degree of this influence.  Here opi
nions are divided, and what sonic consider            as   axioms, others
treat as absurd paradoxes.
     The Institute waits         to receive   memoirs,     which       by   new
researches, aud new illustrations, may dispel the uncertainties
                                                                            that

        It presumes, that among the numerous questions which the
    fecundity of the subject            of  the prize may give rise to, the
    author ought not to forget to answer the following                   :
        I.   Is it true that sensations        cannot be transformed into
   ideas,      but by the means        of signs  ?   or, what amounts to the
    fame thing,         Do our    sirit ideas essentially    suppose the assist
   ance     of  signs   ?
        a. Would the art of speaking be perfect               if the  art  of signs
   \vcre carried       to perfection    ?
       3. In the sciences where truth is received without con
  testation, are we not indebted for this to the perfection of
  signs    ?
       4. In those which furnisti eternal subject for disputes, is
  not difference of opinion the necessary effect of inaccuracy
  in    the sigm    ?
       5. Are there any means of correcting signs badly made,
  and of rendering all the sciences equally susceptible of de-
  mons: ration       ?

       THE      Society of Medicine           at Paris had     proposed as the
  subject     of  the prize    of 300 francs,       to be adjudged     this year,
 llic following         question  :
       "  What      are the advantages          and    inconveniences of the
 different methods of treating the aneurism ?"                       But   as this
 question       was not sufficiently explained, the society decreed,
 in its public fitting of Floreal            2 d   (May u)>      that the ques*

   THE      papers presented to the Class        of the Physical   Sciences
of  the Institute, by its members and associates,                during the
above quarter, chiefly related to rural conomy, the veteri
nary art, and chemistry.
   Experiments lately made on horses, sheep, goats, and rab
bits, prove,      that these animals die speedily,          and with con
vulsions, when they have eaten          a certain quantity of the leaves
or berries     of the yew.      Citizen Daubcnton thinks           that this
tree is dangerous ; that it ought not to be transplanted                into
countries which nature has preserved from it                ;  and   that it
would be much better lo destroy than to cultivate it.
    Citizen Celly,      in" a memoir      on    the utility   of employing
analogy in the natural sciences,            and on     the   application of
botany to promote the progress of rural conomy,                     endea
vours to prove, that the properties            of  bodies being a conse
quence     of their organization,       the    more   relations there are
between      them, the more the uses for which they can be em
ployed are approximated.
    Citizen Gilbert (bowed the necessity of subjecting all the
operations of agriculture to comparative experiments, in or
der to enable       the rural sciences       to make      that  progress  of
which they are susceptible.            He thinks it would       be necessary
to form rural establishments          destined to inquire into ihc best
processes, both for the cultivation         of   vegetables and the ame
lioration of the breeds of domestic animals.
   Citizen Tenon        presented a memoir, containing            a compa
rison   of  the method?! in which manducation is performed in
man,     the horse,    and the elephant.
    Citizen Chabert communicated reflections on a disease
among horses, known under the name of immobility (immo-
bilitt), not yet described, and which has a great affinity with
                                                                        that

the catalepsy.
     An        osseous     tumour which              arose   in the ham of a horse,
gave occasion              to Citizen       I   luzard to make               some reflections
on the origin of that malady, and the means                                         of curing          it,
when       it
           is        treated according to its principle.
     Citizen Lelievrc announced                        that he had lately discovered,
in France, sulphate    Jtrontian in
                                 of                             a    striated mass.          It    was
found, at the depth of 15 or 16 feet,                            in   a   clay pit (glai/itre),
which          has been worked for fume years,                             at fiouvron,           near
Toul.
     Citizen Dolomieu                showed some                of   the sulphate            Jlron-
                                                                                            of
t'tan,     which         he had       brought with him                      from Sicily, and
which,          as   well   as the    preceding, had been analyzed                            by   Ci
tizen Yauqui'lin.
     It   is   well known that the nitro-muriatic                            acid      is   the true
solvent        of uold,      and that this metal may be recovered from
its solution          by    sulphuric ether.              Citizen         Sage showed        a    gold
precipitate suspended                 between the ether and                      the nitro-mu

     Citizen Chaptal            read    a       memoir on        a    new mode          of manu
facturing verdigris.              This new                process,        practised al       Mont-
pel Her for some              years     past,         consists       in   causing      the residue
(marc) of grapes to ferment, and of putting       layers be                  it   in
tween plates of copper, to develop the metallic oxvd, called
verdigris.  This method                        is   superior    to the old one, as               it   is
much easier, and attended with                            less expense,           because     it   re

    THE      society for promoting the arts and useful manufac
tures have proposed a prize ol 40 ducats,                to be given to the
author of the bett answer to the following question                   :
    "  What       are the best means, confirmed by experience,                 to
secure     wooden work washed by the sea, such as sluices,
buoys, signals for ships, ice. and e\en sliips themselves,
front being destroyed         by the sliell-worm           (teredo    navalis),
which,      as  is well known, pierces through wood and hastens
its decay     ?"
    The    society will consider that essay as the, best, which pro
 poses means ot a cheap nature,             known by experience to be
effectual, and         which     are either as durable as the wood
itself to withstand        the effects    of the waves ai.st the ice,          or
 can be renewed from time to time without inconvenience,
 and without injury to the works they                 are intended to pre
 serve.     All    the  means hitherto proposed             for the like pur
 pose, such as covering the wood with copper, lead, Sec. are
 excluded     from the prize ; because these, besides being pe-
 ristiable   in water,    are liable to be stolen, and in many cases
 cannot     be   applied.    No   paper,   also, can      be entitled     to the
 prize, unlclb the means           proposed   111 it have been proved by

 thankfulness receive papers          of this kind       ;  the means       pro
 posed  will  be subjected to a trial         of two    years ; and     if they
 are then found to answer the purpose,               a suitable    reward    will
 be adjudged     to the inventor.

 accompanied       by a sealed     note containing         the name      of  the
 author, must be transmitted            to the society     before Christmas

    THE    members of the Teylerian second society at Haer-

 1799:
    " What     are the causes why most nations have made choice
of  metals,   particularly gold and silver,          as   the representative
signs of wealth     and riches?      What       are the advantages      of this
circulating medium,         so  generally adopted,         and what are the
disadvantages     connected with           it ?   And can nothing          else,
equally durable, and attended with benefit and advantage,                     be
invented    in its stead ?"
    The premium        for the best answer is a gold medal equal              in
 value to 400 Dutch        florins.
    The  answers in Dutch,          Latin, French, English, or Ger-
man, with      a scaled letter    containing the name of the author,
 must betransmilted toTeyler's foundation-house                  atllaerlem,

on the first   of November,        the same year.
    The  society have      also announced,         that as no answer had

prize-question of 1796, respecting              the constitution and form
of government of        the Grecian republics, and their influence
on the happiness or unhnppiness of their citizens, they pro
pose it once more in the following form :

     IN   consequence    of the 368th article of       the Constitution      of
 the new Roman Republic,            the citizens who are to compose
 the members of the National Institute were                   nominated in
 April    last by the     French    general.      It  is divided into two
classes   :  that of the  sciences,   mathematics and physic; and
that of philosophy, the belles lettres, and the sine aits.               The
 first is subdivided   into fix  sections  The mathematics,             che
mistry, anatomy, physics,          natural history, and agriculture ;
and     the second into six sections also, viz.           philosophy,     his
 tory and antiquities,       poetrv   and music ;         the political   sci
ences, grammar and eloquence;              the art    of design.
                             ASTRONOMY.
     Mr. ITerschel         has lately   discovered      four new satellites
 to his planet    ; so that there are    now six. This discovery was
made      bv a telescope    of 30 feet, which he had constructed
 for the Observatory of Madrid. The first notice that La-
 lande had of this discovery was from Golha, the Prince of
 which is fond of astronomy: he laments, in a short notice
 which he published        upon this subject,        that for some years
 he has not received       from   Mr. llerschel       any account     of    his.
 discoveries    in the heavens.

     Mercury     and Venus have       been observed to pass over the

wade an observation of this kind.               He     saw, during       twenty
minutes,       a  black body, round,         and well       defined, cross the
face of the fun, and he remembers to have                     seen   something
 similar in ihe year 1784.                                         Lalande.
                             Paris,   2 Germinal,        (March     22,   1798)
     The   fun had been seen some days without anv spot, but on
the 29th of Ventose (March 19) there appeared a small one
on its eastern limb. It had arrived therein the night-time, as
 well   as that     which was formed          in the present decade.            It
 will employ thirteen         days    and a    half   to    traverse   the fun's
 disk, according to the time of thejun's rotation, in regard,
 to the earth, which I have determined to be 27 days 7 hours
and 37       minutes.      In comparing with           each other the       large
 spots visible by the naked eye in the ye.;rs 1752,                1764, 1777,
 and 1778,        I  consider them      to   be the fame spot, or at least;
 farmed at the same point of the solar globe, where there is
 probably a local cause which from time to time produces at
 the fame place the fame phenomenon.                               Lalande.
     Citizen    Messier,    astronomer      of    the    National     Institute,
 about    seven    in the evening on the 23d of Germinal (April
 11) discovered        from his observatory a new comet in Tau-
 yus, near the Pleiades, and in the parallel of the principal
  star of   that    constellation, with whjch          it was compared         at
 8h. 58m.        i6fcc. of true time       ;  its   right ascension        being
49h. 19m. 4/sec. and its declination 23b. 22m. 55sec. north.
Next morning, the 24th, the comet was compared agaiq
with    the fame star, at 8h. 25m. 46sec.                 Its right ascension,
was     found to be 5ch. 52m.              55scc.     and      its  declination
 2$h. 18m. 58fec.
    This comet, which           is small, round, and brilliant,           has no
tail,  and cannot be seen by the naked eye.                   On the 25th its
light   was increased ; which seems to (how that it is approach
ing the earth.
    This    is the 20th comet which           Citizen Messier        has disco

    Francis Lalande, nephew of the astronomer                of that name,
 has lately   carried to 45,000       the number      of  the stars which
 he engaged to determine.  An immense labour, which                      no
 astronomer before       ever ventured       to undertake,      and which
 was a desideratum      in astronomy.
    Dr. Burckard,     an able astronomer       of Ootha, now       at Paris,
has calculated the orbit       of  the comet lately discovered.          He
 finds that it   passed  its perihelium on the 3d           of April, at 7
hours, in 3 signs, I2deg. 56m. at the distance              of ,0487 from
the fun : the inclination of its orbit is 45deg.               18m. and    it
intersects   the ecliptic at 4 signs, o deg. 44mm.
    M.  de Lalande, in a letter which he lately wrote to                Ma
jor  von Zach, at Gotha, informs            him,  that the Turkish      am
 bassador at Paris is remarkably fond           of astronomy,       and at
tends   regularly the Lyceum,           where he     has a sopha     appro
priated   for his own    use.     His interpreter Codrika        has trans
lated one    of M.    de Lalande's        works    into the Greek lan
guage.      The Turks     at present seem to apply with some at
tention    to the    cultivation of mathematical knowledge. 
M.    de Lalande says      that    a mathematical school          has been
esiabliflied    at   Constantinople        with   four    professors,   and
 that the   number      of pupils amounts          to  fifty.    Logarith-
niical   tables   are  now printing in that city, with Turkish
types.
                           EARTHQUAKES.
    LETTERS        received     from      Bencoolen, Taponooly,         and
 Padanir, of the 5th and 7th of March 1797, give the fol
lowing relation of an earthquake that happened on the west
coast of Sumatra on the aoth             of February   :
    The vibratory     shock*    of this    earthquake      arc .slated,   on
competent authority,         to have continued tor three          minutes,
                                                                         and

                                        Earthquakes.                                         107
and to have recurred at intervals,                       during         a   space    of three
hours,         from its beginning,              till    the shock           had completely
ceased.        At     Padang, the houses of the inhabitants are almost
totally        destroyed,         and    the public       works          much damaged.
The      snow Padang, lying at anchor in the river, wns thrown,
by the Hidden rife <'.'the sea, upwards of three miles in shore,
where (he still remains. The number of lives lost at Padang
on   ihi? melancholy               occasion exceeded 300.                   Of    these, some
were crushed            under the ruins of falling houses ;                        some were
literally entombed alive by the earth closing upon them                                  ;   and
others        stere   drowned by the hidden irruption of the waters
of   the ocean.             The   effects   of this awful convulsion of nature
do not appear to have                   extended to the northward of Tapo-
nooly     ;    as     at that place little or no damage                      was    fuiiained.
It   appears to have come from the southward, and is supposed
to have extended as far as Bencoolen ; but no accounts having
been received at Taponooly or Padang, from the southward,
between          the time         of   the occurrence         of   the earthquake and
the dale         of    the letters,         the extent    of this calamity             has not
been ascertained.
     At Natal,          the residence         of   a   subordinate of Bencoolen,
very considerable                damage      wan sustained,             and several houses
thrown down, but no lives were lost.                               It   is however     feared,
when the particulars (hall                      have     been       collected        fr m the
different quarters                on the west coast, where                  the    earthquake
was felt, that the sum, both of lives and property destroyed,
 will    be sound much greater than                      yet apprehended.
     A         Metz, dated Ventose 30 (March 20), slates,
         letter from
that     in the morning of the 24th a mock of an earth
         at fix
quake had beeu felt at Sarreguemines, Bliicatel, and other
communes of the department of la Meunlie.                                          Is'o precise
observations            were made on           its direction.       It        was so violent
 at Bitche that             it   railed up pan     of   the    arch of        the bridge, fa
as to render           it   dangerous        to be pasted.
     A    fact which scciu3 to explain this phenomenon                                 is,   that

            BOTANY,             GARDENING,                  AGRICULTURE.
  A LETTER                from        Mr. Anderson, Director of                  the Botanic
Garden of St. Vincent's,                     dated the 24th           of December        last,
has been received by the Society                           of Arts, Manufactures, and
Commerce, which brings very pleasing accounts respecting
the thriving            state    of   the bread-fruit-tree.                 In   1793,   fifty
young plants were carried from Otaheite by Captain Bligh.
They were then from 6 inches to 3 feet high. They are
now 30 feet and upwards, and the circumference of the stems
from 3 to 3 i feet.
     It   was feared,       when they were first carried over, that they
would        not have strength to stand against the violent hurri
canes       of the West Indies ; but the wood is found, on the
contrary, to be extremely tough, and well qualified to                                   resist
the severest       gusts        of wind.
     The bread-fruit weighs from 4                           to    iolbs.   each,   and is in
its greatest perfection about a week before it is quite ripe.
When baked, which is the best method of cooking
                                                                                         it,

equal,      if   not superior, to bread.                    From its first appearance,
it   is   three months before                        tit   for eating.

     The Society           also received                 some biscuit made          from the
 fruit,     which they agreed was an excellent fuccedaneum for
 bread.
     Some curious experiments, which promise importantbene-
 fits to mankind, have lately bern made                               by   Sir Francis Ford,
 to determine whether oxygene,                              or vital air, has anv effects
 upon vegetation                different     from common                   atmospheric air.
 He       f.)und   by   repeated trials, that flowers, and other plants,
 sprinkled with water that had been previously                                   impregnated
 with oxygene gas, grew much more vigorously, and even dis
 played more beautiful tints than similar plants on the fame
 ground treated with common                               water.     The water       was im
 pregnated         bya    very simple         pioeek  Bottles              tilled with water
                                                                                          were

  were         inverted over       a    common           pneumatic apparatus, and
  oxygene gas introduced till                     a    third or fourth part of the
  water was displaced          :       the bottles being then                  stopped,           were
  agitated       for some time till it was believed                           the water had
  taken up all the gas that it could receive.
       We know not whether                    the residuum            of   the gas has yet
 been submitted to any                 test, to       determine whether it under
 goes a        change by being thus wasticd by the water; but, no
 doubt, the subject will receive that attention which it merits
 from those who have the means and opportunity of repeat
 ing and following out the experiments.
       It   appears to be a subject worthy                 of inquiry, what would
 be the best aud easiest methods for impregnating water with
 oxygene? or,          which       would be perhaps                   still    better,           what
 would be the best substance to be thrown upon land to ena
 ble     it,   or the moisture         it   contains,      to absorb               the    greatest;
 quantity of oxygene from the atmosphere                          ?
     Some experiments              have been            lately made           in    the neigh
 bourhood of Bristol, under                  the immediate inspection                         of one
of the members of         the Bath Agricultural                       Society, with               re
spect to the culture       of madder           j       the result     of which             is,   thai

fold to the dyers at      a    cheaper rate than that imported, being
of   a   quality equal to that grown in Zealand.                               In       1756      the
king of         France issued an            edict,      exempting from land-tax
for the space of 20 years (that    to fay, in all fields newly
                                                  is
broken up) all cultivators of madder in drained marshes and
other waste and neglected                   grounds.        In    1762 the Board                   of
Agriculture        held at Beauvais            made       it   plain to all persons
concerned in dyeing, tbat madder raised                          in   that district, and
used while the roots were fresh gathered,                         gave        a    finer tinc
ture than the Zealand madder,                     and went further                 in    the pro
portion of eight to five. In the fame year  was ordered in          it
council, that no tax, for the space of 20 years, should be
levied upon grounds newly broken up, provided                                           the      said
grounds had lain 20 years in au uncultivated state.                                     In 176!

   Citizen Baudin,                    commander of la Belle Angilique,
who, with several botanists and naturalists, was                        sometime
ago sent on       a voyage        of discovery     by government, has just
returned from America,                  and     has brought with him the
richest   collection of living plants ever               seen    iu Europe.          He
fus brought home in all 3500 exotic*, among which                                    are
several    cabbage         trees, cocoa-nut        trees,   and     alligator pear
trees (luurus Ptrsea).                 Some of the trees are 25 feet in
height, and from 12 to                15 inches in diameter. Besides the
collection of living            and dried plants, he has brought                 with
him various specimens                 of wood, birds, infects,          and many
other objects of natural history.
   Captain Baudin on his arrival attempted to enter the port
of Havre, as being the most convenient for transmitting his
collection to Paris, but was prevented by the English squadron
which blockades             that port.        1 he Englisli commander told
him     his orders were         such, that he could suffer no               vessel    to
enter Havre       ;   but, in a very handsome manner, directed him
to proceed to the east           of Fecamp,      the only place in the chan
nel not blockaded            by ihe division under his command.

  A VEIN of cobalt               was some time ago discovered                 in the
Wherry mine           near Penzanre in            Cornwall, which,           we are
happy to announce,              has turned out very rich ;            but   as   they
have no person there perfectly acquainted with the process                            of
smelling    it,
              it      is   to be feared that its true value          will   never be

Ikilful mineralogists in Cornwall;      and that we have no good
fraBical work in   the English language to enable them to apj-

from working the rich tin and copper mines in that county.
Kirwan's Mineralogy is an able scientific classification and
brief analysis of the subjects of which he treats ; but we
want some popular works like those of Professor Klaproth.
For want of proper books of this kind in          the English lan
guage, there is reason to believe that many valuable mineral
products are every day lost in Cornwall       ; for every substance
that appears not to possess the characteristics of the tin or
copper, of which they are in search, is thrown away among
the rubbish.    This   was the cafe with the cobalt vein, when
a gentleman    of more knowledge than         the proprietors hap*
pened   to observe it.
              WEIGHTS       AND MEASURES.
   IN  the month   of March    last Citizen   Aubry    presented   to
the Council of Five Hundred       a work containing the propor
tions between all the measures possible, and a simple method
to discover these proportions.       This work is considered in
France    as a certain step   towards an     universal  standard   so
much desired.
   Sir George Evelyn Shuckburgh          has lately laid before the
Royal Society the result of many years application and study,
upon the subject of a universal standard for weights and
measures.     He proceeds upon the principles of the late in
genious Mr. Whitehurst, and uses the identical instruments
he employed.     The mean measure is derived from the dif
ference in length  of two pendulums performing            a different
number of vibrations in a minute.

 x\N       hexagonal frame        ABCD, (Plate V.) formed of ten
 inch square beams, joined together,           rests   upon twelve strong
posts driven into the ground.          On   the smaller hexagon        of this
 frame stands the under part        of the building      aaaa, which      rises
 to the height of fourteen feet, and is supported by braces ot
 spurs.     On the beams which            compose     the   upper frame of
 this part of the building        lies  a horizontal     wheel,    12 feet   in
 diameter, which is made fast by means of iron screws.                       A
 small hexagonal cabin         of   the like diameter,       and 7* feet in

 motion of the telescope.

by means of iron wedges used as in the Dutch windmills, can
be so elevated that the whole upper part of the building may
be moved               upon eight rollers placed                      above    the horizontal
wheel.            A    small vertical           cylinders proceeds                 along the       side
 <jf   the cabin down to the horizontal                             wheel, and at the lower
end has an eighteen                    inch wheel           g   with twelve. teeth, which
fit into those of the large wheel.                              The small wheel, to de
fend        it   from the injuries of the weather,                            is    inclosed in      a
box.          To       the top    of this           small    cylinder,       which        rises three
feet above the platform,                        is   affixed    a   cross-bar lever         xx,    and
the cylinder has its point                      of motion        in  a    collar at   h,    in which
small rollers arc applied to lessen the effects                               of friction.          By
turning the cross the whole cabin moves round its axis, and
the tube          of    the telescope           1    1,   connected with       it,   is   thus made
to move            also horizontally.                     The vertical movement of tht
tube, which was                   attended                with considerable          difficulty,     is

bottom into the uprights of the cabin.                                     They      arc supported
bv strong braces, and, where necessary, arc bound fast with
iron screws.    To prevent all lateral agitation, Professor
Schradcr placed at right angles on the two horizontal beams

 strength, each                 end     of which              projects five feet over the

 pricked lines), and               a    strong oblong rectangular frame moves
 in this          groove         by   means of four small                     iron rollers fixed
 to the corners with screws.                                 By the        cross    lines    vv     the

 place of the frame only is marked.              In this frame the tube is
 made to move on a strong roller.               At the upper end of the
 frame is suspended one box               of  a tackle  of fix pulleys, the
 second box     of which is      fastened to the    cross beam / / of the
 hanging frame-work,            and the rope Ip, proceeding from the
 tackle, is wound round the cylinder of a horizontal windlass,
 the handle     of which       is  in part visible    at /  1.    The    second
 resting-place of the tube is in           a fork on the top of an iron
 rack q, by which the more accurate movement both vertical
 and   horizontal       is effected with the greatest ease.             When
 the handle     1 1   is turned round, the sliding frame together
 with the tube rises or falls, and a common spring catch ap
 plied to the windlass keeps the tube            in that  position to     which
 it has been       brought.        To counteract the weight of the
 tube, which        increases     according to the perpendicularity of
 its position, the Professor          fastened   to the end     of it   a  small
 tackle, the rope of which, carried over a pulley fixed to
 the cross beam       7/,  sustains a re-acting weight       of  120 pounds.
This weight        acts only from the perpendicular               situation    of
 the tube to about that in which it is represented in the plate.
The quick horizontal movement, which is effected by means
of the cross-bar lever with the cylinder and horizontal wheel,
 requires a power of about forty pounds ; so that the observer
can, with great ease, turn the tube round the whole hori
zon, though the weight of the construction taken together
amounts to about 12,000 pounds.
    From    comparing this description with the figure in the
annexed     plate, it will be seen that the gravity, both on ac
count of the weight of the hanging frame-work                        and    that
of the tube,         must    incline    too much     to one    fide   :  it was
found necessary,          therefore, immediately after it was con
structed,    to   devise     the   following    counterpoise    :    The two
horizontal beams G          G,   a  foot square, which support the gal
lery   FF,    with the ladder that conducts to the platform,
were made to project on a level             with  the bottom part        of  the
cabin.     The weight of the gallery and                 ladder      caused    a
                                       I%                            lessening

lessening        of the weight                 towards          the    opposite side ;            but,    atf
this was not sufficient, the Professor                                 made         the horizontal
beams       to be covered                  w   ith boards, by which                     means       it   ac
quired     so   much ballast that the centre of gravity of the whole
top    rested       on the       steel     gudgeon         c.     The       small balcony con
tains    a seven-feet               telescope         ten inches           in diameter, which
the Professor suffers always to remain in the open                                               air, and
uses as a       hand telescope.                      For   the greater security, a strong
iron rod, concealed by the wainscoting in the inside, is con
voyed along the floor and to the top of the cabin.        The
lower extremity of this rod ends in two branches screwed to
the floor, and              the upper part                 rises one foot above the plat
form.       On         the       top    of it      is stuck the key which serves for
moving          it;   and      by   less   than half       a    turn of this screw, the ob
server    is    enabled          to prevent al! agitation                of the building, bc-
eause     the        rod then presses                with force         against the surface of
the horizontal              wheel.             Properly,        however,           there arc three
screws,        forming           an equilateral triangk-,                      which        effect       this
fastening, two of which                          in the cabin are very stiort, and
the whole arc               so   arranged, that             it    is   necessary to move the
long screw only on the platform.                                 Thus,            by   its force,    it    as
rt were moves the upper platform from its level,                                            and presses
it   a   little,      imperceptibly inclined,                     towards the two screws,
which          by     their pressure on the horizontal wheel prevent all
agitation.

utility.        The     great weight              of    the speculum requires                    that it
should be alwavs kept in the tube, and this renders necessarv
a peculiar apparatus not requisite in smaller telescopes.  It
is well known that large metalline masses acquire very slow
ly the temperature                     of   the atmosphere.                  The         consequence
is, that specula are very frequently covered with the evapo
ration from the atmosphere, which condenses on them.                                                    If
the composition of the metal be not good, the speculum soon
becomes         tarnished.             The        cause    of this         lies     in      too large      a
quantity         of copper, which forms                 component part of the
                                                               a
mass,      and therefore               it    must be combined with  sufficient              a
quantity of tin.                  Edwards's            composition in this respect                       i*
much preferable               to all other mixtures.                       By more than forty
experiments Professor Schrader dilcovered                                    a     very good mix
ture   ;   and        specula      made       os    it    were       so   excellent,         that they
might be exposed to considerable                              evaporation without losing
much of their splendour.                           As    in   a    close apartment no body
can be tarnished,                 if   a    speculum       Ik:     iluit up during hot               and
moist weather                the       above       inconvenience                can be avoided.
Professor Schrader has secured his speculum                                        by   a   cover made
of    brass rings,           eight inches broad, soldered together.                                  The
centre      screws,          as    well      as   the     iron circle which                  keeps     the
speculum          in    its position,             arc properly fixed in these rings,
and,       by   means        of two         capes with handles, which internally
are lined with leather, or, what                           is      better,      with the skins of
moles, the speculum                    is   kept perfectly free from air.
      The period of               the day at       which          the speculum can be un
covered         for   use,    depends on the length                       of time which           it    re
quires to assume the temperature                              of   the atmosphere.               A   few
experiments will                  here conduct to the proper regulation.                                   A,
good rule for guarding against tarnishing   to endeavour                          is,
as much as possible to keep   continual draught of air in

employed in such positions                         that the rain may not penetrate
through them.                 A     small     stage      for the purpose of getting at

 JL    IIESE             small      birds are of        blackish grey colour, in

clining      a    little to green          ;     but on the back to the tail, as
well    as   on the belly, this blackish colour gradually changes
into   a     mouse colour.                The whole length of                     the    bird from
the bill         to the tail         is   about four inches and                   a   half, and its
height from the bill to the extremity of the middle toe three
inches and          a    quarter.          The    distance from the tip                  of   the one
wing to that of the other, when extended,                                    is   ten inches and
a   quarter.         The       largest feathers          of    the wings are about four
inches in length.                   The    head     is   flat; but, on account                    of   the
thickness of the feathers, appears round, and to be of                                        a     large
size    in proportion                to the       rest   of    the      body.           The bill         is
broad,        and ends in           a   sharp extremity,                bent downwards                  in
the    form of       an awl.          The width of            it   is   increased        by   a   naked
piece       of    skin    somewhat like parchment,                           which, when the
bill   is   shut, lies folded together, but                        which, when                the      bill
opens,       is   considerably          extended,        and enables the bird to catch
with    greater cafe,             while on wing,               the      infects that          serve     it
for food.           The        eyes are black,            and      of    a   considerable           size.
The tongue, which                    is    not forked,         is    shaped like an arrow.
The     cars arc flat, round,                     naked       spots,      with     small      oblong
openings, and arc entirely concealed                                 under the feathers of

facility attach itself to cracs and rocks.              The tail    is fully as
long    as  the    body together with          the   neck and the head.
When       expanded      it has the form of      a wedge,    and consists     of
ten large feathers.          The four first on each side are long, and,
when the tail is closed, extend almost an inch beyond the
 rest.    The other      feathers decrease towards        the middle     of the
tail, and are equal to about the length of the body.
    The whole bird          is exceedingly light and tender.            Ten of
 them together weighed little more                 than two ounces and a
 half.     The Javanese call it lawit; but           those who live in the
 mountains, berongdagee or waled*.
    There are two places in particular near Batavia where
 these birds are found in great numbers.                The   first, Calappa
 Nongal,     lies about ten miles southwards           from the city; the
 other, Sampia,         is a little more      distant   towards the south
 west; but they are both in that range of high land extending
 towards the      sea,   which is apparently different from the large
 ridge that extends over the whole island. Besides these there
 are   also several other places           in the fame district, or at a
 greater distance from the coast, which either produce                   a  few,
  or arc carefully concealed         by the Javanese to whom they aro
  known.
    The two bird mountains             before mentioned,        called by the
 Javanese caverns          {gea),   are insulated    rocks, hollow within

and pierced      with      a great     number of openings.             Many of    .
these openings are so wide,              that  a person       can enter them
with   ease; others are attended          with more difficulty;       and some
of them    are so small, that nature evidently seems to have been
desirous   of providing for the          security    of  these little animals,
On the      outside     these rooks arc covered with a multitude               of
strong tall trees of various kinds.            The     inside consists  of grey
calcareous stone and white marble.                   To    the walls of these
caverns     the birds affix their small nests in horizontal                rows,
and    so close   that they for the most part adhere together.
They construct them              at different heights from 50 to 300
feet ;   sometimes        higher or lower,         according as they find
room    ; and no     hole or convenient place,            if dry and clean, is
left unoccupied; but if           the walls be in the least wet or moist
they immediately desert them.
    At day-break        these birds fly abroad from their holes with
a loud fluttering         noise,    and   in the dry      seasons rise so   high
into   the atmosphere         in   a  moment,       as they must seek their
food in distant parts, that they are soon out of sight.                  In the
rainy season, on the other hand, they never remove to                    a  great
distance from their holes, as has been often remarked, parti r
cularly in the government of Java, where there arc some
rocks situated very close to the shore.                     About four in the
afternoon      they again return, and confine themselves so
closely to their holes, that none of them are seen any
more flying       either out or in, but those which arc hatch
ing.
    They    seed  upon all sorts of insects which hover over the
stagnated water       ;  and these they easily catch, as they can ex
tend    their bills to a great width.               Their molt destructive
enemy     is a kind     of hawk      (hiiiendies), which seizes many of
them as thev       issue   from their holts       ;  and which       people,   on
 that account, take great care to frighten away by (hooting
 at them.
    Thev    prepare      their nests from the strongest remains of
 the food which thev use, and not of the scum of the                       sea or
                                                                               of

 of   sea   plants*,     as has been asserted.            This    seems the more
 probable, as it        is known, from experience, that those birds
 which build their            nests in the two rocks before mentioned
 have never been found on the sea-coast,                    and could not pos
  sibly fly thither and return again in             so  sew hours, on account
 of   the   high intervening mountains,                and the stormy winds
 that often prevail among them.                 The    great difference      in the
 colour and value of these nests proves that their goodness
 depends      merely on the superabundance                  and quality       of  the
 insects on which           they feed, and perhaps on the greater or
 less solitude     of the     place where they seek            for nourishment.
 Those found on the territory of Calappa Nongal and Goa-
 gadja     are exceedingly grey,            and worth one third less than
 those     produced      in the territory of Sampia            ;   and the     latter
 again arc not to be compared with an excellent fort which
 are every year imported from Ternate and Pastier, or which
 arc to be found on the             surrounding        islands, particularly to
 the   east  of Borneo.
     These birds employ two months in preparing their nests;
 they then lay their eggs, on which they                       sit  for fifteen or
 sixteen     days.      As    soon    as   the young       are fledged,      people
 begin to collect          the nests,      which is done regularly every
 four months       ;  and this forms the harvest of the proprietors
 of these rocks.
     The    business      of taking down the            nests is performed by
 men      accustomed        from their youth to climb                these recks.
 They construct        ladders     of  reeds (bofehrotting)        and bamboos,
 by which they are enabled to ascend to the holes                     ; but,  if the
 caverns arc too deep, they employ ship-ropes.                        When they
 have got to the bottom of the caverns, they place bamboos
 with notches in them            against     the wall,    if these   be sufficient
   *  This   has  been    hitherto   generally   believed,   and copied from      one
naturalist by another.       Houtrrn himself in his Natuurlykc Hijhrif, vol. i.
part v. p. 637, gives a description of the bird as well as of its manner           of
fteding, which is considerably       different from the above.
                                                                                  in

133              Account os the Javanese Swallow,
in order    to get up to the nests ; but         if they cannot reach
them in this manner, they stand on the ladders and pull the
nests down     with   poles   of bamboo made for that purpose.
There    are also   certain holes to which people can ascend by
means of     stages   made    of bamboos     ; but these are exceed
ingly few.
    This employment, which is attended with great danger,
costs the lives of a great many men, and particularly of
thieves, while attempting to rob these caverns at improper
seasons.     For this     reason,   small watch-houses      are every
where built in the neighbourhood.
    The mountaineers, who          are those    chiefly accustomed   to
this employment, never undertake their labour till they have
slaughtered     a buffalo,  which is the      usual preparation   made
 by the Javanese for all their undertakings.              On such oc
casions they mutter over a few prayers, anoint themselves
with aromatic oils,      and fumigate the holes with sweet-smell
 ing  substances,    which, according to their ideas, are things
 all highly necessary.       At the chief of these caverns in the
 island of Java, a particular protecting female deity is wor
 shipped under the name        of Raton Lout R'niul, or     princess  of
 the south sea.      A  small hut with a covered sleeping- place      is
 there appropriated for her, together with various elegant
 articles of dress, which no one but a princess must approach ;
 and every Friday when the nests are taken down incense is
 continually burnt, and        the  body and clothes of every one
  who intends    to ascend the rocks must be exposed to it.        The
 other Javanese are not        so superstitious,    and content them
 selves  with much fewer ceremonies.             To afford them light
 jn the cavern, they employ torches made of the resinous
 gum of a large tree called caret, and the inner bark of the
  arek-trec.
     The collecting of the       nests continues      no longer than a
  month, and,     as  already mentioned,        may be repeated three
  times in the year.        Some believe      tha{  it may  be done    a
                                                                 fourth

fourth time; but this is not probable, as all experienced
people brought up to this employment              confidently assert,
that a nest as long as it remains entire is continually enlarged
by the bird, or made thicker, until it is entirely deserted by
her when it has become dry or hairy in the inside.
    When the        nests have been collected,    no farther trouble
is necessary than to dry them and clean them, after which
they are put in baskets and fold to the Chinese.         The price of
them is variable, and depends on their whiteness and fine
 ness.    Some of them have a grey, and others a reddish ap
pearance.       Those of the bell sort are exceedingly scarce.
They    are sold at the rate    of from 800  to 1400 rix-dollars   per
 125 pounds.        This high price,   and the insatiable avarice   of
 the   Chinese, give rise to much dishonesty          and thieving;
 especially  as the Chinese make no ceremony           of bribing the
 watchmen with money, opium and cloth              ; and this,   even
with the utmost vigilance, cannot be entirely prevented.
     The two places above mentioned, Calappa Nongal and
 Sampia, belonged formerly to the Dutch East India company;
 but as the advantages arising from them were in part much
 lessened by the Javanese, and        in part not well understood,
 government       resolved,   in the year 1778, to sell them by
 auction to the highest bidder, and received for them almost
 a hundred thousand rix-dollars, a sum far exceeding what was
 generally
 c           expected.      Besides these, there are several other
 places of the like kind, in the above range of mountains,
 though of     less  importance.     There  are two or three also   in
 the high land in the interior parts of the country, and         seve
 ral small ones which are kept concealed with great care. Three
 considerable bird mountains, Goa Daher, Gede, and Nanga-
 sari, are  situated in the government       of Samarang in Java ;
  and these are washed by the sea,      which forces its way so deep
  into the latter, that fish may be caught in it. In these places
  the nests are of an excellent quality ; but it is exceedingly
  dangerous   to collect them on account      of the  steepness of the
                         5                                       rock*

apparatus made     of bamboos       must be employed.
    About 2500 pounds weight of             these nests are collected
every year in the island of Java.
    There are bird caverns       also  in Bantam      and the   island of
Sumatra ; but the inhabitants          of the former arc    so indolent,
and the government so bad, that rice even is not sown, nor
is any other article necessary for the support             of life culti
vated.     The Chinese     have never ventured to penetrate          into
the interior part   of that kingdom,       and have      no intercourse
with the mountaineers        ; so that little can be expected from
that quarter.
    The young birds are eaten both by the Javanese and the
Europeans in India, but it is difficult to procure them.
They    are considered    to be very heating.        The   nests, on the
other hand, when they have been boiled to a flimy kind                 of
soup, exposed    in the night-time      to the dew, and been mixed
with   sugar,  are exceedingly cooling.         The Javanese employ
them therefore, with much advantage,                 in violent fevers.
The author of this paper saw also that, when prepared as
above, they were prescribed       with good success for sore throats
and hoarseness.      This remedy, in all probability, has been
borrowed from the Chinese, who, as a rich merchant of that
nation who carried on a great trade with these nests assured
the author, eat abundance          of them during the winter,         be
cause sore throats      arc   then very common in the northern
 part of that extensive kingdom, on account of people sitting
 so much over the sire.
    But this nourishing       and strengthening quality, so much
 extolled,  the author   was   not able to discover, though he used
 a considerable    number      of   these   nests,   prepared   different
 ways, in order to be convinced          of the truth.       He    caused
 them to be examined          by able chemists     ;  but nothing more
 eoujd be observed,     than that the solution presented a weak
                                                                     gum

gum with a disagreeable taste, which perhaps might                  be   of
some use in slight indispositions of the breast.
    These nests, therefore, are merely an article of luxury to
ornament the tables of the rich.          The Chinese are remark
ably fond of them.          After being     soaked and well cleaned,
they put them, along with a fat capon or a duck,                  into an
earthen pot closely        covered, and suffer them         to boil     for
twenty-four      hours over a flow fire, which they call timmen ;
and on account of this addition the whole dish acquires a
more luscious taste.
    The   trade   carried on with these nests was some years ago
not   so considerable, but of late it has much increased.             Thes
high price of them in China, which is still advancing, makes
Batavia the principal mart of this commodity, which, as the
company have now given it up, is employed very advantage
ously by the inhabitants to lessen the prejudicial exportation
of   specie.
    That this    species  of swallow is not to    be found      in China
is now sufficiently known.
    Linnæus in his Syji. Nut. gives, as a distinguishing mark
of the Hlrundo efculenta, that it has white spots only on the
 feathers of the tail.        The small birds in Java, however,
 which construct      these nests,  have spots neither       on the tail
 nor on any other place.          The tail feathers     are entirely      of
one colour, blackish grey above, and a little brighter below.
     Rumph     says of his capodes  marina, that the     feathers    of the
 tail were spotted, and that the breast also was speckled black
 and white.
     Valentin, in his description of the small swallow which
 constructs eatable nests, mentions neither spots nor speckles,
 aud fays only that the belly was undulated          white     and black.
 If these   are to be considered    as essential   differences, it will
 follow that there arc two kinds of these swallows           :   one with
 a speckled breast and white        spots on the tail feathers, and
  the other without      spots or speckles.    A  third kind of these
  swallows would be those called     momos    or botrongitams. These
                                                                        also

spoil   the habitations            of the better kinds.                They     are distin
guished  from the latter merely by being larger, and having
the legs down to the feet covered by small feathers.

 JL H E        manufacturers at Astracan, besides red cotton yarn,
the process for dyeing of which has been given in the pre
ceding number of this Journal, prepare also blue, yellow, and
green, which they give out to be dyed by regular dyers.
The process which they employ is briefly as follows :
     The principal           dye is the blue,        which   is employed both for
cotton and silk.              To   prepare     it,   the indigo or blue dye-stuff
is   finely pounded, and dissolved in water                       by   a   gentle heat in
large earthen jars, seven of which stand in brick-work over
the fire-place, at the distance of about an ell and                          a   half from
each         About two pounds are put into each vessel.
         other.
Five pounds of the soda or kalaiar, mentioned in the process
for the Turkey red, finely pounded, together with two
pounds of pure lime and one pound of clarified honey, arc
added to each          :    when these ingredients have been well mixed
the fire     is    strengthened       ;    and when the whole begins to boil
the dye       is   stirred carefully round in all the vessels, that every
thing may be completely dissolved                         and mixed.            After   the
first boiling the sire           flackened, and the dye
                                is                            suffered lo  is

this    is   continued even after the furnace                is   cooled, till    a   thick
scum arises           in   the neck   of   each   jar, and   soon after disappears.
                                                                                        The

The    dye is then allowed to stand two days, until the whole
is incorporated, and the dye thickens.
   The dyers assert that with this dye they can produce three
(hades      of blue,     and     that, as the dyeing particles gradually
diminish,        they can dye also a green colour by. the addition
of yellow.
     When        a manufacturer             gives     cotton yarn to a blue dyer,
he first boils it at home in a ley of soda (kalaiar), then dries
it,   washes     it,   and     dries   it   again.         The blue dyer lays this
yarn to       steep    in pure water,        presses       out the superfluous water
with     the     hands, and then immediately begins to dip                                   it    in
the blue    jar, often wringing  till     completely penetrated
                                             it        it   is
 by    the dye. This first tint generally given to yarn in such
                                            is
jars   as have had           their colouring matter partly exhausted.                              It
is    then dried, rinsed, and again dried                      ;   after which,         it   is   put
 into the fresh blue dye, properly saturated                                   and, after the
 colour has been sufficiently heightened,                          it   is ;   dried for the last
 time.
      For    a   yellow dye,       the dyers of Astracan employ partly
 saw-wort,   brought from Russia, and partly the leaves of the
 kijlar beige or sumach. The process        as follows    The      is                    :
 yarn    is    first boiled for an hour               in   a   strong ley        of soda;       it   is
 then dried, afterwards rinsed and laid wet to                                 steep   for twelve
 hours in      a   solution of alum with warm water.                                When     it   has
 been dried in              the air,   it    is   laid to soak several times in
 troughs with the dye which has been boiled thick in kettles
 from the above-mentioned                         plants, till      it    has acquired the
 wished-for colour, care being taken to dry each time                     it                      it   is
 soaked.        then rinsed in running water, and dried for
                 It    is
 the last time.
       On this yellow colour                a    green      is   often dyed.            After the
 yarn has been dyed yellow,      given out to the blue dyer,
                                                 it   is
 who immediately dips     in the blue jars, the dye of which
                                       it
  has been         already partly exhausted                ;     and   if      the green colour
 is    not then sufficiently high, the operation                               is   repeated,      the
  yarn being dried each time.

 IV.    Observations     on a   Jun&hn of the Red        Sea to the Mediter*
         ranean.      From the Journal de Physiqueyir 1798.
 JL's     is needless to attempt to prove           of how much import
 ance    it would    be to form a       junction between the Red Sea
 and the Mediterranean.             Every one is sensible that it might
 produce invaluable advantages in regard to the civilisation of
Asia and Africa;           the   reciprocal    commerce both between
 these two parts       of   the world,     and     between them and the
whole of Europe          ;   and   particularly      in regard to France 3
especially when it shall have joined the Mediterranean to
 the German sea, as I proposed in 1786, when I published
The Junction of the Rhone with               the    Rhine.
    It  would     be useless also to examine every thing that has
been said by ancient historians,              respecting    the great works
that may have been executed,               or only undertaken, for that
purpose,      by the kings and other sovereigns or governors                of
Egypt, from Sesostris or Pfammeticus down to Trajan or
Adrian, since no traces or certain descriptions of them
are    remaining     ;  and since      so  many efforts      made   so  often,
and in such various             ways, from        time immemorial,       only
serve to prove        the great    importance        that has always been
attached       to this enterprise, even when            it could  have been
attended      only with     a  local or very limited utility in compa
rison of what it holds out at present.
    It  is however certain, that an able engineer, by examining
the country with attention,              would there       discover remains
sufficient to convey just ideas respecting             the vague and con
tradictory accounts of the situation, the direction, entrance,
and exit      of  these several canals.        But all this would       be  of
little benefit. He would doubtless perceive, that               if some   or a
part of these works           have    been  effaced or destroyed by the
hand of time, or abandoned on account of wars, or throueh
the policy or instability of governments, none of them were
planned or executed in such a manner                  a$ to answer  fully the
                                                                          end

 toid   that ought to be proposed at present.                   They cannot,
therefore, be assumed          as models   or helps       for  any new work
of   the fame     kind  ;   which,    however,      as  will    here    be seen,
could be executed with much             ease and    simplicity,       supposing
the Undertakers       had     entire and peaceable         possession     of the
isthmus and western coast of the Arabic gulph,                      as well aS
of the    course  of the   Nile,    and   all the intermediate country
advancing     a great  way towards the south*
    Without giving credit          to a pretended      higher level       of the
Red Sea than of the Mediterranean,                    which is not pro
bable, we must,        according to the account             of all travellers,
admit there       periodical      tides   and     accidental        elevations,
amounting from five to fifteen           feet ;  and     this is sufficient to
prevent every plan        of  a communication          between       these two
seas,   constructed on a perfect level, and always navigable
for the largest vessels, since an influx of waves so great
would ravage it from the one end to the other, and certainly
be followed by an ebbing so low as to render the Mediterra
nean     higher and destructive in its turn.               But what would
oblige the undertakers to renounce this                tafle   is the impossi
bility of digging     a long and continued           bed,     to the depth      of
twenty feet below the level or the two adjacent                      seas,   in a
district which no doubt rises much more above that level,
and    which   is said to consist entirely      of hills   and downs       of ex
ceedingly moveable           sand,   where the construction and pre
servation   of  a canal   would be like the labour of Penelope.
    We    must not, therefore, think        of joining     these two seas but
by   a  river navigation for barks or boats drawing six or eight
feet   of water   at most,     and between two ports, such as Suez
on the one side and Grand Cairo,                Fostat or Boulac on the
 other, which seem to have been destined for that purpose,
since their direct distance is only twenty-five                  leagues,    and
since the eastern      branch of the       Nile below Cairo           is as deep
as the sea itself at Damietta, Zan, 80c.
    But it  is necessary not only to give the new canal the least
length, but also the smallest elevation possible.                  But accord-

ing to every account, the nature of the ground will oppose
the full execution of these two objects, and seems to (how
that they might                 thwart         The only method
                                            each     other.                                    .
then is to       weigh them both together, taking matters even in
the worst        light ; and to determine the question                       I   propose
the following preliminary considerations                       :
   1 . The             which the canal ought to have
                  least elevation
from one end to another, should be equal to that of the
greatest tides or swellings               of which    the Red Sea is susceptible.
The     level    of the canal would           be thus fixed,          and all the      dif
ferences        from the highest             to the lowest           rising of the      sea
would be counteracted                    by one or two locks, as it might be
possible to counteract at the other end all the overflowings
of the Nile, which probably                    rife higher,         and   which in that
cafe would require flood-gates.
     2. There are two other methods                     which might         be adopted
in   the like case, but             which would        be far less advantageous.
One of these, which would                     save   the necessity of locks both
towards the         sea   and towards the Nile,               is,   not to allow boats
or other        vessels to     come from or enter the sea but twice                a   day
at the times        of    »he   tides,     and not to come from or enter the
Nile but when             it   is   at its greatest heights.          But this would
lay too great        a    restraint on commerce, particularly at Cairo,
where the transportation of goods would not be possible but
during two or three months     but still the level would be
                                              :
come doubtful and variable, like all tides and inundations                               ;
and       would necessarily be alternate currents, which
        there
would render the water brackisti and unheahhful, not only
in the canal, but also in the Lower Nile.
   3. The other method, in order to exclude locks altogether,
or at least in part, would be, to depress more the bed and
level    of   the canal, taking care to guard                 it    at each end   b/the
flood-gates, which would permit                        vessels      to enter the sea or
the river at the times of their greatest elevation. But, though
this method might render the course                       of   the navigation          freer
and less interrupted,               it   would not prevent the mixture of the
                                                                                    freft

                           with the Mediterranean.
                                                                                  131
fresh and salt waters.            It would     save   nothing cither in con
structing or the labour' os managing the locks                  :   in   short,    it
would increase in           a   prodigious degree the solid          content       of
toe excavations          and the general expence of the works.
  4. The                  which the canal ought to have
                 smallest elevation
would be fixed then by the greatest height of the waters
cither of the      sea   or the river.       But in    such   an extent      it is
probable that several eminences might oppose this general
level, and even in carrying the canal round these the labour
would undoubtedly be increased. In short, it would be im
possible to avoid the necessity            of making    the canal begin on a
ridge or eminence ; by which means it would descend by
two inclined planes, one on the east towards the sea, and
the other on the west towards the Nile.
 5. In that cafe the question would be, to determine the.
maximum and the place of the elevation, which could be
done only after       a*   long examination      of the   spot, and an exact
Itifvey of       the highest part     of             by means of le
                                            the ground,
velling.     The     essential object    of this examination will be,
1.   To   avoid both the sands        which are to the north, and the
rocks or mountains              that abound in the south.           2.   To find
rm the ridge       of the latter that       spot which would correspond
best with the following conditions, viz. that the canal might
be rendered a« short and as little exposed to windings as pos
sible ; and that its point          of departure should be so low that
vessels    might aseend to         it by the fewest possible number of
locks,     and yet give occasion           to as little digging     as   possible
3. And      as    these three conditions        will often    be unattainable
at the fame time, to balance them,                and to make them reci
procally give way and prevail in such a manner that the me
dium may ensure the most advantageous result in the greatest
number of respects.
  6. Having thus determined the summit or highest point of
departure, with the length and depth of the canal, we may
tasdy     find, and without any doubt, the means of filling                       it,
                                                                              and

 13a                On a JunS'vm     of the Red Se*
 and of feeding it abundantly by the waters of the Nile, by
 going up the river beyond Cairo as far as the spot where its
general height is greater than the level already fixed, and
 from which it will be necessary to draw off on the right bank
 a large stream or branch of water, defended by strong gates
 against   muddy water or extraordinary inundations,             and to
 conduct it gradually in an inclination of fifteen or eighteen
 lines in a hundred fathoms,           and   to make    it  end by the
shortest passage     towards the western extremity         of the point
of   departure.     This, however,      supposes that the mountains
situated to the cast cannot supply water in sufficient          abund
ance and by a shorter passage, which would be extremely de
sirable,   and which ought to be carefully examined ; for it
appears certain that the      Nile  has very little inclination below
its cataracts,     which    are nearly two hundred leagues         front
Cairo j and consequently the place where the water is drawn
off ought to be taken at a sufficient distance to be higher
than the point of departure of the canal, however little it
may have been established          above    the level   of the  highest
tides and inundations.
    7. According to the best and latest descriptions ef that
country, we may however believe that this point of departure
will neither require     deep excavation     below the surface   of the
ground, nor     a great  elevation above the mouths of the canal,
either at the Nile or the Red Sea ; for it appears certain or»
the one hand, that the last of all the ancient canals, that
ascribed to   Amron     the   Arabian, was dug in      a perfect level,
and    even open from one end to the other, proceeding            from
the   Nile to Fostat ; and     on the other, that an ordinary rife of
16 cubits    will  be sufficient  that the river may enter there at
present,    for   a length     of four   leagues,   traversing   Grand
Cairo.     There    is no reason then to doubt that this rife
would proceed to the Red Sea, and would there make some
rail, if the remains of the canal had not been filled up either
by the hand of time, ot by wars between those nations             sepa
rated by the    Adriatic.
                                                                  S.  It

                          ivilb  the Mediterranean.         
                                                                           133
      8. It is probable then that this grand communication might
 be re-established by simple cleansing or by some amendment,
  but with sluices and other necessary works at both the mouths,
  that navigation might at all times be there possible, what
  ever might be the variable height           of the    waters in the river
  and the sea ; the latter      of which, notwithstanding what has
  been said    on the subject, will be found constantly lower than
  the former even at the time        of the   highest tides.      The high
  est risings   of the Nile,   therefore,   which at Fostat are said to
  be from 20 to      %%   cubits, must determine the general level
  of  the canal, that is to fay, the height         of  the locks necessary
 to descend towards each of its extremities when the waters
 are at their lowest,       and also the distance and height           of the
 place    from which        the water   of the Upper Nile            must   be
 drawn off to feed this canal,            coasting     along the slope       of
 the mountain as far as the northern cape or promontory                      of
 Mokattan,       or from a bason       raised about thirty        feet above
 Grand Cairo.         It  would also be attended with the valuable
 advantage      of fountains  and great embellishments to that city,
 become the central mart or repository             of the ancient world.
Besides,      it would   be a powerful preservative           against insalu
brity and that contagion which            so frequently afflict that im
mense city,       on account of the drought and excessive filthi-
 ness which prevail there,
.    It may be readily seen, then, that this plan does not present
nearly so many physical difficulties, and is not such an im
mense      enterprise    as some have imagined        j  since the distance
either from Cairo to Suez, or to Colzoum, or to
                                                                   any other
port more to the south or more convenient, does not exceed
25 leagues; for that of Suez seems difficult, and to be
threatened       with being speedily choked up at the point of
the gulph which is the narrowest,                  and which becomes
narrower every day a new reason for
                                                   abandoning a canal,
though perhaps the shortest, which should proceed directly
from Suez to the Mediterranean, particularly when we con
sider the impossibility       of conducting     so  far, and amidst such
                                      K3                                a I'uU

could not be dug to the bottom, or to the level of the two

   There          is   however one important remark still to be made,
which        is,   that the present trade of Egypt with Asia                               is   carried
on merely              by   caravans,          and      by   two different ways; ont                 en

mountains of Upper Egypt, for 25 or 30 leagues only, from
Cophtos to Coseir, which       port of the Bed Sea much
                                                     is    a
casier       of   access than Suez,                  because the           sea there       is   broader
and much less dangerous.                              But       as this desile        seems to be.

 A       HESE            observations              are extracted             from   a     small      work
 published       M. Spallanzani
                        by         few                     a            years      ago,    under tho
 following title
                  " An account of some
                             :                                          species     of bats, which,
 when deprived                   of   sight,       perform their movements in the
 air    as   if   they still saw           :   a   faculty not        possessed      by   other birds
 under the like circumstances."                                And    the author fays that he
 was led to them                  by   some experiments                  which        be made           on
                                                                                                  night

                                on the Sight os         Baft.                           135
night birds.          He     let loose      several birds in a chamber per
fectly dark, and perceived                  that the bats flew about in it
without any impediment,                     and neither rushed               against    any
thing in the apartment, nor touched the walls with their
wings.   He at first imagined that they were conducted
by some glimpse of light which he did not perceive, and on
that account he blindfolded them with a small and very
close hood.          They then          ceased     to     fly;   but he observed at
the same time, that this did not proceed from any depriva
tion of light,         but rather from the constraint thence occa
sioned,    especially when            a   hbod     of   a    very light texture was
attended    with      the fame effect.
  He then        conceived          the idea     of   pasting up the eyes          of the
bats with        a   few drops of size or gum                    ;   but they still flew
about in the fame manner as                   if      their eyes had been open.
As this    however was not sufficient,                    he pasted up the eyes           of
these animals with round bits                    of leather,          and this even did
not impede them              in   their flight*.
   That     he       might at length be certain                      of his object,       he
blinded them          entirely, either           by   burning the cornea with              a
red hot wire, or           by
                   pulling out the pupil with a pair of small
pincers, and scooping out the eye entirely. Not contented
even with        this precaution,             he      covered        the wounds with
pieces    of   leather,       that    the light might have no influence
whatever on the remains of the organs which had been de
stroyed. The animals seemed to suffer very much      this                          by
cruel operation              but when they were compelled to                    use    their
wings, either         by ;   day or    by   night, and even            in   an apartment
totally dark, they flew perfectly well, and with great caution,
towards the walls, in order to suspend themselves when they
wished     to rest.           every impediment great or
                             They avoided
small, and flew from one apartment to another, backwards
and forwards, through                  the door         by   which they        were con
nected, without touching the frame with their wings.                                    In a
word;      they shewed themselves                  as     bold and lively        in     their

the       use   of their eye -fight.
    M.      Spallanzani tried the fame experiments with the fame
result on the eyes            ef the   horse-shoe bat (vespert.               ferrum equi-
numj, the dwarf-bat,                 the great bat {noflula), and the bat               of
Buffon.           M. Spallanzani             is    convinced that the other four
fenses still remaining              to these animals                cannot supply           the
want        of fight j     and he       is   therefore         of opinion that          a   new
organ, perhaps            a   new fense, which              is   wanting      in   the human
species, may         in    them be put        in activity          by   their being blind

 A        HE      experiments of        M. Jurine              were made only on the
long-eared bat {vespertil'w aurilut),                            and the horfe-slioe bat
(vespert.        ferrum equinum). The                    bats were procured from the
vaults under the fortifications of Geneva                               in   the months      of
December and               January.          The author             first    obviates    some
doubts respecting the places where                             these animals reside          in
winter, as some of them have been found in                                    a    torpid state
in the trunks of old               trees during that season.
      The author          observes,     that he found at the above season,
and in the fame vaults, abundance of moths (phalænæ) and
crane-flies (tipula), and thinks he here discovers one of those
wise dispensations            of   nature,        by    which other animals of more
utility find       a     source     of aliment when they could procure
nothing in          the atmosphere           at that rigorous season.
      The long-eared           bat has fix incisive teeth in the under jaw,

                                                                                         four,

four,     and unequal.         The    horse-shoe   bat has none in the up
per jaw, except two small ones in the membrane of the pa
late: the lower jaw is furnished with four.                When the     horse -
shoe bat attaches itself to a           wall, it contrails     its body, and
wraps itself up in its fur in such a manner that it might be
taken for a black chrysalide.                The long-cared bat appears
 less careful   of   itself,  and first   makes use of its hind feet, and
then     of those  before,     in order   to affix itself to a wall.
      The   temperature       of the vaults which         served them for a
 habitation was between 500 and 57° Fahr. that of the exter
 nal air between 2JC and 300. M^ Jurine having exposed some
 of    these animals to         a temperature       between    360 and 390,
 several    of them      perished,     and others fell into a state     of tor
 pidity   ;  from which he was not able to rouse them by any
  touching, though a gentle current of air directed against
 them caused them to make a movement, by drawing back
  the whole body on the hind legs, and this they repeated as
  often   as the  insufflation was renewed.           M. Jurine had before
  observed the same effect on mice.                He remarked, however,
  that the approach         of a candle     agitated   and awakened      them,
  probably on account of the rarefaction of the ambient air.
  A violent agitation of the air by which they are surrounded
  makes them speedily take wing.
      During the torpid state of these animals no movement
  is   observed which can indicate that they breathe.                  A small
   horse-shoe    bat,     a large bat       of the   same    species,   and    a
   long-eared      bat    were     placed    on    a stove,    and    exhibited
   signs    of life    at   different    periods;     but   their   inspiration
   and   expiration were         extremely irregular, particularly those
  of the long-eared bat. There is a striking difference be
   tween the position of these two species of bats when they fix
   themselves against        any object.      The   horse-shoe    bat hooks  it
   self all at once,       with    its head down and its legs upwards           ;
   while the long-eared bat turns itself round quietly, in order
   |p assume very often an oblique position,
                                                                            Th«

13$                 Experiments       on   Bats deprived        of Sight.
     The author then               proceeds    to the experiments            which the
illustrious Spallanzani undertook before,                           but in which great
scope was still left for the imagination.                      The author        seems to
have                        which his predecessor left for
         found the desideratum
those who might follow him in the same path.
   He extended in an apartment several willow twigs three
feet   in length,          at the distance     of    six inches from each other,
and      let loose two bats, which                  passed     and    repassed   between
them, without               touching them at all with their wings, and
which, when their flight                was ended,           always attached them
selves to the fame                cornice.     The author then cut out their
eyes ;     during which operation, the long-eared bat suffered a
considerable     hemorrhage from the ocular orbits.    Being let
loose     in that state, they still flew to the fame interstices.
These being barred up, they made choice of others, through
which      they          passed   several times,    always avoiding to touch
the twigs' with their wings,                  and for that purpose they passed
obliquely.
  The long-eared bat sometimes stretched out its neck,
and as it were made choice of that object to which it
wished to attach itself ; a custom which it had before it was
blinded.            It
             often applied one of its hind paws to its eye ;
collected the liquid which exuded from     and then applied    it,
it   with avidity           to its mouth.         These two bats lived            a   long
time after they were deprived of sight.                        Two long-eared bats,
the one blind,              and the other having the perfect use             of its
sight,    were           let loose together.        The blind          one always fol
lowed its companion,                  even observing the smallest sinuosities
of its    course.           The bat which       saw,       passed    between the twigs
with     less   delicacy than the blind one.
     M. Jurine             then extended      a     net with large meshes, after
making          a   breach in it.            The long-eared           bat   which     saw,
pasted through              it    immediately;       but the blind one stopped
short, went all over the net, and, having found the breach,
passed    through without touching                   it,   and then soon joined its
                                                                                    com

Of what        ufe then is fight to the hat, and what is the organ
that fupplies its place        ?
      The author then imagined that             the folution   of this pro
blem could be found only by anatomical refearches.                   During
 the courfe of thefe, he found the organ of hearing very great
 in proportion to that of other animals, and a confiderable
 nervous apparatus afligned to that part. The upper jaw alfo
 is furnifhed with very large nerves, which are expanded in a
 tilnie on the muzzle.
       M. Jurine then        extended    his experiments    to the organ of
  hearing and      that of (mull.        Having put     a  (mail hood on a
  long-eared      bat,   it immediately pulled it off, and flew.            He
  flopped up its ears with cotton, but it freed itfelf in the like
  manner from that inconvenience.                 He then put into its ears
   a maftic     of turpentine      and wax.     During the operation the
   animal (hewed a great deal of impatience, and flew after
   wards very imperfectly.
       A  long-eared bat, the ears of which had been bound up,
   flew very badly        : but this did not arife from any pain occe~
    firmed by the ligature ; for, when its eare were fewed up, it
   flew exceeding well.           In all probability the animal would
    have   preferred     having its ears bound up to having them
    fewed.      Sometimes it flew towards the ceiling, extending its
    muzzle before it fettled.
        M. Jurine      poured    liquid pomatum into the ears        of   a  bat
    which enjoyed        the ufe    of its fight.   It appeared to be much
    affe&ed     by this operation ; but when the fubftance was re
     moved, it took flight.         Its ears were again filled, and its eyes
     were taken out ;       but it flew then only in an irregular man
     ner, without any certain or fixed direction.
        The   ears  of  a horfe-fhoe bat, which had the ufe        of its fight,
     were   filled with     tinder mixed with water.          It was     uneafy
     under the operation,          and    appeared   afterwards   reftlefs   and
     ftunned;     but it conducted itfelf tolerably well.           On being
     blinded, it rufhed with its head againft the ceiling, beat the

    The tympanum of a large horse-shoe bat was pierced with
a pin (trois-quart). The animal appeared to suffer much from
the operation, and fell down in a perpendicular direction
when thrown into the air. It died next morning. The same
effect was produced on piercing the tympanum             of  a  long-
eared bat with a needle.
    The author then    made very accurate researches on the       dif
ference   between   the organisation   of the brain of    these two
kinds  of  bats, and, after a careful dissection,    found that the
eye  of the long-eared bat is much larger than that            of the
horse-shoe   bat, but that the optic nerve is proportioned to it.
The outer part of the ear of the former is much larger than
that of the latter, but the interior part is smaller.
    The  horse-shoe  bat is indemnified for this difference by a
greater extension   of  the organ of smell, as evidently appears
when the external elevations and irregularities       of its muzzle
are examined.       When it is about to     take flight,  it  agitates
its nose much more than the long-eared bat.
    From   these experiments the author concludes, first,         that
the eyes of (he bat are not indispensibly necessary to it for
finding its way; secondly, that the organ of hearing appears
to supply that of sight in the discovery of bodies, and to fur
nish these animals with different sensations to direct their
flight, and enable them to avoid those obstacles which may
present themselves.      The author   also found on these animals
a particular kind  of fleas.

  J7 ROM        what has been already (aid, it appears that encau
  stic painting is much better calculated than oil painting to with
  stand the power      of time     and the influence         of those circum
  stances   which destroy sooner any other kind.                 It affords this
  advantage      also to the painter, that he can lay on an un
  changeable white, which cannot be used in oil painting, as
  is proved by the fragment         of a mummy          above mentioned.
      We     are indebted   in particular to Nardi, Borrichius,              and
  Jablonstd,      for hints how to employ with advantage the
  Egyptian remains of antiquity ; but one cannot help wonder
  ing, notwithstanding all           the    illustrations    of  these   learned
  men, that they seem to be          so little valued, and that mummies
  are now almost banished          to apothecaries'       (hops, though they
  arc often monuments of sculpture on account of the exterior
,  eases in which they are preserved ; of painting, on account
   of their clothing and     bandages ; and           perhaps also   of history,
   on account       of the hieroglyphics which serve on them as
   inscriptions. In regard to the two first circumstances, mum
   mies have not hitherto been sufficiently valued by those who
   neither trace out the progress of the human mind, nor are
   interested in enquiries respecting the infancy of the arts.
   With     regard to the last point          of   so much importance, we
   often hear people fay      :  Of    what use is it to collect things of
   which we      understand     nothing    ?    It  may,    however, be easily
   perceived    that this is not the language of philosophy, whoso
   penetrating eye fees farther, and which values every thing.
    Leibnitz considered it impossible to read and explain the
    Etruscan inscriptions;       he even doubted whether they were
                                                                     characters.

characters.  Without studying good collections and Etruscan,
monuments, could it have been possible to discover the
alphabet of these ancient people ? Without the repeated re
searches      of travellers, could it         have been      hoped that            Barthc-
lemi would explain the Palmyreao                       inscriptions?           Without
possessing and examining the present fragment,                            or something
of the like kind, could any one with certainty determine the
remote period when the art of encaustic was practised, or
discover      the true method in which                  it was      employed         ?   But
we (hall allow every one to think on this subject                        as he pleases.
Our       academy      requires facts      and observations         :    any thing else
does not merit its attention.
    The      first fact,     which    I   think   I   have proved,           is,   that the
Egyptians were acquainted with and practised wax panting.
  The second     the better preservation of colours, and in
                        is
particular       of   tbe white, by means         of encaustic, notwithstand
ing the revolutions of many centuries.
  The third      that the matter of the Egyptian white colours
                      is,
        not metallic calces or oxydes, which at present are used
in is   oil painting.
    And      the fourth,      a   deduction from tbe experiments made
«f the component             parts   of   the ancient encaustic,             which differ
very much from those already 11141k' known.
  Those who are acquainted with the accuracy and certainty
of the method not long               since introduced into chemical                      ope
rations,       will   be    convinced that in 24 grains of                the encaustic
painting,        which      I   ventured to detach from the above-men
tioned Egyptian fragment, in order to subject  to exanainar-            it
tion, tbe mixture of an hundredth part of foreign substanc*  a
would have been discovered with the                     greatest:       certainty;       thai
the resin of Rcqueno must undoubtedly have been percepti
ble to me, and that the alcah of Bachelier and iorgna could
not have escaped the counteracting medium.   But in this
Egyptian encaustic   found nothing except veuy pre wax,

though     I   varied my analysis         jnevery known method.                    I     must
therefore conclude that modern learned writers, at least                                   in
                                                                                    respect

                             On Encaustic Painting.                                          143
respect to this Egyptian mode                         of painting,          were as far from
the truth as the accounts                   of ancient authors                appear    to me
precise and satisfactory ; and that the encaustum with which
formerly the fore part of (hips and the walls of houses and
temples were           painted, was something different from soap or
resinous crayons (pafitllo                 di   majlice) .
  The      basis however              of   the ancient pigments for the (kin
was perhaps formed of                 a    waxy soap, with which they com
bined lake (sues) and. white lead; and hence perhaps arose
the well-known common expression, which is still figuratively
used,      when people       that a face has buona or catt'wa eerat
                                say
according         as the complexion   appears healthful or sickly.
But    as those    who at present prepare paints for the (kin do not
use that    oil which the portrait-painters employ,                             it is not im
probable that the ancients made use                                of one composition for
paintings, and another for improving the natural complexion
of the female (kin.
      I am well     aware mat it will be asked                      :   In what manner       can
wax at present be rendered sufficiently liquid for the strokes                                 of
 the pencil,       if it   be not converted                  uUo powder or soap          ?   This
question, in niy opinion, can be fully answered from the words
 of   an ancient author, end                    in    the next place by experience,
   Vitruvius in particular, book vii. chap. ix. expresses him
 self in the following clear manner :
    " Those," says he, " who wish to retain cinnabar oa
 walls, cover       it,    when     it   has been well laid on and dried,                    with
 Punic wax diluted* in  little oil (let this be well remarked)
                                    a                                                          ;
 and after they have spread out the wax with         hair brush,               a
 they heat the wall    means of by brazier filled with burning
                                                            a
 coals (hence     called encaustic painting), and then make
                    it     is
 itsmooth and level     rubbing     by
                                   with wax tapers and cleanit
 cloths, as       is   done when marble statues are covered with wax.
 The     effect   of this wax         crust          is,   that the colour    is   not destroyed
 by- the light      of     the fun or the             moon."
      It   here    appears          by     these words             of Vitruvius that the
 Romans,          who copied the Grecian                         process,    which the latter

 144                    ®n Encaustic   Paititingi
borrowed from the Egyptians,          mixed the wax with an oil to
make it pliable under the brush ; but no mastic, alkali                of
honey,     as has been    ingeniously imagined,     and which some
have thought might be employed          with  success.    The difficulty
now will be confined to point out in what manner this oil
was emploved.        It  does not appear    that they used those fat
oils which are commonly           called drying oils ; because they
could have employed these as we do, without the addition of
wax, which in such a        case  would have been entirely super
fluous.     Fat oils which do not dry would not        have been pro
per for that purpose,     as they would have kept the wax conti
nually in the     state  of a soft pomade or salve.        Besides,   my
experiments would without doubt have (hewn me the existence
of any oily matter.
    With regard to      essential or volatile oils, a knowledge         of
them is not allowed to the ancients, as the invention of dis
tilling is not older than the eighth or ninth century, and
therefore falls in with the period of Geber or Aviccnna.
But Herodotus      speaks  in  a very clear manner     of   the distilla
tion   of afphaltes, which was     made at   Sufa;   and    I, who dis
tinguish   so much chemical knowledge among the Egyptians,
cannot suppose them ignorant          of so easy a process.      In the
temple of Vulcan      at Memphis    they had a school     of chemistry,
which flourished there for a long time,          as  we are told by
Zosimus Panoplitanus, Eusebius, Sinesius, Albufaragius,              &c.
In   order to use wax in their encaustic painting, it is certain
that they must have combined it with an ethereal volatile oil,
ot which no traces should afterwards remain             ;  because this
was required for the solidity of the work,             and because       I
actually sound this to be the cafe in the fragment which                 I
examined.       But though they might        be unacquainted        with
the art    of separating ethereal oils from the many substances
which they contain, they certainly         were   acquainted     with a
very volatile thin oil produced by nature, and which in vari
ous places issues from the earth, but probably not in Greece,
as   I found   reason   to conjecture from the    following    observa
                                                                 tions :

                                On Encaustic Painting.                             145
 tions. Strabo and Plutarch relate that the people of Ecba-
 tana, in order that they might exhibit                   a pleasing spectacle to
 Alexander           the    Great,     (hewed     him a flaming stream,             by
 sprinkling rock-oil in the             streets  of a village,     and then setting
  fire to it.       They also rubbed over with naptha                  a naked   boy,
  and then setting          sire to  it in the like manner caused him to
  run about in           a  bath.      These    people    then were acquainted
 with naptha, which issued from the                      earth     in that district   ;
  but it was not known in Greece, at                       least to the     common
 people,      as   it never     was seen by them under the like circum
  stances.       This      ethereal    oil was     used,     in my opinion,          to
  render wax fit for painting;               and it is natural to suppose that
 it would be first employed for this use where it was first
 known.           It appears to me that the Greeks, as was the cafe
 with many other things, and                    as  the above -quoted authors
  fay,     learned      encaustic     from the      Egyptians, as the latter
 learned       it perhaps       from the      Assyrians     or Chaldeans.          We
 know that Lysippus wrote expressly under one of his pic
 tures: " Painted in encaustic ;" which he would not have
 done, had not this kind of painting been new or a secret in
vGrcece.
     Naptha is an ethereal oil much lighter than sulphuric ether
 itself,    as   I  found, contrary to common opinion,                    by my ex
 periments.           It  is an exceedingly volatile          oil, which entirely
 flies off and evaporates             without     leaving a single trace of it
 behind.         On account of this            property     naptha is used,       as is
 well known,           to copy signatures and manuscripts, by rubbing
 it   over the       paper to which         it may be requisite          to transfer
 any writing, as it makes it perfectly transparent.                       The  paper
 then becomes            opakc and white as before,               after the naptha
 has evaporated.             Such in all probability           was    the cafe   with
 the   oil, which Vitruvius            does not specify,        but which,     as   he
 fays,     was combined           with    the wax.       It    was for this reason
 that    I found nq oil in         the Egyptian wax painting when               I  ex
 amined it.           We     have therefore      discovered      the   real mixture
 used     for the ancient encaustic painting.

    But, to bring my assertions to greater certainty, it was ne
cessary not only to prove the absence of every foreign matter
in the ' above-mentioned encaustic fragment by means of an
accurate analysis,       and to form some conjecture what kind of
oil must have been combined with the wax, but it was neces
sary also to search for an imitation          of it synthetically; and I
 had the good fortune to meet           with a favourable opportunity
of gratifying my      wistics in this respect.
    In   the  year    1785     my worthy friend Gultcnbrunn, an
eminent Saxon painter, now in London, resided at Florence.
 I  prepared    for  him     a  solution of Venetian wax in highly
purified napth.i,       and    desired him to mix up with it the
colours necessary for        a painting.     He immediately complied
with my request;         and we were both astonished,       as  well   as all
our friends, at the high tone which                the colours     assumed,
and    the agreeable      lustre  which    the painting afterwards       ac
quired, when it had been rubbed o\rer with a soft cloth.                    I
observed that, in following this process, the artist can de
termine the effect of the colours from their appearance on
the pallet.      This   is not the cafe when the wax is combined
w  ith alkali, gum, or mastic,          by which the pigments h?ve a
different appearance under the pencil, from that which                  they
ought to have on the painting;            because the painting,      until it
has been     dried, heated, and varnished,           appears muddy and
obscure.      At this    period   1 had only conjecture in my favour
respecting     the    composition of encaustic;           but    the result
of   the above    trial, and, (till more, my examination of the
Egyptian fragment,         so often mentioned already, freed me from
all doubt.
    I  made another preparation         of  the like kind for that cele
brated    painter Ademello,         by combining      a  quantity of the
common spirit os turpentine (acqua ragid) with wax, the                g<x>d
effect   of which     was    also extolled by that artist.       The pur
pose    for which      at present     I would apply a preparation          of
this kind, is to daub over some          of those beautiful paintings in
fresco by Giovanni da San Giovanni,              to be seen   in  the court
                                                                          of

 of   an elegant            villa near        this city, which                   in my opinion
 would certainly                preserve      them from               that       decay     through
 which        they are advancing;              with rapid         steps          to destruction       ;
 for it appears from the words                        of Vitruvius,              that encaustum
was used in the time                  of   the Romans to cover parts which had
been      already painted              cither with water colours or in fresco.
 I judge, from the analogy of effect, that this was the substance
with which    Apelles daubed over his paintings, and which,
according to Pliny, made them appear                             as    if covered        by a   thin
plate    of    talc or -transparent            selcnite,    and gave the colours a
wonderful softness.                   In   the ancient cedar oil             I   can distinguish
only the more              modem acqua ragia, or spirit of turpentine ;
consequently          that, or naptha, was the oily matter which the
ancient painters mull have used for their encaustic works.
   As experiments                made        both by analysis and combination
were favourable             to my idea,         I flatter myself that I have ap
proached           nearer       the    truth than        the      preceding celebrated
writers,       whose        researches        were      indeed         highly        useful     and
meritorious,              and     among        which       the        illustrations        of the
learned        Requeno           deserve      much       praise.             Should       this be
granted, I shall think myself well rewarded for my trifling
labour ; and nothing remains but to express a sincere wish
that I may          fee    the above         method extended to all those pur
poses to       which it          was applied    by the ancients, that                         is,   to
preserve        paintings            in water colours, or on plaster,                           and
sculptured         pieces    of marble.         Were our public                  statues covered
with      encaustum,            as    was     the cafe      formerly,             according         to
Vitruvius          and     Juvenal,          the dark moss             (lichen)      would not
adhere to their pores,                 which    disfigures        their whiteness,              and
renders       them black         ;     and    to which      the        attracting of oxy
gen      by
         carbon may perhaps somewhat                                   contribute.  Were
paintings a fresco and a tempera covered                                with wax      this in
manner,            Florence would not have                     lost     so       many     master
pieces        by   Giovanni           and Andrea,          which        it       once    possessed.
Lastly,       were this plastic             varnish     used, after          the method             of
Apelles,       to give equality to the tone                  of       the colours, and to

preserve our oil-paintings,           many valuable pieces would be
guarded     from      the    destructive     influence of the       light and
atmosphere, which change ever)' thing; insects would be pro
tected   from being spotted with dust, which greatly injure
their tints   ; and in particular we should prevent that damage
which    the common resinous varnishes occasion,                though with
slow steps, as these varnislics          not only become black of them-
lelves with time, but, as they contract in drying, and, becoming
 hard, they produce rents and cracks, and consequently bring
the paintiiiET, which it is wished to prescrv«, sooner to de
 struction.      Resinous      varnishes      are   naturally stiff and     un-
 pliable, and the materials on which most new paintings arc
 found are hygrometrie substances, which contract or expand
 in proportion      to the dryness or moisture that prevails in the
 atmosphere.         If   it be true,     as   Oberlin    observes,    that the
 varnish    (vernicc     Hi moriconi)      has    rendered   many beautiful
 paintings scaly, which were taken from the ruins of                    Ilcrcu-

 stance. But I do not fay this with a view to offend those
 judicious and meritorious persons who go lo work with pru

  than to place in       a proper    light the antiquity and superiority

    facilitating    the Business     of divers manufucluring and econo
     mical Prof ejj'es," for which a Patent, dated 24/A June 1795,
     was granted Jo " Samuel Bentham, Lfq. ofQuecn's-
    fquare, ll'ejl minster.""
  E<<VER       since the days      of Bacon,      the philosophers    of Europe
   hare employed        themselves     in determining,        by actual    expe
  riments,     the physical     properties      of  matter,   and   the laws  to
                                                                          which

                     of performing divers Proceffls.                           149
which it      is subject;     not merely to gratify a harmless                and
laudable curiosity, but with the avowed intention of reducing
to a rational and solid system         of principles,       the various arts,
manufactures, and economical              processes which,          before that
period, depended almost wholly upon chance or caprice.
    To   the result    of philosophical experiments we owe the
present     advanced    (late of science, and the many improve
ments which       have been introduced into the manufactures                     of
 Britain, and have brought them to the high state of perfection
they have attained.          Has Mr. Bentham, in the patent under
consideration,     added     to the number     of  physical       facts    before
known     ?  Has   he    discovered    any new principles to entitle
him,    as a discoverer,      to enjoy for fourteen years an exclusive
monopoly of the arts to which they apply                ?    TS»o  such thing.
Mr. Bentham          has    discovered    what    all     the    world      knew
before  what       may be       found, in various         forms,      scattered
through the pages of thousands of volumes ; namely, that it
 would very much promote arts and manufactures, if means
 could be devised to enable us to apply, in the large way, all
 the facts that have. been determined by philosophical                    experi
 ment.      Yes,   reader,    the learned   of all countries         have    been
 indefatigable in their various pursuits for           these    last two cen
 turies, only to furnish materials for the exclusive                  advantage
 and emolument        of Mr. Bentham.          But he (hall be allowed
 to speak for himself.
     Every one knows, that         a patentee  must lodge in the proper
 office  a   specification, describing his invention              in   so   full  a
 manner that, at the expiration of his term, the public may
 be able to enjoy the benefit          of  the discovery.          The    present
 patentee, in compliance with this requisite, fays,
                                                                    " I the said
 Samuel Bentham do hereby declare, that my said invention
  is described in manner following; that is to fay, my inven
  tion consists in the idea of applying to the purposes of art
  and manufacture, in the large way, the practice that has
  been so long in u/e,       of   extracting and excluding the air in
  the waj/   of philosophical    experiment."   He    then proceeds to tell
                                     L3                                          UV

150                      Mr.        Be?ilbam's      Patent Method
us, that        "air    is cither known to be, or suspected                        of being, an
obstacle to art and manufacture,                           in   a great      variety of ways ;"
but it would be insulting our readers to enumerate                                           those he
points out,           as they must             he as well acquainted                 with them         as
Mr.       Bentham           himself.          We sliall only                observe     in passing,
that,     as he       admits the fact to have been known before, it ap
pears odd that he should call the idea his invention.
     He     then       proceeds          to    exemplify-            the    uses     that may be
made       of   bis    invention,             in preserving           substances animal and
vegetable        from putrefaction.                   It        was        known,      before        Mr.
Bentham was born, that such substances might in some de
gree      be preserved      long time in vacua: but perhaps
                                  for     a
Mr.       Bentham has found out some new way of producing a
vacuum,          and therefore            is entitled to the exclusive use                     of    that
method?         No! He              says the       air must be extracted from the
vessel     or chamber by             "    an air-pump,               or otherwise;"            but the
other ways he has kept to himself.                                   Mr. Bentham              supposes
that, in the practice of potting solid substances, the fat, which
in    a    milted       slate       is thrown         round them, acts                   "    in good
measure" by excluding                         the air.          It    is partly       true;        but it
performs another work                         which      his vacuum would entirely
destroy      it      prevents the escape             of   the juice*.
      "   Many of           the   changes,"         fays        the patentee,           " to       which
bodies are subject in point                       of colour,               are known          to result
from the action of the air.                         An      exhausted chamber affords
the means of preserving them from all such changes, for any
length of time." This was known long ago ; but we sliall
suggest one use to which                        those may apply               it,   who (hall first
purchase         permission             from the patentee.                    Such      as    wish     to
preserve the colours                  of their clothes from being injured                              by
the action of the air, may get an air tight-case made for
themselves to walk     the bottom part terminating in
                                     in                                                                a
pair of boots.               After      they have inclosed                 themselves,         let their
 servant,        "     by   an air-pump            or otherwise,"                  extract     the   air,
 "    care being            taken    at       the fame      time to exclude                  the   light,
 v hen      the presence          of that element               also   is    found to influence

For    the same    reason the triangle       D P C (Jig. 16) will be oh
a level with the      trapezium D M N C (Jig. 15) ; and by rea
soning in the like manner in regard to the other pyramids,
it will    be conceived, that as the six pyramids have                  for their
whole faces twelve trapeziums              and twelve triangles,         the sur
face    of the  secondary solid     will  be composed       of twelve penta
gons, which will correspond              with the twelve rhombuses               9s
fig. 5 ; but with this difference, that they will have other
inclinations.         This solid is represented alone Jig. 19, and
with     its cubic nucleus      Jig. so,   where it may be       seen     in what
 manner it would be necessary to proceed                  in order     to extract
 this nucleus.         For example, if a section be made palling
 through the      points D, C, G, F, you will detach the pyramid
 resting on the face       DCGF          of the nucleus, which will by
 this section be uncovered.
      Among     the crystals belonging either to the sulphurc os iron
  (martial pyrites), or the arseniate of cobalt (the arsenical                  co
  balt ore of Tunaberg),             there is found a dodecaedron,               the
  faces    of which    are equal     and   similar pentagons, and its nu
  cleus is a cube        situated   as above described.         But      there   are
  an infinite number of possible dodecaedra,                        which may
  have, for faces, equal and similar pentagons, and will differ
  from each other by the respective inclinations of their faces.
  Of all these dodecaedra, the one, the structure of which would
   be subjected     to the before-mentioned laws, gives 12^° 56' 8"

   to the precision      of    seconds,   nor even to that of minutes, in
   measuring the same angle in dodecacdral                  pyrites, that mea

    proaches    so near     to the result    given by calculation,          that we

would have perceived                    a very          striking difference                between     these
two dodecaedra,                  since       the
                                          regular dodecaedron gives only
u 6°       33   '54"       as the inclination of its respective pentagons,
which          makes a difference                  of   about        11° -J between it and that
abovt mentioned. Nay, there is no law of decrement what
ever capable              of producing             the regular dodecaedron,                      however
compound it may be imagined,                                   as   I     have shewn elsewhere               f
in    regard to a cubic nucleus,                          and        as    I can          demonstrate     at
present,         generally, for              a   nucleus of any form.                         After    these
details  it may be easily seen how important the use of cal
culation         is,
             either to prove the truth of theory, or to trace
out the boundaries                    by   which         the progress              of crystallisation     is
circumscribed.
     We        have already             then two kinds of dodecaedra                              ;    one,
whose          faces are rhombufes                  ;     and        another, whose faces arc
pentagons         ;    produced upon               a     cubical nucleus, in consequence
of    two simple and                 regular laws of decrement, in                           a   direction
parallel to the edges                   of       the nucleus.                  A      multitude of new
polyedra, which will have the fame nucleus, may be con
structed,            by   varying these laws                  in    divers other ways.

the rhombuses           b  as d, g as x        (stg. 4), of the nucleus f.
    That part of the axis of the dodecaedron which exceeds
 on each side        the     axis  of  the nucleus, is equal to that axis             ;
 or, what amounts to the fame thing, the whole axis of the
 dodecaedron        is triple that     of the nucleus.
     The     twelve scalene        triangles that compose           the surface     of
 this variety have their           lesser   fides,  which     are united      two to
 two on the       six edges b      d, d  f,f x, gx,      g  c, b c  (jig. 21),     ex
 actly     situated     like those marked with             the   same     letters   in

  in two ranges of integral moleculæ ; and, as the laminæ al
  ways retain their rhomboidal figure, the sum of all their ex
  ternal     angles,      analogous to        b, d, f, x, g, c, produces fix
  longitudinal        ridges,'    which    form,   alternately, the large and

  may readily be conceived          that the laminae,          at the same time
  that they decrease towards their lower edges, ought, on the
                      f
  other hand, to increase towards their superior edges, analo
  gous to a b, a          a g, &c.       {stg. 4.)     in such    a   manner that
  the parts   of  the crystal situated towards these edges should be
  always enveloped,        and that the angles at the summits                   of the
  rhombuscs should        remain contiguous to the axis.                    But this
 is only an auxiliary variation, proper to second                      the effect of
 the decrease,     which alone       is sufficient to determine the form
  of  the dodecaedron.

     This variety, commonly            called    lenticular calcareous spar,
 arises from      a decrement       bv    a single    range     on both fides of
 the edges a b, a g,     as (Jig.      23), and      e  c, e d,  e x, contiguous
 to the summits a, e,        of the nucleus. An            idea may be formed
 of  its structure by comparing           it with that of       the dodecaedron
 whose     planes   form rhombuscs            (Jig.   5 and      12) originating
 from the cube       (Jig. 7);     and     by supposing       that   the laminæ,
instead    of  decreasing     at the same time on all the edges, de
crease only towards those contiguous,                   three by three,        to the
angle     C,  and   its opposite.        In that     cafe    the    faces     formed
will    be reduced to six,      which,      by prolonging themselves              ac
cording      to the law      of continuity, so .as to intersect each
other, will compose         the surface of a rhomboid analogous to
that in question       ; except    that it will have other angles on
account of the cubical form of its integral moleculæ.
    From what I have here said it may be easily conceived
that the diagonals drawn from a to V                (Jig. 22), from          a to g',
from a to      /,  &c. on     the secondary        rhomboid,        will    be con

cleus, which              serve            as    lines of dqiarture for the decrements.
Hence it follows, that to extract this nucleus it will be ne
cessary       to make the planes of the sections                             pass         along the dia
gonals in question,                       as has been already              remarked.

l6o                       Theory   of Crystallisation.                         *
by pointing out the position of the rhomboidal nucleus in
closed in the regular hexaedral prism of the calcareous                      spar,
was not sufficient to conduct immediately to                 a  determination
of  the laws      of  those     decrements     which     produce      secondary
crystals.     It  was necessary to pass through intermediate steps
more simple than the result of these laws in regard to the
prism in question.            I (hall now proceed to give an idea of
these last results,      which    depend on laws of decrements whose
lines of departure          are not parallel to the edges        of  the primi
tive form, but to the diagonals of its faces.
   To   assist the   imagination in conceiving the method which
I  have followed        to investigate   these new decrements,             I shall
remark, that the same substances which exhibit the dodecae-
dron with        pentagonal       planes    originating      from      the   cube
(J*g- IQ    anc* 2°)>      a,M*  wmcn m>gnt even assume the form of
the dodecaedron        whose planes are rhombuscs             (Jig.   5 and 6),
are found also under that of the regular octaedron.                        But it
appears,     on the first view, that it might be pofliblc to bring
the structure     of this    octaedron    to a decrement         on the edges
of   a cube ;    for,   if  we confine ourselves to make the laminæ
of  supeqjosition     decrease only on the edges          of   the two oppo
site faces   of this cube, for       example,     on those of the superior
base   A B C D (Jig. 6),           and  of   the   inferior base, we stiall
have in general        two pyramids applied           on   these    bases;    and-
if  we   suppose further that the faces of              these    pyramids are
extended     until they meet,         which   is nothing else than conti
nuing the effect of the law of decrements in the space situ
ated between the bases of the cube, we (hall arrive at an oc
taedron, the angles of which will vary according as the law
(hall determine a greater or smaller number of ranges sub
tracted.       But theory demonstrates              that there is no law,
however complicated it may be supposed, which is capable
of giving equilateral triangles as the           faces  of this octaedron.
    On the other hand, if we divide              a regular octaedron, ori
ginating from a cube, we (hall perceive                 that    the cubic nu
cleus is situated     in this octaedion in       such a manner that each
                                                                                of'

of   its six solid angles corresponds                            to the centre          of   one    of the
faces      of   the octaedron, which could not be the cafe on the
hypothesis       of    a   decrement on the edges.                             From this relation
of position,          added to the                 impossibility of applying here the
theoretic calculus,                  I   have concluded that the law                          of   decre
ments accomplishes its end, in such cases, by                                       a progress     differ
ent from that          which conducts                       to the forms before described ;
and my researches, in regard to that point, have unfolded a
new order of facts which add much to the fecundity of crys
tallisation, and at the same time to that of its theory.                                              But
on this subject it is necessary to enter into                                   a    more particular
investigation.
     Let   AB CD   {Jig- 27) be the superior or inferior surface
of a   lamina composed os small cubes, the bases of which are
represented by the squares                            that sub-divide the whole square.
If we      consider the series                  of cubes       to   which      the squares a, b, c,
d,   e,f,g, t, i, belong, it                     is evident that all these cubes                   will   be
on the diagonal drawn from                             A toC,            and that they        will form
one string {Jig. 28), which will not differ from the string of
the cubes a, n, q, r', s', f, a', z, x!, {Jig. 27) lying in the
direction of the edge A D ; except in this, that in the former
the cubes touch only by one                                of their      edges,      and in the lat
ter by one           of their            faces.        We sliall           observe       at the same
time, throughout. the whole extent of the lamina,                                             strings     of
cubes parallel to the diagonal, one                                 of which       is pointed out by
the scries      of   letters         </,   v,    k,   u,   x,y, z, another              by   that of the
letters n,      t,/,   m,       p,   0,    r,    s,   and      so   of   the rest.
     We may conceive then that                               the laminae           of   superposition,
insteadof projecting beyond each other one or more ranges
of cubes, in direction parallel to the edge, project beyond
                     a
each other       in    a    direction parallel to the diagonal                               ;   and we
shall construct            in   the like manner around the cubic nucleus
solids     of different          figures,              by      placing,      successively,         above
the different faces of this nucleus, lamin, which may arise
in the form of pyramids,                         and       which will        experience        the kind
of decrement just described.                               Tbe       faces    of     these solids     will

not be simply furrowed by striæ,             as  when the laminae           de
crease towards the        ridges.     They will      be roughened        by an
infinite number of salient           angles,    formed by the exterior
points of the composing cubes, which is                a necessary conse
quence    of  the continually        angular figure     presented      by the
edges   of  the laminæ       of  superposition.      But all these points
being situated on      a le\el, we may suppose the cubes              so small
that the faces of the solid will appear to form           so  many smooth,
and continued       planes.
   But this will be rendered            more striking by an example.
Let it   be proposed      to construct around the           cube   AB G F
\sig. 29),    considered as nucleus, a secondary            solid, in    which
the lamina     of  superposition       shall decrease on      all sides by a
single range    of cubes,     but in   a  direction parallel to the dia
gonals.      Let ABCD           {fig. 30), the superior base            of the
nucleus, be sub-divided into           81   small   squares,    representing
the exterior faces     of  as many moleculæ.            What will       be said
in regard to that     base    may be applied to the other five faces
of the cube.
   ^Figure3i     represents      the superior     surface   of the     first la
mina    of   superposition,       which ought to         be   placed      above
ABCD        (Jig. 30), in     such a manner that the          point a' may
answer to the point a, the point b to the point b, the point
c' to the point c, and the        points'    to the point    J.    It  may be
readily  seen by   this disposition     that the squares     A   a, B b,    Cc,
T>ti,  (Jig-.^o), remain uncovered, which will fulfil                  the law
of decrement      above described.         It is moreover seen that the
borders QV, ON, I L,            Cm F, (Jig. 31), project by one range
beyond the borders         A  B,   A D, CD, BC, (Jig. 29), which
is necessary, that the nucleus may be enveloped towards these
edges.     For a little attention will (hew, that if this were
not the cafe, that is to fay, if the edges of the lamina repre
sented Jig. 31 as well as the following, coincided with the
lines ST, EZ, YX, M U, on which supposition they would
be on a level      with     AD, A B,        C D, B C, (Jig. 30), they
would form re-entering angles              towards the analogous parts
                                                                               of

of    the   crystal.       Thus in          the lamiuæ applied                   on     ABCD
{fig. 29), all the edges answering to                         CD would                be on a le
vel   with C D F G, of which they would form a prolonga
tion   ; and in the lamina; applied on D C G F all the edges
analogous to the fame ridge                       C D would         be on a level              with
ABCD, from which                      there would          necessarily result a re-en
tering angle opposite to the salient angle formed by the two
faces ABCD and CDFG.               But the re-entering angles
appear to be excluded by     the   laws which determine the
formation of simple                   crystals.      The      solid    will     increase then
in    those      parts    to     which      the decrement docs not extend.
But as this decrement is alone sufficient to determine the
form of the secondary                  crystal, we may             set aside     all the other
variations which intervene only in                         a subsidiary         manner, ex
cept when it is wislied, as in the present case, to construct,
artificially,      a solid representation                of   a crystal,       and to exhibit
      the details which relate                 to its structure.
      The     superior         face     of the       second        lamina will            be    like
A', G', L', K', (Jig. 32),                     and    this lamina must be placed
above the preceding               in    such a manner that the points                     a', V't
c", d", may answer                    to the      points a', V,          c',   a1',    (Jig. 31)*
which will           leave       uncovered           the squares          that have            their
exterior angles situated in Q,       0, V, T, M, G, &c.
                                                      S,   E,
and continue to effedt the decrement bv one range.                                             It    is
here seen that the solid increases succcffively towards the
analogous edges at              AB,      B     C,    CD, AD (Jig.               30), since be
tween       A'   and     1/, for example, (Jig. 32),                     there        are thirteen
squares, whereas               there are only eleven between                     QV       and   L   I
(stg.       31).     But       as the effect          of the decrement contracts
more and more the surface of the laminae in the direction of
the diagonals,             nothing         is     necessary        but     to add         towards
the     edges that -do not decrease,                     a    single     cube         denoted        by

 This    square    must      be disposed      above        the preceding in         such
 a  manner that the points            c',f,   g',    b ',   (Jig. 33), may corre
 spond    with   the points       c,f, g,   h  (jig. .32).
     Figures 34,        35, 36 and         37   represent        the four lamina?
 which ought         to rise successively above the preceding,                     under
 this condition,          that the fame         letters       must     correspond       as
 above.      1 he last lamina will be reduced                      to a single cube,
 distinguished       by z' (Jig. 38), and which ought to rest upon
 that pointed      out    by the fame \cttcrjig. 37.
    It follows from what has been said, that the laminæ of su
perposition applied           on the base        AB CD           (.fig- 29 and 30)
produce by the total              of their    decreasing         edges four faces,
which, in proceeding from the points A, B, C, D, incline
one to another in the form of a pyramidal summit.
    It is here to be remarked, that the edges in question                           have
lengths which begin by increasing, as may be seen on in
specting^. 31 and 32, and which then proceed decreasing,
as may be seen by the following figures.                            It thence results
that the faces produced by the fame edges increase                               at first,
and    afterwards decrease            in breadth,          so  that they, become
quadrilaterals.         Figure 39 represents              one   of    these quadrila
terals, in    which      the  inferior     angle    C    is confounded        with    the
an<de     C (fig.     29)   of   the   nucleus     ;   and     the    diagonal     L    Q
represents the edge         L' G     of the lamina         A' G' L' K' (Jig. 32),
which is the          most extended         in  the direction          of that     edge.
And    as the   number of the laminæ of superposition which pro
duce the triangle        LCQ (Jig.        39) is less than that        of the laminæ
which     produce the triangle          LZQ,      since there is here only one
   * In   the present   case  this figure takes place from the second           lamina of
superposition.     By assuming      a nucleus composed of         a greater number      of
 mokculæ, it is evident that we should have            a more remote boundary.

will      be    a    regular octaedron.                Figure 42 shews this octaedron
in which              the cubic       nucleus         is       inclosed,          so    that each of its
solid angles            C, D,   I         G, &c.       corresponds                to the centre            of one
of        the    triangles      Z F,      N,   I

octaedron.              It   may be readily seen, that to extract this nu
cleus,          it   would be necessary to divide the octaedron in its
eight solid angles,                  by   sections parallel to the opposite                                edges.
For example,                the section          made           in    the angle         Z        ought to be
parallel to the edges                     IS, IN, TN, TS;                          and hence             will   re
sult      a     square which              will itself           be situated             parallel         to     the
superior             base   A   BCD         of   the           nucleus, and which will be
confounded with that base when the sections have made the

superposition, applied                     on this face, decrease                        by    one      range

This law of            decrement             will produce two              faces,             which pro

 like decrements         on the primitive       forni, the faces produced
 will    be twelve     in number.        But in virtue of the law of de
 crease by one         range,   the   two faces which         have   the   fame

 be in the fame plane,           which reduces the twelve faces to fix,
and      transforms the secondary crystal into an acute rhomboid
P   *  (J>g- 43)-
     This rhomboid, from what              has been said, has       its edges,
p z, py, p a,         situated each as the oblique diagonals of the
 nucleus, or those which would be drawn from a to J, from
a to x, from a to c, &c.          (Jig. 4).

parts to which the decrement does not extend,                   auxiliary va
riations, in virtue of which they are prolonged to envelop the
nucleus towards these parts, as in the regular octaedron, the
structure      of which      has been already explained.           Moreover,
while the laminæ decrease, for example on the angles                     as d,
afx,       (Jig. 4), they undergo        also towards the adjacent        angle
dfx,      variations which intervene in          a subsidiary  manner to aid
the effect     of the principal decrement.          The variations     here are
also decrements        by a simple range on the inferior angles.            But
in cafe the principal decrement should proceed by two ranges,
three ranges, or a much greater number, these variations
would become decrements of               a  particular nature, and which
would not be parallel to the diagonals.
     In   short,  we might apply here what we have already said
in    regard     to the first variations considered on the regular
octaedron, and observe, that the principal                 decrement      alone
determines the form of the secondary               crystal ; so that   this de
crement being well comprehended, nothing is then necessary
but to suppose its eflect prolonged, in order that the faces to
which it gives birth            may intersect       each   other in such a
manner       as to  circumscribe entirely the         space   to which     they
correspond.

     The laminæ which            compose       this rhomboid decrease by
  two ranges on the angles her, ocr, bco, &c. (Jig. 4^),
  which concur to the formation of the two solid angles c, n,
  of  a cubic nucleus.      The      faces produced, instead       of being on
  a level,   three and three,      around     these   angles,    ii in  the cale
  of  a decrement     by  a single range,        incline one to the other,

  that their diagonals are parallel to the horizontal                 diagonals

     By this it    is seen   that     the cube here answers the purpose
  bf  a rhomboid, which should have its summits in c and n,                     in
  which    case there  would be only one axis passing through the
  summits in question.            In the dodecaedron, on the other
  hand, with pentagonal planes              (Jig.  19),   the cube performs
  the functions of      a  rectangular parallclopipedon,              and    then
  we may conceive three different axes, each of which                       passes
  through the middle          of    the   two     opposite    faces.      I  have
   observed that when the cube            began     to perform the one or

    The crystals of rhoniboidal iron are found among those
of   the iron ore     of the island     of Elba.     But it is  very uncom
mon for the law of decrement               to attain to its boundary,       and
for the rhomboid not to be modified by facets parallel to the
faces    of the nucleus.
     If  the decrement       which     produces   the rhomboid took place
 at the fame time on the eight solid angles              of  the cube, there
 would result from it           a  polyedron of 24 facets, all like the
 trapezoidal granite,         of    which I shall speak hereafter, but
 with a very different structure.             This result is realised by na
 ture in the crystals found at the Cal ton-hill near Edinburgh,
 which     are considered      as  zeolites.

      other InfecJs hurtful       to  Fields and Gardens,       by  M. Soco-
      loff.       From    the  New Transactions of         the Imperial    Aca
      demy of Sciences at Peterfburgh,              Vol. V.
    X.   HOUGH it           is certain that earth-worms occasion             great
  destruction by gnawing the tender roots               of  shrubs and plants,
  and that other insects,            such as caterpillars and       locusts,    are
  exceedingly hurtful           both to fields      and gardens,       few have
  given themselves          the trouble to devise any remedy for this
  evil.     I flatter   myself, therefore,       that I shall do a service to
  the public     if I  point out an       easy and sure  method, certified by
   experience,      of either killing or driving        away from fields and
   gardens    all noxious vermin.
       As  the destructive       power of quick-lime,         heightened by       &
   fixed   alkali, which corrodes, dissolves and               destroys all the
    tender parts of animals, has been long known, I thought
     his mixture would be the best means for accomplishing the
    object I had in view.           I took three parts, therefore,      of quick
                                                                               lime

 lime, newlv made,          and two parts       of   a saturated solution       of
fixed alkali in water, and thence            obtained      a somewhat     milky-
liquor    sufficiently caustic,        highly   hostile     and   poisonous to
earth-worms         and   other    small    animals   ;   for,  as  soon   as    it
touched any part of their bodies,             it occasioned in them vio
lent symptoms of great uneasiness.                 If this liquor be poured
into those holes in which the earth-worms reside under
ground, they immediately throw themselves out                      as  if driven
by some force ; and, after various contortions,                     either lan
guish    or die.       If the   leaves     of plants or fruit-trees,         fre
quented    by the voracious caterpillars, which                 are so destruc
tive to them, be sprinkled           over with this liquor,        these insects
suddenly contract their bodies and drop                 to the ground.       For
though     nature     has defended        them    tolerably well by their
hairy skins      from any thing that might injure their delicate
bodies,    yet,    as soon as they      touch with their feet or mouths
leaves which        have been moistened         by this liquor,       they   be
come    as  it were stupefied,       instantly contract themselves,          and
fall down.
    I had not an opportunity            of trying a like experiment on
locusts  :  yet we may       conclude, and not without probability,
from their nature,         and    the    general   destructive     qualities   of
the above      liquor,    that   they, in the like manner,              may    be
driven from corn-sields,          if  it be possible to sprinkle the com
with   the liquor by means          of  a machine.
    With    regard to plants or corn, these sustain no injury from
the liquor, because it has no power over the productions of
the vegetable       kingdom,     as   I  have   fully learned      from expe
rience;    or,   if  any hurt is to be suspected, all the danger will
be removed by the first sliower that             falls.      This liquor may
be procured      in abundance in even- place where lime is burnt.
If the  lime be fresh, one part of it infused in about seventy
parts  of common water will produce real lime-water.                        The
want of the fixed alkali may be supplied by boiling wood-
aslies in water, and thickening the lye by evaporation.
    This liquor might       be employed also to          kill  bugs and other
                                                                       domestic;

the oily pickle that remains in casks in which salted herrings
have been packed.                             To this liquor          they     have a strong                aver

 1   T     is    very singular, and worthy                           of    great      attention, that                  a
 small          insect         intoxicated with spirit of wine                              and then              im

               or killed on purpose in that manner, may,                                                               by
 certain means, be revivified, after having been deprived of
 all signs of life for about quarter of an hour.      ahad occa                              I
 sion to observe this circumstance, for the first time, in com
 mon flies; for                    itis   well known that                 these     insects are strongly
 attracted            by       the smell of spirit of wine; and that, becoming
  intoxicated              by      it,
                                    they fall into the liquor, and are drowned.
  Having thrown                          a    great       number of flies which had                               pre-
  ristied in this manner in                           a     glass,    into    a     stove    among wood
  asties scarcely                  warm, and looking into the                        stove    a    little while
  after, on account of some experiments                                      I      was making,             I      ob
     served, not without                        astonistiment,         the flics start up from the
     ashes, and, after wiping themselves                                   clean from the dust ad
     hering to their wings,                           fly   away as    if     nothing had happened
     to them*.
                                                                                                                   My
           A    circumstance of              a   similar kind occurred to the              late   Dr. Franklin.
     While       he resided         is   France he         received from America            a   quantity of        Ma
                                                                                                                   deira

Ijfit                       On      the    Revivification oflnsecls.
    My curiosity being                     excited     by this circumstance,                     I   left a
wide-mouthed glass, into which I had put some spirit of wine,
uncovered, on purpose, and, having collected the flics which
I   afterwards        found dead in              it,
                              buried them carefully among
                                                     I
the before-mentioned wood-ashes and in   little time, when  ;             a
the moisture of the spirit had                          been completely absorbed                         by
the ashes,       I    observed            them all revivified.                 Being convinced
in this manner that the experiment would                                      succeed with com
mon flics,       I     resolved to make                a    like trial with other kinds of
insects.       I     therefore            took some small              beetles,          which        were
those nearest at hand, put them into                               a   glass filled          with    spirit
of wine, and, when they were perfectly dead,                                           covered       them
with ashes. These, to my great satisfaction,                                           were       restored
to life    in    the like manner.
 I      made an experiment also    small spider and  with
                                                     young    a                                  a
moth, by depriving them of life five different times within
the course          of   three        hours, and always with                       the      wislied-for
success, except             that the           spider,       after     the      last     experiment,
was      become          so    languid         and      weak that             it     could        scarcely
crawl.       I    found the like effect to be produced on bugs, only
that    it   was necessary to keep them longer in the aslies before
they were brought to life.
   In regard to butterflies                  I       cannot speak with certainty, as
those on which            I         made experiments were feeble                            and sickly.
Common wood-lice on the other hand, after being killed in
spirit of wine, could not bring to life
                         I               the same means.                 by

ists and physicians, who, perhaps,                                may infer from the above
observations,            that warm wood-aflies might be employed, not
deira wine which had been bottled in Virginia.                         In     some   of the bottles he
found    a   few dead flies, whkh lie exposed to the warm sun,                              it   being then
the month        of July,     and    in   less than three hours these apparent!/                  dead ani

      Various Methods      of rendering IVriting indeJiruBible.
                        [Concluded from Page 92.]
 W HEN           I had    discovered     the means      by liquor of flint
to render paper so much          less  combustible, and also in parti
cular to prevent its being converted           into ashes,      I resolved to
examine how common ink would stand on paper prepared
in that manner.        I  imagined that ink, on account of the
oxydated    metal    contained in its mixture, would not be                     so
easily destroyed    by the sire ; for, though         it is not naturally
black when freed from the acid of galls, it must however be
somewhat     visible   as   soon    as  the substance       on which it is
put is rendered      indestructible.        And this      I  actually found
to be the cafe,    after  writing a few lines with good common
ink upon    a   leaf of paper which had been carefully prepared
with liquor of flint, and putting it into the                sire   till it was
burnt to a coal.      I  examined the writing with attention, and
found that several words which             I had written upon           it could
be read,   though the paper was reduced              to a coal.         All    the
words could not indeed be distinguished with the same clear
ness,   and   therefore      they could not be all properly                 read.
Some of them had          a red    ochrey colour, and        these     were the
clearest ; others    were     blackish, and     some were        of   so  dark   \
tint that they were almost           entirely blended       with the colour
of  the charred paper      :   the last were totally illegible.            These
phenomena arc perfectly agreeable to the nature of oxydated
                                                                            iron.

iron, which,        as is  well known, assumes the above-mentioned
tints, according        as it contains more or       less oxygene        or carbon.
   On account of the             oxydated    iron, as      I   could not employ
common ink for my                proposed    object,     I   sought     among the
oxydated     metals for one that was capable                 of linking the       eye
on a black ground, and which at the fame time would com
bine with common ink *.
   To common ink              1   added a portion       of   oxydated       bismuth,
which, according           to   its own    nature, is exceedingly white,
and which on a black ground would produce                           visible charac
ters that must then be legible.               I prepared the mixture,            and
obtained a somewhat              thick ink, which        did not slow readily,
and with      which       I could write      a few    lines, but not without
difficulty.      Paper written upon with              this ink I burnt in a
wood fire,       and     examined it      as   soon    as    it was reduced        to
coal.    I   however found that the words were not more legible
than those written with common ink                  ;   for the      oxydated    bis
muth communicated its oxygene to the inflammable parts of
 the mixture, and the whole was revived into a metallic
regulus   :   several     small    grains of regulus of bismuth could
therefore     be distinguished       in it with the naked eye.               I mixed
common        ink with several other oxydated                  metals,     and  with
several kinds        of  earths ; but the ink         by these was so much
changed      in  its colour and consistence,            that    I thought it un
necessary to pay any farther attention to                  it.    I had recourse,
therefore,     to dissolved       metals, because         ink by these is not
changed     in its consistence,        as by oxydated metals, and parti
cularly earthy bodies.
   But before       I made any mixture with common                    ink,  I wished
 to try what        colour characters         made      with dissolved         metals
only would         assume, on paper         prepared as before,           when    re
duced to coal.
    I wrote, therefore, on different leaves of paper, which had
 been   soaked in liquor of flint, with a common solution os
        * For common ink any 'other black                      be substituted.

gold; nitrite of      silver^   copper,    tin, lead, bismuth,           cobalt,
antimony,       and manganese.         None of      the characters written
with    the above solutions could be read by                 the    naked eye,
except that written with          nitrite of copper, which appeared
of a beautiful green colour. I burnt all these leaves in a
flame, and the results were         as  follows   :
   The     characters    made     with    solutions of gold and             silver
were     not visible   on    the   charred    paper,     on account of the
dark tint which they assumed in the sire.                  The   cafe was the
fame with those characters          made     by solutions of cobalt, an
timony,      and lead.
    I  have found    that dissolved     nitrite of cobalt mav be em
ployed with great advantage for making sympathetic                      ink, not
inferior to the celebrated        ink prepared        from the same metal
dissolved     in the nitro-muriatic       acid, or aqua-regia         ;   which,
as is   well known, becomes visible of          a   beautiful green colour
by heat, and disappears in the cold.            Characters written with
dissohed nitrite of cobalt became visible, of a beautiful violet
colour, on paper prepared as above.              I held the leaf of paper,
on which I had written with the before-mentioned solution,
a few seconds over the fire ;         and when       I took back     the leaf     I
could read the characters, before invisible, as they now ap
peared    of   a violet    colour; but      the colour gradually           disap
 peared,    and   the writing      again   became       invisible.      When      I
 held the paper     so near the sire     that  it was a little singed,         the
 characters appeared white, and disappeared again in the cold.
    Characters made with nitrite of antimony were not visible,
 because they were as black as the charred                paper.     But when
the paper was held to the light they could be read a little,
 because the oxydated         metal made the characters            exceedingly
opaque,      and therefore    easily to be distinguished         from the      rest
 of  the paper, which was more or less transparent.
    Characters made          with   dissolved    nitrite of tin gave the
 fame    result as the preceding.          Those also made with a              so
 lution of bismuth were scarcely visible aster being in the sire;

    while the oxydated bismuth was converted into metal *.
    The invisible letters made with a solution of this metal can
   be read also,       if  the paper be dipped            into pure water.           By
   this simple process the characters appear of                     a  white colour,
   as the paper     becomes       somewhat      darker.       The writing,       how
   ever,   may be read better           if the   paper     be then held to          the
   light,    because the paper,         which      becomes      somewhat trans
   parent, suffers the characters, which are altogether dark, to be
   seen.
       I thought it unnecessary to make any experiments with dis
   solved    arsenic   and quicksilver,          because      their oxydes       easily
   suffer the oxygene to escape             ;  sublime in the fire, and then
   entirely fly off from the burning body.
       Of all  the metallic salts,     I  found only nitrite of copper and
   2inc fit for my proposed object ; for the calces of these metals
   continue fixed in the fire, and shew themselves afterwar.'s in
   durable and bright colours.
      The    characters      which I wrote with              dissolved     nitrite   of
  copper were       exceedingly visible, of          a   copper      colour on the
  charred paper,       and this colour can be well distinguished on a
  dark ground.           When       I wrote with dissolved             ammoniacaJ
  copper,     instead   of nitrite of copper, the characters assumed
  in the   fire a  dark red colour, which approached that of cin
 nabar.       Dissolved     nitrite of zinc,      however, is the best of al]
 the substances        with which I            made     experiments,         because
 characters      written with it on paper prepared                    by liquor      of
 flint   were   legible   ; and    it is   therefore    preferable      to solutions
 of copper, or of any other substance.
      When I wrote with dissolved nitrite of zinc,                  the characters
 were not visible ; but when             the paper       was    burnt they were
     * To  observe this phenomenon      tetter, it will  be sufficient to  write on    a
leaf of paper which       has  been impregnated     with sal-ammoniac,       and then
to burn it over the flame     of a candle.    The  charred paper remains smooth ;
but at the places     where    the  characters    were   written a beautiful     stnail

so  visible, in   a clear  white colour on    a  dark ground, that they
could be read with        as  much   ease  as   characters written with
the bell ink on white paper.
    I  ihall   now examine whether dissolved             nitrite of zinc,
which     produces so beautiful a sympathetic         ink, can     be com
bined with common ink, without the latter being                 so changed
in its colour      as  to be rendered     unfit for   use   as before.       I
made     this mixture,       and found that the ink became             some
what pale by the nitrite of zinc, on account perhaps of the
nitrous acid, which probably lessened the combination of the
acid    of  galls  with the iron: but I could write with it very
well on paper prepared by my liquor of flint ; for the colour
of common ink mixed with nitrite of zinc, which appeared
on common paper to be somewhat                   weakened,      became      so
dark on prepared paper, that words written with it appeared
more conspicuous          than those written       with    common ink.
The white colour of which           the characters appeared,          on the
charred paper, was not changed by the mixluie of ink, as                     I
was fully convinced by repeated experiments.
   One part of my curiosity was still not gratified,           as  I  wished
to know       of what colour     the dissolved    metals would        appear
on paper impregnated with different salts.              For thai     purpose
I  made the following experiments          :
    I wrote on    paper, which had been impregnated with acetite
of barytes, with      a solution of gold, nitrite of silver,         copper,
bismuth, tin, lead, antimony and zinc.                  The characters
Written with a solution of gold appeared                 on   the charred
paper    of a beautiful    poppy  red,  and those with a solution           of
copper of     a  dark yellow.     Those written with a solution of
antimony, zinc, bismuth, tin and lead, could not be seen.
   I  wrote also with solutions of the above metals on paper
which had been soaked in muriate of lime. The characters
written     with solutions of gold and silver appeared on the
paper like those written on paper soaked in acetite            of barytes.
Those written with solutions of lead and bismuth appeared
white;     and those written     with  a solution   of  copper appeared

potash was totally destroyed in the flame,                 as above remarked.
 I   thought it necessary therefore to make 'experiments with
other sulphites; because I had before observed that such salts,
by means of inflammable bodies, are converted into sulphu
reous bodies.                            ,
     I wrote also with the common dissolved metals,                      on paper
 which     had been       impregnated with muriate of soda.                     The
 characters      written with a solution of gold could scarcely be
 distinguished      of  a   dark red colour       ;  but those written with
 all the other dissolved metals were not legible.
     I wrote with      the fame       solutions   on paper which had been
 soaked    in   a  solution of muriate of ammoniac, but none of
 the characters were visible on the paper when reduced to coal.
     I wrote, in the last place,             with the same substances on
 paper which had been soaked in               a  solution os nitrite 6s lime,
 and, when reduced to coal, I could read the characters writ
 ten   with    a  solution of gold of           a   beautiful rose red; and
 those written      with a solution os silver of             a   yellow colour;
 but the      charred      paper    was    white.     The other         characters
 were    not legible, except           those written with         nitrite os bis
 muth, which had assumed                a blackish   colour.
     The other     pieces    of pqur soaked in           solutions    of  'different
 salts gave no result worthy            of notice.
     The   above observed effects and             before-mentioned chemi
 cal   preparations were the means                 of leading me         to several
 pleasant    experiments.          I   wished,    for example, to bring it
 about that the burnt paper should be converted into a white
 indestructible coal, on which the characters                  might be legible
 of different colours, and accomplished my object in the fol
 lowing manner :  I rubbed some gum arabic mixed with pure
 magne sia by means          of  a  hair brush, over the paper soaked in
 liijuor of flint.       When       the paper w as dry,        I wrote on it      se
  veral lines, some       with   a   solution of gold, and others with               a
 solution of antimony           in aqua-regia.           The   characters      made
                                                                                with

   with both        these     solutions were totally illegible.                    I then
   threw the prepared paper thus written upon into the fire ;
   and when it was wholly reduced to a coal, all the lines could
   be read   of a black colour on a white ground,                    so   that die cha
   racters were almost like those written                  with common ink on
   white paper.          If  ft be required          to make the            solutions of
   gold and antimony black, that the words written with them
   may be more distinguishable before                     the   paper is burnt,           it
  will only    be necessary to add a little common                       ink to them,
   but such as contains           as small     a   quantity      as   possible     of the
   sulphite   of iron*.
       I dipped   paper which          had been prepared with liquor of
  flint in   a saturated       solution of nitrite of zinc, and suffered
  it to become       exceedingly dry in the sun.                    I then wrote on
  several bits    of this    paper with the solutions               of different       me
  tals,   and a few        hours after reduced             them      all to coal, by
  holding them one after the other in the sire.                              Characters
  written    w ith dissolved nitrite of copper appeared of the co
  lour of metallised copper; those written with dissolved ni
  trite of iron, or bismuth, of                a   yellow colour;            those    with

 and magnesia, it may be made to assume any other colour                  if  the paper be
 dipped sometimes in one and sometimes in another              of the   above-mentioned
 solutions, as the characters on the charred piper will              then assume some
 times one colour and sometimes another.              If paper,    for example,      which
 has been soaked in     liquor of flint,  lie held a little   in a solution of sulphite
 of copper, and then dried,      the paper    will  assuine  a beautiful     green colour.
If   the paper be burnt,    it assumes  a copper colour.        It' you write po paper,
already tinged green, with any metal'ic solutions of metals which arc not so
easily decomposed by the action of the sire,             singular   phenomena will       be
observed.     If you   write on it with suiphite of iron, the characters will be
read of a yellowish      colour.    When the paper it reduced            to coal, the cha
racters are still seen yellow.      If you    write with dissolved nitrite of anti
mony,     the character* appear whitish.          If   the characters      are   written on
such paper with nitrite of line, they are invisible; but when the paper is
reduced to coal, they appear of a silver colour,          &c

solution appeared         several    times     of  the colour   of black    vel

 appear   of   an    orange     yellow colour,         if the paper    be often
 heated without reducing it to coal.
    P. S. I am now employed in endeavouring to discover at
 method of rendering paper prepared with liquor of flint
 stronger, so that when burnt it may not be so friable, in
 order that when several          sheets    of   paper are burnt upon each
 other they may be easily separated, and the whole writing on
 them be read.           As soon as I have derived anv n silts from
 my experiments, I shall not fail to communicate than.

  litmus    (syrup     of   violets having       been for some time out         of

tals   of huh flowers           as have been               just mentioned, though an
excellent      test   for alkalis,         is not so easily affected                    bv acids as
litmus,       and, by keeping, loses in a fliort time much of its
sensibility.
     To obtain        fresh made tests from vegetables,                             few of which
are to be met with in winter, was a matter                                      of considerable
moment.           Mr. Watt found              the red cabbage                   (brasliea      rubra)
to furnish the best.             In   its fresli state it is more sensible both
to acids and alkalis than even litmus, and more decisive from
its being naturally blue; turning green with alkalis, and red
with acids.
     Mr. Watt         extracts       the colouring              matter from the thin
parts    of   the leaves only.             He minces them small,                        and digests
them in water about the heat of 120° for                                    a   few hours.         If
not to be immediately used,                       as   it is apt to spoil,               Mr. Watt
recommends to spread the minced leaves on paper, to dry
them in a gentle beat, and then to put them in bottles well
corked.        To     prepare        the    test, infuse             or digest these dried
leaves in water acidulated with sulphuric            acid till they give
out their colourj          then strain the liquor through a cloth, and
add to it      whiting or chalk, stirring it frequently, until it                                 be
comes a true blue, neither                   inclining          to green nor to purple.
When this point                 is gained,             filter it immediately;                  other-
wife it will become             greenish          by standing on the chalk.                       It
will    deposit       some gypsum,                and, by adding                a   little spirit of
wine,     will    keep good for some days.                           Too much spirit              de
stroys the colour.              If    wanted to be kept longer, neutralise

but how long it might be preserved, he had not determined.
   Mr. Watt recommends                   to use the tests in a liquid state; ;.s
he observes, and with justice, that the size and alum in writ
ing-paper in some degree fix the colour, while paper not
sized     becomes        too     transparent,       when         wetted,       to     render
small changes of colour perceptible.
  To the above useful hints of Mr. Watt we sliall add ano
ther.  The skins of red radistics yield by being bruised a very
sensible test, and, no doubt, might be preserved by the means
he has pointed out.

fine sire-wood.              Its allies afford      a great         quantity of pot-ash,
exceeded by few',. or perhaps by none, of the trees that grow
in the woods of the United States.
     The   aecr faccharinum               is not injured by tapping;                          on the      
contrary, the oftener it is tapped, the more syrup is obtained
from it.         The       effects   of    a yearly     discharge             of   sap   from the
tree in     improving           and       increasing the sap, is demonstrated
from the superior excellence                   of   those trees which                 have been
perforated        in an hundred               places     by     a    small         wood-pecker
which      feeds upon the sap.                  The      sap   of     such trees is much
sweeter     to       the    taste    than that obtained from trees which
have     not     been                        more sugar is
                             previously wounded,                    and
afterwards procured. In this last particular it follows a law
of the animal conomy. It is well known, that when a
person has been once tapped,                    the process requires                  afterwards
to be more frequently repeated.                         A   single        tree has not           only
survived,        but flourished        after forty-two              tappings in the fame
number of years.
     A   tree   of    an ordinary size yields,                 in   a good season,              from
twenty to thirty gallons of sap, from which are made from
five to six pounds             of    sugar.      To this            there      are sometimes
remarkable exceptions.                 Samuel Low, Esq.                   n   justice of peace
in Montgomery county, in the State of New York, informed
Arthur Noble, Esq. that lie had made twenty pounds and
one ounce of sugar from the 14th to the 23d of April, in the
vear 1789, from              a single tree      that had been tapped for several
successive years             before.        The quantity obtained                        per    diem
varies from five gallons to a pint, according to the variations
of   the weather.            The influence          w   hich this has in increalinc;

 in Dr. Tongue's opinion, who supposes that                               changes    in the
 weather of every kind might be as readily                                ascertained      by
 discharges       of    sap    from trees,          as by the barometer.              (Vide
 Philosophical Transactions,                  N° 68.) Warm               days succeeding,
 frosty nights are most favourable to a plentiful                            discharge      of
 sap.       If frosty nights succeed a warm day, there is always a
 total suspension of the discharge *.
                                                                                         The
    :'
       Dr. Hale, in his Vegetable Statics,          relates   that he cut down a vine, and
cemented to its        mutilated     stump glass       tubes,    each  7 feet long, and one
fourth of an inch diameter, with brass caps, by which they were screwed
on one above another, till they rose to the height of 36 feet.
    By    these gages   it appeared,
     1st.   That the   sap began      to rise    March      10, when    the thermometer by
day stood only at 3 degrees above the freezing point.
    jdly. Thar, April        18, it was at its height and vigour.
   3dly. That from that time            to  May    5, the force gradually      decreased.
    4thly. That it constantly          rose  fastest   from sun-rise to about 9 or 10 in
the morning,      and then gradually         subsided     till about  5 or 6 o'clock    in the
afternoon.
    5thly. That it rose sooner in the morning                after ccol' weather, than aftes
hot days, and in proportion             to the   colduesi. of the night and subsequent
 heat.
    6thly. That after       several   successive   cold days and nights, the sap would
tisc during the whole day,         if it  chanced to be fine, although slowest at noon.
     7thly.   That if warm weather            had made the sap flow vigorously,           that
vigour would       he abattd immediately           by a cold easterly     wind and   a cloudy
sun, when the sap would sink at the rate of an inch per minute ; but when
the sun slione out, and the wind shifted, it rose again as usual.
    Sthly.    The   oldest  vines were soonest        affected    by a change of tempera
ture,     and in them the s.p first began to sink.
    gthly.    And, on the coutrary, when the tube was fixed to                   a very short
stump of a young vine,           and at only 7 inches           from the ground,      the   sap
flowed incessantly, and fastest          cf all, in the greatest heat of the day, sinking
only after sun-set.
    He then makes this general conclusion, that the rapidity with which the
 sap circulates    in the vine during the spring, \\ five limes greater than the
rapidity with which the blood flows in the arteries of                     a horse; that it is
consideraMy flower in the summer than in spring, very languid in autumn,
 and ceases altogether in the winter.

      The    sap     usuallv flows for fix weeks, varying according to
the temperature of the weather.                                      The       season     so/ tapping is
in February, March, and April. During the remaining part
ffithe spring months, as also in the summer, and in the be
ginning of autumn,                       the maple tree yields                  a   thin sap, but not
sit    for the manufactory of sugar.
  Baron La Hontan gives the following account of the fap^
of the sugar maple tree, when used as drink, and the manner
of obtaining it.                     The      tree, fays he, yields              a     sap    which       has   a
much         pleasantcr                 than the best lemonade or cherry-
                                      taste
water, and               is    the wholesomest  drink in the world. This
liquor       is   drawn             by   cutting the tree two inches deep in the
wood, the cut being made                                 (loping to the length of ten or
twelve        inches      ;         at the       lower end              of this gafli,            a    knife     is
thrust into the tree flopingly,                                 so   that the water runs along
 the cut or gafli, as through                          a   gutter, pervades the knife, and
 falls upon              some         vessels       placed          underneath            to      receive       it.
 The      gash does no harm to the                              tree.      Some trees will yield
 five or      six   bottles of this water in                    a    day, and many inhabitants
 of Canada might draw twenty                                   hogsheads          of   it    in one day,        if
 they had           a    mind            to    notch all the maple trees upon their
 plantations  but common things are slighted, and scarce any
                     ;
 but children think of extracting this liquor from the trees.
        The         mode of tapping                      is    different,           and      is    performed
  with       an axe or an auger.                         The latter        is    preferred,            from ex
  perience of                 its     advantage.               It    is   introduced about                  three*
  quarters          of an inch,               and     is   afterwards deepened gradually to
  the extent of two inches.                                A   spout      is   introduced about half
       The    above experiments                clearly     demonstrate,         that    it   ii   not from heat
  and light alone that the sap risei in the vine, or any other tree; for,                                   if  that
  were the case,         it    would increase          as the heat increased;           it   would      be greatest
  in    the noon-day,           and      in   the height       of   summer,     and less in spring than in
  autumn, whereas the reverse                    is   here sliewn to be the case.                 It   must there
  fore depend on the irritability of the fibres composing the vessels, which
      gets exhausted          by    the stimulus of heat and light, and                 is   accumulated        by   in
  absence.          T.

an inch into the hole, and it projects from three to twelve
inches.       The   operation      of tapping is sirll done on the south
fide ; and       when the      discharge of sap lessens, an opening is
made with the auger             on the north (idc, when an abundant
slow takes place.
    Wooden        troughs large enough to contain three or four
gallons are placed under the spout to receive the sap, which
is carried every day to a large receiver made of wood. From
this receiver it is conveyed, after being strained, to the boiler.
The following         facts   have     been   ascertained    by experiment      :
The sooner the        sap is   boiled, after it is collected from the
free, the better.        The    larger the vessel the more sugar is ob
tained.      The     sugar   is   also improved by straining           the   sap
through blankets, or cloth, either before or after it is hall
boiled.      Some fatty substance is added to the sap in the
kettle, to prevent its boiling over.             Lime, eggs, or new milk,
is mixed with it in order to clarify it.                 I have seen clear
sugar     made     without     the    addition of either of them.             A
spoonful of slack lime, the white of one egg, and a pint of
new milk, are the usual proportions of these articles, which
arc mixed with fifteen              gallons of sap.      The     maple    sugar
clarified with milk          alone had the evident         superiority of all
others.      After being sufficiently boiled, it             is grained, and
clayed, and afterwards           refined,   or converted into loaf sugar.
The method of conducting                  each    of these processes is       so
nearly the fame with those which are                 used   in the manufac
tory of West India sugar, and               are- so generally known,       that
I  need spend no time in describing them.
    There are two other methods of reducing the                   sap to sugar.
The    first is by freezing.       This method      was tried by    Mr. Scott,
a fanner in this state,         with   great success.     lie   fays, that one
half of    a  given quantity of sap reduced in this way, is better
than one      third of the fame quantity reduced by boiling.                   If
the frost should not be intense enough to reduce the                     sap  to
the graining        point,    it may afterwards        be exposed       to  the
action,   of  fire for that purpose,
                                                                     Secondly^

  Secondly, by spontaneous evaporation. The hollow stump of
a maple sugar tree, which had been cut down in the spring,
and which was found some time after                                lilled with sugar, first
suggested to our farmers                  this method of obtaining sugar.               So
many circumstances                 of cold        and dry weather, large                   and flat
vi'flels, and above all                 so   much time is necessary to obtain
sugar by either             of   the above methods, that the most general
method among our farmers                          is to obtain it by boiling.
     The     kettles and other utensils                  of   a    farmer's kitchen                 will
serve most           of   the purposes        of making           sugar, and the time re
quired for the labour               (if   it   deserves that name)              is   at   a   season
when        it
            is       impossible         for the farmer to employ himself in
any species of agriculture. His wife,                                and all his children

strength. The experiments which led to this opinion I sus
pect have been       inaccurate, or have been made with maple
sugar prepared       in a slovenly way.      I  have   examined equal
quantities by weight of both the grained and the loaf sugar,
in hyson tea, and in coffee, made in every respect equal by
the minutest circumstances that could affect the quality or
taste of each of them, and could perceive no inferiority in the
ftreno-th   of the maple    sugar.    The liquors which      were to de
cide this question were examined at the fame time by Alex
ander Hamilton, Esq. secretary of the treasury of the United
States,    Mr. Henry Drinhur,        and several ladies, who all con
 curred in the above opinion.
     2. Price.    Whoever     considers  that the     gift of the sugar
jnaple tree is from       a  benevolent Providence       ; that we have
 many million* of acres in our country covered with them ;
 that the tree is improved by repeated tappings ; and that the
 sugar   is obtained by the frugal labour        of a  farmer's family   ;
 and at the fame time considers the labour of cultivating the
 sugar cane,     the capitals funk in sugar works, the first cost       of
 slaves and cattle, and       the expences    of  provisions   for both,
  &c. will   not hesitate in believing that the maple sugar may be
  manufactured much cheaper, and sold at             a  considerably  lest
 frice than that which is made in the West Indies.
     3. The resources for making a sufficient quantity of this
 sugar, not only for the consumption        of  the United States, but
 for exportation, will appear from the following facts:  There
  are in the slates of New York and Pennsylvania alone, at
 least ten   millions of acres of land which produce the sugar
 maple tree in the proportion           of thirty trees to one acre.
  Now,    supposing all the persons     capable of labour in a family
                                                                     and
  Jo consist of three, and each person to attend 150 trees,
                                                                    each.

               Account of the American Sugar Maple.                           189
well     tree to yield 5 pounds       of sugar, the product         of labour of
60,000 families would be 135,000,000 pounds of sugar, and,
allowing the inhabitants of the United States to compose
600,000 families, each of which consumed 200 pounds of
                                                              be 120,000,000
sugar a year, the whole consumption would
pounds        a vear,   which     would leave a balance of 15,000,000
                                      Valuing     the            at 6  90    of a
pounds for exportation.                                  sugar
 dollar per pound, the sum            saved   would be 8,000,000 dollars
 of home consumption,               and the     sum gained by exportation
  would be       T ,000,000 dollars.
      The    maple sugar also affords excellent vinegar;              its molasses
 is capable       of affording a very pleasant summer beer. The
  sap is also capable          of producing spirit ; but we hope this
  wholesome juice will never be prostituted                  to such a purpose.
  A diet     consisting    of  a plentiful admixture of sugar has many
   advantages.
        Sugar affords      the   greatest quantity        of nourifliment       in  a
   given quantity of matter of any substance in nature.                      Hence
    the Indians use it in their excursions.                 They mix      a certain
    quantity of maple sugar            with   an equal       quantity of Indian
    corn, dried and powdered.                This mixture is packed up in
    little baskets.       A  few spoonfuls      of it mixed with half          a  pint
    of spring water,         afford   them a pleasing         and    strengthening
     meal.      From     the great    degree    of   strength and nourishment
     which      are   conveyed     into animal bodies         by   a small   bulk of
     sugar,    it may be given to horses with great advantage.                       A
      pound of sugar with grass or hay, I have been told, has sup
      ported    the   strength    and   spirits   of  a   horse during      a   whole
      day's labour in       one    of the   West      India islands.       A     larger
      quantity given alone has fattened horses and cattle during the
      war before last in Hispaniola, for           a   period of several months,
      in which        the exportation      of   sugar and      the   importation of
       grain were prevented by the want of sliips.
           3. A plentiful use of sugar is the best preventative of
       worms.        The author of nature seems to have implanted a
       love   for sweets in all children for their growth,               and to ward
        off the disease of worms,
                                                                                    4.1

     tab              Account   of the American Sugar Mapl?.
        4.   I think it probable, that the frequency of maligning
    fevers    of  all 'kinds has been lessened     by this diet, and that its
    more general         use would defend     that class of people who arc
    most subject to malignant fevers from being so often affected
    by them.
       5. It has been said, that sugar injures the teeth ; but this
    opinion now has so few advocates, that it does not merit a
    serious refutation.
       It  ha* been a subject       of enquiry, whether       the maple sugar
   might not be improved in its quality,                and    increased  in its
   quantity, by culture.           From the influence which culture has
¦
   upon forest and other trees, it has been supposed, that by
   transplanting the maple sugar tree into a garden, or by de
   stroying such other trees as. shelter it from the rays of the
   fun, much advantage might accrue. I know but of one fact.
  A    farmer in Northampton            county,   in the   state   of Pennsyl
   vania, planted         a  number of    these trees above twenty years
  aio in his meadow,             and   he declares   that the quality is      so
  improved, that from three gallons of the sap he obtains every
  year a pound of sugar; and it is a known circumstance
  that, to produce the fame quantity of sugar from the trees
  which grow wild in the wood, it requires five or six gallons
  of   sap.      To transmit     to suture generations all the advantages
  which       have been      here enumerated,      it is  necessary that this
  tree should         be cultivated in the old and       improved parts of
  the United States,          and   a bounty given upon the maple           su
 gar by Government.               Afterwards men would lind out their
 own advantage in rearing them. An orchard consisting
 of aoo trees, planted upon a common form, would yield more
 prosit     than the fame number of apple <>r any other trees.
 If    a  greater exposure of a ire         to Uu action os the sun has
 the fame effect upon the maple that it has upon other (trees,
 a larger quantity            of  sugar  might   reasonably       be  expected
 from each          tree planted in an orchard.          Allowing it     to be
 only seven pounds, then 200 trees will yield 1400 pounds
of sugar; and deducting 200 from the quantity for the con
sumption of the family, there will remain, for sale iaoo
                                                                      pounds,

                     Mr. Park's Journey- into Africa.                          191
l»ounds,      which     at 690 of a dollar per pound will yield au
nnnual prosit to the farmer of 80 dollars.                    Should this mode
of transplanting for the purpose of obtaining sugar be suc
 cessful, it will not be a new one.                 The sugar cane of the
West Indies was brought originally from the woods of the
East Indies        by the Portuguese,          and   cultivated at Madeira,
 from whence it was transplanted                directly or indirectly to all
 the sugar islands       of the West Indies.
     In contemplating        the present opening prospects in human
 affairs,   I   am led to expect that a material (hare                 of  the hap
 piness    which       Heaven seems to have prepared for all man
 kind, will be derived chiefly from the manufactory and
 general    use    of the maple        sugar,    which     I  flatter myself    will
 not be confined to us, but will extend                    itself to other na
 tions.     With this view of         the subject,     I cannot help contem
 plating    a sugar     American maple tree with              a species   of  affec
 tion and even veneration;               for   I  have persuaded         myself to
  behold in it the liappy means                of rendering        the commerce
  and slavery of our African brethren in the West India islands
  as unnecessary as it has always been inhuman ajul unjust *.

this enterprising traveller's journey,         and   of  the diseoveries he
made, is reserved for a large volume, to be published by sub
scription, which we are happy to find announced, and we
have     no doubt that the author will meet with that reward
from the public to which he is           so justly entitled by his forti
tude and perseverance.            We   cannot help observing also, that
 great    thanks are due to the African Association, for their
 exertions to procure information           respecting     the continent       of
 Africa,     and thus to pave the        way for the civilisation of its
 inhabitants.        The Report printed for         the use   of   the mem
 bers does great credit to the literary talents        of Bryan Edward?,
 Esi]. by whom it was drawn up.
      On the 22d of December 1795,               Mr. Park took his           de
 parture    from the house of his friend Dr. Laidlcy,              at Pifania,
 on the banks of the river Gambia,                and directed his course
 easterly    for the kingdom of Woolli.              He   was accompanied
 by     two negro       servants,   natives   of   the    country,      one     of
  whom spoke English tolerably well, and served him                   as  inter
  preter ; the other was a boy presented to him by                  Dr. Laid
  lcy.     He had also a horse for himself, and two               asses  for his
 servants.       His  baggage consisted chiefly       of  provisions    for twd
  days, a small assortment os beads, amber and tobacco, for the
  purchase     of  a fresh supply    as he proceeded : a        few    changes
  of linen    and other necessary apparel,        an umbrella,       a   pocket
  sextant,    a  compass,    and   a thermometer, together with two
   fowling-pieces,      two pair of pistols,       and    some other small
   articles.
      Mr. Park     reached   Medina,     the capital of     Woolli, on       the
   third day, and was received by the sovereign or chief, named
  Jatta,   with    much     kindness.     This prince       wished      to per
  suade    Mr. Park not       to proscerte    his journey any farther,
  by pointing out the dangers and difficulties he would have-
   to encounter ; but finding his remonstrances had no effect,
   lie furnished him with       a  guide to Bondon,        and suffered     him
   to depart.
      Leaving     Medina,     Mr. Park     proceeded      onwards, and on
                6                                                             the

the 2i st of December        reached      Fattecohda,    the capital of
the kingdom of Bondou.            The king of this country          was a
 Pagan, like that of Wodlli        :  but he had adopted the Moor
ish name    of Almanli,    and seems also to have imbibed some'
what    of   the Moorish     disposition    ;  for though     Ms. Park
presented    to him his umbrella and some other articles, he
compelled him to strip in his presence               and  surrender     his
coat, which he said he should            reserve for his own wearing
on great and public festivals.          In return, however,      he gave
our traveller five drachms           (minkalliesj   of geld    dust,   and
loaded him with provisions.
    Departing from Fatteconda on the 23d of December, Mr.
Park proceeded       the two following days to a place called
Joag in   the kingdom     of Kajaaga, a country bounded on the
north by the      Senegal river.       The natives are called Sera-
Woollies, and     seem to be pure negroes.          The   appearance      of
a white man among them excited great curiosity.                The king
commanded that he should be brought before                 him ; and it
was with some difficulty that         Mr. Park, who had       been cau
tioned to avoid him, declined the interview,             and got out      of
his dominions with       the   loss   of about   one  half of his   goods
and apparel.
    The  name    of this rapacious chief wisBacheri.             He    ba'd
recently fallen dut with     a  neighbouring prince, the sovereign
bf  Kasson, a   country to the north-east ; and it happened that
the king of Kaison's nephew was in Bacheri's capital, en
deavouring, but hi vairl, to effect           a  reconciliation    at the
time of   Mr. Park's arrival     at Joag.    This  yourtg man, finding
that our traveller    proposed proceeding to Kasson,          kindly of
fered to take    him under his protection1.          They accordingly
set  out together, and, after a journey of two days, crossed
the river Senegal at Kayec, the frontier village of the king
bf   Kasson's  dominions,     near    which that river      ceases   to be
navigable.      From Kayee       Mr. Park     was led   by his friendly
conductor to Teescc,      the place      of his   abode,   and the resi
dence   of the king's brother Tigetee-Sego,            an old man      of &

194               Mr- Park's Journey      into   Africa.
                                                                           ,
venerable aspect, but of a selfish disposition.           He   had never
seen, he said, but one white man before,            and, on describing
him, it was known to be Major Houghton.                   The circum
stance of having a white man under his roof was highly
gratifying to the vanity of Tigetee-Sego,            on account    of the
great number      of  the natives   who resorted to      see  him.    He
therefore compelled our traveller to remain with him twelve
days, and afterwards to take a journey           of two   days more to
present    himself to the king at his capital of Kooniakary,
who detained him another fortnight, but in other respects
behaved to him      with great kindness     and hospitality.      Of this
prince,    whose   name was Demba Sego Jalla,             Mr. Park re
ceived the first certain account       of Major Houghton's        death.
    Being permitted at length to leave the capital,             Mr. Park
prosecuted     his journey eastward,      and   in five days arrived at
Kemnoo, a large and populous town (since destroyed), at that
time the metropolis of Kaarta.           The sovereign, whose name
was Day si Koorabarri,      received     Mr. Park with       great kind
ness.     Major Houghton was        the only European he had ever
before seen, and he had conceived            the highest     idea  of the
superiority of the whites to the blacks in all possible respects.
The language of the country seemed to Mr. Park to be a
 mixture of the Mandingo          and   Sera-Woolli : but the pure
 Mandingo, in the attainment of which Mr. Park by this
 time had made considerable         proficiency, was very generally
 understood,     and  with very    little  assistance from his inter
 preter   he found no difficulty       in conveying his own senti
 ments, and comprehending others.
    Having informed the king that he proposed going to Bam-
 bara in search of the Joliba river, which was believed to take
 its course through the centre of that extensive kingdom, he
 was told that, the Bambarans being at that time in a state              of
 warfare with the Kaartans, he could not without                  extreme
 personal    danger venture    into the Bambaran country.              His
 only   safe route   was a northerly course to Ludamar,            a terri
 tory of the     Moors in alliance with Mansong the king of
                                                               Bambaraj

Bambara; from whence,                    passing     as  a   traveller from the
Moorish country, he might venture, by a circuitous journey,
to Bambara.           To this advice being obliged to submit of
give np all thoughts            of prosecuting his journey in            search os'
the Niger, the king, as the last proof of his kindness, sent
eight horsemen          to convey him         in  safety to   Jarra,  the frontief
town of the Moors, where he arrived on the 18th                            of Fe
bruary 1796.           In the course of his journey he passed through
a village not far from Jarra, called Simbing, from whence
Major Houghton wrote his last dispatch with a pencil.
    The territories which our traveller had hitherto explored,
being very generally clothed with native woods, presented to
the eye the appearance of great uniformity.                       In his progress
eastward      the country rose into            hills, and    the foil varied to a
considerable      degree ; but wherever the land was cleared, great
natural fertility was            observed.        Bondou      in particular may
 literally   be    pronounced          "  a  land flowing with milk and
 honey." Both these articles,                  together    with rice   and Indian
 corn of two or three species,               were to be obtained at a small
 expence.       Of their honey,           the    Pagan natives make an in
 toxicating     liquor,       much      like    the   mead     of Europe.      The!
 price of   a  fowl in Bondou was a button, or a small bit                 of am
 ber ; goat's      flesh     and   mytton were prbportionably cheap j
 and for six or eight amber beads Mr. Park might at any time
  have purchased         a  bullock.       The    domes! ic animals are nearly
 the   fame as       in Europe      :   the Guinea       fowl and red partridge
 abound in the fields          ; and the woods         furnish a small species   of
 antelope, of which the venison is highly and deservedly prized.
     Of   the other        wild animals in the Mandingo countries the
 most    common arc, the hyæna, the panther,                         and the ele
 phant.      But the       natives    of Africa      have not yet acquired      the
 art of taming          the    last-mentioned animal,            notwithstanding
  his strength and docility,            so  as to render him serviceable to
  man ; and       when       Mr. Park told         some   of  them that this was
  actually     done      in   the   countries of the East, his auditors
  laughed, and exclaimed,

 fake   of  its teeth,   which      they transfer in barter to those whd
sell them again to the Europeans.
     The    pastures    of Bondbu       furnish    an  excellent breed      of
horses,     but the usual beast of burtheri in all the negro terri
 tories   is the ass.       The application of animal labour to the
purpose     of agriculture       is wholly unknown.         The chief im
plement      used   in husbandry is the hoe, which varies in form
3n different     districts  ; and the    labour is universally performed
by staves.       Besides     the grains proper to tropical climates,
the Mandingoes cultivate in considerable                quantities ground
nuts, yams, and pompions.                 They likewise    raise cotton and
indigo,      and     have     sufficient skill to     convert    these   ma
terials into tolerably fine cloth          of  a  rich blue colour     : and1
they make        good soap      from a mixture of ground-nuts and a
ley    of wood-ashes.
     Trie town of Jarra, at which           Mr. Park     had now arrived,
is f?oiated in the kingdom            of Ludamar,      a Moorish country,
of which       it is not known        that any account has ever been
given in any of the languages of Europe.                 The town itself is
extensive,     and    the houses are built      of clay   and stone inter
mixed     ;  but the major part of the inhabitants are negroes'
from the borders of the Southern States, who prefer a pre
carious protection under the Moors, which they purchase by
a tribute, to being continually             exposed to their predatory
hostilities.
     During his     stay at  Jars a,  Mn   Park resided at the house of a
Slatee trader, named Daman, who was known to                   Dr. Laidley.
By him Mr. Park           was informed that he could proceed               no
farther on his way to Bambara, without leave from                   Ali,  the
Moorish       chief or king of the country, who was then en
camped       at a place       called   Benowm    ; and   that it was ab
solutely necessary that a present should accompany the appli
cation by which permission was to be obtained. Mr. Parit
therefore     purchased       five garments    of country cloth, by       the

   sale of one of his fowling-pieces.             Daman      undertook to
  negotiate the business,      and at the end     of  a fortnight permis
  sion arrived from Benowtn.
      This  permission   was    brought by one of        Ali's own   slaves,
  who said he was ordered to           serve   Mr. Park     as a guide to
  Bambara     ; and on the 27th of February he took his depar
  ture from Jarra, accompanied by this slave, his own faithful
  boy, and    a negro   belonging to Daman j the interpreter re
  fusing to proceed any farther.
     On    the   third day after     his departure       from Jarra they
 reached a large town called Deena;            on entering which        Mr.
  Park was surrounded          by many of the Moorish inhabitants,
 who harassed him with shouts of insult, spit in his face, and
 seized his baggage,      which they robbed of what things they
 fancied.      He got refuge, at length, in the house of a negro ;
 and after experiencing much difficulty in persuading his at
 tendants    to proceed any farther, he set out on the second day
 for Sampaka.          Here he procured lodging at the house of a
 negro, who understood the art of making gunpowder.                     The
 nitre was obtained in considerable quantities from the swamps
or ponds, which are tilled in the rainy season, and to which
 the cattle resort in the heat      of the day for coolness.        As tho
 water   of   these ponds is slowly exhaled        by the fun, the nitro
 appears in a white efflorescence        on the mud, and is carefully
 scraped   off in   the form    of small   crystals.     Sulphur   is pur
chased    of  the  Moors,    and the several ingredients are blended
together     in   such proportions     as experience      has shewn    will
answer     the   purpose ; though the powder thus made               is far
inferior to that     of Europe.
     On   the   morning of the 7th of March, Mr. Park had
reached a small village called Sami, within two davs journey
of Goomba,        the frontier town    of Bambara      ;  anji was resting
himself in the hut of      a  friendly negro, pleased wfth the hopes
of being soon out of danger, when he was alarmed by the.
arrival of two Moors, who announced that they cams by
order   of AH     to convey him to the camp at Bcnowm.                They
                                    0  3                            addej^

added, that,     if   he consented to go       with them peaceably,      he
had nothing to fear        :  but that,   if he refused,   they had orders
to carry him by force.
    Finding     entreaty     and   resistance equally fruitless, for the
messengers      were   joined by others, all of them armed, our
traveller, guarded        by the Moors, and accompanied by the
negro boy (Daman'6 negro having made his escape on seeing
the Moors, and the slave sent by Ali having previously left
him on the road), set out on the evening of the same day
for the camp at Benowm,             which      after a distressing journey
they approached         on the 12th.          It  presented   to the eye a
multitude of dirty-looking             tents,    scattered   without  order
over a large space of ground          ;  and among die tents were seen
herds   of camels, bullocks,        and goats.
    The arrival      at the camp     of   a white     man was no sooner
made known,         than all the people who were drawing water
 at the wells threw down their buckets, those in the tem>
mounted their horses,           and men, women and children came
running or galloping towards him.                   He soon found himself
 surrounded with such crowds that he could scarcely walk ;
one pulled off his clothes  another took off his hat  a third
 stopped    him   to examine his waistcoat          buttons-  and a fourth
 called out     "  La ilia ill Allabi, Mahomed ra/owl Allabi * j
 and signified      in a threatening manner that he must repeat
 these words.        He   at length reached         the  tent of the king,
 whom       he found sitting upon a black leather cushion,             clip
 ping a few hairs from his upper lip, while a female attendant
 held up a looking-glass before him ; there were many other
 females in the tent.          The king appeared to be an old man
 of  the  Arab    cast,  with   a long white beard.          He had a sullen
 and indignant aspect, and looking at our traveller with at
 tention, enquired of the Moors if he could speak Arabic ;
 but being answered in the negative,               he appeared much sur
prised, and continued silent.

     The surrounding           attendants,      and particularly the ladies,
  were far more curious and inquisitive.                 They      asked a thou
   sand questions, inspected         every part      of Mr. Park's apparel,
   searched his pockets, and obliged him to unbutton his waist
  coat and display the whiteness of his (kin,                ice.      They    even
   counted his toes and singers,           as  if  they doubted whether he
  was in truth a human being.                   When the curiosity of the
  ladies    was    in some measure         satisfied,  he was conducted to
  the tent of      Ali's chief flave; into which however               he was not
  permitted to enter, nor allowed to touch any thing belonging
  to it.     He   requested something to          eit, and some boiled corn
  with salt and water was             at length sent him            in   a wooden
  bowl   ; and a mat was spread out on the sand before the tent,
 on which he           passed   the night, surrounded           by the curious
 multitude.         A   hut was afterwards        erected,   in which he was
 confined and strictly guarded.
     Some time after           a ludicrous        circumstance took place,
  which would not           deserve attention did       it not    tend to throw
  some     light on the national manners of the people                      among
 whom our traveller resided.              Hearing one morning the found
 of drums, Mr. Park            was informed that the noise was occa
 sioned by the celebration          of   a wedding in one         of   the neigh
 bouring tents.          Soon    after   an old woman         entered       his hut
 with    a bowl      in her hand, and signified that (lie had brought
 him a present from the bride.              Before he could recover from
 the    surprise    occasioned      by this message,        the    woman        dis
 charged       the contents      of the bowl full in his              face.    Mr.
 Park finding that it was the fame sort of holy water                      as  that
 with which the priest among the Hottentots                       is said to be
 sprinkle     a  new-married couple, he began lo suspect that the
 old lady was actuated           by mischief or malice          :    but flic gave
 him seriously to understand that it was a nuptial benediction,
from the bride's wvn person, and which, on such occasions,
 is always received by the young unmarried Moors                        as a  mark
 of   distinguished      savour.

pqndition,    and one of them once privately sent him a small
supply of meal and milk          ;  but their kindness extended           no
farther.    If they   pitied his situation, it is probable that they
dared not administer to his wants;           and his distress at length
became almost insurmountable.               He was allowed         a single
meal of kouj'cous,   a preparation of boiled corn, once in twenty-
four hours.     All his     effects were    taken from    him,      and   he
was not even indulged with            a  change of linen out of the
few shirts he had brought in his portmanteau              :   oppressed at
the fame time with       a burning fever, his situation was truly
deplorable.
                "  In this condition, from fun-rife           to fun-set,"
says he,
           " was I    obliged to suffer with an unruffled counte
nance the insults of the rudest savages on earth.
    In eight or ten weeks, however, circumstances occurred^
which, contrary to their first appearance,                  changed our
traveller's situation for the better, and in the end produced,
his [deliverance.      In the war which prevailed between the
kings    of Bambara and Kaarta,           the  Moors   at first took no
active part; but     Ali having      afterwards   engaged to fend 200
horse to the assistance     of  the fugitive     Kaartans,      he became
panic-struck at the approach of the king of Bambara towards
Benowm : brpke up his camp, and fixed his tent in a country
to the north.     Mr. Park was compelled to follow him, and,
after a month's,     confinement at the new camp, was led by
Ali   to Jarra.   At this    place    he had the mortification        to fee
the poor boy who had attended him from the Gambia taken
from him, by Aii's command, for the avowed purpose of
being sold into slavery.        Aster this cruel circumstance,           and
the certain information        which     he received    from     Ali's own
son (a youth    of  ten years   of   age,   who had conceived some
 thing like friendship for Park, or pity for his misfortunes),
that it was in contemplation to deprive Park himself of his
 life, or put out his eyes, he determined rather to risk perish
 ing in the woods, of hunger, or by the fury of the wild beasts,
 than to remain any longer with              a  horde  of    faithless bar
barians,    whose    tendcrest     mercies were     cruelty,     and   from
                                                                      whose

whose caprice or fanaticism he was in hourly                        danger of
destruction.
    On the morning of the ist of July 1796, Mr. Park was so
fortunate as to break the bonds of his captivity.                      He had
contrived to procure at his departure his own horse,                     saddle
and    bridle ; a few articles of apparel, and also his pocket
compass.        This    last he had conpealed        in  the sand during his
confinement.         He     rode forwards the whole           of  the first day
without       slopping.
                              " I   felt,"  said he,    " like one recovered
from sickness ;       I  breathed     freer ;  I  found unusual lightness
in my limbs. Even            the desert looked pleasant ; and        I dreaded
nothing but falling in with some wandering parties of Moors,
who might convey me back to the land of thieves and mur
derers, from      which I      had just escaped."
    The    first emotions         of his mind       subsiding    however into
sqbcr    reflection,      he soon found his condition to be very de
 plorable.       His    horse    grew tired, and        he   experienced     the
torments of thirst raging beyond description. Whenever he
came to a tree, he climbed it in hopes of discovering a water
 ing-place, but in vain          ; he   chewed the leaves, but found they
were    all bitter,      and afforded no relief.          In a vast wilderness
of the African continent, without             an attendant or guide, with
out food and water,            or the prospect of procuring any ; in a
 country     where     the   lion   and panther prowling for their prey
 are less to be apprehended than man, what situation could
 be more        forlorn     and    dreadful?      He    proceeded     onwards,
 however, directing his route nearly east-south-east,                     in the
 view of reaching by the shortest course possible a district that
 might afford him shelter.                A   heavy    rain about midnight
 enabled him to quench his burning thirst, by spreading his
 clothes on the ground and sucking the moisture out of them ;
 and   a muddy pool, which              he found soon after, yielded       relief
 to. his horse.      The     rest  of  the night, and nearly the whole         of 
 }he ensuing day,            neither water nor food was to be found             :
  and he must inevitably have perished,               had he not fortunately
  towards evening, lighted upon a few scattered huts of some
                                                                         Fouiab

   of iou/cous       ready prepared.         She procured likewise some corn
   and water for the horse .                  Those only who           have      suffered
   similar misery can judge              of his sensibility       at this unexpected
   deliverance.           But  as  the village belonged to the Moors, our
   traveller_had only a short time to rest. As he approached
   the territories of the negroes, however, his apprehensions
.  diminished, and his condition improved.
        Procuring        precarious support          in   this manner from the
   charity of the most wretched of human beings,                              Mr. Park
   wandered for the space of fifteen days, still however pro
   ceeding onwards in the accomplishment of his mission. At
   length,       in the morning of the sixteenth                   day, having been
  joined by         some    Mandingo         negroes,     who     were    travelling to
   Sego, he had the inexpressible satisfaction to behold the great
   object of his wishes         the      long-fought majestic Niger glitter
   ing     to the morning fun,             as broad as the Thames at               Well-
        It  is worthy of remark,        and highly to the credit of the female sex,
  that    Mr.    Park   seems invariably    to have met with compassion and relief
  from     women.       This  perfectly   accords with the account given by another
  enterprising traveller,      Mr.    Ledyard, who       expresses  himself    as follows  :
  " I    have always remarked that women in all countries are civil, obliging,
  tender     and humane ; that they are ever inclined to be           gay and cheerful,

cast, through the middle          of a very     extensive town,     which his
fellow-travellers told him was Sego, the capital of the great
kingdom of Bambara.              His emotions at this fight were ex
quisite, and      it were  unjust not to give them in our traveller's
own words       :
                   "I   hastened," fays he,           " to  the  brink of the
 river, and, having drank of the water, lifted up my fervent
 thanks in prayer to the Great Ruler                of all things, for having
 thus far crowned my endeavours with success." Unhappily,
 he had yet to sustain many severe and bitter trials                 of his  pa
 tience and fortitude.
      Information     of  a considerable          river flowing through the
 centre of Africa, between the latitudes of 15° and 200 north,
  had    been received       at   very early periods from              different
  quarters.     At   one time it was believed             to be a part   of the
  Senegal.      The Gambia        had the fame         honour ascribed      to  it
  at another.       But sufficient proof       was afterwards obtained that
  neither   of   these rivers was the      Niger, and further enquiries
  confirmed the      ancient accounts of a stream that was not only
  of greater magnitude than either the Senegal or the Gambia,
  but which flowed in a contrary direclion ; running not to the
  westward     into the Atlantic, but from west to east, to regions
  unknown.          The Moors       described      it by   the name    of  Nil il
  Abeed, or the River of Slaves            :    the negroes     bestowed on      it
   the appellation    ofJoliba, or      the Great Waters.
       Some doubt however still remained.                    It was  urged that
   the   Moors might     possibly speak       of one river, and the negroes
   of another; and        the   account of its direction towards the
   east  was received by our ablest geographers with much dif
    ficulty and hesitation. On both these points Mr. Park's
    testimony is clear and decisive          ;   the Moors, in his hearing,
    uniformly called it Nil        il Abeed ; the inhabitants of Scgo,
    the Joliba ; and that it flowed from                west to cast,     he had
    ocular demonstration        in   a long and perilous anibulation             of
    sonic hundred miles,       which    he afterwards made on its banks.

          uh. From ibe Armales de Chimie, Vol. XXVI.
   OEVERAL           celebrated         chemists       have already analysed             the
   emerald     ; but, as    I    am convinced that science is promoted
   and individuals      instructed by repeating the labours of those
  who have preceded us,             I    have again subjected            this fossil to a
   chemical analysis.           Klaproth, one of the most accurate ana
  lysers   of modem times, found in                  the emerald      of Peru siliceous
  earth 66.25, aluminc 31.25, oxyde of iron 0.50.                              It will be
  seen   in the course of this fliort memoir, that the result of my
  labour differs from that of the Prussian chemist, not only in
  the proportion of the constituent principles,                           but in their
  number, and the nature of some of them *.
     Exp.     I. This   stone, broken into small fragments, and ex
  posed to a strong heat, lost a part                   of   its beautiful green co
  lour, and retained only          a  light      ssiade   of it. In many        places    of
 it there were cracks         ;  and it lost of         its weight 0.02 grains..
     Exp.    II.  Two hundred            parts    of this    fossil, which     answered
 to 200 grains, paid de marc (eight ounces to the pound), or
 10.615 grammes, were melted for an hour in a silver cru
 cible with 600 parts of caustic po^assi.                      The matter had then
 a greenish      yellow colour.             This solution, when              evaporated,
 to a quarter of its bulk, was converted                          into   a green     jelly,
 the shade of which was much weakened by desiccation.
     The    residue was diluted in a large quantity                    of water     ; and
 it  was observed,      that the first portions of this liquid,                   poured
     According to the first analysis of the emerald, the results of which I
presented to the Nut:»ml Institute, I found in it siliceous
                                                                          earth, alumine,
liiue, and the oxyde    of  chrome    ;  bvt   since  that  epoch,   having   discovered a
new earth in the beryl, or digue marine,            I repeated my analysis, under this
new point of vicxv, and I found           also that particular     earth, as  will be seen,
iu the course of this memoir.

upon the substance, made it assume a bright and very agree
able green colour.          The solution of the salt had also the same
shade,      but weaker.       There     remained a white insipid sub
stance,     full of grains, which was insoluble in water, and had
all the     properties of siliceous earth.         It weighed 129 parts,
after having been exposed to a red heat.
       Exp.-lll. To      the liquor    of the  second   experiment, from
 which      the siliceous earth had been separated,         I added caustic
 potasti, more than necessary for saturation, and then boiled
 it for     some time.       The    greater part   of the matter precipi
  tated was at first re-dissolved        ; but there remained a certain
 quantity which           obstinately resisted solution.      The solution
 having been filtered, the insoluble matter, which, when wash
  ed and dried, weighed seven parts, was collected on the filter.
       This matter had a light lilac colour, which became green
  by the heat of the blow-pipe. When melted with borax and
  the fusible salt of urine, it gave them a superb green colour,
  perfectly like that of the emerald.               This property of thus
   giving    a green    colour to borax and microcosmic           salt, made
   me abandon the idea          I  had first conceived,     that this matter
   might be the oxyde of nickel ; since the oxyde of that metal,
   though green, communicates to borax a hyacinth colour. As
   this colour had a perfect resemblance              to that which      I  ob
   tained from the oxyde of the metal          *  contained in the red lead
   of Siberia,       I directed my experiments with a view to              esta
   blish that resemblance.           I therefore  took this colouring mat
   ter, drawn from the emerald, and boiled it to dryness with
   concentrated nitric acid.            I  then poured     upon the residue
    caustic potash,      and obtained a solution       of an orange-yellow
    colour; which when mixed with               a solution  of the nitrate     of
    lead immediately produced the red lead            of Siberia,   and gave,
    with the nitrate of mercury, a precipitate of a vermilion red
     colour, absolutely in the same manner as docs the acid of the
      red lead.

io6                   Analysts     of the Emerald of Fertt.
    These experiments, though not numerous, are sufficient to
prove, that the colouring matter of the emerald                           of Peru is
not iron, as announced by Klaproth, but that it                           is,   on the
other hand, the oxyde of the new metal which                          I   discovered
in the    red   lead of Siberia. One thing, however, which ought
to surprise      those acquainted with the sagacity and accuracy
which the chemist of Berlin (hews in his labours, and which
have gained him            so
                   high reputation,      that he did not obis,
serve this substance,            so   easily to be distinguished by             a   great
number       of characterising marks, entirely different from                       those
exhibited        by   other minerals.        I    shall now proceed         to other
principles of the emerald.
    Exp.     IV. The       reader     will recollect that          the liquor   of the
second      experiment, deprived of its siliceous earth, was pre
cipitated       by   caustic potash,        and that the precipitate was, in
great part, re-dissolved               by   an excess of this alkali.               This
solution was then supersaturated with the muriatic acid, and
carbonate of potash used in commerce was poured over it.
This produced          a   very abundant           precipitate,       which, being
washed,      and exposed to        a   red heat in     a   silver crucible, weigh
ed fifty-four parts.
    These fifty-four parts were dissolved in the sulphuric acid                        ;
and the solution,          by   the addition      oflittle potash at intervals,
                                                       a
gave,     by   several successive      crystallisations, 149 parts of alum
crystallisedin octaedrav among which there were eight or
nine parts of the sulphate of lime but as these 140 parts of
                                                  ;
alum contained only about twenty-fix parts of pure alumine,
and as the mother-water, the taste of which was exceedingly
saccharine, gave no more alum     the addition of  bynew                        a
quantity of potash, dilutedI  in water, and mixed with
                                             it                                        it
a   solution of the carbonate           of ammoniac, until             there was an
excess.     I    shook this mixture from time to time, for several
hours   ;   at the end      of which the          greater part       of the precipi
tate, which had been at first formed, was dissolved.
 I    then filtered the liquor, and collected on the paper the un-
dissolvcd matter,          which, when            washed         aud dried, weighed
                                                                                     two

liquor, being exposed to the action of fire, deposited,                 some
moments after, a white insipid dust,               full   of grains, which
dissolved with an effervescence        in acids. Being collected with
care, washed, and made          red-hot, it weighed twenty-six parts.
This     substance,    subjected   to different tests, exhibited all the
characterising marks of that earth which               I   found in the be
 ryl ; the properties       of which I explained at large in a me
moir inserted in the preceding number of the Annales, and
which has obtained the name of Glucitu.

      It  appears then by the result     of this  analysis, that there is a
  Very great difference between the proportion,                 the number,
  and the nature of the principles which constitute the eme-
  fald, and those sound by Klaproth ; since, according to him,
  it is composed of only 66.25 °f siliceous earth,
                                                                  31.25 alu
  mine, and 0.500s the oxyde of iron. There are in this stone
  then three substances not observed by the above chemist, viz.
  gluciiu, the oxyde of chrome, and lime ; while the oxyde os
  iron, which he announces-, does not «xift in it.
       It follows therefore from this      result, that the emerald and
  the beryl are two stones perfectly similar, and
                                                                 composed of

  M.lETEOROLOGY,                  which    depends only on an immense
 number of observations, has, however, been exahed into a
 science.    It   affords    general    results   of great importance    ; a
 collection of which has been made              by Cotte. By these it    ap
 pears that the barometer varies very little under the equator.
 Its variation    becomes       greater   in proportion   as it approaches
 the poles.     It   seems to experience         a diUrnal and an annual
 variation.
    Diurnal variation. Between the hours of ten and two,
 both of the day and the night, the risings and fallings of the
 mercury are the least.           The contrary takes place between
 the hours of six arid ten       of the morning and evening. This
 seems to depend on the fun and the moon passing the zenith.
    Annual variation.  The oscillations are less in summery
 greater in winter, and very great at the equinoxes.                  This
seems to depend, like the tides and the winds,                 on the fame
action   of the fun     and the moon.

feme   in all latitudes.       Kirwan      has  given a table for calcu
lating the mean        degrees   of heat    in different latitudes.

abundant in summer than in winter. Mean quantity of rain

ral temperature of        a   year returns the fame every nineteen
years, an epoch when the phases and position                 of  the moon,
in  regard to the earth,        are also the same.        From    the above
pepiod, therefore, we may predict, very nearly, the tempera
ture of any given year.            This method is        practised    by the
makers of almanacks         ;   and their predictions, to a certainde-
gree, may be depended on.            This    mode    of calculation is well
known also to merchants who speculate in the price of pro
visions.

at different heights above the surface            of the earth, as Pictet
had formerly,       and others at the       depth of four feet below it.
He   gives an account,         therefore, of the evaporation of the
                                               '
earth, electricity,      humidity,       &c.     His  observations     appear
every    month     in an excellent collection,           published by the
brothers Pictet,      under the title of Bibliotbeque Britann'ujue.
It  appears that the thermometer,           which is four    feet below the
earth, stands generally between           90 and    io° Reaum.      (5a0 and
54° Fahr.)    and that it experiences         very little variation.
    Zoology.  Great           attention has been paid to the natural
 history of animals.       Cuvier     has published a number          of  me
 moirs on zoology, and           some    have    been   published also by
 Geossroy.     Daubcnton proposes to divide the animal king
dom     into   eight classes:      1st,    viviparous     quadrupeds,       of
 which he reckons 415 ; 2d, cetaceous animals 15; 3d, birds
 2,424 ; all these animals have two ventricles in the heart :
4th, oviparous quadrupeds, of which he reckons 113 ; 5th,
 serpents 175 ; 6th, fisties 866 ; all these animals have only
one ventricle in the heart, and their blood is almost cold                      :
 7th, insects,    of which       he reckons 15,000;        their heart is of

   Cuvicr            and      Geoffrey have made several                         interesting re
searches in regard to that class                            of animals called mammalia.
The former, in                a   memoir on the rhinoceros, has proved that
the two kinds known by Camper, viz. that of Asia and that
of Africa, may have one, two, or three horns. The horns,
therefore, cannot be                      a   characterising mark to distinguish
them.              The distinguisliing mark, however, of the African
rhinoceros              is,   that     it   has only twenty-eight                denies molares,
while that of Asia has twenty-eight molares and six incifores.
He    of opinion also, that there are at least two other spe
cies   in is   existence,         and perhaps          a    third.
   Camper has proved also, that the  African elephant      dif                             is
ferent from that of Asia.    The teeth of the latter are com
posed of transversal zones, and those of the African elephant
represent on their surface                         a   kind of trefoils or lozenges.             It
appears,           that besides these two species there exist two others,
and perhaps three.                     Swediaur fays, that the greater part of
the elephants' tusks used in commerce are collected in the
immense pastures of Africa, where these animals feed, and
that the negroes                  set sire to the          meadows in order to discover
them.
   Audibert proposes                      to give      a    history of apes.          He   has   al
ready published one number,                             containing        six   coloured plates,

lines, madrepores,                 &c.     Girod Chantram has carefully                      ex
 amined some of these substances,                          which had hitherto been
classed      among the cryptogamia                 kind of plants          :     such as the
 hyffiis, conferva, ulva,                  tremella,       &c;       and observed,           that
 the greater part        of    them arc composed                of   tubes or vessels,         in
which        beings that appear to be animated circulate.     He
even distinguished      in one species of confenva a real volvox,
which had some similarity to the rotator of Gmclin.
     These supposed plants, by a chemical                             analysis,          give the
 fame      results as animal             substances.        He       therefore      concludes
that they are not plants, but species of poly piers, formed, like
 coral, by small animals.                    Of   these polypiers        he distinguiflies
two kinds; some without tubes, and some which have tubes.
We        shall    then have three               orders    of    polypiers :  ist,          The
calcareous, such              as   corals and madrepores; the substance of
which is hard and calcareous:  2d, Corallines, the substance
of which          is soft and flexible, like sponge             :   3d, The conferva,
the substance of which is absolutely                       herbaceous.              It   is to be
wished       that naturalists would pay attention to the study of
the insocts which construct these different kinds                              of   polypiers,
as they arc still        unknown.

P
A ETER BAYEN,                       member of the National Institute in the
section     of chemistry,           was born at Chalons in the department
of   la   Marae, in the            year 1725.       His     parents,      observing         that
he had a happy disposition                  for learning, took the earliest op
portunity to improve                him to the college of
                                     it,    by   sending
Troyes, where he studied the Latin language with the best
success..         Having terminated               the     course      of his      studies     at
that place, he turned his attention to natural philosophy,
and, after acquiring                the first principles            of chemistry,           soon
                                                                                         became

became sensible that, to make any real progress in that science,
the soundest judgment                 must be guided by a particular kind
of knowledge not          supplied by nature, and which can be ob
tained only by long and assiduous labour.
  With    a   tolerable stock of knowledge,                      and a desire to ob
tain more,         Bayen repaired           to Paris, where he resided                  with
an eminent apothecary, a friend                       of the    celebrated    Charras,
The intelligence          and     happy dispositions             of the pupil could
not escape the penetration of the master, who, finding in
this young man, fond of science, a character and taste simi
lar to his own, treated him                 as   his friend rather than           a   pupil,
                          of instruction, by entrusting
and procured him every means
him with the management of his laboratory.   His hopes
were not disappointed             :   Bayen applied             for several years to
all the labours       of pharmacy,               and acquired       so much (kill, in
this art, that, before he had attained to the age us thirty, he
was appointed chief apothecary to the army in Germany
during the war of seven years.    The duties of this office he
discharged         with   a   success       worthy of the confidence which
had been      reposed in him            ;   and he      sought no other recom
pense for the fatigues he underwent,                        than the satisfaction            of
being useful in the hospitals.
  After      the    peace      he returned to               Paris.    At   that       period
government          was desirous            of executing        a    plan it had been
long meditating, which was, to cause an analysis to be made
of all the mineral waters common in France. Rouelle, be
ing appointed to make choice of the chemists capable of dis
charging that talk, pointed out Bayen and Venel.    Thev at
first carried on their labours                   in conjunction,         and publislied
the result    of their        observations        ;   but   as an enterprise          of this
nature, to be completed, would require                         several   years, and' as
particular circumstances obliged Venel to discontinue                                 it,   the
whole devolved upon Bayen,                       who applied himself to           it    with
the utmost assiduity.
  He   successively published various works,                         which contained
much more extensive information                         respecting       these mineral

waters than had ever been before known.                                  The waters which
rre in particular analysed were those                         of Barreges, Bagneres,
and Luchon. The analysis of the                          latter is a model of correct
ness which ought to be followed in works of this nature,
and to which nothing could be added. This work, written
in   a very methodical manner,                      while it instructs the chemist
and the physician, may be useful also to the naturalist and the
philosopher,            and even to the man                of   letters,    by the interest
which      the author gives to a subject                        that appears to be little
susceptible        of   it,   and the variety            of the     details which     it   con
tains.      to be wished that this grand enterprise,
           It      is                                begun
by Bayen and Venel, had been continued    but the funds set          ;
apart for the execution of                     it   having been applied               to other
objects,      it   was at last dropped         ;     and the knowledge respecting
the mineral waters of France                    is      still imperfect.
     Bayen, in the course of his travels through the Pyrenees,
had studied natural history, and been convinced                                of the   neces
sity   of analysing           bodies,     in order to acquire              a   knowledge       of
the substances which compose them.                                  He   therefore collected
specimens          of   those minerals which                   seemed to be most             de
serving of particular attention                     ;    and    these     specimens     in hi3
hands became valuable materials for the ingenious analysis
which     he made             of them,     and in which he was employed                       for
twelve years.             To this         immense          labour the public            is    in
debted for Bayen's different memoirs on marble, serpentines,
porphyry,          ophites, granites, jasper, argillaceous schists, and
the sparry ore           of iron, which             he presented           to the Academy
of Sciences,        and which that body caused to be inserted among
those    of   the foreign literati.
     Stahl, the oracle of chemistry, having maintained that one
of   the effential principles in nature   pure fire, or the matis
ter which produces                 fire   in   combustible bodies, gave to this
clement thus combined the particular name of phlogiston,                                       or
the inflammable principle. Bayen, who in all his operations
sought only for truth, and would not be convinced without
evident proofs, because the habit                of experience had rendered
him mistrustful,               began to    doubt of the existence of phlogis
                                                                                             ton..

  of them.        '1  he opinion     of that    learned man did not how
  ever discourage         him   ;  and he continued his researches.               If
  was chiefly by examining precipitates               of mercury that Bayen
 convinced himself fully of the falsity             of Stahl's doctrine, and
 that he acquired        a  proof that every thing called metallic oxyde
 is indebted      for the excess of its weight, its colour, and its
 state, only to the absoqrtion           of  one    of   the constituent parts
 of  the atmospheric         air.   With    apparatus,     which    he invented,
 he made experiments so rigorously correct,                    that he was able
 to calculate the weight          of this  substance fixed in the metals.
    When       Baven presented to the Academy                   of Sciences    the
 result  of   the experiments above mentioned,                  Lavoisier,    who
 was present,        made    metallic oxydes         the object      of his     re
 searches also,       lie  repeated the experiments           of Bayen    ; found
 them correct        ;  discovered that a portion           of   the  air drawn
 from metallic calces           is much     purer than that of the atmo
 sphere ; that this portion            is the only      part which can serve
 for combustion and respiration               ;  and cave to this fluid        the
 name   of vital air. Lavoisier therefore, by removing entirely
the veil which Bayen had only drawn                    a   little aside,    over
turned for ever the theory of Stahl, and established one of
the most memorable epochs in chemistry.
    The various experiments which Bayen made, in the course
of three years, on the precipitates of mercury, led him to a
discovery     of   the singular property which some               of  these pre
cipitates have of exploding with a loud noise, when mixed
with   a very small       quantity of the flowers of sulphur. Bayen's
labours also in regard to tin ought not to be passed over in
silence. It was a question in chemistry, to determine whether
that metal really contained arsenic,               as  Margrassand Henkel
had said   ;   and, supposing it did, whether the quantity would
be sufficient to make the use of it be abandoned in economi
cal purposes.          The long and laborious           researches    of Bayen
discovered      that there exists tin without             any mixture;        and
                                        P4                                   that

that there exists some also, which                  is united to a very          small
quantity of the arsenical substance.
     His  analyses      taught him also, that the tin                 used   in com
merce, and that manufactured by pewterers,                         contain copper
and antimony,          which render it hard            ;  zinc, which         gives     it
 a white colour ; bismuth,              which      renders it sonorous ; and,
 above all, lead,      which diminislies          its value.    It  is  in particular
 this metal fraudulently united with tin, that can render the
 latter dangerous *,          as   both these substances are soluble in
 vegetable     acids. Scarcely had Bayen's researches on tin been
 made     public,     when the uneasiness excited                by Margraff and
 Henkel vanislied. It was clearly proved, that                        the very small
 quantity of arsenic contained in tin cannot                           absolutely      be
 hurtful,    and no more ideas were entertained                      of banishing        a
 species   of  vessels   so  long employed by our ancestors.
     Bayen      had   such     a   habit of considering objects, and of
 judging of their composition by                the analyses he had made                of
  analogous objects, that it was often sufficient for him to see
  and to touch them in order to tell their nature.                         As a proof
  of this    assertion,     may be mentioned the opinion which he
  gave   of one    of the marble       balustrades in the Place de la Revo
  lution.     Notwithstanding           the polisli and apparent            solidity of
  this marble, he foretold that it would decay                       in   a very    little
  timej    and he pointed out to Deyeux,                   who was present,            the
  different places where the alteration would                      first manifest       it
  self,  and    those    which would endure the longest.                       Scarcely
  had a year elapsed when the prediction began to be accom
  plished ; and in less than three years the alteration was so
  great, that considerable excavations were formed in the
   places pointed out.           Bayen was of opinion,              that the in onu-
       Thf  pewter pets in common use           in   London    contain    lead  in   their
  composition ; and    at all    the beer drawn        in them    is more or lesi acid
  (stak), it  is evident that those who use them are constantly taking,            though
  in small quantities,      a so'.uticn  of lead, which     is highly noxious.        It is
  very improper,     therefore,    to uie beer which has stood in           them for any
  kf gth of rime.     Edit.

ments which have subsisted without                  any perceptible altera
tion for  long series of ages, have been those constructed
             a
of marble, little susceptible of any attack from the action of
the air or of water.              From    all the analyses     which   he made
of marble belonging            to ancient monuments,             he concluded,
that when        a   public edifice is to be erected, an architect can
not take too many precautions to be assured of the good state
of the materials he employs, especially when they are brought
from a quarry recently opened.                 By thus making          an useful
application of chemistry            to an art which seemed to be foreign
to   it,    he revived   a   truth, too little noticed, that there exist*
between       all the sciences      a   connection which unites them by
fixed and invariable principles.
     Besides the labours above mentioned, Baven began others,
which, on account of              the many experiments necessary before
he could obtain certain results,               were never finished      ;    for he
was of opinion that the operations of chemistry ought to be.
conducted slowly, like those of nature. On this account he
has been known to employ himself whole years in the ex
amination        of one      substance,      in which     he wished         to dis
cover and to separate              a    matter, that would have been de
stroyed or altered           by   too violent means, had he            proceeded
with       more haste.       To this prudent conduct           was    owing the
great      perfection to which            he always     carried his labours;
and his accuracy was               so
                         great, that he was never afraid of
seeing his experiments repeated                by
                                    other chemists.
     This diligent and laborious man, when he had attained
to   the age of sixty, found his health, which had hitherto
been found and robust, sensibly impaired                  by a   long and pain
ful malady.-            Several    journeys     which    he was obliged to
undertake, the loss of some friends, domestic   troubles, and
weakness  brought on    his labours, hastened his death. He
                                   by
supported his complicated evils with great patience, and died
in the beginning of the present year, at the age of seventy-
two.        Bayen lived       in   celibacy, but he      possessed     the virtue
necessary for that condition.              He was   a   man of    a   found judg

 In  the distribution of the places which he had at his disposal,
 when inspector of hospitals with the army,           he observed the
 most impartial justice; conferring them according to merit,
 and   inexorable even to solicitations from his relations or
 friends.    Chemistry did not occupy the whole of his atten
 tion, and the variety of the knowledge which he had acquired
 by his studies, rendered his conversation interesting and

 I  N  the public sitting of the French National Institute, held
on the 15th of Meslidor (July 3), after an account had been
given of the labours of the preceding three months, Cit.
David Lcroy read       a  memoir on the small ships of war of the
Ancients, which        he examined from        the  time of the first
Punic war      to the battle   of Actium.     He  made choice   of this
epoch, as being that which            presented the most remarkable
improvements,        and   respecting   which   we have the most in
formation.        The author, in this memoir, points out       the ad
 vantages   of   these vessels,  which were exceedingly narrow in
proportion to their length, several of them being eight and
even ten times longer than they were broad, which allowed
them, though pushed forwards by oars alone, to advance with
great velocity.      Cit. Leroi thinks that, notwithstanding the
improved     state  of navigation, oars ought not to be      so  much
neglected;      and that ships of war like those used          by the
Ancients     might    still, especially   during  caluiSj be attended
with   great advantages.

    Cit. Fleurieu communicated           some conjectures,       perhaps
too hypothetical,       on the manner in which          the north-west
coast   of America      was peopled;    together   with  a general view
of that coast, and of both the Americas in regard to civiliza
tion.     This memoir       displays the extensive knowledge       of  its
author.
    Cit. Colin-IIarleville      recited  a dialogue between       a man
and his own conscience.             Several  traits of sentiment    were
loudly applauded.
    Cit. Chaptal communicated a memoir on yellow dves, to
which it has been as yet found impossible to give splendour
and durability.        The author pointed out      the chemical means
to be employed for accomplishing this object; and took oc
 casion    to (hew    the great obligation which        the arts have to
 chemistry.
    Cit. Mongcz        presented   some reflections on two antique
 statues,    the dying    gladiator, and the gladiator repellens, or
 sighting gladiator;      which    are now on their way to embel
 lish the Museum          of Antiques,      and   of which      beautiful
 copies in bronze may be seen at the entrance             of the court   of
                                                                            '
 the Tuilleries.       Cit. Mongcz is of opinion that          these two
 Greek statues do not represent gladiators, who were known
 only among the Romans, whom the people despised, and
 ¦who   were,    however,   seen  with pleasure  but rather Grecian
 wrestlers.      It is well known that the Greeks united in their
  wrestlers, those ideas of dignity, strength and beauty, which
  are seen imprinted on these beautiful statue6.
     Cit. Lalande,       aster remarking that      the magnetic needle

  several observations,      which he communicated to the Assem
  bly, that it directs itself towards a certain place on the sur
  face of the earth, which he thinks approaches

hold public meetings, the information            it   must    diffuse    in  its

   On   the  evening of the 17th inst, the Members of the
Royal Academy of London, by desire of government, held a
meeting     at Somerset- house       to consider     os some      beautiful
device for our coin, which may render counterfeiting more
difficult, and impress foreigners with an idea of our national
taste.    The  idea is good so far as it goes,        but ft ought to go
farther.    Our   coinage    ought to be     so managed        as to serve
for a real historical series and chronology            of  all   important
public    events,  whether of     a prosperous      or adverse nature.
The Royal Society         and   Royal Academy would            be usefully
 employed in producing the necessary devices,               legends,       8ce.

equal facility give so much information            to all ranks       in the
community.        The    events recorded    on our coins stiould           not

with     a mission         relative       to the arts,          in    a    letter   dated    Aix,
Prairial 14th, fays:               "   Some workmen, who were digging up
the ground on the declivity of an eminence which overlooks
Vienne,          discovered      a small        group, consisting of two children
formed of white marble, in perfect preservation,                                    and exceed
ingly well executed j                  one   of   the children holds            a   bird, which
the other endeavours                   to snatch from           it,   and which        seems to
peck      the         arm of the latter.                 Each      of the children            rests
against the trunk             of   a    tree.       At   the bottom            of one of     these
trunks, and near the child which holds the bird,                                       is   seen    a
serpent      ;    and on the other trunk there                       is   a   lizard having in
its mouth          a   butterfly.

     THE Abbe Hauy,                     having polished            a      fragment of trans
parent        native sulphur, found that                      it     possesses the     power of
double refraction in               a   very eminent degree.                    The two       faces
of this fragment              are inclined               to each       other about twelve
degrees,          and their greatest distance                 is   fourteen         millimetres,
or   a   little more than           six   lines.      If this      fragment be placed on
a    piece    of      paper on which            a   line has been drawn, two very
diiiinct          images    of   the line are seen.                  By observing objects
somewhat remote through this fragment,                                    it   may be judged,
 by   the distance between the images, that the refraction of
sulphur          in   itself must be very considerable,                       allowance being
made for the density                of that       substance,          the specific weight          of
which        is   only double that of water               ;   and this agrees with the
results      of Newton, in              regard to the refractive                 powers     of in
flammable bodies.                  Cit. Hauy        proposes to make experiments
in   order to determine the quantity                        of this refraction, which
                                                                                               has

with the      result    of calculation, according to               the proportion
between      the refractive powers of inflammable                  substances and
their densities.

     AN     ingenious Artist at Paris has lately completed, with
great    perseverance,         patience, and mathematical accuracy,
a very curious         model of that city,           on which        he has     been
employed nine years.                He    has not contented           himself with
comparing and correcting all the plans of Paris ever pub
lished : he measured all the streets, squares, &c. according to
the most accurate geometrical methods of measurement,                             and
determined the inequalities of the site of that immense capi
tal by levelling.          The greatest diameter of his model, in the
 extent    from     east   to westj is fifteen       feet.     The mean       size  of
 the houses is three lines.            The    artist has carried       his accuracy
 Ib far, that each inhabitant            of Paris     can distinguish his own
 house, court-yard,          and garden.        The public        places and gar
 dens are represented          with   a most   striking similitude ; and not
 only their dimensions but their colour and ornaments can be
 observed.       The alternate rising          and     falling    os the plane      of
 the model gives to this representation                    a correctness      which
 produces       an effect     like enchantment,           if  the observer       sup
 poses himself        to be     standing     on   Mount-Marte,            and to be
  looking down on the city.               The    artist has with much         judg
  ment endeavoured,           by the shades        of   his  colours, to give a
 point   of   rest  to  the  eye  ;  the   want    of  which     is a great failing
 in that model of Rome which formerly stood in the library
  of St. Genevieve,           and which       now belongs to the French
  nation,     as  it exhibits the      tiresome view        of  a   dazzling white
  mass   of   gypsum.        Thirty     thousand      trees, which distinguish
  the   different walks, public            places,     and gardens,        form an
  agreeable variety with the slated and tiled roofs.                    This model
  may be taken           to pieces     by means of screws,             and   can    be

  A dihect             communication                   between the counties              of Kent
and Essex        has been projected by                    Mr. Dodd, engineer, by
means which we              think well calculated                  to answer the intended
purpose.         He     proposes a            cylindrical       tunnel under the river
Thames,         from        Gravesend to Tilbury,                        to    be   constructed
wholly with key-stones, and therefore able to bear any pres
sure; the diameter to be sixteen feet in the clear, which
Mr. Dodd imagines will                         be sufficient        for foot, horse, and
carriage-passengers;              the passage to be illuminated with lamps,
and a steam-engine to be erected                              in    a proper situation to
draw off the drainage water, if any should accumulate.
  The expence of this stupendous undertaking is estimated
at so low a sum as 15,9551. for 900 yards of tunnelling, re
laying the bottom, lamps, lamp-irons, steam-engine, pipes,
and other necessary machinery.
   This     projected           measure          will    save      a circuitous          route of
fifty miles by land (the                       distance       from Gravesend              to   Til
bury, along London-Bridge).                            Independent of the advantage
it would        afford to commercial establishments                             and agricultu
ral improvements, the general benefit to the counties of Kent
and Essex must be immense.                      #
   Mr. Dodd           is   of opinion, that, whether                     the measure is con
sidered as a great              national improvement, or a local one to
the two counties, of forming                       a    military post of the first con
sequence         in that part of the kingdom,                           for enabling troops,
&c.   to pass through,               its importance claims the greatest at
 tention.        Another question he suggests,                          is,   what may be the
most proper           method of raising the supplies to defray the ex-
 pence     of    the undertaking-  whether                        by   the   joint   expence     of
 both counties, or              by   a   subscription of private individuals, in
 corporated        by      Parliament,          with authority to levy tolls? The
 latter mode he            is   convinced would be beneficial to the indi
 viduals, and amply repay the (hare-holders.

                            VEGETATION.
    IN   our first number (page 109) we stated that, from some
interesting experiments which had been recently made by
Sir Francis Ford, it      had been     proved    that plants sprinkled
with water, previously impregnated with oxygen                gas,  grew
much more vigorously,           and displayed     more beautiful tints,
than those nourished with common water.                 The application
of oxygen     tta promote vegetation       has been since tried in the
following simple manner, and the result has been the fame
as above stated : Bottles filled with oxygen gas, being first
inverted, .have had their mouths buried under ground, near
the roots of the plants intended to be supplied with it.
After   some time the gas in the bottles was found reduced              to
the standard      of common atmospheric air: but             the oxygen
had done its duty ;      for the plants that had been thus sup
plied with it were much          more healthy and beautiful than
others of the fame        kinds placed      in every other respect in
similar circumstances.

I.    Description    of      the large Orang Outang                   of   Borneo.     By
     F. B. von Wdbhb.                    From /^Transactions of the Ba-
     taviau Society in the Island of Java.
JLV JLaNKIND              have bestowed every possible pains to trace
out the progress of nature, and                         to discover those         threads
by which her works are connected                        ;    and their exertions, in
deed, have        not always been fruitless.                    Thus, for example,
the    discovery     of animal plants               pointed         out the transition
from the vegetable to the animal                        kingdom.           The   bat and
the flying        squirrel        displayed    the connection between qua
drupeds      and birds        ;    and the     seal         and the sea-cow       that of
quadrupeds with siflies.
     The   greatest vacuity           which    appears          to us in the plan       of
nature      is,   certainly, that observed between man,                          a   being
endowed with reason, and the irrational animals.                                 Natural
ists hitherto have endeavoured,                 but in \ain,          by   the most ac
curate researches, to acquire some satisfaction                         on   this-point;
and we may almost consider                    it   as       certain that the links of
the great chain,             here wanting,          are not to be found              in the
world which          we at present            inhabit.          Were nothing more
required but similarity of bodily conformation,                              this transi-
      Vui.   I.                                 U                                     lion,

226                Dtscrlplion       of    ibe Orang Outang
tion,    without       doubt, would be sound                in the four-handed
race   of  apes.      But  as the qualities          ot" the    mind are here as
much considered          as the     form of the body, it is evident that
the ape, which does not d.krve the second rank amonff the
irrational animals, cannot form the link that connects qua
drupeds      with man.          The       external    figure, however, of this
animal has since the earliest periods engaged the attention
of   naturalists    ;  and by the similitude             of   its body we are led
to suspect     a  similitude of mental powers in beings to which
the all-wife Creator has given                  so much likeness.        Rut   as the
discoveries      made     by the searchers          into nature are frequent
ly not    so  much the truth           as    something suited to the system!
which they have adopted, this circumstance has given rife to
a   great deal of error.           The      celebrated    Linnæus himself was
induced by        a figure  which Bontius * delineated of an orang
outang, or wild man,             seen     in the island of Java, and the ac
counts of some travellers, to class his                homo    noflumus or night-
man between            man   and       the ape,      and     thereby    to establish
 the existence        of a being,        the truth     of which      is as yet very-
doubt sul.
     Buffiin     proceeded       in    a    much     more       cautious    manner.
 That    celebrated      naturalist       suspected,      and    not without rea
 son,    that the accounts given with so little accuracy of the
 night-men alluded only to the white negroes or kakerlaks,
 considered       in   a false    light or under the veil of prejudice                ;
 and, indeed, the description given by Bontius of the orang
 outang differs only in some very inconsiderable circum
 stances     from      the  figure       of the white           negro or kakirluk
 Saudami described by             M.    van    Iperenf.     If we    take from this
 description of Bontius the ruff under the chin,                        and the few
 hairs which cover the head,                   a more    beautiful human form

                                of   the Island     of Borneo,                        ilf
    would      appear      tha.i that of Saudami*;               and had the        latter
    grown up, not at the court               of  the prince       of Tabana,       but  in
    the solitary woods of the island of Bali, his mental powers
    would have been so little expanded, that an inattentive ob
   server might         have      classed   him among the             pon^os,      varis,
   orang outangs, Stc. of Batiel, Pyrard, Reguat, and others.
   But the figure which Bontius has given us of the onng ou-
   tang may have been delineated                  with too great a resemblance
   to that    of man,     and contrary to truth ; for, if we adhere only
    to the description, we can discover                    nothing more than a
   common large orang outang or pongo. Brisson, who classes
   the orangoutang ot Bontius along with the vari, appears to
   have been       of the    fame opinion.           An    instance   of   such a false
   and    to-> human-like representation               of this animal occurs          also
   in   the figure     of   an orang outaivr           of   the island     of Borneo,
   given in Bcckman's voyage ; where the author speaks, with
   out all doubt, of the fame species as that transmitted to our
   society from that island.              Bui be this as it may, it is certain
   that since     thi>  time Bonlius resided in Java, or the middle                     of
   the last century, no orang outanc, such                       as that delineated
   by him, has been found                 either in this island or in any               of
  those in the neighbourhood                ;  and as he asserts          that he saw
  several such animals             of both    sexes, it is certainly        incompre
   hensible     why the       least   traces   of  them are not now to be dis
  covered.        The     oldest and       most     experienced        Javanese are
  acquainted with no other orang outangs than                             such as     are
  real     apes ; and they distinguish under this Malayan                         name
        " The description of       thcwhitcnegTO," says the author in his Letters
from India," will ailbrda          new and incontestable      proof to our naturalists,
  that every thing hitherto said        of whole  rare*   of kakcrluks or    white negro
 night-men, and thclike,         is mere  fables and that such men are sometimes
 produced here and there only by accident.                 Tlie  parents   of this white
 negro, who is called Saudnmi, were, like the other ii'habitantsot'theirna-
 tive country, the island        of BaJi, of a   dark brown colon       . and their son
 ¦os     not sickly, but large and strong.           I found   him to be five lect two

328                Description     of the Orang Oulang
two kinds without tails, which                Bnffon     places   among the
Bongos or jockos.            Both are natives of Borneo,               the only
place almost where they are found               ;   and whatever      travellers
may fay, they are as         litile to he seen in the forests and           wilds
of Java    as the  lions and elephants represented on some charts
of   that island.      The    small species which        Buflbn, by abbre
viating the Congo name, calls jockos, are often brought to
Java by     sliips coming from Bangarei j and               of this kind     was
 that sent alive      to Europe in       J 776, and of which an accu
 rate description has         been given by Wosmaer.                The orang
 outangofthe         large  kind, or the pongo of Buflbn, is not
common even in its native country Borneo ; and much pains
and labour had been in vain employed, for upwards of twen
ty years, in endeavouring to catch one of                  these   strong     and
mischievous animals.              M. Palm,        the resident at Rembang,
was at length          so  fortunate, on occasion          of his being       sent
 on an important          mission to Sukkadana, to procure after a
 great deal     of trouble    one   of these animals,        which he sent to
 the Batavian Society preserved              in    arrack.    The following
 accurate description of it will,            in niv opinion,        mow how
 fruitless it will be to search for the wild men of Bonlius in
 this  f|>ecies  of orang ontang.
     The   head in a certain degree is somewhat               sharpened from
 behind towards the top.             The mouth projects           a  little   for
 wards, and on each cheek is            a fleshy excrescence (vLesucbtigt
 kwabbe)      which     extends sidewise more than the thickness of
 the head.       The cars are small, and lie flat to the head.                The
  eyes are small and prominent.               The    nose, without any per
  ceptible elevation, consills merely of two long nostril*, placed
  in  an oblique direction         towards each other.          The mouth is
  surrounded by tbick          lips  and in the inside has no pouches
  (zacten).       The tongue is thick and broad. On that of the
  animal in question there were found some remains of green
  herbs which        it had eaten.        Each jaw is furnislicd            before
  with four     broad incisors, standing between            two thick canine
  teeth, which rife above them.               The    face is  of a dark brown
                                                                           colour,

colour,           and has no hair, except                        a very       thin    beard.         The
 neck is exceedingly short.                         The        breast is much broader than
the hips.            At    the rump there is no appearance                            of   a   tail, nor
of anv tough projecting hide. The penis seems to be drawn
 back into the body.                     The        hands are long, and the palms as
well        as    ihe fingers           are    of    a    dark brown colour,                   and have
no hair.            The        legs arc short and                thin, but the muscles are
strong.            The     sect       have a great             resemblance           to the      hands.
The        toes and fingers are furnished with                           black nails,            almost
like those of a man, except the large toes, which arc smaller
and shorter;              a difference that arises perhaps                           from the fre
quent         use    made  of them.                      The breast and the belly are
mostly bare.            The other parts of the body, the face, the
ears,       the     palms of the hands, the feet and the fingers ex
cepted,           are covered with brown hair, which                             in many         places
is fully as long as the finger.
         Under      the     skin of the throat aud breast of the animal
transmitted to the society,                         there were found two bags,                       one
of which occupied                    the greater part of the breast, and, as well
as l\\i>. smaller          which was enclosed in in                      it,   had   a   communi
cation with the wind-p^pe.                               As this       rare    animal          was   ile-
flincd for the cabinet of the Prince of Orange,                                        it     was sub
jected        to no        further anatomical researches,                        for fear of de
stroying its configuration.                           The bowels,              to guard against
corruption, were                     taken    out before          it   had been transmitted
to Batavia. We, however,                                 flatter ourselves       with the well-

ajO                      Description of the Orang Ouiang
animal was caught, we were informed by                                      M. Palm, that it
defended          itself       so   furiously with sharp-pointed slicks, which
it broke off from                   the trees,         that it was impossible              to take     it
alive.      Tim         property it seems to possess in common with the
African pongos, which,                      as    Beutel fays, attack elephants with
these weapons,                  and drive them from their places                       of resort*.
   The following is an accurate measurement of the different
parts of this animal, according to the Rhinlandic foots
divided into twelve inches                        :
   Whole length of the animal from the soles of the feet to
the crown of the head 3 feet \o\ inches.  Thi3, however,
does not agree with the measurement made in the island of
Borneo, where the whole length was found to be 49 inches ;
but perhaps a different standard was employed, or the body
of       the animal            might have become                    contracted by lying in

    Vol. I. Part III.       1798.
I   N  the course    of my      repealed      tours through the
ascended the Broken twelve different times ; but                     I
                                                                      Harz*,

                                                                               I
good fortune only twice (both times about Whitsuntide)                       to
see  that atmospheric phenomenon called the Spectre of the
Broken, which appears to me worthy of particular attention,
as it must, no doubt, be observed on other high mountains
which have      a situation    favourable for producing it.
    The  first time    I   was deceived        by this extraordinary phe
nomenon      I  had clambered up to the summit                 of the Broken,
very early in the morning, in order to wait there for the in
expressibly beautiful view of the sun rising in the east.                  The
heavens     were already streaked with               red ; the    fun was just
appearing above the horizon                in full majesty, and the most
perfedt serenity prevailed          throughout the surrounding coun
try,  when    the  other     Harz     mountains in the south-west, to
wards the Worm mountains, Sec. lying under the Broken,
began to be covered           by     thick clouds.         Ascending at that
moment the granite rocks called the Teufelskanzel, there ap
peared    before me,        though at       a great distance,      towards  the
Worm mountains and               the Achtermannshohe,             the gigantic
figure of a man, as if           standing      on   a  larec pedestal.     But
scarcely had     I discovered       ii when it     begr.n to disappear; the
clouds sunk down speedily               and    expanded,       aud   I saw the
phenomenon no more.
   The   second time, however,              I saw this spectre       somewhat
more distinctly,     a  little below the summit ol the Broken, and
near the Heinnchshone,             as    I was looking at the fun rising
about four o'clo.k in the morning.                   The weather was ra
ther tempestuous         ;  the   sky towards       the    level country   was
          
             The Han nouuuns              arc  sitealed   in Hanover.
                                                                        pretty

                                    on a singular Phenomenon.                             233
               Observations
pretty clear, but the Harz mountains had attracted several
thick clouds, which had been hovering around them, and
which beginning to fettle on the Broken confined the pro
spect. In these clouds, soon after the rising of the sun, I
saw my own shadow, of a monstrous size, move itself for a
couple of seconds exactly                 as    I    moved ; but            I   was   soon in
volved in clouds, and the phenomenon disappeared.
     It    is impoisble      to see this phenomenon, except when the
fun is at such an altitude             as to        throw his rays upon the body
in    a horizontal       direction    ;    for,     if he   is higher, the shadow is
thrown rather under the body than before it.
     In         of September last
           the month                                     year,    as    I       was making a
tour through the Harz with a very                           agreeable           party, and as
cended the Broken,             I found     an excellent account and expla
nation of this phenomenon,                     as seen      by   M. Haueon            the 23d
of May        1797   > in   his diary of an excursion to that mountain.
I    shall therefore        take the liberty     of transcribing it. " Aster
having been here for the                   thirtieth time," says M. Haue,
"    and, besides other objects of my attention, having procur
ed information           respecting       the above-mentioned atmospheric
phenomenon,             I    was at length so fortunate as to have the
pleasure      of seeing it     ; and perhaps           my description              may afford
satisfaction to others who visit the Broken through curiosity.
The fun rose about four o'clock, and, the atmosphere being
quite serene towards the east, his rays could pass without any
obstruction over the Heinrichfliohe.   In the south-west, how
ever, towards Achtennannsliohc,                        a brisk west wind carried
before it thin transparent                vapours, which were not yet con
densed into thick heavy clouds.
     About quarter past four went towards the inn, and
     '.'            a                           I
looked round to fee whether the atmosphere would permit
me to have          a   free prospect to the south-west                     ;    when I   ob
served, at      a   very great distance             towards Achtermannshohe,

 by moving my arm towards my head, and the colossal figure
 did the fame.
     " The pleasure       which I felt on this discovery can hardly be
described      ;  for  I had already walked many a weary step in
the hopes of feeing this shadowy image, without being able
to gratify my curiosity. I immediately made another move
ment by bending my body, and the colossal figure before me
repeated it.         I was desirous of doing the fame thing once
more  but my colossus had vanished.                    I  remained in the
same position, waiting to see whether it would return,                    aud
in   a few       minutes     it  again    made   its appearance      on the
Achtermannfliohe.              1 paid my respects to      it  a second  time,
and it did the same to me.             I then called the landlord os the
Biokcn     ;  and having both taken the lame position which I had
taken alone, we looked towards the Achtermannfliohe,                      but
saw nothing.           We   had not, however, stood loug, when two
such colossal figures were formed over the above eminence,
which repeated our compliments by bending their bodies as
we did ;         after   which    they    vanished.     We retained our
position     ; kept our eyes fixed        on the fame        spot, and   in a>
little the two figures again stood before us, and were joined
by a third.         Every movement that we made by bending our
bodies these figures imitated  but with this difference, that
the phenomenon was sometimes                 weak and faint, sometimes
strong and well defined.             Having thus had an opportunity
of discovering        the  whole secret of this phenomenon, I can
give the following information             to such   of my readers as may
be desirous       of  feeing it themselves.      When the rising fun,
and according to analogy the cafe              will   be the fame      at the
setting sun, throws his rays over the Broken upon the body

stcdsalily     upon them, and, in all probability, he will            see the
singular spectacle of his own shadow extending to the length
of   live or six hundred          iett, at the distance       of about two

   Parts of Africa.        From tbe Proceedings of the Africaa
   Association, I798.
                       [Concluded from Page 204.]
  -I HE city     of Sogo,    at which    Mr. Park    had now arrived,
consisted   of four divisions or quarters, two on each               fide of
the water; and each of them being surrounded by                      a  mud
wall, it had the appearance of four distinct towns.                     The
houses    are built   of clay,   and   have flat roofs ; but some          of
them have two stories,         and    many are white-washed.             Be
sides  these    buildings,    Moorish     mosques    are seen      in every
quarter.      These objects, with the numerous boats on the
river, a crowded population, and the cultivated              state   of the
surrounding      country, formed altogether        a prospect      of civi
lisation and magnificence which our traveller little expected
to find in the bosom of Africa.           From the best inquiries he
could make, he had reason to believe that the place contained
altogether about 30,000 inhabitants,
    The  boats   on the Niger arc formed of the trunks of two
large   trees rendered concave,        and joined together,         not fide
by fide, but lengthways, the junction being exactly across
the middle     of the boat.     They    are therefore    very long, and
disproportions bly narrow       ;  and have neither decks nor masts;
they are however roomy.           Mr. Park   observed in one       of them
four horses and a great many people crossing at              a   ferry.
   To this ferry Mr. Park            proceeded,    intending       to cross
over to the largest quarter         of the city,  where he was in
formed the king of Bambara held his residence                  ;    but the
number of people pressing for          a passage  was such as to pre
vent his embarkation.
                                                                        The

   2$6              Mr. Park's        Journey into Africa.
     The multitude       gazed on the stranger with silent             wonder;
  and he distinguished with concern many Moors among them.
  Iu  the mean lime, information that             a white man was waiting
  for   a passage   was conveyed         to the  king    ;  who immediately
  sent a messenger to inquire what brought him to Sego, and
  what he wanted       ?    Our traveller, having given           the best an
  swer he could as to       the motives of his journey,            added,    that
  he was there in his way to           Jennc, and, having         been robbed
  of all  he   possessed,    implored the king's bounty and protec
 tion.     The    messenger      told him to go to          a distant   village,
  which he pointed out, and wait for the king's further orders.
     Mr    Park complied with these directions,               but found that
 the inhabitants of the village were either averse or afraid to
 give him lodging or entertainment ; and having turned his
 horse lo se, he sought shelter from a storm of thunder and
 rain under    a tree.   At length,      as  night approached,       the kind
 ness and humanity inherent in the female sex, to which he
 had often     been indebted        on former occasions,         came to his
 relief on the present.         A poor negro woman returning from
 the labours     of  the field     observed     that    he was wet,      weary
 and dejected,     and, taking up his saddle and bridle, told him
 to follow     her.    She led him         to her cottage,      lighted up a
 lamp, procured him an excellent supper of fish, and plenty
of corn for his horse ; after which, she spread a mat u|>on
the    floor,   and   said   he might       remain there for the nights
For this well-timed bounty our traveller presented her with
two os the four brass buttons which remained on his waist
coat.     Mr. Park      relates that this good woman, having per
formed the riles of hospitality herself,               called  in the female
part of    her family,     and     made them spin cotton for a great
part of    the   night.     They     lightened their labour by songs i
one of which must have been composed extempore                       5 for our
traveller was himself the subject of it             ;   and the air was,      in
his opinion,      the sweetest       and    most    plaintive he had ever
heard.      The words,        as may be expected,          were simple, and
may be literally. translated as follows           :   "  The winds roared,
                                                                           and

                    Mt. Ptirl't     Journey into Africa.                   937
and the rain fell.          The poor white man, faint and weary,
came and       set   under our tree.       ETc has     no mother to      bring
him milk no wife to grind his corn."                   Cbarus.       "  Let
us pity the white man          5  no mother has he, &?. 6cc.'
   Mr. Park continued          all the next day in the village, with
out receiving any orders from the king,                 and   found    himself
the object of universal           inquiry.     He     soon heard     enough,
however, to convince him, that the Mo.                     rs and Slatees or
slave traders,       residing in Sego, were exceedingly            fufpiriout
concernine the motives           of   his journey,      and in the highest
degree hostile towards him.              He learnt     that many consulta
tions had been held with (he king concerning his reception
and dispofil     ;   and the villagers openly told him that he had
many enemies, and mud expect no favour.
   On     the third day the messenger arrived ; and, bringing a
bag in his hands, signified to our traveller that he must de
part forthwith from the vicinage of Sego ; but that Mansong
the king, wishing to relieve a white man in distress, had
sent him 5000 kowries*             to enable    him to purchase provi
sions in the       course   of  his journey.       The    messenger added,
that   if  Park's intentions were really to proceed to Jenne, he
had orders to accompany him as              a guide to     Sausajiding.
   Being thus compelled to leave              Se>sp,     Mr.    Park applied
himself to collect all the information                  he could from his
guide.       Though it was evident that this man was sent prin
cipally in the view of discovering the motives and object of
his journey, he was found to be very friendly and commu
nicative.      By him Mr. Park was frankly told, that                if Jenne
was the place of his destination, he had undertaken an en-
terprize of greater         danger than      probably       he v as apprised
of; for, although          the town     of Jenne     was nominally       a part
of   the king    of Bambara's dominions, it            was in fact a city     of
   
       Kowries or cowries arc *mall shells which in Afiica and many parti
of   tbc East Indies pa»s current as money.        In   Bambant a hundred ot'

 the Moors         ;   the principal part            of the inhabitants being Bush-
 reens or Mahometans                   ;     and       even       the      governor himself,
 though appointed by Manfong,                            was     of   the fame sect.                Mr.
 Park's reflections on this occasion                            were aggravated                 by the
 circumstance, that his danger was likely to increase                                     a3 he ad
 vanced on his journey ; for he learnt that the -places beyond
 Jenne      were under the Moorish                      influence, in             a   still    greater
 degree than Jen ne itself; and that Tombuctoo,      the great
 object of his research,   was altogether in the possesfiou of
 that savage and merciless people.
      Notwithstanding            these discouraging reflections,                          Mr. Park
 persisted       in what    he conceived              to be his duty ; and the first
 town       of   nbte »t which             he arrived after              leaving Sego, was
 called Kabba.             It   is situated in the midst                   of   a beautiful and
 highly cultivated country,
                                                "    bearing," fays             Mr. Park,           "    a
greater resemblance              to the centre              of Kngland, than to what
I    should have supposed had                   been        in the middle of Africa ;"
and the      season      was that      of \\\zjhea           harvest, or the gathering
in    the fruit which           produces        ihejbea-toulou                  or tree-butter,
the great abundance of which in this quarter was astonish*
ing.   The tree itself very much resembles the American
oak;     and the nut, from the kernel                           of which          the butter            i»
prepared by boiling it in water, has somewhat the appear
ance of a Spanish olive.  The kernel is enveloped in a sweet
pulp under         a   thin gre    n   rind     ;    and it is        Mr. Park's- opinion,
that the butter produced                   from       it,   besides the advantage                    of
its keeping without               salt the      whole year,              is     whiter,        firmer,
and    of   a    richer flavour than the best butter he ever tasted
made        from cow's milk.                 The growth                 and      preparation         of
this commodity            seem to be        among the sirlt objects of African
industry in this and the neighbouring states   and                         ;            it     consti
tutes  amain article of their inland commerce.
    On      the afternoon         of       the second day               Mr. Park              and   hr»
guide reached Sansauding,                   a   \ery large town situated on the
banks of the Niger, much                        resorted to           by   the    Moors, who
bring thither large quautities                      c-f salt,    which          they barter for
                                                                                               Jbta-

Jb*a-touIou and gold dust.                    Leaving this place early next
 momimr, he proceeded to a town called Nyarfl', and from
 thenct fa Modibao,            a delightful place       on the banks of the
 river, which       is here very         broad, and enlivened with many
 small     and verdant        islands,     all  or" them stocked with       cattle
 and crowded with villages.                  Here he was compelled           lo  set
  off again abruptly, for tear of the Moors,                 the el'-ety or  chief
  man giving him           a guide      toKea; but his       horse, which       had
  been long reduced to a mere skeleton,                  dropped    on the road,
  and he was obliged to quit him.                   At Kca   he embarked in a
  fishing canoe, and was landed                in fix hours at Silla,      a large
  town on the southern              side  of  the   \iger.    At this   place she
  dooiy    was    nearly    as   savaee    as the     Moors, and it was with
  great difficulty our traveller could get shelter lor the                  night.
  He    was now convinced              by painful experience,      that   the ob
  stacles to his further progress were infurmountable,and                       that
   ra attempting to reach           Jenne,     unless under theprotection         of
  some men        of weight     and influence among the Moors,              which
   he had     no    possible means of obtaining,            he should     sacrifice.
   himself to no purpose          ;  for his discoveries     would perish with
   him.      He    considered at the same time, that by returning to
   Gambia       in  a different     route, he might Hill promote in some
   degree the purpose        of his     mission ; for, having discovered         the
   Niger    at a great distance        from its head, he mould be adding
   considerably to the geography of Africa, in tracing this mys
   terious river up the stream to its source.              On   theseand similar
   considerations Mr. Park determined lo return to Sego, and,
    proceeding from thence along tie banks of the river, trust
    for his support to the hospitality of the negroes in the south
    ern dates, out of the reach of Moorish fanaticism and malice.
       The town of Silla, from which Mr. Park                  began his return
    homewards,        is within two short days journey of Jann6,
    which is situated on an island in the river.                 At  the distance
    of two   days more the river empties itself into a considerable
    lake, called Dibbie or the Dark Lake j concerning the extent

 t4©             Mr. Park's     Journey iiifo Africa*
of which, all    the information    which could      be obtained was^
that in crossing over it from west to east the canoes lose
fight of land one whole day. From this lake the water issues
in many streams, which terminate in two large branches.
One of these flows towards the north-east> and the other to
the cast; but they      join again at Kabra, one day's journey
to the southward of Tombuctooj and the port or shipping-
place of that city.     The tract of land which the two streams
encircle is called Jinbala, and is inhabited by negroes ; and
the whole distance by land from Jenue to Tombuctoo is
twelve days journey.         From Kabra, at the distance of ele
ven days journey down the stream, the river panes to the
southward of Houssa, which           is two days journey         distant
from the river.     Of    the further progress   of this   great river,
and its final exit, whether it be the fame that         passes  by Kas-
fina*,    or whether,      as ancient charts seem      to indicate,    it
spreads   into  one   or more inland     lakes, or at an       immense
distance intermixes      with the waters of the       Nile,   are ques
tions which future discovery can alone resolve.
    On  the third day    of August Mr. Park left Silla, intend
ing to   return through Scgo in his way back to Gambia j
and at Modibao        he had the good       fortune to recover       his
horse,   which he found somewhat            improved in condition.
Here    he learnt that Mansong,      having been persuaded by the
Moors that our traveller         had come into his       country with
some mischievous intention,         had given orders to apprehend
 him.     He  therefore   thought it prudent to avoid       >Sego  alto
 gether} which he accordingly did, by taking a circuitous
 route until he had got considerably       to the welt ; when turn
 ing towards    the Niger,    he passed through many towns and
 villages on its b.'.nks ; the largest of which, called Sammee,
 he left on the 14th of August, and lodged that night at

                   Mr. Part's       Journey into Africa.                       341
he   passed   through Yamina, and on the 20th reached                     Kooli-
korro,    a great   salt-market.        On    the   following     clay   he pro
ceeded to Marraboo, and in two days more arrived                        at Bam-
makoo, the froniier          of the kingdom of Bambara.
    During the      course     of this peregiination through            the  king
of Bambara's dominions, our traveller                 had to encounter the
tropical     rains in all their violence       ;  and he      was   principally
indebted for his daily           support to the dootv or         chief man in
the several towns           through which        he palled.       This officer
seems to possess in some respects the               authority of "mayor in
the corporate towns of England; and                      it reflects great ho
nour on the police of the African kingdoms,                      or on the be
nevolent manners of the .natives, that it is                   considered      one
part of the dooty's obligation            to provide food for the neces
sitous traveller     :  Tojuffer     the king' s Jlranger to depart hun
gry,    such is the phrase used, is an offence             of   a very heinous
 nature.      On many        occasions   Mr. Park       offered payment, for
 what he received,          out of the kawries that ('till remained of
 the king's       present,     and   his offer was sometimes           accepted,
 and sometimes         refused.     On others      he remunerated        his   holl
in   a singular manner,         the particulars     of which     deserve to he
 recited.      Among       the  various impostures          practised     by    the
 Moors towards           the poor negroes,       they frequently sell them
 scraps   of  paper with an       Arabic inscription (commonly             a pas
 sage from      the   Koran), which        are called s.isbns or charms.
 With      one   of these about his person,          the possessor considers
 himself invulnerable,           aud neither the lurking serpent n:ir
 the prowling leopard is any longer the object                   of his    dread.
 In   the circumstances to which          Mr. Park       was reduced, be had
 the good fortune to discover that              the negro natives ascribed
 to him the power of granting               saphies      of  even more        than
  Arabian virtue.            " Isa   Moor's     sa;»hie   is good,"     said    the
  dooty   of Sansanding,        "a  white man's must b.' better;" and
  Mr. Park,     at his request, gave        him one       possessed   of all     the
  virtues    be could       concentrate,     for it contained the Lord's
  Prayer.      The     pen with which it was written was made                  of  a
     Vol. I.                             R                                   reed :

Teed ; a little charcoal and                gum-water made                  very tolerabse
ink,       and a thin      board answered             the purpose       of    paper.          la
his journey         westward       this merchandise turned to extraordi
nary good account            ; and      it is surely needless for                  Mr. Park
to frame any apology for having availed himself of such a
resource in his situation.
      At Bammakoo          the   Niger      ceases    to be navigable.               It   takes
its    rifts at a small    village called Sankari in the high lands of
Jallonkondoo, about              six days       journey S.     W. from Bamma
koo     ; and the    country becoming mountainous, our traveller
 on the 22d took the path                for Sibidoolon, where he arrived
at the end of two days.                On    the 30th he came to               Wonda,            a
'fine village regularly built and surrounded by                         a    wall.        Here
 })c   was confined        several days          by   sickness; and having no
thing      else to offer    to the friendlv           negro, in whose              house he
was accommodated,                Mr.   Bark presented         him,     at   parting, with
'bis horse, now indeed become unable to proceed any further.
On     the 8th of September he set out on foot for Kinneveto,
a   considerable      town, which he reached on the                         nth,     and      in
three days more arrived                at    Kamalia.         At this          place       Mr.
Bark, worn down by fatigue and the vicissitudes of the wea
ther, having sometimes been plunged up to the neck in                                       ri
vers and swamps,           and sometimes              lost in woods          and     deserts,
without shelter, clothing, or food, fell into                      a   severe      and dan-
gerous fit    of   sickness,     in   which the remembrance of                    past    suf
fering, and the hopes of future enjoyment, had nearly been
extinguished together.  On his arrival at Kamalia he had
still space of 500 miles to traverse before he could reach
       a
any friendly country on the Gambia; and                            being informed
that great part of the way lay through   desert, which         a                              it
was impossible he could cross singly and unsupported, he
had no other resource but to wait for the first caravan of
slaves that might           travel      the fame track.            Such       a    one was
expected      to pass through Kamalia at theend                    of thres months,
and the      chief director of         it   resided in that        place.          To him,
therefore,      Mr. Bark         applied    ;   and for the value           of one        slave,
                                                                                              to

                    Mr. Part's     Journey into Africa.                    n$
 to be paid on his      safe  arrival at the Gambia,             this worthy
 negro,      whose name was Karfa Taura,              not only undertook
  to conduct him safe to Pifunia, but offered              him likewise the
 accommodation os his house until the time of the caravan's
 departure.      Under this man's roof our traveller was con
 fined to a mat, which was his only bed, by a severe and dan
 gerous fever for upwards        of   a  month.       Five months longer
 lie  was detained for the caravan.            During this long interval
 not   a   murmur escaped the        lips of Karfa, or of any of his
 wives, at the trouble and expense which their inmate brought
 upon them.        To  the kind attentions,        the lender solicitude,
 the cheerful assiduity,      and    warm hospitality of           these  poor
 Pagans,      Mr. Park   declares    he is indebted        not only for his
safe  return to Great Britain, but also for the preservation
of his life   ; and  he admits that he made his friend Karfa but
an inadequate      return, though the best in his power, by pre
senting him, on their arrival at Gambia, with double the sum
that he had originally       promised.
    The whole of Mr. Park's route, both in going and re
turning, having been confined lo a tract of country bounded
nearly by the 12th and 15th parallels of latitude, it must be
imagined that he sound the climate in all places exceedingly
hot.       On  the borders   of  the desert,     where the fierceness of
the   tropical fun is reflected        from the sands,         the   heat was
scarcely     supportable.     Having been robbed of his thermo
meter, he had no means             of forming       a   comparative judg
ment     ;  but he well remembers that in the dry season, when
the wind blows from the           east and     north-east across the de
sert, the ground became         so  hot in the middle of the day as
not to be borne by the naked foot.             In the camp at Ucnowm
even the ner.ro flares, accullomcd as they were to this tem
perature,     could not walk from one lent to ."mother without
their sandals. At this lime of the day the Moors lie stretched
al length in their tents, either         asleep or unw     illing   to move ;
and Mr. Park declares, that,            as he lay    listlessly along after
their manner in his hut of reeds, he could not hold his hand
                                    It   2                             against

against the current          of air which       came through the crevices,
without suffering very sensible pain from its scorching effect.
In the southern districts, which abound with wood and wa
ter, the climate improves            ;    and in the mornings and even
ings the air is serene, temperate                and pleasant.         During the
rainy       season   the    prevailing wind is from the south-west.
The monsoon commonly changes about the latter end of
June, and the wind continues to blow from the south-west
quarter until the middle or end of October.                        In this inter
val the country is flooded, and the rains are preceded                            and
followed        by   dreadful tornadoes           or typhons.          The com
mencement of this monsoon is the spring or seed-time, and
its termination is commonly the season                     of harvest.
   Among         the principal productions            of the   negro     territories
is the lotus.        It  is rather a thorny          (hrub than       a tree,      and
abounds in all the countries which                  Mr. Park      traversed     ;  but
it thrives      best in a sandy     foil.     Its fruit is a small yellow fa
rinaceous berry, about the size                  of   an olive,    which       being
pounded in         a wooden     vessel,   and afterwards dried          in the fun,
is made        into excellent cakes resembling in colour and                       fla
vour the sweetest gingerbread.                   Some of the natives              pre
pare from it also a liquor deliciously sweet.
   Os      one species     of their corn       the negroes      make excellent
beer,      by mailing the feeds nearly              in   the  fame     manner as
barley is malted          in England       ; and     the beer which          is thus
made was to          Mr. Park's        taste equal      to the best strong beer
he had ever drank in his native country.
    In    the latter end     of April     1797 the coffie or caravan being
at length completed, and our traveller's health re-established,
he    set   out from Kamalia in company with seventy persons,
of whom only thirty-seven               were staves for sale.        In nine days
they came to Maana, bordering on a branch                        of the Senegal.
In     ten days more they reached              the small     but fertile state of
Dcntilla,        and   crossed in their journey some             of    the streams
 that contribute to the great river              of Gambia.           On the 4th
us   June     they fell in with that river, about two days journey
                                                                               above

above the falls       of Baraconda,       to which place it is navigable
for canoes from its mouth               ; and    in fix days more, on the
loth of June, Mr. Park,             to his infinite satisfaction,         having
undergone in his journey, from the heat of the weather,
from fatigue, and from hunger, more than he could find
words to describe,            entered the hospitable mansion             of Dr.
Laidley, from which he had set out eighteen months before.
    On the 15th of the fame month he embarked in a slave
ship    bound      to  America;         which being driven by           stress  of
weather to Antigua, Mr. Park took his                    passage  from thence
in    a vessel   bound       to Great      Britain   ; and    on the 25th of
December        last arrived     safely in   London.

                        MEASURES           OP    LENGTH.
CENTIMETRE.                     The      hundreth       part   of   the    metre.
This    is rather a subdivision than a particular measure*.
    Decimetre.        Tenth part of the metre.              The double       deci
 metre makes a very convenient measure for the pocket.
    Metre.          The    standard      of  the measures      of  the republic
being the ten-millionth            part of  a   quarter of the meridian, or
the length of abo-it 3 sect n/.,^ lines ; it may serve for
measuring cloth, stuss?, &c. It makes about the ordinary
height of     a walking-stick,        which any person may          ca>ry   iu the
hand.        The dcniinietre        and the double metre may be useful
for different kinds of measurement.
    Decametre.         Ten times the length os the metre.                  About
thirty     feet ten    inches.      Proper to form a chain            for land-
surveying.
   
      The millimetre, or     the thouaandtb    \tart <>stV metre, might be her*

246              French Weights and Measures.
    Hctlometre.       Length of       a hundred metres.        Will   not be
used.
    Kilometre.       Equal to     a thousand      metres,    or about 580
toises.     Four will make about          a common league.
    ISlyriametre.       Its value is ten thousand metres, or about
 15800 toises,    which is      a  little more than one stage.          The
kilometre and the myriametre will be convenient to express
dillances in itineraries, and to regulate boundaries in order
lo measure the highway*.
                      MEASURES           OF CAPACITY.
     Centilitre.     There is no need for       a smaller measure of this
 kind.      It may     be considered      as equal to a      small glass   for
 spirits and liquors.         The double of it would        serve  extremely
 well for the same purpose.
     Decilitre.     This    is almost equivalent to acommon goblet.
 The     use  of it may      be readily conceived.         Its half and     its
 double are analogous to other measures now employed for
 liquids.
     Litre.        Its content     is equal    to  a  cubic decimetre.       It
  differs very little from the litron,          and the Paris pint ; and
  may be employed          in the fame manner, either for liquids or
  dry    substances.       Its half and its double will be also very
  useful.
      Decalitre.     It may     be substituted,     as  well  as  the double
  decalitre, for measuring corn and all sorts of grain.
      The demi-decalitre may supply the place of the
                                                                       fueiia
   (peck).
      Hectolitre will serve for various dry substances, such as
  grain, salt, plaster, lime, coals, &c. The content of this
  measure      might     be given to       casks   for wine.      The dtmi-
  beclolitre   will  be also exceedingly useful, and particularly for
  grain.
      Kilolitre.     Equal     in content to       a   cubic   metre.    It   is
  equivalent     almost      to the ton     used in sliipping,      which     is
                                                                           not

                          French Weights and Measures.                                                 247
not        so much an instrument                     of   measurement                     as a mode        of
valuation.
     The myrialitre is          superfluous           *.
                                        WEIGHTS.
     The milligramme would weigh                            a   little        less    than      -5V   of   a
grain,        consequently         would give much more exactness than
the 32ds which have been used hitherto                                   ;   but     as   this measure
is employed only in very nice operations, which do not occur
in    the common usages             of commerce, weights may                                    be con
fined to the following              :
      Centigramme.            The hundredth                      part of a gramme, or
about       j of a   grain.
      Decigramme weighs                 a   little    less      than two grains.                       The
demi-decigramme is almost equal then to the common grain.
  GitAMME. Equivalent to the weight of a cuhic centi

    V. Account of Dr. Perkins's              Discovery     of the Influence of
       Metallic Traitors,       in removing many          of the Diseases of
       the Human Body.
     JL HIS     discovery    has made some noise in           America, and,
   like every novelty, has its advocates and its           opponents. The
   son of the inventor, now in          London,      has published a small
   work on the subject, to introduce it to the notice of medical
   men in this country, from which we extract the following
   particulars   ;
       Galvani,    the  celebrated      professor at    Bologna,     was  the
  first who     announced some          curious phenomena, observed
  from an accidental application of metallic substances to the
  nerves and muscles        of animals. The subject immediately
  engaged the       attention    of philosophers throughout Europe,
  and the public, in consequence,             were soon favoured with a
  confirmation       of Galvani's     assertions, by the publication       of
  the experiments of Valli, Volta, Fowler,                Monro, Cavallo,
  &c.     The    result  of   these    various researches       proved   that
  "   the influence is not peculiar to a few animals only,                but
 seems to be a property         of all."    Although      the living animal
 is most susceptible      of the influence,     yet, from a combination
 of different metals,        the    nerves and     muscular fibres, long
  after every appearance        of vitality   was removed,        have been
 excited to powerful       action.
      From   the discovery     of a new   law*, acting       so important   a
 part in the animal conomy, it might rationally be expected
 that attempts would be made to ascertain how far this prin
 ciple could be applied in        a remedial     point of view to human
 diseases.     This    has   been the particular        inquiry of Doctor
 Perkins.
    The   term   animal   electricity,       which arose from the many
analogies   that   were  observed    between   the influence di^ravered   by
(Galvani and electricity, hai by later writers given place to   galvanism,
a compliment well merited by the ingenious        discoverer.
                                                                     Several

                  Influence   of Metallic TraSors.                      25   1
    Several phenomena relating to the influence os metals in
cafes  of pains,   he had observed before the news          of Galvani's
discovery had reached America          ; and    when the physiologists
of Europe     were engaged in experimenting on the                denuded
nerves and     muscles   of  the  smaller animals, with         a view      to
ascertain   the agency    of this incomprehensible property in
them,   Dr.   Perkins was prosecuting        a series of experiments,
which confided in applying externally, to parts affected with
disease, metals,    and compounds of metals,          of  every descrip
tion, which occurred to him, and constructed                into various
form3     and   sizes.    The reiult     proved,     that   on drawing
lightly over the parts affected certain instruments, termed
TKACTORS, which he formed from metallic substances into
pointed shapes, he could remove most of those topical dis
 eases of the human body, where an extra degree of nerv
 ous energy or vital      heat   was  present; unless        such    disease
was situated in some of the internal viscera, too remote from
 the part where the instruments could be applied.                 The dis
 eases  which have been found        moll     susceptible  of  the    influ
ence    of the tractors, are rheumatism, some gnutv affections,
 pleurisy, ophthalmias, erysipelas,       violent spasmodic convul
 sions, as epileptic sits and the locked    jaw,   the painand swelling
 attending contusions, inflammatory tumors, the pains from
 a recent sprain, the painful effects      of a burn or      scald,    pains
 in  the head, teeth, and indeed most kinds           of painful topical
 affections, excepting where the organic structure of the part
 is destroyed, as in wounds, ulcers, &c. and excepting also
 where oils or some other non-conducting                 substances       are
 present.
    This practice, like all    considerable    innovations, on its       first,
introduction,      encountered the      severest   scepticism    and ridi
 cule, and a medical society         pronounced it a revival of the
 exploded practice     of  animal magnetism : but the president
 and many of the members of that society afierwards
                                                                    applied
 the tractors to practice, and have since
                                                  published the success
 of their numerous experiments.
                                                                           At

2ga                  Influence as "Metallic Trailers,
    As   most phenomena are learned from observation                  long be
fore we arrive at the theory which                 connects and       explain*
them,     so with this metallic influence, no clear and satisfac
tory explanation of the modus operandi has yet appeared.
    Notwithstanding          the assiduity with which physiologist*
have pursued their inquiry,             and are still pursuing*,         to dis
cover the laws and properties of Galvanism, and to ascertain;
the extent of its action in the animal               conomy;         yet, like
many other phenomena, they still remain mysteries.
    Mr. Mcigs, profeflbrof natural philosophy               at Newhaven,      in
» letter on    Dr. Perkins's     discovery,    conceives     the prinoiples    of
metallic irritability      so little understood,      that he will not pre
tend to explain how the tractors produce their effects;                     but
seems satisfied in finding that the effects are produced.                 After
stating an experiment on his own child, eight years                     of age,
very    dangerously     ill with    a  peripneumonic         complaint,     and
to   which     the tractors gave almost instantaneous relief, he
fays,     "I   have    used the      tractors with success in several
other cafes in my own family ; and although, like Naamaa
the Syrian,      I  cannot tell why the waters of Jordan should'
be better than Abana and Pharpar, rivers                of Damascus; yet,
since experience has proved          them    so, no reasoning can charge
the opinion.        Indeed,     the causes      of all common        facts are,
we think, perfectly well known to us; and it is very probable,
fifty or an hundred years hence, we (hall               as  well known why

M. Crevc,    professor  of medicine at Mentz,     has lately  published an im
portant tract on Metallic Irritability.      He maintains,     from a  varietyof
experiments    made on the deail bod ies of men and animals, that even tb«

the metallic tractors should in a few minutes remove violent
pains, as we now know why cantharides and opium will

about either, excepting          fails."
     Mr. Woodward,         professor   of natural philosophy         at Dart
 mouth, in      a  letter also on the same          subject, has      stated  a
 number of successful experiments in pains of the head, face,
 teeth, and in one cafe        of a  sprain.
     Dr. Vaughan,         a member       of  the    Philadelphia      medical
 society, has lately published an ingenious tract on Galvanism,
 the object of which        is to account for the         influence     of  tbe
 tractors in removing diseases.            After  a citation    of numerous
 experiments made on the nerves and muscles                  of animals, he
 observes,    " If we   only take an impartial         view    of  the opera
 tions of nature herself, and attend diligently to the analytical
 investigations    of the aforementioned experimentalists               on this
 sublime subject,     T think the sceptic      must admit that the prin
  ciple of nervous energy is        a  modification     of electricity.      As
  sensation is dependent       on this energy,     a pleasurable sensation,
  or what may be termed a natural or healthy degree thereof,
  then certainly pain or supersensation can only depend on
  an accumulation        of  the electric fluid,      or extra degree         of
  energy in the part affected.            On this principle       the problem
  admits of easy solution ; namely, that the metals, being sus
  ceptible of this fluid, conduct the extra degree of energy to
  parts where it is diminished, or out           of the system altogether,
   restoring the native law of electric equilibrium."
      Drs. Tilton, Baker, Hall, Lord, Brewster, Dalho, Dyer,
   Johnson, Backus, Lee, Willard, Marvin and Gosg, of Ame
   rica, have publislied their approbations of the             use  of metallic
   tractors ;  which arc in fact only pieces of pointed iron or
   brass,  &c.     How far      the attempt     of  the  author to explain
   their action upon the principles          of Galvanism       has been suc
   cessful, we    will not    take upon us to determine.              We    shall

mon/lfated, it will not be therefore rejected                         ;    for in that case
it would only      be a proof that the empiricism                         of    the practises*
of magnetism,        by introducing absurd glare, {how and mystery,

was founded.           We       are led to make this remark by an                                ob

the operation precisely in the same manner                                 as before,            the
pain or inflammation would be removed directly."  A note in
troduced    here by the author,   to prove by this fact the
analogy between the influence of the tractors and Galvanism,
docs not appear, to us, to be in point.                         "On        the application
of zinc     and silver to the tongue, the sensation                         of    taste is very
slight to some, while with others                        it is very strong             :    when
the experiment is applied to the fense of sight, some                                            are
hardly      sensible    of      it,     while others observe              a     strong flash."
Here, however, the cause of the different effects produced
must be sought for in the modification, or peculiar structure,
of the organs of sensation                in   the patient       not in         the operator.
   We mean not         this    by             observation       to    detract        from the
merit of the discovery              :    that must rest, independent                        of all
theory, on the degree of evidence                             that may be brought
forward to support it.                  If the    facts fliall be sufficiently con
clusive   to establish         the efficacy        of the tractors,  removing   in
only   one species     usdisease, the             inventor has nothing to star
from the opposition of the faculty                       in   England      :   the gentle
men who compose that body are too liberal to oppose any
beneficial      innovation,              merely because              it   conies from             a
foreigner.      On     the other hand,             if    the cures reported to have
                             America cannot be effected here                                by

 VI. An     Analysis   of tbe Waters       of two Mineral Springs at
    Lemington Priors, near Warwick ; including Experiments
   Uniting to elucidate the Origin of tbe MurLtic Acid. By
    William         Lambb, M. A.         late Fellow of St. John's Col
    lege, Cambridge.       From tbe Memoirs of the Literary and
    Philosophical Society of Manchester, Vol. V. Part               I.
  J. HE     author of this ingenious paper has shown himself a
 master   in  the art of  analysis.    The   apparent     discovery  of the
 origin of the muriatic acid, to which             Mr. Lambe's labours
 have led, is    so  well worthy of the      attention of philosophers,
 as it.may lead lo a discovery           of  the composition       of other
 acids whose bases arc at present unknown, that we have not
 a doubt but the path he has laid open will be explored by
 all the ab!e chemists of Europe.
     After    some very     pertinent introductory           remarks,   the
 author observes, that     as  both the springs rife many feet below
 the earth, it seems needless to enter into any particulars
 concerning the nature of the surface,              or the qualities of the
 foil of the circumjacent district, and therefore proceeds to
 the objects    of his inquiry   a»  follows   :
            ON   THE WATER OF THE NEW BATHS.
    The spring     was discovered     in  the year 1790,      at the depth
 of 42   feet from the surface      of   the ground.       A   well is funk
 about 24 sect deep.          In  the course     of this  depth   there is a
 rock the thickness of         8  or 10 sect     ;   afterwards    a bed  of
 marl ; after penetrating which, another rock, much harder
 than the former, is found.         Through this        second rock a bore
 is made     18  feel deep,    where there        is a small   cleft in the
 rock.     There are many little springs found in this course               .
                                                                         but

 t£j6                      An Analysis of two Mineral Springs
 but from this cleft the water rises with violence to the level
 of 4      feet above the surface                      of    the ground ; and                 it   affords a
 constant         and copious supply of fresh water.
                           J.   ON     THE GASEOUS FLUIDS.
      The water, when                          fresh   drawn,           smells      of sulphurated
 hydrogen, or hepatic                      »
                                               gas ; but       it quickly         becomes           inodor
 ous by exposure                     to the atmosphere.                      I   have     obtained no
 more than 4 cubic inches of gaseous fluid from a wine-
 gallon of the water. Of these, hardly half a cubic inch is
 abf'orded by the water;                        and,    i. Nitric       acid dropped               into   thit>
solution causes a minute precipitate of sulphur; hence some
hepatic gas has been expelled by the boiling, a. I put some
of the water, which had not been boiled, into a bottle, leav
ing    a part  the botile empty : I then filled the bottle en
                   of
tirely with lime-water,  and stopped it. A white precipitate
fell, which, with the addition of distilled vinegar, effervesced
sensibly,                  The half cubic inch is, therefore,
                 but not strongly.
mostly carbonic acid. 3. Into the portion of the air which
was not absorbed by water, I plunged a lighted candle ; it
was instantly extinguished.   This portion         therefore,                           is,
azotic gas.
                II.   THE SPONTANEOUS PRECIPITATE.
   A    sediment            falls to the bottom, and adheres to the fides
of the bath.               It   is   of yellow colour,

brightness            by   exposure to the atmosphere.                            A     similar sedi
ment may be separated                          by   boiling the fresh water.                       From     a
gallon of water, .75 of   grain     procured. This dissolves

appearances            of   oxyd       of iron.        It     must have been united vvith
the carbonic acid, which has been already detected.                                                 (1, 2.)

                                       PRECIPITANT*.
    1. Aster the spontaneous                precipitate has been separated,
a little oxygenated                 muriate of mercury was dissolved In a'
glass full     of   the water.                        A   white matter separated during
the solution, and, in some hours, collected                                    in       considerable
quantity.
    2.   A   piece    of       sulphate               of argil! was     dropped         into    a   jar   of
the fame water             ;       presently              a stratum     of white matter               was
formed at the bottom of the                               jar: but this   appearance is tran
sitory ; for in the course                        of   an hour or two the precipitate is
redissolved,        and the water resumes                           its transparency.                This
is an appearance               which              I   had not found noticed by writers
on the subject, though                        I   have reason to         think it not uncom
mon.         The     waters            of Astrop, near Banbury,                     contain car-
bonat of lime dissolved by the carbonic acid                                        :    and, when
the carbonat has been separated,                                by boiling the water, the
same     appearance                is produced by sulphate                      of argill.                Its
origin, and that of the decomposition of                                   the mercural fair,'
will be shown in the sequel.
                     If.        THE METALLIC SALTS.
    Several        phenomena demonstrate                              the existence            of    some
metallic substance in                     this            water,    besides    the       precipitate1
already described              (n.)       :       but it is    so   peculiarly combined, or
otherwise modified,                     as to elude, in a great                   measure,             the
action of      the ordinary reagents.                           When the water                 is boiled
in contact with some                    of the metals, it               becomes turbid ; and
the metal is partly oxydated, and partly dissolved.                                        The iron,
which        has    been used in the construction                             of the baths,                i*
almost destroyed               :    the       tin, which lined             a vessel used             as a
warm bath for children, has suffered in like manner.                                                Is the

vessel, similar effects are produced ; a precipitate is formed,
and some copper is dissolved in the water,                                    i. This        is readily
proved       by putting           a     bright piece of iron into the liquor,
which,       in a few hours, acquires                  a coppery coating*.                           Lead
also    I   have found to be acted upon.
   I examined,                with some minuteness, the precipitates formed
by iron and by copper,                       a. The first is of               a   yellow colour ;
and, though it is not magnetic, it may be made                                              so    by the
flame       of   a blow-pipe            upon charcoal.                 It   consists, therefore,
of oxyde of iron, either totally or in part                                 ; but whether it is
derived from the liquor, or from the iron which was                                               used to
procure          it,
             cannot be determined      this experiment.     by
                                                          But
the following observation demonstrates, that iron   contained                          is
in the water itself.  3. The water was boiled in                                              a   copper
vessel, and the precipitate formed was collected.                                                 This       is
also    of   a   yellow colour         j    and, exposed to the flame                       of   a   blow-
pipe on charcoal                  (like the former               precipitate),              it   became
magnetic.          It    seems also to contain copper; for, precipitating
its solution in muriatic acid                   by    ammoniac, the liquor became
blue    ;    the colour however was                   by    no means strong.
   When           the salts       of    the water have been concentrated                                     by
                                                                                                     it in
evaporation, copper                    is   acted upon more powerfully                           ;           so
much that          if    a     silver spoon be used for the evaporation                                      is
much tarnished, and the salts acquire                                 a   cupreous          taste and        a
yellow tinge, though they are colourless                                    if    the evaporation
be made           in   glass.      These vestiges           of       the copper must be at
tributed to the alloy of the spoon.
   The       appearances         I      have described               surprised      me the more,
as, from the use                 of       of the common reagents,

 there is    a  precipitate likewise, but of a dull lemon colour y
 after a   partial evaporation the colour approaches to white
 ness.     In   each   of  the two last cafes, the liquor gradually ac
 quires    a deep    yellow tinge.           In  these   experiments, we have

      V.  MANGANESE IS DISSOLVED                         IN THIS WATER.
     As zink     is known to have a stronger affiuity to acids than
the other metals have,              I hoped     by its mean to obtain some
 information on the cause of the facts                 I  have described,              r.   I
 boiled,    therefore, some of the water in                   a  glazed      vessel,      irt
 6ontact    with some pieces of zink :                  a small      precipitate was
 formed, but enough to be collected                       for examination with
 the blow-pipe.          This     was fused with        bom        ;   and a globule
 was formed of           a  rich red colour, precisely that communi
cated by manganese*.                  Continuing the fusion, the colour
 vanished;        nor could        I   make it reappear             by the         yellow
 flame of the blast           :  probably because           the      manganese         was
 mixed with another metal.                   The globule        was removed            to a
 silver   spoon ;      and, then, by fusion, it regained                       the      red
colour.      To    avoid the possibility        of error,    a  little manganese,
 fused with borax in the same manner, was placed beside the
 red globule;        and     no difference could be observed                      in the
 colour of the two globules, except                    a  flight      variety      in the

tincture of galls                 (iv. 5.),           yields the fame result.                          By vfing
a large quantity of                        the        water,        I       collected sufficient for
examination.   This                        I   put over      a fire          on an iron plate:                      the
vegetable          part took                   sire    and         burnt          away   :       the powder
became of an ochry yellow, and was magnetic                                                  :    fused with
borax         by   the        blow-pipe,               it acquired the                    redness           which
manganese          imparts.
     3. The fame fact may be proved                                         by    a single        experiment.
It     is known              that tartrite of pot-ash decomposes                                           falls of
manganese          by        a   double affinity               ;    in consequence                 of which,
tartrite of manganese, which                             is a substance insoluble in water,
precipitates*.   I poured, therefore, a solution                                                 of tartrite of
pot-ash into                 water,            and     there        sell      a    copious crystalline-
precipitate.             Much iron fell down with                                  the manganese,                    as
might be expected                       from the affinity                    between             the oxydes of
these         metals     :       for, by fusing the                         precipitate with                    nitre,
green spots were formed on the sides                                         of   the crucible.
     Tartrite of pot-ash                       decomposes               likewise      salts       of lime,           as
is well known ; but the tartrite of lime is precipitated in tho
form of a white powder, which                                       is not sensibly crystalline.
But as there is                   a    great          abundance of lime in tliis water
(xiy.), it             seems probable                    that it had                  entered          into         the
composition of these crystals.
     Manganese has been but rarely noticed                                             as        entering into
the composition                  of mineral             waters.             The    reason, perhaps,                  is,
that    it    has been seldom looked for, rather than that                                             it   seldom,
exists   ;     since
                       it
                       is             now known to be                    a    substance            abundantly
diffused through the earth.                              The        waters         of Allrop, which                   1

                                  a
of lime has been thrown  down       boiling.  This water, in.      by
these circumstances, hardly affects either tincture                                                 of galls or

   As   I    shall have frequent occasion         to mention     this mix
ture  of  oxydes     of  manganese    and iron,      I will enumerate    the
tests I have    used, to avoid useless repetitions,          These are, i«
The magnet        :   to this the smallest     particle   of iron may     be
rendered      obedient, by exposing it to a due heat, on char
coal, by the blow-pipe.            a. The tinge communicated by
the process to a globule of borax : this from iron is green or
yellow   ;   from manganese it is hyacinthine ; or, when tho
globule is more loaded with tbe metal, a sine rich red. This
colour disappears by the blue conical flame ; and may be
reproduced by the gentler yellow flame which surrounds
the cone.       3. Fusion with nitre, or with carbonate of soda :
manganese imparts to them a sine blue colour ; but if it be
mixed with the oxyde of iron the colour is green.
Til.    AN HYPOTHESIS              TO EXPLAIN THE CAUSE OF
                           THE PHENOMENA.
   The    first hypothesis     which    I   framed, to account for the
facts in question, was deduced             from the well known          pro
perty which manganese possesses            of oxygenating     the muriatic
acid.     My     reasoning     was   as follows    :  Since, during the
solution of the black oxyde of manganese                  in the  muiiatic
acid, a portion of the acid becomes oxygenated, it must fol
low that,      if this portion mould meet and combine with a
metallic     oxyde, the salt formed by such an union must be
superoxygenated.           But in the   state  of oxydation, doubtless,
is  a great part      of the iron   which is    so   abundantly dissufsed
through the earth.          Are then      the  appearances     in question
the result     of   these circumstances?        In short,    are the salts'
muriat of manganese and oxygenated muriat of iron r In

and however much it was diluted, the manganese                  was in
stantly detected by prufliat     of pot-ash.   I  was therefore forced
to conclude that,     if oxygenated muriat of iron      is really an in
gredient of this water, it must be formed by a process dif
ferent from that which I had imagined.
 VIII.     THB APPEARANCES             IN QUESTION ARE PRO
     DUCED BT THB ACTION OF HEPATIC GAS ON IRON
     AND MANGANESE.
     An  observation    of Bergman, though in part erroneous,
 bas  conducted me, as I think, to the true cause of these ap
pearances ;     and   I  am greatly mistaken      if its consequences,
when fully pursued,         are not of considerable importance to
 chemical science.       Bergman has    asserted  that hepatised water
in which iron filings      have been kept for some days, in a       well-
 closed vessel, grows purple with tincture        of galls  : if the  iron
 be dissolved by an acid, the colour approaches          more lo violet.
 He moreover      adds, that the solution    of iron in   hepatised \va-
 ter is not at all rendered turbid byfnifjiat ofpotajb (Bergman's
 Ejsays, Dissertation v 1 1 . 4. L.) This latter fact promised to
 throw some light on the subject of my inquiry, particularly
 when it was joined to the fact        of  the hepatic smell,      which
 the water has when recently drawn (1). I was the more
 strongly induced to pay attention to this combination, from
 the contradiction of another very eminent               chemist.     Mr.
  Kirwan    has denied that hepatic gas can dissolve        iron, or any
  other metal (Pbilo/opb. Tran/ac. 1786). To ascertain tjiia
 point, I have made numerous experiments with the greatest
 caution and accuracy that I have been able to apply.                 The
 liepaiic gas which      I have used, was obtained from uilphuret
 of iron, formed     by fusing equal parts     of iron and flowers of
  sulphur   ; and (except    in some instances,     which will    be par
  ticularly noticed as they occur) was extricated by diluted
  sulphuric acid. The gas was collected under water; which
  method was preferred, to purify it       if possible from   extraneous
                                    S 4                               acid.

a    little gas which has escaped the action of the iron, flies

used to extricate the hepatic gas.                          We may further conclude,
that though the              remark of Bergman on the                  effect of the
prufiiat of pot-afli is true               ;   the remark which accompanies                            it
(en the colour produced by infusion of galls) is erroneous.
A purple colour is always, I believe, occasioned by extra
neous acid       ;    in which cafe the prusliat                    of potash      is also pre
cipitated.           From      the    fame          facts    we are enabled               to detect
another error also, into which the fame great man has been
betrayed.            In his    analysis        of   the acidulous waters              of Medvi,
in Ostro-Gothland              {Bergman's EJsays,                  Diffirloiionviii.6.),
he has noticed                 4A grains of iron, dissolved
                             a residuum         of
partly by hepatic gas, partly by carbonic acid. Now we
have seen that there is no decomposition                                of   these liquors by
boiling; nor           does any oxyde precipitate,                       how long soever
the evaporation be continued.                           The hepatic            gas seems to
be totally decomposed                 :   nitric       acid dropped into these li
quors precipitates nothing.                                                                                 «
  Are we then to conclude with                               Mr. Kirwan, that hepatic
gas does not decompose                     iron or any other metal                    ?      As the
gas itself is decomposed,                  this, in strict propriety ot language,
must     be allowed            to     be true;              but that some          solution is
effected       during the decomposition                           the   following         remarks
evince.         3. A     piece      of    clean and bright              iron was put into
some     of    the hepatised          solution         (if  I     may be allowed                  so   to
call    it,   while its true composition        unknown)     is  soon be       :   it
came      turbid     ;   a     copious ochry precipitate fell down    and                    ;
in 04     hours the whole surface                     of    the iron was covered                  with
rust.   4. Let the solution be boiled in                                a    copper       vessel,      a
precipitate also separates of an ochry colour                            ;   but   it   is   smaller
in quantity than in                   the former experiment.                       5. Digest           a

     solves, a white matter collects on the fides, and falls to the
    bottom of the glass.              9. Infusion of galls, after the fresh iron
     has been digested with the solution, precipitates the iron of
     a clr.rk colour; still the prusfiat of pot-afli does not become
    turbid.       From all these facts it is clear, that as the iron com
    bines with the sulphur of the hepatic gas,                   a peculiar substance
    is formed and dissolved in the water, which has hitherto been
    unnoticed by chemical writers,                 as far as has fallen      within my
    information.            That this     substance is contained in the waters
    of     the    spring under our present examination,                    seems fully

ffrtupeftWj os this salt and the phenomena                                  of   the water, that
the Water contains this very salt                          :   now,    I   conclude, that they
contain a matter, be it what it may, produced by the action
of hepatic         gas on iron.          But they                    are the very fame facts
which form the                   bans upon which                 each       separate        inference
is built     :    does it not then follow as a necessary consequence,
that the hepatised                  solution itself contains                 a   muriat of iron
highly      oxygenated,             and that, therefore, in this process muriatic
acid is generated?                      This conclusion                seems authorized                 by
reason, and experiment has confirmed it.                                     i. I evaporated             a
small quantity              of    the solution         (nil. i.)           in a watch glass to
dryness      :    a   bitter deliquescent               salt is left behind:                    on this
flit     a little      strong       sulphuric acid was dropped, and paper
moistened             with ammoniac                   was held over the glass ; white
vapours were immediately formed over the                                            glass   :     some
volatile acid              is,   therefore, separated                 by   the sulphuric acid.

and, as before, dropped                         a   little sulphuric acid on the re
siduum      ;     in this        cafe   a   strong effervescence was excited, very
pungent acid fumes arofc, which, from their smelt,                                                were
readily known to be muriatic.                                  The    same truth        was esta
blished beyond               a    doubt      by   holding       a    bit of paper moistened
with      simple water,             which         made the vapours visible:                      in the
form of      a    gray smoke               a   distinguishing characteristic of the
muriatic acid. (Bergman's Effajs, Differ tation II. II. b.3.)
The evaporation had been performed in copper vessel, ex                 a

a day or two the hepatic odour is destroyed, and the liquor
has properties similar to that which waa formed with the
iron tilings.      The   fame kind        of deliquescent     salt   it left by

However, this liquor resembles the solution of manganese in

 escapes in this experiment, as it does with the iron ; a black
 substance is formed; but the hepatic odour was not destroyed,
 though the hepatic gas was kept in contact with the mercury
 many weeks.         After filtrating the liquor,        I boiled it to expel
 the superfluous      hepatic gas.         A  small   portion of the liquor
 was suffered to evaporate         spontaneously      : a  crystalline matter
 was left behind of an acrid taste.                 Another portion was

estimation        of 6076       toises, in almost      a straight    line and with
very little variation in the level, was with great reason pre

two signals or observatories,               now to be seen, the one at the
end     of Lieusaint,        and the other at the entrance               of Melun,

stone was secured            in   a piece  of strong mason- work,          and from
this stone arose a cylinder of copper, fastened                     into it with      a
mass      of   lead.      The     axes   of   these cylinders,         which     were
fourteen lines            in diameter, corresponded perpendicularly
with the upper points of the signals. As the line of the base

measured,         and found to be 1790 11', which produced nn the
total length a difference             of 10! inches.        Departing from the

ration      of   measurement              on the 5th           of Floreal,    at the base         of
the signal of Melun.             The instruments constructed for thia
purpose          were     four rules of platina, each two fathoms in
length   (at a given temperature) ; six lines in breath, and
 two thirds of a line in thickness. Each rule was mounted
 on a piece of wood, sufficiently strong                             to be secure against
 all warping and bending;                          and was covered,          at the distance
 of    three, inches,              with   a flight cafe           of wood,       at the two
 extremities of which arose two points made of iron, to serve
 as marks to            direct the           sight.      On     the rule     of platina    there
 was placed another rule of copper of the fame strength, but
 somewhat          less       in length, which            served to measure            the ex
 pansion of the platina.                  It is well known           by experience, that
 the expansion of platina is to that of copper                                as 12 is    to 25.
 The two rules were                    fixed upon each other, in an invariable
 manner by their anterior extremity, in order that the effect
  of   the expansion               might be carried entirely to the other ex
  tremity.         The         rules    being plunged into melting ice,                       and
  consequently at 0° of Reaumur's thermometer (32°Fahr.¥),
  the extremity of the copper coincided on the platina at a line
  marked ; but                as soon as       they were exposed to another tem
  perature, the copper extended on the platina, on account                                         of
  the different expansion                     of    the two metals.            An ingenious
  apparatus            constructed           on this principle, afforded,              with the
  assistance       of     a   nonius and microscope fitted to                   it,   the means
  of estimating the dilatation of the platina                                to nearly 3-55,65
  of toife. This apparatus formed at the
        a                                                                    fame time    a       very
     sensible metallic thermometer, each part or degree                                of which

  each rule     of   the platina".      The four rules      were    placed at
  the end of each other, supported by iron tripods mounted on
  three screws, to make           the extremities correspond         at cqaal
  heights, and brought into a line by marks to direct the sight,
  placed successively on the wooden wedges before mentioned.
  Had each rule been       placed inimmediate contact with itsneigh-
  bour, the operator in placing one rule might have deranged
  the preceding,        and    the contact besides would never             have
  been perfect.        To  prevent this inconvenience, care was taken
  to leave    a  sufficient interval from one rule to another            ;   but
  the extremity      of  each rule was furnished         with   a small    rule,
 or flip of platina, which could be pushed into              a groove    to fill
  up the interval, and to form           a perfect   contact with the fol
 lowing rule      : a scale fitted    with a nonius, viewed through a
 microscope, measured the length             of the small rule,     to nearly
 TVJvtsv of a toise. But in thus measuring a line on ground,
 which often rises or falls insensibly, it was necessary to pay
 great attention to the differences           of the level.    For this pur
 pose the case       of   each   rule had, at equal distances from its
 extremities, two small cubes made of copper, which rose to
 equal heights        on the plane of the rules; and upon which
 where laid the two branches of a square, bearing a spirit level.
This     level being twice placed         on each rule, in the two con
 trary directions,        gave    the   mean inclination        almost     to a
minute;        so  that with a very simple        formula each       measure
was found reduced to the horizontal line, and the series of
observations       gave at the fame time the complete level             of the
 base.     In commencing           the   operation, the first rule was
 placed in such a manner that the centre              of a   plummet,       sus
pended at its anterior extremity,            should fall exactly      on     the
centre    of    the copper cylinder,        already    mentioned,       which

 The rules a,        3  and   4  were   placed    in  a   series after the
 first, and brought into a line with the sight.                  The small
 rules, or (lips, were pushed in to sill up the intervals             ;   and
 the lengths    of these flips,     as well   as  the expansion    of   each
 rule, and the observations         of the level, read by Delambre,
 were   written, as he dictated, by two assistants, who each
 held a paper divided into columns for that purpose.                    After
 this the first rule was removed and placed after the fourth1
 rule, and the fame operation was repeated, directing the
 line always by the sight-points, removed successively at the
 distance   of  every    hundred toises, and taking care at each
 change of     the rule to read the expansion, the length             of   the
 slip, and the two observations        of the level.
    This operation being          repeated   3021 times, rendered it
 consequently necessary to make 6043 observations by the
 microscope, and as many of the level. This was continued
 without interruption during the day          ;  and when     night obliged
 the operators     to suspend their labour, the following method
was employed to six the point where they left off, and which
 was to serve next morning              for the     point    of departure.
Towards the extremity of the last rule an iron stake was funk
into the ground, and         a  pretty deep hole dug around it.          The
iren stake was then removed, and its place supplied                      by a
wooden flake, on the surface of which was nailed a plate                    of
lead.    The     last  rule was placed      in   such   a manner that a
plummet,      nicely adjusted and suspended from its extremity,
should fall on this plate; the point where it touched the lead
wa* marked       as   exactly  as possible,  and the wooden stake was
defended     by a strong       covering of wood, which            was   itself
covered    with earth,       so  that carriages could         pass  over it
without causing any derangement.                Things remained in this
state till next morning, when the operations were resumed in
the like manner as that of the first day. The whole operation
lasted forty days,        three   of which only were interrupted.
The operators generally advanced eighty-eight length* of

arrived at the cylinder os copper, forming the other extremity
of    the base, under the signal       of Lieusaint     ;  the extremity   of
the last rule was found to pass the centre just 48$ lines; and
this deduction being made,            as  well  as  all the necessary cal
culations, the result was a length          of 6075,784689        toifes.
    Though       these details are sufficient to enable the reader to
judge of the        great   precision employed in this operation,
 Delambre added many other ingenious and nice precautions
which      are too long to be repeated here,           and which ensured
 to his labour the highest degree         of   exactness possible.        We
 lliall only   add, that, by the accuracy        of   the instruments and
methods employed, errors           of inches    and seconds are as little
 to be presumed        in the present     measurement,         as errors   of
toifes    and minutes were formerly.            This    great perfection is
 chiefly owing to the labours of Borda.
VIII.     Chemical Reflections on tbeEffeS produced by Mordants
     in dye'.ng Cotton red.       By J. A. Chaptal. From the
     Annales de Chiinie,        Vol.  XXFL
I   N   regard to the beautiful      red colour given to cotton by
means      of  madder,    the cafe is the fame as with certain phar
maceutic preparations, the ridiculous receipts for preparing
which      have been hitherto respected,          because apprehensions
have     been entertained that their essect would be altered by
introducing       the least change in the process.           A  month's la
bour would        scarcely be sufficient   lo terminate all      the opera
tions which have been judged               indispensably necessary for
obtaining       that beautiful colour called the Turkey or             Adri-
anople red.         Soda, oil, gall nuts, sumach, the sulphate of
alumine,       blood, the gastric liquor, madder, soap, the nilro-
niuviale of tin, are employed in succession.               The true means
of simplifying this       process is not to labour        al hazard, and to
make       trial us the different methods            practised    without a

rarely and with flow                  steps    to any happy results.                        I   am ac
quainted but with one method                             of making              progress            in the
arts, which            is,   to bring back and reduce                      all operations to
simple principles            :     by   these means we obtain fixed points                                of
departure, to which                   all results and all our labours may be
referred.         Chemistry           is   now sufficiently advanced                        to supply
us with these bases, and nothing therefore                                is   necessary but to
establish them.               In   the hands           of the   artist they             will    become
what formulae                are in the head                of the mathematician.                         I
shall therefore            attempt to give an example                          by   subjecting to
chemical principles the three chief mordants in dyeing cot
ton red  viz. oil, gall nuts, and alum.
           ;
     It   is   known that cotton does not receive the red                                      of    mad
der   in       fixed manner until                   has been properly impregnated
                                               by it
           a
with oil.         The        red applied               printing     far from possessing
                                                                     is
the fame degree of fixity,                    since    it will not stand when washed
with soda.            This preliminary preparation                        is    given to cotton
 by   forming         a   cold soapy liquor from the combination of oil
and   a    weak solution           of   soda.          The    useof this alkaline ley                     is
attended        with no other advantage                     than that of diluting and
dividing the oil, and enabling the operator to convey                                                it   to
all the parts of the cotton   an equal and easy manner.
                                               in                                                      I
have found            by   experience that pot-ash produces the fame ef
fect as soda     ;        and,   in   my opinion, this fact merits some con
sideration, as soJa, which                     is   scarce and dear              in      the     north,
may be supplied               by   pot-ash, which             is    there common.
     From this principle              it   follows, that all kinds of soda or oil
cannot be employed                 indiscriminately.                In order that the soda
may have the proper qualities,                         it   must be caustic, and con
tain little muriate.             It     must not be rendered                   caustic          by   lime,
as   it   then makes the colour brown.                              Its causticity             must be
the effect       of   its calcination.
     The carbonate of              soda,       and soda mixed with much mu
riate, combine with                   oil but       very imperfectly.                    Therefore,          1
                                                    Tj                              .   .             soda.

2J-5                   On the     TjfeB of MurJants
soda that has       been long prepared, ot           «  impure, cannot be
applied to the purposes         of dyeing in this manner;
   The choice of the oil        is equally essential as that    of the soda.
The oil, to    fee  good,      must unite very perfectly       with the ley
of  soda, and must remain in an absolute and permanent state
of combination.          The oil     fittest for   this dye is not fine  oil,
but that rather which contains              a large portion of the extrac
tive principle.       The former          docs  not preserve its state    of
combination        with the soda, and requires such a strength in
the   ley as  would be injurious to the subsequent operations.
The latter forms        a  thicker and more durable combination,
and requires     only   a   weak ley      of one or two    degrees.
   The    necessity   of producing        a perfect and intimate combi
nation of the oil and the soda will be readily perceived, by
reflecting that the ley of soda is only employed to divide,
dilute,    and convey       the   oil    in an equal manner to all the
parts of    the cotton    :   for it follows from this princrple,       that
if the oil is not well mixed, the cotton made to pass through
this    mordant     will    take the oil unequally,        and the colour,
therefore,     will   be    badly united.         Hence it happens that
the workman places            the whole secret       of  a well-united  and
strong colour in the choice of good oil and suitable soda.
It thence follows from these principles that the oil ought
to be in excess, and not in a state            of absolute saturation  ; for
in   the latter case it would abandon the stuffin             wafting, and
the colour would remain dry.
    "When the cotton has been properly impregnated with
oil, it  is subjected     to the operation         of being galled.     The
using of the gall nuts is attended with several advantages :
i. The acid which they contain decomposes the saponaceous
fiquor with whkh the cotton is impregnated, and fixes the
oil on the stuff.       2. The character of animalifation             which
the galls have,       predisposes the cotton to receive the colour
ing   matter.    3. The astringent principle unites with the oil,
and sunns with it a compound which blackens as h dries ;
                                                                      which

which is not     vary soluble in water, and which has the greatest
affinity   with the colouring principle of the madder.                   The
dyer may acquire          a  competent knowledge of this          last com
bination,     and study its properties, by mixing a decoction                of
gajt nuts with a solution of soap.
    It follows from these principles           :  I. That the  place   of  the
gail nuts cannot be supplied            by any other astringent, let the
quantity employed be what it may.                  a. That the galls ought
to he strained     as   hot   as  possible,  that  the decomposition may
be (peedy and perfect.            3. That the galled cotton ought tp
be speedily dried,        in order to prevent its assuming a black
colour, which would injure the brightness of the red intend
ed   to be given to           it.   4. That dry weather ought to be
chosen for the process of galling, because in moist weather
the astringent principle communicates a black colour,                     and
dries (lowly. 5. The cotton ought to be pressed together with
the greatest care, in order that the decomposition may be ef
fected    in an equal        manner at every point of the surface
6. That a proportion ought to be established                  between     the
gall nuts and the soap          :  if the  former predominates, the co
lour is black ;     if  the latter, the portion       of  the oil not com
bined with the astringent principle theu escapes by the warn
ings, and the colour remains poor.
   The third mordant employed in dyeing cotton red is the
sulphate of alumine (alum).                 This substance not only has
of itself  the property os heightening             the red us madder,     but
it contributes alio by its decomposition and the fixation               x>f  its
alumine to give solidity to the colour.               To judge of the ef
fects   of alum in dyeing cotton, it will be sufficient to mix a
decoction of gall nuts with a solution of alum. The mixture
becomes      immediately turbid, and there is formed               a  grayish
precipitate, which, when dried, is insoluble in water and
alkalies.
   Every thing that takes place in this experiment                 of the   la
boratory may be observed in the process of aluming in dye
ing.     Cotton, when galled and plunged in a solution of the
suMateor     acetiie   of alumine, immediately         changes   its colour,
                                          T3                              anJ

and becomes gray ; the bath presents no precipitate, because
the operation takes place in the tissue                            of the cloth itself,
where the production remains fixed.                                It is however to be
observed,         that   if   the galled           cotton be      passed      through       a   too
warm solution of alum,                    a   portion of the galls            escapes       from
the      tissue   of   the stuff,      and the decomposition                   of the alum
takes place in the bath              itself; which diminishes the propor
tion of the mordant, and impoverishes the colour.
   We       have here therefore a combination                         of   three principles
(oil,     the astringent principle,                 and alumine) which serve as a
mordant for the red dye of madder. Each of them employed
separately        produces         neither the fame fixation nor the fame
lustre    in   the colour.
   This mordant, without                  dispute, is the most complex known
in dyeing, and it presents                    to chemistry a fort          of combination
which it is of           the utmost importance                   to study.         It is from
the precision in this combination,                         and the judgment shown
by the artist himself to produce                        it,    that   a    beautiful colour
can be expected           ;    but   if   it       be possible    for him to conduct
himself through the labyrinth                        of these numerous operations,
by taking the clue of experiment as his guide,                                it   will   at any
rate be very difficult for him to simplify his progress, or                                 bring
it'to perfection.        It   is   only       by   reasoning on his operations, and
calculating the result and principle of each, that he can hope
to become master of his processes, to correct their faults,
and      to obtain       invariable products.                     Without           this,       the
practice of        the most experienced                 artist   will   afford     nothing in
his hands but the discouraging alternative of success and dis
appointment.           I      wished          therefore    in    this short analysis             of
the process for dyeing                red, which           is    the most        complicated
of all,     to give an instance                of what chemistry              can do in         the
arts when its principles are properly applied.                             I     will venture
to assert,        that the most uninformed workman will here find
the principle          of his art and           the rule      of his conduct.

It appears, therefore, th.it we are not yet arrived at its ut
most boundaries ; and, that when mankind                     shall dig more
frequently, and to      a greater depth         in the earth, many bo
dies   will be discovered,      of which     at present we have no idea.

useful discoveries    from bodies that at present excite only idle
curiosity.
    In  the year 1789     M. Macquart,           a  physician at Paris, to
gether with      myself, analyzed the red lead of Siberia, and
announced that this mineral was an intimate combination
 of  the super-oxygenated oxyde            of  lead    and the iron    ofalu-
 mine.      Since that epoch Bindhcim also said, that he had
 found in it copper, cobalt, nickel, iron, and the inolybdic
 acid.    Some days ago        I likewise subjected this substance to
 a new examination, and           I  hope to prove        that every    thing
 hitherto publiflied on this subject is incorrect ; and though
 I have not yet given to my researches all the extent which I
 propose,    for want of a sufficient quantity of matter, they
 have been carried far enough to prove that the red lead con

  mixture was exposed for an hour to              a boiling   heat.   I  ob
  served, tst, that when these matters began to act. upon each
  other there was produced a strong effervescence              which con
  tinued    a  long time;         ad, that the orange colour os the     lead,
  became a brick red ; 3d. that at a certain period the whole
  matter seemed to dissolve ; 4th, that in proportion as the ef
  fervescence advanced          the matter reappeared      under the form
  of  a  granulated powder,          of a dirty yellow colour; 5th, that
  the liquor assumed         a beautiful golden yellow colour. When
  the effervescence         had    entirely subsided,    and  appeared     to
  have no longer any action on the substances,                   the liquor
  wa9 filtered, and        the metallic dust collected       on the paper.
  After being        washed    and dried,      it weighed no more than
  78 parts:      the pot- afli therefore had taken from it 2a parts.
     Exp.     II.   1 poured upon the 78 parts just mentioned, some
  of   the nitric acid, diluted        in twelve parts of water, which
  produced       a   brisk effervescence.        The greater part of the
  matter was dissolved           :  the liquor assumed no colour,        and
  there remained only a small quantity of powder of an orange-
  yellow colour.         I  separated the liquor      of the  residuum    by
  the help of      a  syphon, washed the matter several limes,          and
  united the washings with the first liquor.              This residuum,
  dried, weighed no more than 14 parts : from which it fol
  lows, that the nitric acid had dissolved 64.
     E p. III. I again mixed these 14 parts with 4a parts of
  the carbonate ospot-ash and the necessary quantity of water.
  I then   treated them as in Experiment              I.  and  the pheno
  mena were the fame.               The liquor, after being filtered,    was

  Exp.      IV. The          two nitric solution* united and evaporated,
produced 92 parts of nitrate of lead, crystallized in octaedra,
perfectly white and transparent. These 92 parts of nitrate
of lead,           in water, were precipitated by a solution of
            dissolved
the sultate of soda. This produced 81 parts of the sulfate of
lead, which were equivalent to 56,68 of metallic lead.
   Exp.     Y.      The alkaline liquors united,               had an orange-yel-
low colour.           They      deposited      at the end       of   some days           fwo
parts      of   a   yellow powder which contained flo more lead.
These liquors,          subjected       to evaporation until a saline pellicle
was formed on their surface,                   produced, on coolihg,               yellow
crystals;       among which there was carbonate                        of pot-ash, not
dee -imposed.           These crystals           dissolved     in water,          and     the
solution        united with         the mother           water,      the     whole was
mixed with weak nitric acid until the carbonate of pot-ash
was saturated.           The liquor then had a very dark orange-
 red colour.          Being united with a solution of the muriate of
 tin, newly made, it            first assumed a brown colour,                  which af
 terwards became               greenish.       Mixed with           a solution          of the
 nitrate    of lead it immediately produced the                      red lead.          Last
 ly,   evaporated       spontaneously,         it    produced ruby-red crystals,
 mixed with crystals of the nitrate                   of pot-ash.        Ninety-eight
 parts   of this mineral,          decomposed          as above      mentioned, hav
 ing produced            81     parts of the         sulfate   of    lead,     loo       parts
 would have given 82.65,               which are equivalent tc-57.t of
 metallic lead.              But admitting, as experiment proves, that
j  00 parts of lead absorb, in combining with acids, 12 parts
 of oxygene, the 57.1 of metallic lead ought to contain                                     In
 the red led 6.86 of this piinciple, and we ought to have
 for the mineralizing acid 36.4.

 red lead, as beautiful as the natural mineral.  The other

of       oxyde of lead and 34.88 of acid.

 As I        conceive there are few persons, however conversant
 with    natural history, who may have            seen  or known there
 was an animal existing in the coldest parts of Canada, of the
 fame genus with the        Jerboa, hitherto confined       to the warmer
 climates of Europe and Africa           ; I take the liberty    of laying
 before this society the following observations (accompanied
 by a drawing) on an animal of that kind, procured by myself
in   the neighbourhood        of Quebec, during my       last residence    in
 that country.        As  I do not   recollect to have  seen   this animal
 either figured or described by any author in natural history,
 I  flatter myself, these observations may afford some satisfac

                                         I     have       frequently observed others
in shrubby          places and in the woods, amongst plants, where
they chiefly reside, leap considerably higher.                                   When found
in    such places,       it   is   impossible to take them, from their won

of   a   cricket ball, nearly an inch                in   thickness, perfectly smooth
within,     and about 20 inches under ground.                                   The man who
                                  not knowing what                   was, struck the ball
                         by it,
first discovered                                                it
with his       spade,             which      means    it   was broken to pieces,                   or
the ball also would have been presented to me.                                      The draw
ing will perfectly show how the animal                                   is     laid during its
dormant        state.
      How long          it   had been under ground                    it   is    impossible        to
fay  ;   but   asI      never could observe these animals in any                                par*
of    the country after the beginning                      of September,           I     conceit
they lay themselves up some time in that month, or beginning
                                                                                                   of

of October, when                    the frost    becomes         sharp   :     nor did       I   ever
seethem again before the last week in May, or beginning of
June. From their.being enveloped in balls of clay, without
any appearance                of food,       I   conceive they sleep during                          the
winter,       and remain for that term without                               sustenance.             As
soon as         I   conveyed         this specimen to my house,                       I   deposited
it,   as   if   was,    in    a     small chip-box, in some cotton, waiting
with    great anxiety for its waking                     ;   but that not taking place
at the season they generally appear,                         I   kept   it    until I      found      it
begin to smell:         I      then stuffed        it,   and preserved         it   inits torpid
position.       I     am      led to believe its not recovering from that
state, arose from the heat                  of my room during                 the time      it    was
in the box,            a    sire    having been constantly burning                          in       the
stove, and which in all probability was too great for respira
tion.      I     am led to this conception from my experience                                         of
the snow bird of that country, which always expires in                                           a   few
days (after being caught, although   feeds perfectly well)    it

 decrements on the angles.              I give the name of intermediate,
 decrement to this particular kind           of   decrease,   the progress os'
 which will     be better illustrated by the          following example.

    This variety of iron ore, which for the most part appears un
der the form of two opposite pyramids, rising from a common
base, is found       at Fraraont m les Vosges.              There   are some
groupes, the surface of which, like the iron ore              of the island of
Elba,    reflects the most lively prismatic colours.             The crystals
are often so small, that they might be taken for simple tetra
gonal laminae; but, on close inspection, the small spots which
form the faces      of the rising pyramids may be ten.
    These   crystals, which M. de 1' Isle classed among the modi
fications of the dodecaedron           with    isosceles triangular planes,
have for nucleus a cube which              performs the functions of the
rhomboid,       as in the ore us the island of Elba.                The two
regular hexagons, by which they are terminated, arise from
a decrement by a single range of cubic moleculæ on the
angles c, n, {Jig.     46; of the nucleus.

    To form       an idea    then of the effect of the Intermediary
Jaw, combined with the preceding, and which gives rise-to
the lateral trapeziums, let us suppose that c b p r (fig. 49)
represents1    the fame square as fig. 46, subdivided              into small
squares, which are the external stces              of  as  many     molecular.
If we take     these moleculæ by pairs, so that they form rectan
gular parallelopipedons, having for bases tire' oblong squares
 b  ngb, bgmG,$cc.           and   if  we imagine that the subtractions
are made by two ranges            of  these double moleculx,         the edges
of   the laminae of superposition          will   be successively ranged      in
 lines,  as  P G,     T L* R p,       S p, k x,     y as,  &c.  and    the sum
 of all   these edges      will   produce     two faces which, departing
 from the angles         b, r,    will  converge,      the one towards       the
other, and will unite themselves on a common ridge, situated
 above the diagonal c p, but inclined to that                 diagonal.     We
 shall then have twelve          faces   as   the complete       result  of the
 decrement      ; and  calculation shows, that the fix superior faces,
 being prolonged to the point where they meet the fix lower
 faces,   will form with        them     the surface       of a dodecaedron,
 composed      of two rigl* pyramids united            at their bases.    These
 pyramids are here incomplete by the effect of the first law,
 which gives the hexagon abedru (Jig. 48) and its op
  posite*.
                           5. Mixed      Decrements.
      In olher'crystals    the decrements, either on the edges or on
  the angles,     vary  according to laws, the proportion            of which
  cannot be expressed but by the fraction                   \  or J.     It may
  happen, for example, that each lamina exceeds the following
  by   two    ranges parallel to the edges, and that it may at the
  fame time have ah altitude triple that              of  a simple   molecula.
  Figure 54     r- presents a   vertical geometrical section         of one of
  the kinds of pyramids which would result from this decre
  ment;     the effect   of which      may be readily conceived         bycon-

decrements      those    which exhibit this new kind of exception
from the simplest laws.
   These decrements,          as  well   as the   intermediarv ones, rarely
exist any where else, and it is particularly in certain metallic
substances that      I  have discovered them,            [-saving tried to ap
ply the ordinary laws to          a variety of these substances,            I found
so   great   errors in the value of the angles that                      I   at   first
believed     they were inconsistent             with    theory.      But alter I
had conceived the idea os giving to this theory the extent                           of
which I     have just spoken,         I arrived at results so correct, that
I  no longer entertained any doubt                 of  the    existence       of   the
laws on which       these results       depend,
                 "RrfleH'ions on the preceding           Results.
    All   the metamorphoses             to   which    crystals are       subjected
depend on those laws           of structure just explained,           and others
of the like kind.         Sometimes         the decrements         take place at
the fame lime on all the edges j               as  in  the dodecaedron           hav
ing rhombuses for its planes,             as before     mentioned      ;   or on all
the angles, as in         the    octaedron originating           from a cube.
Sometimes they take place only on certain edges or certain
angles.     Sometimes there is an uniformity bctwein them,                           so
that it is one single law by one, two, three ranges, 8tc. which
 acts on the different       edges, or the different angles; as is ob
 served in the two         solids   of which        I (hall   speak     hereafter.
Sometimes        the law varies from one edtre                 to the other, or
from one angle to the other; and this happens above all
 when the nucleus has not asymmetrical Joini ; for example,
when it is    a  paralltlopipedon,           the faces     of which differ          by
 their   respective      inclinations,        or by the        measure      of their
 angles. In certain cafes the decrements on the edges eon-
 cur with the decrements on the angles to produce the fame
 crystalline form.         It   happens       also sometimes       that the fame

 edge,  or the same angle, is subjected to several laws               of de
crement, that succeed each other.               In a word, there are    cases
where the secondary crystal has faces parallel to those of the
primitive form, and which combine with the faces produced
by the decrements       to modify the figure        of the crystal.
    I ca\\ simple secondary forms, those arising from an unique
law of decrement, the effect of which entirely conceals the
nucleus;     aud compound secondary forms,               those which arise
from several simultaneous laws              of decrement, or from one
single law which has not attained to its extent, so that there
remain faces parallel to those of the nucleus, which concur,
with the faces produced by the decrement, to diversify                    the
aspect  of the crystal.      1  shall soon make new applications            of
theory to the compound secondary forms, of which syntactic
iron ore has already presented us an example.
    Ifamidll this    diversity     of laws  sometimes     insulated, some
times     united by combinations more or               less  complex,     the
number      of the ranges subtracted          were itself extremely vari
able ; for example, were these decrements               by twelve, twenty, 
thirty or forty ranges, or more,           as  might absolutely be     possi
 ble, the multitude       of the forms which might exist in e3ch
kind of mineral would be immense, and exceed what could
be imagined.         But the power which             effects   the subtrac
tions seems to have        a   very limited action.         These   subtrac
tions for the molt part take place              by one or two ranges        of
molecuLe.        1 have found none which exceeded four ranges,
except in a variety       of   calcareous      spar, forming     part of  the
collection   of C. Gillet Laumont,             the structure    of which     I
have lately determined, and which depends on a decrement
by six ranges     ; so that,    if  there exist laws which exceed the
decrements by         four ranges, there is reason to believe that
they rarely tike place in nature. Yet, notwithstanding these
narrow limits, by which the laws of crystallization arc cir*
cumlcribed,      1 have found, by confining myself to two             of ihe
limpleit laws, that is to fay, those which produce subtraction*
by one or two range?,              that calcareous      spar is susceptible

   of two      thousand     and    forty-four different forms         :  a number
   which       exceeds    more than fifty times that of the forms al
   ready    known*,       and    if  we admit into the combination de
   crements by three            and     four ranges, calculation will give
   8,388,604        possible forms in regard to the fame substance.
  This number          may be still       very much      augmented        in conse
  quence of decrements either mixed or intermediary.
      The striæ remarked on the surface of a multitude                      of crys
   tals afford a new proof in favour              of theory,    as  they always
  have directions parallel to the projecting edges                 of  the laminae
  of  superposition,      which mutually go beyond each other, un
  less they arise from some particular want                of regularity. Not
  that the inequalities resulting from the decrements                      must be
  always sensible,       if  the form       of  the crystals   had always that
  degree of sinisliing of which it is susceptible .; for, on account
  of the extreme minuteness of the moleculæ, the surface would
  appear of a beautiful polish, and the striæ would elude our
  fenses. There are therefore            secondary crystals where they ar«
 notobserved in any manner, whiletheyare very visible mother
 crystals     of  the-same nature and form.             In   the latter case, the
 action of the causes which produce crystallization not having
 fully enjoyed all the conditions necessary for perfecting that
 so    delicate operation of nature, there have been starts and
 interruptions in their progress, so that, the law of continuity
 not having been exactly-observed, there have remained on the
 surface      of the crystal vacancies         apparent to our eyes.           In  a
 word, it is      seen  that such small deviations are attended                with
 this     advantage,     that they point out the direction according
 to which the striæ are arranged in line* on the perfect forms
 where they escape our organs, and thus confibute to unsold
to us the real mechanism               of  the structure.

 eondary        crystals by their reentering and salient angles,                                            thus
 afford a satisfactory                  solution of the difficulty                         a    little before
 mentioned          ;   which         is,   that the fragments obtained                          by   division,
 the external            facets     of which form part of                    the faces             of   the   se
 condary crystal,                 are not like those drawn from the interior
 part.       For this diversity, which                       is    only apparent, arises from
 the facets in question                          being composed of                   a     multitude             of
 small planes, really inclined to one another, but which,                                                     on
 account of their smallness,                          present         the appearance                    of one
 plane   ;    so    that,     if  the division could reach its utmost bounds,
 all these fragments would be resolved into moleculæ, similar
to each other, and lo those situated towards                                         the centre.
     The fecundity of                 the laws on which the variations                                of crys
talline forms depend,                        is   not confined to the producing of                               a
multitude of very different forms with the fame molecula?.
It often happens also, that moleculæ of different figures ac-
range themselves in such   manner as to give rife to like po-

lycdra in different kinds of minerals. Thus the dodecaedron
with rhombuses for its planes, which we obtained       com                                         by
bining cubic moleculæ, exists in the granite with    structure                                 a
composed of small tetraedra having isosceles triangular faces,
asI      shall prove hereafter                    ;   and   I      have    found           it    in     sparry
fluor, where there                 is   also an assemblage                 of   tetraedra,            but   re
gular;       that    is      to fay, the faces              of which        are equilateral tri
angles.       Nay more            :     it   is   poslible that similar moleculæ may
produce the fame crystalline form                                    by   different laws of de

    The bases       of this    prism are produced in consequence               of  a
decrement by           a  single range on the angles of the summits
h  as, g as, b ag, de x, dee,              c  ex {Jig. 4.), of the primitive
form.       The fix planes result            from       a decrement by         two
ranges on the angles b            df, fx g, beg, dfx, d be, cgx, op
posite to the      preceding. Let ah d             f   (fig. 50.) be the fame,
face   of  the nucleus as fig, 4.           The     decreasing     edges situated
towards the angle of the summit               a   will succeffivelycorrespond
with the lines       b i,   i /,&c.    and those which look towards the
inferior angle d will have the positions pointed out by mn,                     opy
&c. But in        consequence         of the   first decrement taking place
by one range, we prove that the face which results from it is
perpendicular to the axis; and calculation shows, in tire like
manner,       that the second decrement, which takes place by
two ranges,        produces planes parallel to the axis, and                  thua
the secondary         solid is   a  regular hexaedral        prism.
    To display further           the structure      of this prism      let us re
mark that, in the productions              of any onen he         nib {fig. \.\
of   the two bases,          we may confine ourselves            to consider    the
 effect of cne only of          the three decrements           which    take place
around the solid angle a {fig. 4.), for example of that which
takes place on theangle              b as,  supposing thatthelaminæ             ap
plied on the two other faces,             f a  g x,    b a g  c, do  not decrease
but to      assist the result      of  the principal        decrement,      which
takes place in regard to the angle              b
                                                   as. But      here these auxi
liary   decrements         are    altogether similar to that the effect of.
which     they are supposed to prolong.
    The    case   will   be totally different       if we   apply the fame ob
 servation to the decrements which are effected by two ranges
 cn the inferior angles           b df, a'fx,f.vg,         &c. and which pro
                                                                              duce

duce the six planes           of  the prism.       For example, is       we con
 sider the effect       of    the decrement       on the an^'e      dfx,       it is
necessary also that           the laminae applied on the faces a           f  d b,
a sx    g[fg.     4 )j should experience towards theirlateral angle*
a f  d,  as x,                                      f
                   adjacent to the angle d x, variations which se
cond the effect of the generating decrement.                          But     here
these variations are intermediary decrements by ranges                            of
double moleculæ.
    To conceive          a  better idea     of   these  variations,   let  11s   re
sume the face a b           df [Jig-    50).      The variations in question
will   take place parallel to the lines c e,              r x, g 2, vy, &c.
that is to fay,       by one range     of double moleculæ,          and in such
a  manner that there will always be two laminae on                     a level at
their edges in the direction of the height.                   By this it is evi
dent why the laminae taken from the prism by the first sec
tions are trapeziums,             such asp    Iu   $  {fig.  I.), in which      the
assortment       of    the small     composing rhombuses            will  be the
fame as     on the trapezium u          s 0
                                             f> (fig. 50).     We may in the
like manner        assign the reason       of the different figures through
which the laminae, successively eletatched,                  before arriving at
jthc nucleus, are obliged to pass.                But this detail would lead
us too fur.         In   a word, I must here rcneai, that everything
is included in the cfflct of the principal decrements; that
is to fay,  'in   the present cau, of those          which    take place on the
superior     and     inferior angles,       or parallel to the horizontal
diagonal?     ;   and after       the first lamina     of superposition, the
figure of tlie crystal is given           according to this finale condii

 ferent    epochs al which           the decrements        commence,             are
 supposed,      to commence.           For example:         is we  suppose that
 the decrement, which takes place towards the inferior angle,
 acts alone at first on a certain number                of laminæ,       the axis
  of the crystal      will   be  so much the longer         as the  commence-

specting the dodecaedron,^-.                                 2, which is one of the results
of the mechanical division of the prism. It is                                         there seen that
the pentagonal laminæ of the summits, such as A O I R S,
decrease only by their edge R S, which corresponds to the
inferior angle             b    df {fig.       4.)., while, by their upper parts, they
continue              to envelop the               crystal      without experiencing                         any
decrement towards that fide                             3 so   that it is only on the la

      The     first decrement         is the fame as that which produces the

    The numerous analogies by which this                         variety      is con
nected with different crystalline forms, whether we consider
certain angles      formed by planes,             as   the angle    beg of        900,
the angle ce     g of 6c°, or certain triangles obtained                  by draw
ing the diagonals of the trapezoids,                 have induced me to give
it the name of analogical spar. It is               derived from three other
varieties   mentioned before, viz. very obtuse spar by tqe tra
pezoids e m i      b,fi      b t, &c. ; metastatic spar by the trape
zoids e m d c, e b 0 g, 0 b t z, &c. and the prismatic spar by
the trapezoids      b  d  c  i,   c e  gp,    &c. which       are consequently
parallel to the axis.

figure,    that is to fay,        having its surface composed                  only of

    This variety      results from a combination              of  the law which

 with that which takes place for the dodecaedron                         with pen

fig. 30,     and wished to convert it geometrically into an                ico-
saedron,      such as that in question, it would be sufficient to
make the planes of eight sections               pass  through it in the fol
lowing manner, viz.             one through the three angles          P,  N, L,
 (fig. 19.), another through the angles P, M, S, a third
 through the angles L, R, U, &c. A comparison of the figures
 19     and 55    will (how, by the correspondence of the letters,
 the relation between the two polyedra ; but this is an ope
 ration merclv technical, to which nature could not descend.
 I    shall observe besides,          that the nucleus of the icosaedron,
 to which we sliould arrive, would be much smaller than that
 of    the dodecaedron,        since    the solid angles     of  the latter nu
  cleus would        be confounded with           the angles     D, C, G, &c.
  (fig. 30.) of       the dodecaedron         ;  whereas    the other nucleus
  would have its solid            angles situated     in the middle of the
  equilateral triangles         M PS, N PL, URL,               &c. (fig. $5).
       The   icosaedron       of    the sulphurc    of iron    has   been   con
  founded      with     the    regular icosaedron of geometry, which
  differs from it very sensibly,            since all its triangles are equi
   lateral.    It  is demonstrated        by theory, that the existence of
   the latter icosaedron is as impossible            in mineralogy     as that of
   the dodecaedron         ; so   that among the five regular polyedra         of
   geometry, viz. the cube, the tetraedon,                 the octaedron, the
    dodecaedron, and the icosaedr«n,              the three former only can
    exist there   in   consequence       os the laws    of crystallization.     It
    is not uncommon therefore to find them among crystals                       of
    various kinds of minerals.

      I have not yet observed the petunze naturally                   crystallized
  under its primitive form.            This form,     such as it is given by
  the mechanical division of secondary               crystals,     is that of an
  oblique prism of sour planes {fig. 58), two of which, such                      as
  G O A D, R B H N, are perpendicular to the bases ADNH,
  O G R B. The other two, viz. B 0 A H, R G D N, make,
 with the former, angles of 1200 at the ridges O A, RN, and
 angles of 60° towards the opposite ridges B H, G D. These
 planes are inclined         to the    bases   at the place      of    the ridges

position.      We    shall soon have occasion          lo make       use  of thu
 observation .
    The polynomous petunze presents the most complicated
variety which I have observed among crystals of this kind.
To form an idea of its structure, let us suppose that b py r
{Jig.    57) represents      a section    of the nucleus A R {fig. 58)
made      by   a  plane     perpendicular        to    the    parallelograms
G O A D, B O A H,            and subdivided into a multitude              of small
parallelograms, which are the analogous sections                     of so many
molcculæ.         Here the     side  yr     {fig. 57) which is the fame
section   of  the cutting plane as          G O A D, is greater than it
ought to be in regard to the             side c r {fig: 57), which           is the
fame     section as   B O A H {fig. 58) : but these dimensions
 are suited to   those of the secondary crystal, and here occasion
no difficulty,      because      we may suppose that the                primitive
form has       been    extended       more in one        direction       than    in
another;      for this form, as      I  have already remarked, is onlv
 a convenient datum for the explanation of the structure, and
the crystal consists merely in an asiemblage                of similar mole-
culæ   ;  so  that it is the dimensions of these molcculæ which
remain invariable.
    This    being premised,         we shall find,        by comparing the
figures 56 and 57      ; 1st,   that the plane      fa   b nkl    i  b {fig. 56)

  and   its opposite       (fig. 56),    which    correspond       tofy,   c a

 the fame ridges        GD, B H (fig. 58),       which decrement takes
 place on the other side of these ridges.               It may     be seen by
 what has been already said, that decrements               different in their
 measure give rise to planes similarly situated,            such as    0 n k m
 and   cfg  b   (fig. 56), which      is a consequence     of the particular
 figure of   the moleculæ.
     With    regard to the faces        of  the summit,      the heptagon
pGtcdex           (fig. 56) is situated parallel to the base BRGO
 (fig. 58). The enneagon B * rP 0 nb e z (fig. $6) is pro
 duced in consequence of a decrement by one range on the
 angle   OB     R    (fig. 58), or parallel     to   the diagonal O        R;
 which   decrement does not attain to its          full extent,     and leaves
 subsisting    the neighbouring          heptagon parallel to the         base
BRGO.            It  may be readily conceived, after what has been
 said on the position          of the diagonal O R, why the line           e is
(fig. 56), which         separates the two large faces      of the summit,
is situated horizontally,          supposing   that    the   planes have a
vertical position.
    The trapeziums         dafe, A     p G C, result from       a  decrement
by one range          on the ridges      G O, B R, (fig. 58).             The
facet d   eba (fig. 56)       arises from a decrement by two ranges,
parallel to the ridge B O (fig. 58).                 With regard to the
other facet A B z/>, which has the fame position as the pre
ceding, in regard to the opposite part of the crystal, it results
from an intermediary law by a range of double moleculæ on
the angle    OI1R        (fig. 58). The rhombuses b c I h,k              ifu

XII.     Description         of   the Apparatus employed                      by   Lavoisier

 J.      HE       discovery       made         by   Mr. Cavendish of the                 composi
tion     of water having             effected          a   complete revolution                 in the
theory of chemistry,                 it   will      no doubt gratify               many       of our
readers      to fee      some        account           of   the      principal         apparatuses
which have been contrived to exhibit this phenomenon.
      Fig.   1, Plate        X.     is   that       used     by   Mr. Lavoisier.               A   is
                                                                                                   a
 balloon holding about 30 points, having                               a    large opening, to
 which       is   cemented        the plate         of copper         B    pierced      with four
 holes, in which four tubes terminate.                                The     first tube       H   b   is
 intended to be adapted lo an air-pump,                               by   which the balloon
 may be exhausted of its air. The second lube gg communi
 cates bv its extremity                  M M        with    a    reservoir      of oxygen gis,

                                                                                               d

 hydrogen gas. The extremilv                           d   of this    tube terminates in               a
 capillary opening, through which the hydrogen gas contained
                                                           in

304             Lavoi/Ier's          Apparatus           for producing       Watei.
in   the reservoir is forced,  with a moderate degree of quick
ness,      by the pressare of a column of one or two inches of
water.             The fourth tube, G          L, contains a metallic wire,
having         a   knob at its        extremity L, intended for transmitting
an electrical spark from                     L   to d, on purpose to set fire to the
hydrogen gas                :    this wire is moveable                 in the tube, that the
operator may be able to move the knob                                  L to or   from the      ex
tremity d of the tube                D d.
     The      three tubes          dD d, gg,          and   H    l>,   are all provided       with
flop cocks.
     That the hydrogen gas and oxygen                                  gas may be as much
as   possible deprived of water, they are                          made to pass, in their
way to the halloon                    A,     through the tubes             M M, N N, of
about an inch diameter                   ;   and these are filled with salts,                which
from their deliquescent nature, greedily attract the moisture
of the gas such are the acetite of pot-ash, and the muriat of
                   :
nitrat of lime.                  These salts must only be reduced to                     a   coarse
powder, that they may not run into lumps, and prevent the
gases from passing through their interstices.
     Being provided with                   a     sufficient quantity of the oxygert
and    hvdrogen gases (the latter in the proportion of    to                             2       l'
of   the former), and having adjusted every thing properly, as
above         directed, the tube                 H   b    must   be adapted         to an      air-
pump, and the balloon                      A     exhausted of its air.            Next admit
the oxvaen             so       as to sill the balloon,          and      then    by   means     of
                                stream   of hydrogen through               the tube D</, to

which         set fire      by    an electrical spark sent down the wire con

                                                         of these two     gases may be        con

plying them to the balloon from their reservoirs,                             in proportion
as they are consumed *.       appears from the most accurate

    The    bent part of the tube          C, by always containing          some
water, prevents the gas from escaping through the funnel ;

where the              vesicle          was     placed.           Soon   after     the        vesicle
becomes filled again, though in an insensible manner,                                           and
still produces           an extension             of the leaf-stalk or petiole, which
a cause         like the former may destroy.
   " In         the bedysarum                 gyraru, the     vesicles   of   the bottom          of
the small leaves being filled to a ceUain degree, then empty
themselves insensibly, become filled again as before, and re-
empty themselves in the like manner, without any other de
termining cause than the effect of their plenitude. But this
continued alternation of repletion and evacuation keeps in
constant movement thesmall leaves of the plant, which, when
the weather is warm, rife and fall alternately, but in a flow
manner.
   Shade, or the absence of light, by the coolness resulting
from        it,    causes that evacuation or stirinking                       of   the vesicles
just mentioned.                   Hence          the    closing up in the evening of
certain parts of plants, especially of the leguminous families,
to which, botanists have given the name of their flap.
  It       is     by   these causes,             or others     analogous, that all               tlA
movements              of       these plants ought to be explained.                      A     great
number of plants experience                             particular movements in the
sexual       parts       at       the     time of their            fecundation.               These

      Notwithstanding                  the         many researches               made respecting
 the cause of this irr' lability, much is still wanting.                                         Girtan-
 ner ascribes it chii                  fly   to oxygen          :    but the proofs which he
 gives in support of his opinion do not appear                                          satisfactory        ;
 since the air does                 lot seem to have                 a    direct influence                on
 the irritability            of     he heart.       For example, the vein of an if
 animal be opened, and                       isa bubble of vital air or oxygen gas
 can be introduced into                      it,   by    mean?       of   a   small tube, as soon
as the air reaches the heart the animal fends forth                                            a    cry   of
 pain and expires.                  Bichet, who made this experiment*, re
peated      it      with ati,iospheric air, azot, hydrogen, and the car
bonic acid gas, and the animal periflied in the like manner;
but cold water injected into     vein does not produce the
                                                         a
like effect. Bichet concludes, that the death of the animal
is   occasioned             by   the interception               of   the air between the co
lumns of the arterial and venal blood.                                    But, in this         cafe, we
may       rest assured that            oxygen gas destroys the animal.
     Dr. Mcnzics             observed, that the irritability                     of the      heart pre
served Itself longer   animals strangled or drowned than in

distinguish the arterial from the venal blood, is not the real
cause which gives play to the              irritability of    the heart, but
that its action is particularly owing to the              ejjld vf    heal     am-
hined  with humidity.
    Van Marum, Ilildcbrant,              and    other philosophers think
that there is    a real   irritability in plants, and particularly in
those which have spontaneous            kinds of movement.                It    has
thence been asterted, that oxygen has (he                 fame effect upon
those plants called sensitive,         such as the humble plant (mi
mosa ptidica) , the bedyfarum gyrans,                See. as  upon animals.
    Peschier has made several experiments to ascertain                        whe
ther this opinion was         well sounded ; but oxygen               never ap
peared to him to produce            any effect upon these plants.                He
afterwards examined            whether        these movements          of     those
plants called sensitive are owing to real irritability, like that
of animals.       The numerous experiments which                        he made
on this subject gave him reason to conclude, that                         no    real
irritability could    be    ascribed lo these plants,        and that all the
movements they experience,              by the simple touch or other
wise, are merely mechanical ; and                  indeed plants have nei
 ther nerves nor muscles, nor any organs analogous                      lo    those
 which, in animals, appear to be the feat of irritability.
    This  difference    in the organization of animals and vege
tables cannot be denied          ;  but on the other hand it is equally
certain, that what is called irritability in animals is owing to
 mechanical causes.          The movement of the muscular                 fibre in
 animals    is altogether as mechanical              as the  shrinking         of  a
sprig of the sensitive plant when it is touched.                   That of       the
muscular fibre is owing             to an efflux     of the nervous fluid          ;
 that of the sensitive to the efflux of another fluid, which is as
little known.       But it may here perhaps be said, The animal
 fibre, such    as the heart,      is still irritable a long time asier it
 has been separated from the rest              os the body,     which        is not
 the cafe with the vegetable fibre.             This   is true  :    but it dors
 not prove that it is not always             a  mechanical       cause     which
 acts  in these circumstances j             its action only       is  of    lon<r<r

cular fibre be considered, it cannot be moved but by physical
causes.      The question then will be, to discover what are
these physical      causes.
    It  appears very certain that            the cause     of muscular move
ment is owing            to the    nerves,      since a part        in which      the
nerves are palsied, or confined by a ligature,                      has no longer
any     movement.            But how does the nerve                 move    ?  Some
philosophers have compared                its movement to the oscillations
of   an extended        cord which is struck:            But,      1. The     nerves
arc not extended         :  2. They arc enveloped on all fides             ; where
as the    cord has no points of contact but at its two extre
mities.
    It  appears more probable              to others to consider          the nerve
ss one or more vessels constructed                 almost like the lymphatic
vessels;     that    is    to fay,     composed      of  a  scries    of vesicles   in
which      flows   a    fluid called the nervous          fl'.iid.    I  have   sup
posed that this nervous               fluid is of    a   nature analogous to
thus    of the aura scminalis        .    Others have fought for the cause
of irritability in electricity,            and the experiments on Galva
 nism seem to give some weight to this opinion.

 XV.     On the Effects of Oj-gen In accelerating Germination.
                From /£* Journal dc Physique, 1798.
 M..R. Humboi.dt                 discovered, in 1793, that simple metal
 lic  substances are unfavourable to the germination                      of plants,
 and    that   metallic oxydes           favour it in proportion            to their
 degree    of oxydation.          This    discovery    induced him to search
 for a substance with which oxygen might be                        so weakly com
 bined as to be easily separated,              and he made choice of oxy
 genated muriatic acid gas mixed with water.                          Cresses {Upi-
 diumsativum) in the oxygenated muriatic acid (howed germs
  H the end of six hours, and in cuuimou water at the end

   «»f   32 hours.         The action of the firfl fluid on the vegetable
   fibres is announced by an enormous quantity of air bubbles
   which      cover     the feeds,      a phenomenon not exhibited by
   water till at the end             of  from 30 to 45 minutes.                  These
   experiments announced in Huniboldt's Flora Subterranta
  'Fribergenfis, and in his Aphorisms on the chemical physiology
   of Plants,     have been repeated by others*.                 They    were made
   at a temperature           of from    12 to    15  Keaumur.         In   the sum
   mer of 1796, Humboldt                began a new series         of experiments,
   and found that by joining                the stimulus     of caloric    to that    of
   oxygen he was enabled ilill more to accelerate the progress
   of vegetation.         He    took the feeds     of garden     cresses   (LpiJtuw
  Jativum),pcns          ( pifumfalivum)       , French beans {pbafeolus           vul-
   garis), garden lettuce {laRucasaHvti), mignonette (reseda
   odoratd] ; equal quantities of which were thrown into pure
   water and the oxygenated               muriatic acid at       a  temperature of
   88° F. Cresses exhibited germs in three hours in the oxygen
   ated muriatic acid,             while    none were      seen   in water till the
   end     of 26 hours.           In  the    muriatic,     nitiic   f  or sulphuric
   acid,     pure or mixed with water, there was no germ at                         all:
   the oxygen         seemed there        to be too intimately         united with
.  bases    of   azot or sulphur, to be disengaged by the affinities
   presented       by the fibres        of   the vegetable.        The author un~
   nounces that bis discoveries may one day                    be of great benefit
   in    the   cultivation        of plants.     His experiments         have      been
   repeated with great industry and zeal by several distinguished

   rates germination      also, according to theexperimcntsofCandolle,          a voung
   naturalist,   who liaa applied with great success to vegetable physiology.
   This    phenomenon       is the  more interesting,    as chemistry affords other
   analogies   of the   oxygenated     muriatic acid and the nitric acid. Professor
   Ptiiss,  at Kiel,   by pursuing Humboldt's         experiments,    has found     that
   frogs suffocated in oxygenated         muriatic acid   gas increase iu  irritability,

philosophers.       Professor    Pom* dt Dresden    caused to germinate
in oxygenated       muriatic arid the      seed of  a new kind        of  «w-
phorbia taken        from    Bocconi's collection      of    dried   plants,
no     or  i so   years    old.     Jacquin    and   Vander       Schott at
Vienna threw into oxygenated muriatic acid all the old
feeds which had been kept 20 or 30 years at the botanical
garden, every attempt to produce vegetation                 in which had
been fruitless,    and the greater part of them were stimulated
with meets*.         Even the hardest feeds yielded to this agenf.
Among     those   which germinated         were the yellow bonduc or
nickartree {gHtlerndin       1  bonduc), the pigeon cytifus or pigeon
pea (i-Yti/us   tajan),    the dodonæa angujlifotta,         the climbing
mimosa     {mimtsa scandeni),         and new kinds    of  the homtca. 
There are now shown           at  Vienna very valuable plants which
are entirely owing         to the     oxygenated   muriatic       acid, and
whieh are at present from five to eight inches in height.
HnmboKIt caused to germinate the ciufia rofta, the seeds of
which had been brought from the Bahama islands by Boose,
and which before          had resisted    every effort   to make them
vegettte.      For this     purpose     he employed a new           process,
which seems         likely to be much casier for gardeners               who
have not an opportunity            of procuring   the oxygenated         mu
riatic acid  :  He formed a paste by mixing the feeds with the
Mnek oxyde of manganese, and then poured over it the mu
riatic acid diluted with water.           Three cubic inches of water
were mixed with         half a cubic inch of the muriatic acid. The
vessel  which contains this mixture must be covered, but not
 closely mut;      else it  might readily burst.        At    the tempera
ture of 950 the muriatic acid becomes strongly oxygenated \
the oxygenated muriatic gas which is disengaged passes
through the feeds; aud it is during this             passage     that irrita
tion of the vegetable fibres takes place.

                       of tbdt proposed
        HE     idea   of conveying intelligence by              means        of   signals,
  both during the day and in the night-time,                        is  of   very great
  antiquity, as appears              by the testimony         of   several        ancient
  authors    ;  and there is reason to believe that some sort                     of   tele
  graph was in use even among the Greeks.                      The destruction of
  Troy    was certainly known in Greece very soon after                             it took
  place, and before any person had returned from                         it.   A     Greek
  play begins with a scene, in which a watchman                                descends
  from     the top      of  a   tower in Greece, and gives                information
  that Troy is taken             :
                                     "  I   have been     looking out these ten
                          ' to see       when that     would

  night it    has been done."             A   night telegraph is also expressly
  mentioned by Polybius*, who in his tenth book gives a very
  circumstantial account in what manner the letters of the
  alphabet may be expressed by means of torches.
     It does not appear, however, that this or any other method
  of the ancients          was ever brought into general                  use, or that
  any of the moderns had thought of such a machine as the
  telegraph      till the year 1663, when the Marquis                   of Worcester
  in his Century of Inventions affirmed,                      that    " he      had dis
  covered a method by which,                    at a window,      as   far    as   ihe   eye
  can discover black and white, a man might hold discourse
  with his correspondent without                   noise made, or notice taken;
  being according to occasion                  given or means afforded                 ex re

  belter     if   foreseen,        aud course taken         by mutual consent             of
  parties."        This    eould be effected only by a telegraph,                    which
  in  the next sentence              is declared      to have been          rendered so
  perfect, that        by means           of it  the correspondence            could be

   Forty years after,       M.   Amonton9,       and    ingenious French
mechanic, born at Paris in 1665,                and who died in 1705 at
the age of 41, proposed the following method                   1
                                                                  "  Let   there
be people placed in several stations,             at such a distance from
one another, that by the help of a telescope a man                       in   one
station may see a signal made              in the next before him          :   he
must immediately make the same signal, that it may be seen
by    persons in the station next after         him, who     are to commu
 nicate it to those in the following station, and               so  on. These
signals may be as letters         of the alphabet, or as a cypher, un
derstood      only by the two persons who are in the distant
places,     and not by those who make the signals.                 The    person
in   the second       station making the signal to the person in the
third, the very moment            he sees   it in the  first, the news may
be carried to the greatest distance             in as little lime      as is ne
cessary to make the signals in the first station.                The    distance
of the     several stations,     which must      be as few as possible,         is
measured       by the reach of a telescope." Amontons tried this
method on a small tract of land, before several persons of the
 highest rank at the court of France.

tion asserts*, or whcthcrAmontons'               plan for conveying intel
ligence was founded on the hint thrown out by the Marquis
of Worcester, we (hall not here examine; but it is certain that
the idea of       a  telegraph, upon     a  similar construction to those
used at present,         was suggested by     Dr. Hook towards           the end

visible to each other, lying next in                           a     straight line, 'tis possible
to convey intelligence almost                            in   a moment, to twice, thrice,

  " For the performance of this,                                we mast be beholden to                  a
late invention,                 which       we do not find any                 of    the ancients
knew      ;    thai      is,    the eye must be assisted with telescopes, that
whatever characters are exposed at one station, may be made
pbuat and distinguishable at the other.
 ¦{:   tfc 1st,    For   the stations       :   if   they be far distant,           it   will   be ne-
eaflaryithat they should be high, and lie exposed to the Iky,
that there be no higher hill, or part of the earth                                              beyond
them, that may hinder the distinctness                                    of   the       characters,
which         are to appear               dark,      the      sky beyond them appearing
white.         By which means,                     also, the vapours           near the ground
will.be passed over and avoided.
 ".Next, in choosing of these stations,                                care must be taken, as
pear as may be, that there be no                              hill   that interposes between
diem,         that    is   almost         high enough to touch the visible ray                          ;
because, in such cases, the refraction                                of the air of        that       hilt
will     be very apt to disturb the clear appearance                             of the object.

w.         RITERS          on mechanics,                in   treating of the wedge, have
frequently drawn false conclusions respecting                                      the proportion
which        exists between the                impelling           power applied              to the
head, and the resisting                     powers opposed                 to the sides     j         aud
                                                                                                  those

those conclusion* havrc_refn}ted from, false opiuionfl concern
ing the directions of the refilling powers.
     It   is evident, that when wood or other substance is spiUby
a wedge which does not fill the cleft, that                                  is,   when the angle
of   the cleft       is   more acute than that                    of the wedge,              the power
or action of each              side     of   the wedge, equal and opposite to the
resistance         of   the cleft, must be resolved into two                            ;    the one       in
the direction             of the   side      osthc cleft, which tends to thrust                             it
forward;           and      the    other perpendicular                      to     that direction,
which tends to tear                it   asunder.            It   is   by   not attending to the
above resolution               that      writers on this subject have                            been led
into mistakes; for, instead of considering the powers which
act in        those two directions,                     they      have      imagined             a   single
power only           as   acting obliquely on each side.                           But      if   the side*
of   the wedge are perfectly polished,                            as we must here consider
them, no single permanent power can be applied to impel
any one of them, unless its direction be perpendicular to the
plane of the             side to   which          it   is   applied   :     therefore two ob
lique powers, applied on opposite                             sides   of the       fame point, arc
at least necessary to sustain each other and                                     the action          of   the
plane     ;   and in the case                of    the wedge above mentioned,                             tbe
directions of those two oblique powers                                     will always            be per
pendicular to each other,                         as   will    appear       obvious from                  the
two following propositions                        :
     Prop.         I.     Let     A   B   C       (Fig. 3, Plate X.)              be   a    vertical      sec
tion passing through the centre                               and at right angles to th«
head       and sides        of    any isosceles wedge                 ;    also    in   the pIane_of
this section, and at right angles to its                          sides    A     C,   B     C,   and   CA,
let three powers be applied, such, that their directions may
all mutually intersect                  in   the axis, anil their efforts sustain the
wedge         in    equilibria     iI         s.iy, that         these     three powers are as
A    B,   B    C,   and     E C       respectively.
  Let LM,               K I,D A         he the direction?             of    these three powers,
which produced,                    intersect           each other and                 the    axis in       O.
Since,        by    hypothesis,         these three powers                 directed to the fame
point arc           in    equilibrio, and              the three          fides    of   the       triangle
A    B    C   are at right angles to their directions; therefore,                                      by   a
                                                                                                       well

   of an  isosceles wedge is in     equilibriowith   the resisting power

  and cleft,
     And the co-sine of that            angle   respectively,     the same
  radius being common.
     Let Fig. 2, Plate      X.  represent a    vertical    section   of the
 wedge and cleft, similar in position to that described             in Pro
 position     i ;  also let the two sides   of the cleft   D H, D H be
 equal, and in contact with the sides of the wedge A C, A C at
 equal distances D C, D C from the vertex C, in which case
 the fides of the wedge make equal angles with those of the
 cleft. Through either point D, draw D F at right angles,
and equal to A C ; also through D, draw D E, at right angles
 to D H, and complete the parallelogram D EFG. Then by
Proposition       I, the line  AA   represents in quantity the impel
ling power      applied to the head, and the line     DF     represents    in
quantity and direction the whole action of the          side of the wedge
on that of the cleft, which by hypothesis is balanced by its re
sistance; but      thepowerDF      is resolved intotwo, represented        in
quantity and direction by        DG, DErepectively:          the one, be
ing in the direction of the cleft, tends to thrust it forward          ; and
theother, being atright angles thereto, tends to tear it asunder.

 JL    HE    commission was not satisfied with repeating                                     a     great
part      of the experiments                 already     made       :   they classed them,
and rendered them complete                       by    the addition             of others which
were wanting.
  I.      The phenomenon of Galvanism,                              taken in general,                  is   as
follows     :   A    communication              is   established between two points
of * series of nervous or muscular organs       means of certain        by
determined substances.     At the moment when this commu
nication     made, there take place

changes, the nature of which        still unknown      but which
                                                      is                              ;
are manifested             by     sensations more or less lively,                      or contrac
tions more or              less     violent.         These muscular                   contractions
take place even in separated parts                         of   the body,              and with             si

of irritation.             The      series    of muscular or nervous organs it                                   .<

takes place ; but                if they       are only brought near to each other,
without contact, it is intercepted.
    III.Among the effects resulting from the different compo
sitions pf the exciting arc, we (hall remark the followirig :
The most favourable composition is when it consists of three
pieces, each              of which            is a different metal.                One must touch
the nerve, and the                       oilier       the   muscle          :   these are called the
supports,        or armatures. The tVird forms the communication.
This       is    called          the communicator.                    But one or two of these
may be omitted.                       Animal bodies, of water, may                            be placed
between them j or other substances, either metallic combi
 nations, or all other metals, &c. may be substituted in their
 stead.         It    has not yet been possible to                              determine exactly
 what are the most ineffectual combinations                                        ;    but they have
 been      already classed to a certain point, according to the de
 gree     of their         efficacy.               Gold,    silver,      zinc and tin,             are the
 metals most favourable to Galvanism, when introduced into
 the exciting arc.
     In   general       metal does not act, except when all
                            a single
 other circumstances arc favourable ; but in that cafe it has
 been often seen                  to act.            Error, however,              may     readily here
 arise ; for,        if one of           the ends    of the arc be alloyed, in a pro
 portion ever so little                      different, the arc acts as if there were
 two metals.               By rubbing                 one end with a different metal,
 sometimes            even with the fingers, or by                              breathing upon          it,
 efficacy may be communicated to        under circumstances           it,
 where    would
           it   not otherwise have possessed any.
     Oxydes act              efficaciously, cateris parihus, than their
                            less
 metals.             Dry carbon acts as an actual metal.         not in*                 It   is
 tercepted           by   water and moist substances,                             nor    by   the fingers
if  wet   ;     but this          is     not the cafe       if   the singers be dry,                  Tftc
 energy of Galvanism                          is     not intercepted or diminished                      by
 pieces     of dead            flesli.       1   he effects    of   it      are    sensibly     checked
  by    the epidermis              ;         and     they arc incomparably greater                      in
                                                                                                    flayed

  flayed animals,         or in parts of the human body from which
  the epidermis has been removed.
      It cannot     be said that Galvanism is intercepted                by all idio-
  electric bodies      ;  but, on the other hand, it is intercepted by
  all substances which are strong conductors                          of electricity.
 Such are flame, very dry animal bones, the fleam of water,
  {lass brought to a red heat, Sec.
      IV. Galvanism is influenced also by several circumstances
 foreign to the composition of the two arcs. Such as, 1. The,
 state   of the parts which are subjected to the operation : the
 fresher they are, the stronger are the effects,                      a. The longer
 or shorter      exercise    of Galvanism        :   susceptibility of Galva
 nism is in general excited by exercising                   it;   is exhausted,   by
 continuance, and renewed               by repose.        3. The succession of
 various experiments.             A   disposition     of  metals which at first
 had    be'en   ineffectual, has become effectual                  after a different
 disposition.        Two uncertain experiments                are hurtful to each
ether,      and become         still   more    so    if   made       in  succession,
4. The       state  of the atmosphere.            The     atmosphere       electric ;
 the animal        on which        the operation is performed charged
 and insulated, the effect is the fame.                  The whole        apparatus
 placed under water, the effect remains the fame.
     V. There      are various artificial means to weaken or revive
the susceptibility       of Galvanism.         Thus,       a  frog exhausted and
brought near to          a charged electrophorus resumed its                suscep
tibility. Alcohol, on          the other hand, weakens and even ex
tinguishes it        so as   never to return.           Pot-ash produces         the
fame effect,       only flotvly.        According        to  M.     de  Humboldt,
this susceptibility is in many cafes testored                       by oxygenated
muriatic acid gas.           The commissioners             did not observe this
circumstance        ; but they propose to resume the subject, and to
repeat several other experiments              of   that learned philosopher.
    They     have already repeated those on the action                   of Galva
                                                                                      "
nism on the heart, and               have observed,         as   he did, that its
action is the fame          as on    the voluntary muscles,             and that it
accelerates      their movement.

                                           PHYSICS.
    This       had proposed, in the year IV, as the subject of
              class
a   prize to be adjudged in the public fitting of Vendeniiaire
of the year           VII,      the uses      of   the liver in the different classes
of animals.                This   subject so important, which the academy
of     sciences       had       proposed       in 1792, and which the Institute
thought it its duty to continue to hold forth to the examina
tion of the learned, was not treated in the manner it expect
ed.     It   received only one memoir, in which the question was
riotin the smallest degree illustrated; and of which the
author had wandered into the wide field of the ancient hy
potheses,          without         availing himself of the anatomical and
chemical resources pointed out by the Institute in its pro
gramme.
  This paucity of memoirs, on a subject which concerns
one of the noblest and most useful branches of physics, indu
ced the Institute to suppose that the magnitude and extent                                  of
the question           ;   the scries of the researches necessary for treating
it in   a    propermanner      all, the difficulty of finding
                                      ; and above
united in one man the chemical anJ anatomical knowledge
requisite          for solving       it,   were the causes which           had deterred
competitors from coming forwards.                               Without abandoning
the idea of presenting to the zeal                          of philosophers    a    question
of     so    much importance,                 the Institute has thought proper to
divide        it   into two branches, and to make                     it   the subject       of
    two prizes,            by   adding to the medal which was to have been
    udjud.ed        in      the year       VII,      for the    whole question, that
    which     it   has at its disposal              for the present year.            It   pro-
    j»scs, therefore,             as the subject       of two prizes,      to determine
    die functions of the liver, separating what relates to the
    anatomical structure of the hepatic system, from what relates
    to the chemical examination                        of   the liquids and        solids be
    longing to that system.
       The object of              the first    of   these prizes   will   be   :   the form,
    situation, size, comparative weight and description of the

     The object of       the    second   will be:     an analysis       of  the
  hepatic or cystic bile in the different           classes   of animals     as
  above mentioned.
     The memoirs of those who intend            to be candidates       for one
 or other of       these prizes, or for       the   whole in one         essay,
  must be transmitted, post paid, to the secretary                of  the class
  of the mathematical        and physical sciences,       before the first of
 Nivose in the year       VIII.
     The prize for each question will be a gold medal of the
 weight of a kilogramme; and will be adjudged in the fitting
 of Germinal 15th, in the year VII s. The memoirs may be
 written in French or in Latin, or in whatever language the
 authors choose.
 Notice    of  the Labours      of  the Class   of  the "Physical Sciences
     dttring the preceding three Months.               By Cii.     JLiSi US,
     Secretary.     Head on the 15th Mcssidor            (July 3d.)
     In  she class  of  the Physical Sciences during the last three
 months,      several memoirs       were read relating to chemistry,
 natural history,      rural   economy and medicine, as applicable
 to animals as      will   as   man.     Cit. Gnyton,        in treating of
 the anomalies in affinities, mowed that           these   apparent devia
 tions open to chemists         a vast field  for new researches.          He
 examined why there is no combination between the azot and
 oxygen which exist       so  abundantly in the atmosphere, and in
 a state    of expansion      generally so favourable to an union.
 He likewise pointed out the means of producing it in an
 apparatus capable of supporting nine or ten times the weight
 of  the atmosphere.
     The   same chemist employed himself also in the recipro
 cal decomposition       of  salts, at a temperature       below freezing     j
 a  phenomenon, the observation os which is                of  so  much im
                                                                     portance

                      French National Injlilutt,                      319
portaoce in salt works.          He discovered the cause us it in
the disengagement of caloric, which becomes a disaggrega-
tive power.      Since chemists have extended their researches
to the matter    of heat, it   is well known that carbon is one          of
the weakest      conductors      of it.    Pyrometrical      experiments
have proved to     Cit. Guyton, that        a  body enclosed in carbon
does not receive       from    the fame     fire but two thirds     of the
heat   received    by   a similar body placed         in siliceous   sand.
The    consequences      to be drawn from this fact        will  serve to
improve     the processes employed in reduction and fusion.
    Chemists have hitherto been checked in many of their ex
periments, by not being able to increase the intensity of fire.
The application of an hydraulic principle to the construction
of Macquer's furnace, furnished Cit. Guyton with the means
of increasing    heat to such a degree, that a crucible         of platina
began to melt ; a circumstance never before observed.
    Professor   Klaprolh, at Berlin, had announced that the
colouring matter of the emerald was iron ; but the last analyses
of Cit. Vauquelin prove that the emerald is composed of sili
ceous ahimine, a particular earth which has been called               glu-
 cine, and the calx or oxyde       of chrome;      so  that the emerald
as well as the beryl or aigue marine are two stones perfectly
similar, and composed of the same principles, the colouring
matter excepted.          (See p. 204.)
    By an accurate application of chemical knowledge to the
art of dyeing, Cit. Chaptal has discovered a simple and easy
process for    communicating         to  cotton   a   darker or lighter
chamoy yellow (jaune chamois). By uniting alumine to the
oxyde of iron, this chemist has been able above all to give to
his colours    a soft   and velvety appearance,        which    they can
never acquire when that oxyde is employed alone. He has
examined the different methods of combining that oxyde
with the red of madder, to form a violet colour, and has re
duced     to simple    principles, operations which were exceed
ingly complicated.          He  has shown the reasons why no other
astringents,     whatever be the      dose  employed, can be substi
 tuted for gall-nuts     in dyeing cotton.
                                                                       To

ploy soda, oil, gall-nuts,          sumach, madder, the sulphate of
alumine, and several other substances.                 Cit. Chaptal         has ex
amined what is the action of the three principal mordants,
oil, gall-nuis,    and alum, employed in dyeing cotton                    ;  and by
describing the most complex und obscure operations in dyeing,
he has shown what chemifty can do towards improving the
arts,    when the     practice of it is directed by               a  simple        aud
clear theory *.                                                                ,   ,    ,
    The employment of           soda is not confined to the dyeing                    of
cotton ; that brought from Spain is of great                    use also     in soap
manufactories, glass-houses            for making white glass, and in
bleaching.       As France       expends       annually       the sum       of four
millions for that foreign article, it was of importance to en
courage the cultivation of the plant which furnistiesthe soda
of Alicant.       In this      respect    Cit. Chaptal       and Testier have
been of great service :        the first, in proving by the experience
qf many years, that           the plant which           furnishes the soda of
Aiicant     may be successfully       cultivated on the southern coasts
#f France ; and      that the soda it produces is absolutely                  pf     the
time quality as      that  of Spain     ;  and the second, by giving all
the necessary instructions            respecting       the cultivation,, and
burning of the plant in order to convert it into soda.
     Some years ago Cit. Clouet, a member of the Institute,
had (hewn the possibility of converting iron into cast steet,
without having         recourse     to    previous       cementation.            This
 process,    which     he   has brought to           perfection, is the more
 valuable to the arts which require              cast steel,     as    it may be
produced without           cementation or natural                steel   in every

     It is well known that the goodness               of artillery   depends,          in

 and preserving in all their purity sheep of the Spanish breed.
 Cit. Gilbert has communicated on this important point of
 rural economy the fullest instructions,             and given    the best
 sounded hopes that these valuable animals may be reared                  in
 the territorities    of    the republic, without ever degenerating.
     The   conquests     of our army of the North, by augmenting
the riches of the        Museum of Natural History at Paris, have
 given Cit. Lamarck            an opportunity     of pointing out with
 precision the distinctive characterizing nwk9 of the common
ruttle    fish (sepia efficinalis), the calmar or sea sleeve (sepia
 loligo),    and   poulpe or eight armed cuttle            (sepia octopus),
which had been confounded aud classed in one genus.                      He
bas rectified an error received among some naturalists, who
 considered     as   the animal which forms the .argortauta               or
paper sailor,     a  ponlpe which is accustomed          to lodge itself in
that shell, in the same manner           as  the crab called the hermit
takes up its lodging in different kinds           of shells.
     Cit. Cuvier, in      a  very long memoir on the organs         of the
Voice, shows that the greater part of birds, independently of
the inferior glottis, which is the principal organ of their
M)iee, have     a  superior    larynx, by which mechanism they an
the more enabled to vary their tones, as by its means they
can more easily change the           state  of their glottis, the length
of their trachea,       and the aperture     of their upper larynx.       It
 results from      this   organization, that the gravest tones, and
the harmonics of these tones, are produced by              a prolongation
of   the   tracheal     artery and the greatest relaxation         of the
".'ottis; while by a (horteniog of the trachea, and a contrac

    J. F.    JAcauiK,         professor      of chemistry      at  Vienna, in    1
 ktter    to  M. Delamethcrie,             gives    the following      account of
 some curious experiments which he made lately on this sub
ject :
            " Professor      Chladni       at  Wittemberg, already cele
 brated by several discoveries           in the theory of the phenomena
 of found, induced        me,    during       his residence       at  Vienna, to
 make experiments on the property of different                        gases  con
sidered as     sonorous       bodies ; and particularly             on   that gas
 which     constitutes    our atmosphere,          and serves as the organ      of
 voice.      We took       a  glass bell furnished          at the top with      a
 brass   cock, such      as that     used for     filling  bladders     with  gas,
 and made the internal aperture               of   the cock to communicate
 with   a small    tin flute, about       six  inches in length.         This bell
 being placed in the pneumatic tub, and filled with gas                     of any
 kind,   a. bladder with      a  cock, and filled with the fame gas as
 the bell, was fitted to the cock of the bell, and by pressing
 the bladder gently the flute was made to sound.                       Compara
 tive experiments were repeated in this manner with atmo
 spheric air, oxygen gas,             hydrogen, the carbonic            acid, and
 nitrous gas.      1 lie strength     of  the sound was always the fame;
 but, compared with that in atmospheric air, the oxygen gas
 gave   half   a  lone lower      ; azotic gas, prepared different ways,
                                                                             gave

g*ve almost always a semi-tone lower; hydrogen gas gave
nine or eleven tone* higher ; the carbonic acid gas a third*
lower;      and the nitrous gas almost the fame:               a mixture   of
oxygen gas, and azotic gas, in the proportion of atmospheric
air, gave again the tone of the last mentioned arr, that is \&
fay, a semi-tone higher than each of the compound cases
alone.       As long  as the two gases were not uniformly mixed-
 there    was   a frightful    discord.       Chladni      has  promised    to
 publish     a  full account of       these     interesting experiments,
 which differ entirely from         those   of Dr. Priestley.
           EXPERIMENTS ON ATMOSPHERIC                            AIE.          «
     On the      14th instant,    at 7 o'clock      in   the evening,     Cit.
 Garnerin      and  Cit. Beauvais      ascended in a balloon from the
 garden d'Apollon,         at Paris.     At    the   height of nearly 400
 toises   Cit. Garnerin     let fall a cage, attached to a parachute,
 and containing a cat, which fell very gently near the Port-
 au-Bled.        After 30 minutes      the balloon descended at         Nan*
  teuil, distant from Paris three leagues.             At that place, Cit.
  Beauvais, aide-de-camp           to   General Moulins, quitted Cit.
  Garnerin,     who departed at      half   past three    in the morning to
  complete his aerial voyage,            by taking a long flight.         Cit.
  Frederic Humboldt, a celebrated                philosopher,     had begged
  Cit. Garnerin      to  fill with air      a small flask     with  a ground
  stopper;      Cit. Garnerin emptied the water which it coa«a
  tained at      the heigth of 669 toises (1303 metres) above;
   Paris.     Cit. Beauvais brought back the bottle, silled with,
   atmospheric air, to Cit. Humboldt, who was desirous to know
   if the  carbonic acid gas ascend* to such elevated regions.
      The    observations    of  Saussurc,      made    on the summit 06
   Mount Blanc (at       the height     of 2.480 toisej) announced it*
   existence there ; but this philosopher was in an atmosphere
   rnoditied by the proximity of rocks.              Cit. Humboldt found
   in the air brought back by Cit. Beauvais, which had not
    been under the like influence,           between    3 and    10 miliietne*
    of carbonic air.     Here     then    is a very heavy aeriform        fluid
    carried to the most elevated regions           of the   atmosphere.
                                                                           The

       The air of Paris, collected on              the following      midnight/
    and analyzed by means          of  the nitrous gas and sulfatc       of iron,
   was found to contain 0,276             of oxygen       gas.    The air col*;
   lected    by   Cik Gamerin contained only 0,259 of oxygen.
   The   first was    at  103 degrees,        the second    at 108   of the   <u-;
   diometer.       The air of        the  high regions was consequently
   5  degrees, or 0,017 (almost equal to 0,02) moreimnure than
   the air at the earth's surface *.                This   difference    is very,
   considerable, when we reflect that the greatest or least purity
   of  the atmosphere        does not differ near the earth's surface
   but 0,03 of oxygen.

  veral years past as travelling mineralogist to the                Dublin So
  ciety, has lately arrived         at Belfast,    after having pasted over,
  in his   last journey,     the counties      of Meath, Cavan, Ferma
  nagh, Donegall,         Derry,      and   Antrim. He had before ex
  plored the greatest part        of the South         and  West of Ireland;
  He   has made many new and curious observations, and col
 lected numerous specimens,              illustrating the natural bsstoryj5
 and affording materials         for the arts, manufactures, and agri
  culture of that kingdom.
     Though not educated to those pursuits, he has been inde
 fatigable in his researches, and successful in his discoveries;
 and indeed       he    appears    to be the first person who ever at

near the earth than in the higher regions; the vegetable* which gitiw

                                                                      viceroy,

viccroy,   formed a society in Dublin under hi* patronage :
but the mines are not described in their essays, nor arc there
any catalogues of their fossile productions published.
    Mr. 'Stewart    has been upwards           of twenty     years engaged
exclusively in this pursuit, and             has already deposited       1300
different mineral specimens in the cabinet of the Dublin So
ciety.    But   as few   of his   observations    have hitherto been laid
before the public,        the following     extract from his notes may
prove acceptable       to our readers    :
    "I  was enabled," fays         Mr. Stewart, " by discovering rich
quarries of limestone        and marie, in several estates where they
were never before known either to tenant or landlord,                   to be
accessary to the fertilization        of   the most     barren lands.       In
the estates of Lord Palmerston and             Ormby Jones, Esq. in        the
county of Sligo, I         afforded the greatest pleasure and advan
tage to the poor inhabitants, by demonstrating to them that
the great rocks, which they called Serpent Rocks, and which
 they were gazing at with stupid or superstitious                admiration
 for ages, contained most excellent lime.               These quarries are
at their doors    ;  whereas formerly they carried the scanty pit
tance    of lime they         were   able to procure from nine or ten
 mile* distance.     Having turf      at home in abundance, they are
 now supplied with lime at            as cheap    a rate as any people       in
 Europe.
    "I   observed      to   the   priest   who accompanied me to the
 Serpent Rocks, that this must have been the place to which
 my countryman (St. Patrick) had collected all the serpents
 of the kingdom.         The cliffs extend a mile in front, dip to
 wards the sea westward, and run to an indeterminate length
 into the country.         No block can       be raised  in these cliffs that
 is not replete     with petrifactions;         and the fish appear to lie
 promiscuously      as  if thrown out of         a  net.    There may be
 about ooe-twentieth-of the whole rock composed of those
 petrified sisli or serp»nts.       The strata or beds are very regu
lar, and   of different thickness. They contain also some large
  round sliells as yellow as gold ; so that if chimney-pieces
                                                                         were

 were wrought here they would be very valuable,                  as the fish
 and (hells would afford         very lively and interesting objects
 upon the polished surface. The Cobham marble is reckoned
of   great   value, from the representation          of ruins and land
scapes    which     sometimes      appear upon it     ;  but it would fall
far short, in my opinion,       of the singular    and surprising figures
with which these rocks abound."
    Two    small blocks    of this   stone are deposited at the         Dub
lin Society.

wonderful being,          so  much celebrated in Europe, by means
of which naturalists imagine               they   can trace out,     through
shades almost insensible,         the gradation from man to animals,
made no hesitation          to give to his ape      the name    of  the large,
orang outang or port go.           But, instead of having an opportu

would      have preferred       two hours conversation to that of the
most    learned      societies in the world,        Wurmb      did not even
fee an ape    of the species of the orang outang.              His   observa

aud   I   have been able to determine this point only     com                             by
paring the skeleton of Wurmb's ape with those     of different
orang outangs preserved in the collection of the Museum of
Natural History.  This skeleton of Wurmb's ape, one of the
most      curious and most valuable in the national collection,
will furnish       us with very                  important observations, that may
serve   to give    a   better idea               of    the species       in   question, than       a
description of the external parts.                              (See     PlateXI.)
   This animal,                in    of beings, occupies almost the
                                    the scale
fast rank in the         numerous family of the apes.  The singular
conformation           of its        head         places        it   between the mandrils
                                                        and the allouatcs
(Jttnia malmon et mormon                       (Jimiafeni-
                                                 l)
culus).  However,     without fixing on
                                    if, this characterizing
mark,      though of great importance,                               we adhere to      those ac
cording to which                systematic              authors have formed for apes
'genera    and divisions, the                      want of           a   tail will make      it   an
animal nearly related to the                            gibbons and     orang outangs.
But   I   do not think              it    necessary to           endeavour to prove that
the 'alter       mark      is       very      insufficient to point out the real
affinity of beings.                 A     tail   is    a superfluous appendage,                 and
almost foreign to the bodies                       of animals.             Tins organ       can   in

their habits.        We might       as well fay that some species        of
the genera of the lemur, cavia, erinaceus, &c. which have no
tail, are similar to the orang outangs ; which would be an
absurdity.       On the contrary, in a family like that of the
apes,    where    alt the principal organs exhibit no remarkable
numerical difference, and where the teeth, fingers and
tongue have       n perfect  resemblance,    the form    of the cranium
is the most important consideration in examining the real
affinity of these animals, and may serve as a basis for their
generic divisions; since it appears that the size and convexity
of   the cranium indicate sensibility,        as the  prolongation and
size   of the muzzle indicate brutality.
    But what is most striking in the skull of Wurmb's ape is
the excessive prolongation of the muzzle ; and as this muzzle
acquires such a bulk only at the expense of other neighbour
ing pans, it happens that there is no apparent forehead ;
 that the    osseous  box which      encloses the brain is very small,
and that      the occipital     foramen is situated in the posterior
 part ef the head.        The muzzle,      the size  of which   seems to
 dorm the principal characterizing mark            of this species, is re
 markable not only for the enormous thickness of the jaw
 bones,     but also for the extraordinary bulk of the incisive
and canine teeth with which it is armed.                The incisive    ex
 ceed   in nze   those of the lion ; and the canine, in that respect,
are not much different         :  so that, though these incisive and
 canine teeth, except         in bulk, have a near resemblance           to
 those   of other   apes,   we arc tempted     to confound the head      of
 the one in question with that of the most carnivorous ani
mals.       Another consideration seems in        some manner to sup
 port this affinity.       The occiput rises to    a point, and forms a
 pretty large and thick            quadrilateral   protuberance,     from
 which     arise three osseous ridges, no less apparent and no less
 solid than those      of the lion : two of these ridges proceed in a
 lateral direction to the auricular apertures, and have from
  four to five lines of elevation ; another proceeds to the ver
  tex, then divides itself above the forehead, like that of the

more distinct in the                         ape of Wurmb, and form, with                             the
upper edge of the sockets                         of the      eye, an equilateral triangle.
But       these     (   haracterizing             marks, already               so   singular in this
ape,       will    astonish us Hill                   more by their combination with
others at          least      equally strange.                The     head          has the form ot
half      a pyramid,               and       the auricular apertures                 are placed       far
above the os palatinus                       ;   so that a     line let fall from the auri
cular apertures to the internal edge of the os palatinus would
form, at the point of its intersection with the horizontal line,
an angle           of    250.        This         has been already                  observed    in    the
allouate, where such                     a   singular conformation is necessary on
account of an extraordinary swelling of the os hioides.
        The anatomical              reader will, no doubt, be persuaded,                          after
what       I    have said,          that the ape of Wurmb can in no                                  case
support itself on its two hind legs, but that it must always go
on all-fours.                 It   is,   indeed, on the position of the occipital
foramen, according to the learned observations                                          of Dauben-
ton, that the greater or                          less degree        of aptitude for walking
upright chiefly depends.                              In man,    whose occipital foramen
        nearly in the centre                 of   the base     of    the cranium,           the head
is is
        placed on the vertebral column                         in    an almost perfect equi
librium        ;   but   if    the occipital foramen                 is   removed        backwards,
and particularly to that point where                                 it   is   observed in the ape
ot Wurmb,                    the equilibrium             is   destroyed         ;     the weight        of
the head carries with                    it      the body, and obliges the animal to
use      for its support, and for walking, those anterior extremi
ties which              in   man    serve        only for grasping.
        Before we can draw any conclusion on this point,                                        in     re
gard to the ape                of Wurmb,                and before we            a   (firm, that,     ac
cording to the position                          of   its occipital foramen,               it   cannot
walk      011   two legs, let us consider                  it   in its whole organization.
We are not yet acquainted with                                 all    the immense resources
of nature. We do not yet know                                   to what decree            it   can en

  exist in the greater part         of animals      to compensate       for others
  which     she  may have rendered too prominent.                   But, indeed,
  all the rest    of the organization          of  the ape    of Wurmb            an
  nounces      a biped   animal.       Its pelvis is not completely paral
  lel to the spine ;    its os calcancum has a flat part, upon which,
 like man, it may find             a solid   seat ;   and, in the      last   place,
 its arms have an immoderate length like those                   of  the gibbon,
 since they reach almost to the external                malleolus.        This    last
 characterizing         mark, to which          no attention has          hitherto
 been paid, appears lo me one               of   the surest indications of a
 biped walk.         Apes must take advantage             of  the great length
 of their anterior extremities,              bv extending       them in all di
 rections    ;  thev mu'l make use of them as             of a  balancing pole
 to keep themselves         in equilibrium,       or to restore themselves to
 it when they have been exposed to a fall which obliges them
 to make only a gentle inclination                of  the body.
      In  a  word,    a  particular organization          rectifies   the disad
 vantages which result,           in walking erect,        from the length          of
 the muzzle,       and the position        of  the occipital foramen being
removed        further back.         In   all the known        mammalia, the
spinal apophvses           of  the cervical vertebra? are shorter               than
those of the lumbar and dorsal veriebræ. The                     case is the re
verse in the ape        of Wurmb       ; and, according to the judicious
remark of Cuvier,            these apophvses       of ihe cervical       vertebra?
have this great length, to form more powerful and more nu
merous bond* with the large muscles of the neck which pro
ceed on the occipital ridges.                Thus nature by another              me
chanism has provided for the support of the head of Wurmb's
ape on the spinal column ; and by these means it can keep
itself erect, and run in that posture.
     I  shall not pursue any further an explanation                 of   the cha
racterizing       marks which it exhibits to naturalists.                   I   have
said     enough to prove         that    it is not the orang outang or
pongo, but that it ought to be considered as a species un
known before the publication of Wurmb's memoir.                                I an^

time when he wrote his description the natural history                of the
orang outangs was involved in such obscurity, that he must
naturally have considered his ape to be the fame animal as
the large orang outang or pongo of Bufibn.                      Naturalists
were then far from being convinced               that   this  animal,   such
as   it is described      in  the immortal work         of  that celebrated
author, is an imaginary being to which Boston has assigned
a form and characterizing marks, by confounding, under
thasame name, and in the fame                  description, six diftereot
species   of  apes described by travellers.
II.   Account    of  the Methods employed in         Japan and China la
    prepare Soy,       with  some    Observations      on  the   Bean from
    ¦which   it is produced.      By   Professor  Beckm ANN.
  A HIS       article, which is a brown saline liquor, imported to
Europe from the East Indies,             is employed for seasoning va
rious kinds of dishes,          and   improving     the taste   of different
sauces.      It  is brought     from Japan in small wooden            vessels,
and also from China and other parts of India in glass stalks,
several of which are packed together                  in a wooden box.
 The    use   os  it  has becu     long general     in the East      Indies ;
 where it is placed on the table at each meal, instead of salt,
 for the purpose of dipping in it flefli, sisti, and other kinds
 of food.
     The Japanese       are said to be the inventors        of this article ;
 and, at present, their      soy is preferred    to any other    } though it
 is  asserted   by connoisseurs      that this preference        arises more
 from the price than the goodness.               In my opinion, it »"*

 century ; for it ia not to be found in the old catalogues of
 goods ;    in Saavary's or Ludovici's dictionaries, nor in (he
 old books on cookery. The first account of the method of
 preparing it after the Japanese manner was published by
 Kempfer.

   Before       I   give a         description of this method, it m.iv not                                be
improper to inform the reader that the people in Iiuli.i, in
stead    of our common kidney beans, cultivate and use as
food    another species of a similar kind, called in botany Jo-
Iscbos,    auJ which comprehends                            several species.      Among
these there is one called Julicbosfoya.                             This plant it all over
rough': and its weak stem rises to the                             height of a man. Iu
flowers, which are small, scarcely appear above                                            the calyx,
and are os          a    blueish          or almost       violet colour.The rough
husks      contain for the most                     part only two feeds, which in
form, size and            taste          differ very little from our garden pease,
except that they are flatted,                       shaped       somewhat                like ail egg,
and hare a black speck                          at the place       where they begin to
germinate *.
   These       seeds     form the principal component part of soy.                                        In
Japan they are first boiled, and then mixed with the same
quantity of barley or wheat meal (the latter is for the pur
pose of giving the soy a darker colour) ; and the mixture,
begin covered             up, is depoGted                for twenty-four                  hours in a
warm place, where it ferments.                            The     fame quantity                of com

thrown over             it;   and the whole mass,                      for the space of two
or three months, is stirred round daily with                                  a   chocolate stick,

that period it is strained or squeezed                            through a linen cloth,
and the liquor,               which        is preserved          in wooden vessels, be
comes always clearer and better the longer it is kept.                                                  The
mass    which remains                    is again subjected            to a like process by
having         water poured               over    it,   and, being stirred roimd for
some days, as before,                     is   then strained,

   Of the preparation in China                   the following     account has
                                                   * :
been given        by Eckberg,          a Swede           Thirty-five pounds of
these beans, clean washed, are               boiled for a few minutes with
water in     a covered      vessel,  until they can be easily        pressed   to
gether between          the fingers.      They    are then put into a sieve;
and when they are still moist, after                  the  water has run off,
they are stirred round in fine meal, made of the fame beans,
until   they are completely covered by it.                  They   are then put
into   small     sieves,    or laid upon smooth mats to the height
of an inch      and a    half   above each other, and are deposited in
a basket covered with mats, where they are suffered to remain
three or four days         till they begin to grow mouldy.             They    arc
then first exposed to the air, and afterwards dried in a strong
fun-heat, or in a warm place, until they can bear the stroke
of a hammer; when              they are rubbed between the hands, and
in   that   manner freed from the meal and mouldiness with
which     they are. covered.          They are then thrown into earthen
vessels, and a pickle composed                of 20 pounds      of salt and   ico
pounds of spring water is            |  oured over them.         These earthen
vessels   are exposed open during the day to the                   sun,    but at
night they are covered ; or they are put.in some warm pjace,
for the space os fix weeks, until their whole substance be well
extracted.        When it        is observed that the pickle has become
thick and of      a  dark brown colour,           it is poured off, and     boiled
several limes in          order to render it thicker.            Some, during
these boilings,        add to it sugar,        ginger and other spices ac
cording      to   pleasure,       leaving the whole to stand for            a few
days; after which it is strained.
    From what          has    been above said,         it may be readily per
ceived     that    the preparation         of  soy   in Europe would be        at
tended      with no difficulty         if it were possible to cultivate the
beans.       Bergius, however,           givrs his countrymen little hope
 that this can be done            ; and    chiefly for this reason, thai the
 plant blows      so  late in green-houses, that the summer is gone
 before the      fruit can ripen.          But this is often the cafe with

                                                                                                    34$
exotics which are reared by our gardeners in hot-houses.
As they only begin to blow when their nourishment decreases
and     occasions            a stoppage            of their growth,              the fame          thing
may happen too late in too fertile, a foil, or when they have
a superfluity           of nourishment.                  On the other hand, when they
arc transplanted                 into soil somewhat poorer, and into an open
place where they have                        less (belter,        they do not grow so quick
and     so   long       ;   but they blow earlier.                     And     hence it happens,
that many exotics planted in the open air produce ripe feeds,
which could never be obtained from them while they were
preserved          as       curiosities       and favourites              of    the gardener            in
green-houses.                I   consider      it,   therefore,        as an   experiment worth
making,           to plant these beans in the open sickls                              ;     and   1   am
inclined          to think          that in many summers                        they would pro
duce ripe feeds, especially                        as   Jacquin        fays expressly that they
throve wefl at Vienna in the open air.
      Should my conjecture, however,                                    be not realized,              this
would not, at any rate, be the cafe with that                                           of Bergins,
who M of opinion that                        a   kind     of soy might          be obtained from
our peas and beans                      by   the fame or          a   similar process       ;   but     in
deed    it   would have this great fault, that                          it   would be too cheap
and too soon become                       common.

  invention      of them down to the most recent discoveries, I
 recur to      the labours of Bettancourt, which I have explained
 at full length, as well as the application that may be made                      of
  it to physics and the arts*.           I refer those,    who may be de
 sirous     of being thoroughly acquainted with the subject,                      to
 that work, and (hall here content myself with giving an idea
 of   the apparatus.                                                     <   >.
     The fluid with which           the experiments were            made       was
 confined in       a very  strong boiler made      of copper, being eight
 inches at its greatest diameter, and fourteen inches in height.
 The upper part of it was closed by a cover made of copper
Also,     through which       passed  thr   e  tubes.     The   first served to
 introduce the fluid into the boiler, and could be closely shut
by means of          a screw.    The   second was occupied by a ther
mometer, having its ball about two inches above the bottom
of the boiler, and the scale, which was on the outside, con
tained from o to no0 of                Reaumur.          To   the third was
adapted a bent barometric tube, having two lines                    of internal
diameter, the ascending branch of which was 110 inches in
length.
     By    means     of  a lateral  cock a communication               wa» esta
blished      between the boiler and an air pump, which served to
make a vacuum before              a fire   was kindled      in   the      furnace
below the apparatus.            This circumstance of evaporation in
a vacuum, forms an essential difference                between     the experi
ments of Bettancourt and those made before by Ziegler, and
renders them applicable to the theory               of   the   steam-engine,
where the vapour acts in a space freed from air.
    *  In this second volume will be found experiments       made on the same
object,    and communicated     to me by their author John Henry Ziegler.

    A  vacuum having been made in the boiler,             the mercury
brought as nearly as poflible to a level         in the two branches
of   the barometric      tube, and the thermometer reduced to
tero   by means     of ice, the    ice was removed,     and a sire was
kindled,    which was excited gently and with much equality,
in such    a manner that the barometer            passed over  about a
degree per minute.         One person then stood by to observe the
barometer,      and   another to observe the thermometer, and
each    kept a register      from degree to degree of the pressure
and corresponding temperatures; the pressure being expressed
by the height in (French) inches of the columns of mercury,
 which rose above the level in the long branch of the baro
 meter.
    It was exceedingly difficult to prevent either the introduc
tion of air into the boiler, or the extravasation           of vapour,
 according as the       internal pressure was less or greater than
 the weight of the atmosphere : means, however, were found
 to obviate these inconveniencics ; but they are too long to be
 detailed here, and must be read in the works before men-;
 tioned.
    The   observations    of the    .expansive force  of  the steam   of
 water furnish    1 10 results,   proceeding from degree to degree
 of  the thermometer,       and beginning at zero.       These results
 re contained in the annexed            table,  where the degrees of
 pressure are expressed in (French) inches of mercury, and
 the temperatures denoted according to Reaumur's scale*.
     The experiments on        the expansive    force of the steam of
 alcohol   were   made     by the fame processes, and         with the
 fame apparatus, as those employed with the steam             of water.
 The object of them, independently of their          general utility in
 physics, was to make known the relative expenses which
 would be occasioned by these fluids, when used to
                                                               produce
 moving forces in steam-engines. This object of research is

 both important        and new.      The    expense    of movement in a
 steam engine is compounded            of the price of the fluid evapo
 rated   and   that   of   the  fuel. The use of water requires no
 further expense than that of the substance employed                as fuel  ;
 but it is possible that some other fluid, much dearer in itself,
 may nevertheless have such expansion, that with an equality
of pressure the saving in fuel may be greater than the price
of  the fluid.     If   the results   from    the   fleam of alcohol be
compared      with those from the steam of water, it will be            seen
that, at the same temperature,             the expansive     force   of  the
stram   of  the former is always        more than double that of the
latter.    Much     less fuel then    will  be necessary to produce in
a steam-engine the          fame effect by alcohol       ; and  if  tbe ap
paratus were disposed in such a manner as not to lose the
condensed liquor, which would be attended with no great
difficulty,   it might     be uled  wi;h much      advantage     in certain
cases, and in engines       of small dimensions. But, according to
every appearance,        there   are other fluids less expensive than
alcohol, which may have an equal or even             a greater expansion ;
and it would be a very useful object,          of research to determine
tbe mechanical effect of which steam is susceptible,                 and to
give tables on that subject,        similar to that here presented in
regard to water and alcohol.
   The   results given by experiments,          of   the expansive force
of  the steam    of alcohol    at   different temperatures,        are ex
pressed   in the fame manner, in the following table,              as those-

                              MURIAT OF IKON.
   J.    HE    facts  I   have   related are unquestionable         : it was in
the latter end of 1795 that I first made the observation on the
effect of hepatiscd water upon iron : since then I have veri
 fied   it repeatedly,     and particularly     in the month of Decem
ber 1796, with some very pure iron,                  and in the presence         of
two gentlemen, very competent judges, one of whom assisted
at every part of the process.            Still it has been asked , How it
it  possible that this solution can contain muriatic acid, seeing
that nitrat of silver,         that most delicate        test  of this acid, is
hardly affected by it        ?  To this it might     perhaps be a sufficient
reply, that it is unreasonable             to oppose a mere analogy to
the direct evidence of the           senses ; particularly in a new cafe,
where we have found some of the analogies best established in
chemistry to fail.         But let us recur once more to experiment.
    I formed again some oxygenated muriat                  of iron.   I suffered
the acid to remain on the oxyde about 24 hours ; then poured
off the liquor, and evaporated the fait to dryness to expel the
superfluous acid        :   the salt, which deliquesces           instantly on
cooling, was rediffolved          in a little distilled water.        1.  I  tried
the solution with the acetite of lead              : not the smallest cloud
was produced.           2.    The solution     was     then    tried with the
nitrat of silver:         a little  while curdy matter            was  formed.
3.    A tea-spoonful of the        solution was diffused through two or
three ounces       of distilled water,     and then tried with the nitrat
of silver   : a very flight cloud was formed, and a minute purple
precipitate fell, but not till after some hours.                  The    appear
                                                                             ance

ance was not so           strong,      nor the, precipitate         so    copious,        as
when nitrat of silver is dropped into ordinary rain water.
These experiments evince, that this salt either does not de
compose        the salts of lead and silver,            or that the new com
pounds        are,   soluble in water.            The   first is absolutely con
clusive   :   as to     the small       appearance         of decomposition in
Exp.    2 and 3, be it considered            how difficult it is to prevent a
minute quantity           of common acid from paffing                     over     in the
distillation     of the   oxygenated       acid    ; and   how readily this acid
itself is decomposed           :   add to this the         imperfect oxydation,
perhaps, of the iron.              If these circumstances          are duly weigh
ed,   it seems probable, that this salt, when quite pure, would
not at all sensibly decompose nitrat of silver.                          A slight im
purity cannot be detected by acetite of lead, as                         a small   quan
tity of muriat of         lead is soluble in water.
XII.      FURTHER              CONSIDERATION               S   OH THE              HEP.-
                           TI8KD SOLUTIONS.
   Besides      the    oxygenated salts,          I   think it probable, that
these solutions retain some sulphur ; but under what form,
or in what combination,               it is not   easy to say.      The residuum,
after evaporation, has a peculiar smell, whereas the pure
falls are inodorous. The stain left upon silver by the resi
duum ought, perhaps, to be attributed to this cause.                                Also,
the white matter formed by the decomposition of oxygenated
muriat  of mercury seems to be a combination of sulphur
and mercury.     In proof of this it may be remarked, that
the precipitate of this salt dissolved in simple hepatised wa
ter is white.         Further, it is doubtless          true, that        if    hepatised
water   have< a small      quantity of acid mixed with                    it,   the solu
tion .of iron strikes      a   purple colour with galls.                 To point out
the origin of this colour, mix iron filings and sulphur not
washed, and form them into    paste with a  little water, and  a
let them remain together for some hours:                       put the          paste   in
to, water, and filtrate        :    this water new'strikes         a   purple colour
                                                                                    with

252                  An Analysis of tivd Mineral Springs
with galls. Now, common sulphur is always contaminated
with a little sulphuric acid ; and, as neither hepatic gas nor
oxygenated           salt is here          concerned,            the effect must be at
tributed to the acid and the sulphur.                             If this       water be eva
porated, it leaves              a matter which               does no deliquesce               ; but
which emits           the fame smell as the residuum                       of    the hepatised
solutions.           To   show       that the acid is necessary to the pro
duction of the purple colour, let the sulphur be well washed
with distilled         water before it is mixed                   with     the iron ; and            it
will      be    found that no such colour can be now produced.
The following fact                seems to prove that sulphur may be re
tained in water, in the form neither of sulphur nor of hepatic
gas  : it is an additional proof how essentially the oxygenated
differs from all the common salts of iron.      I saturated a di
luted solution of oxygenated                         muriat of iron, which scarcely
affected nitrat           of   silver,    with        hepatic gas.          A    white preci
pitate fell, but          so   minute that it was impossible                     to collect         it,
nor did         it   destroy      the transparency of the water                      :    hence     I
think     it   probable that,            if   the salt were quite perfect,               it   would
not be sensibly affected                      by   hepatic gas.        I    now boiled the
liquor,        to expel the gas,              till   it   wholly lost its hepatic smell.
The liquor           was again tried with                   nitrat    of silver;     and there
was    a   copious deposition, but of                        a   dark brownish colour.
It   seems certain, then,                 that some sulphur               is   retained        by   the
solution, which cannot be expelled                               by   boiling.

      SODA.
      A   gallon of the water was evaporated to dryness                              ;        the de
liquescent salts were separated from the non-deliquescent                                            ;
and each as the salts which                          were     thus obtained was care
fully examined.                 Thus,          by    processes    which        are   sufficiently
known,          it    was      found that the gallon of water contains of
 muriat of magnesia                1

     The triple compound of which I have treated, is mixed
with-the deliquescent salt of magnesia, but not wholly ; for
it may be discovered with the non. deliquescent salts, though
these have been separated carefully by spirit                    of wine.         The
tartrite of pot-afli indicates it in both.                Oxalic acid does the
fame thing,         separating a white powder with some crystalline
grains which are the oxalat of manganese.                         (See Bergman,

    After     these salts had been separated there             remained a large
residuum, which was not soluble except in                    a great    quantity      of
water. This has a crystalline form like sulphat offline                      ;  and   of
the usual reagents showed              it,in fact,  to contain both lime and
sulphuric        acid.     But the weight          of this residuum, from              a
gallon of water, was no             less   than 112 grains       : a  larger quan
tity than could be dissolved in               a gallon of water, if it were
pure sulphat of lime.             If    it be considered that the water re
quires some evaporation before these crystals begin to sepa
rate, the proportion is still more increased.                    There must be,
therefore, something peculiar in the composition of the salt,
or in the soluble powers of the water.                       Oilier experiments
show       the same thing.           1.    Sulphuric    acid dropped        into the
water precipitates copiously sulphat of lime.                          This cannot
be     effected      by   the decomposition          of  the niuriat      of lime:
 since      we   have    alreadv      seen    that no such          salt  is to      be
found       (xm).        Indeed it cannot exist in the fame solution
with       sulphat   of   soda, as these salts       decompose         each other*.
8.      Sometimes         a   more unexpected, appearance                 than this
     It  i« astonishing   that this fact should have been neglected           anil that
in recent publications.         Mr. Scbmeisser, in hit analysis of tliewaieisof
kilbum Wells (Phil. Transac), has joined together sulphat of soda,
sul|>hat of magnesia, andmuriat of lime, as being contained in llic-e wa
ters.    Ur. Gurnett    has also pat into the composition       of the sulphur well
at llai  rowgate sulphat     of magnesia    and inuriat ot lime ; an   enor the more
 unaccountable, a* Bergman has evpicssly remarked this decomposition

354              -d"   -Analysis          of two Mineral Springs
takes place.          It    is,      that   a     precipitate, seemingly like the
former, has been made                     by   the addition     of   the muriatic acid              :
but      by   the addition             of more        acid the precipitate           is    redif-
folved.       Sometimes,               indeed        most    commonly,          I    have not
been able to effect this appearance.
    It   was natural to expect the solution                         of   any further           un
common observation in the same matter that had                                          already
explained       so    much.  accordingly digested sulphat of

Ifound that the latter had                  a    very strong solvent power.                    Af
ter the liquor had been filtered, sulphat of lime was plenti
fully precipitated              by   sulphuric acid.           The solution of iron
seems     to have something                 of   a   similar property         ;   but     as   it   is
very small, and            as   iron has almost always a little manganese
united with           it,   it    isat least uncertain whether the whole
effect ought not to he attributed to manganese.
    It   remains to compare this remark with the effects of the
artificial oxygenated              salts;       and thus to confirm,            if confirma
tion were        needed,             the analogy which          I        have     laboured          ts
establish.  4. Sulphat of lime was digested with the oxyge

quantity  of sulphat    of lime was separated.   Muriatic  acid
was dropped into the fame liquor, but      did not separate anyit
thing.        The oxygenated muriat of iron possessed the same
property, but         in    so    small     a   degree, that here again            I    am      in
clined to attribute this power to                      a    little manganese attached
to the iron.     follows from these facts, that the large quan
                     It
tity of sulphat of lime   kept in solution
                                       is      the salt us man -     by

5. Some of the residuum was perfectly edulcorated, and sul

tcid, which             was used         in this experiment,                   was added           some
distilled water,           and the         liquor       was         filtrated:         it was then
saturated with an              alkali;     a   small precipitate sell, which was
proved  (by the usual methods) to contain both manganese
and iron.
    6.     I   have noticed      a    variation (a.) in the effect os muriatic
acid when added to the water.                    I have observed a similar va
riety in the residuum itself;                      which      is,   that sometimes                it   has
been found solubl"               Hi   the muriatic acid              :   when this happens,
the addition of an alkali precipitates                           the residuum              in    its ori
ginal crystalline form               ;   and this      it   docs before the acid                   is   sa
turated.             But most commonly                  the      muriatic             acid does not
diflblve       it    at all.    Further,        it   has been said above                    (vn.        1.)
that the acids precipitate                 a   crystalline substance from oxyge
nated muriat            of iron.         This      substance        I     have found to con
tain manganese.                 But what belongs                    to this place to observe
is,     that    it
                is      not always, indeed             it   is   but rarely, that this ef
fect can be             produced in any great degree                          :   in   a   very small
degree         it   may always be observed             ;    but, when             T   first remarked
it,     the precipitate was               very      copious,             so   that enough was
readily collected for examination                                by   the blow-pipe.                   The
s.ilt    of     manganese        dots       not (how this appearance                              in    the
smallest degree.               It   depends,         therefore, on some peculiarity
of      the iron rust, but precisely                   on what        I       cannot take upon
me to determine.
      As       the oxygenated            falls unite with                all the other salts               of
the water, and consequently                        cannot be separated                      by   spirit of
wine,      I    have     found      it    inipoflible         to determine the quantity
of them.
  I      had concluded from the experiment (1.) that this water
contained             muriat of lime           ;   and the following                   remark eon-
firmed me in my error                 :  I     mention         it,    as  I    think       it   probable
that others have been led into mistakes                                  from the fame cause.

    nearly the whole of the sulphat of lime was separated.                  By
   adding sulphuric acid to this liquor, 20            grains of   sulphat of
   lime were      precipitated.      I concluded, therefore, that this
  must have proceeded from the decomposition of muriatof
  lime   :  in truth, this   sulphat   was dissolved   in  the two ounce-
  measures     of water,    and   was separated by the decomposition
  of the   oxygenated    salt.
                 ON THE WATER OF THE OT.D BATHS.
      The    spring which supplies these baths was discovered in
  1786, in which       year a cold and a warm bath were con
  structed.      Upon finking      the well,   a rock was found at the
 depth     of eighteen feet ; and the water         rises from     about the
 depth     of three feet within the rock.
                    XV. THE GASEOUS FLUIDS.
     I   could obtain very little gas from this water, not more
 than three cubic inches from a gallon.              It was azotic. An
 hepatic smell is perceptible when the water is fresh.                To  the
 hepatic gas, doubtless, it is owing, that no oxygen is found
 in this water or in that of the other spring. Dr. Garnett
 has so well explained the cause        of this circumstance,       that it is
 needless for me to enter upon it.            (See   Dr. G.     on the   Mi
neral Waters of Horrowgate, p. 74, &c.)
            XVI. THE SPONTANEOUS PRECIP.TATK.
     This water    is pellucid when it first rises from the spring ;
111  small quantities     it does not lose its transparency         : a very
small sediment is depolited by boiling,            so small     indeed that
sufficient cannot be collected in this way for examination.
However, when the bath has been newly filled, in some hours
the transparency of this large body of water is destroyed by
exposure to the atmosphere,          and it contracts a whitish colour.
I   collected a large quantity     of this precipitate from      the bottom
of the bath, where it     by degrees accumulates.        l.I first attempt
ed its analysis by acids, but was disappointed. J 1 is hardly soluble
                                                                           in

 in any of the mineral                        acids      :    they ail take up                   a   little of     it,
 make      a      brisk effervescence,                       and excite             heat when first ap
 plied   5     but neither            by     a    long digestion, nor                      by   boiling, could
I   saturate the acids              ;       nor,       by    putting        a   very small quantity                of
the powder into                a    large quantity                 of acid, could             I      completely
dissolve the powder.
    2. But              by   the    use      of    the blow-pipe                    it   readily appeared
that this sediment                      is    no other than the oxydes of the two
metals            so   frequently mentioned, iron and manganese.-                                                 It
may be made magnetic;                               it   gives the hyacinthine colour to
borax           the colour                                     by      continuing the fusion, and
                                    by is
           ;                                destroyed
may be renewing                             removing the globule to                          a    silver spoon     :
fused with soda and nitre                         it   makes           a    blue or      a   green globule.
As the         sediment            may be procured in sufficient quantity,                                      I
repeated            the last experiment on                         a       larger    scale      :    some nitre
being mixed with                    it,     the mass was pulverized, and fused                                  in a
crucible; when                 taken out               of the       sire    it   was green, and dis
solved         in water,           to which also                  it   imparted          a   fine green co
lour   :     in     a   day    or two         a    yellow ochre was deposited,                             when
the solution became                         blue   ;    from this liquor                     a   powder sub
sided      by     exposure to the air, which was manganese.                                                 (See
Scheele's Essay on Mang. xxxvi. B.)
    3.     Pursuing the observations                              of    the effects          of   the mineral
acids confirms this conclusion.                                   I     mixed some of the                   sedi
ment with powdered                          charcoal, and exposed the mixture to                                   a
strong red heat                :   it   became               of   a    light brown colour, and
now proved to be readily soluble                                       in    all the mineral acidi.
(See Scheele's Ess.ty on                           Manganese, xxxviii.                           A.)       With
the muriatic              and       nitric        it   formed          a     gelatinous compound.
The sulphuric acid, diluted,                                 was soon saturated                 ;    the liquor
was evaporated,                 and         deposited             white crystals,                the form        of
which          is      rhomboidal.                This        is   a        triple salt,          the base       of
which      is     iron and manganese.                          If      there be       a      small excess        of

     All       the appearances                which          demonstrate              the existence         of
peculiar metallic salts in the waters                                   of       the new baths are also
to he found in this                  ;   as, the oxvdation and solution                       of metal*
and       a   copious precipitate                  by galls, while the                 prufliat of pot
ash       is not affected                (iv.):        and        the fame           experiments were
repeated to show the presence                                of   the oxygenated             salts   of iron
and manganese (v. vn. &c.) with the fame result, and au
thorize the same conclusions. Still I believe there is some
diff. rence              in regard to these salts between                              the two waters.
1.    I   have already observed                        (xvn.)          two points of distinction ;
and,          as the second              of   those experiments is probably an in
dication of sulphur, this water seems                                        t     be without it.         This
is confirmed by evaporating                                 the water in a silver vessel,                   to
 which          it communicates no stain.                                However,           2. Its action
 en copper is very strong,                             so   that,      if it      be boiled in a copper
 vess-1         for      a     long time,          a   blue oxyd of copper is separated
 from the                vessel.     But here, again, there is                         a disscrence be
 tween this and the former water ; for, though copper is dis
 solved in               it,   none can be precipitated on iron                            in   its metallic
 form,         as w<:          have seen          (iv.      1).     The iron          in   this water docs
 not          seem       to be      in   that high degree                of oxvgenatiou              that   it
                                                                                                            is
 in   the other.                This     1   infer, because,             3.      the precipitate formed
  by      tincture of fall*                  is   of   a    much darker colour,                 even when
 thf      water has been much evaporated                                     :    sometimes,      when the
 water has been reduced to half its original bulk,                                               1   have re
 marked even                    a   very      slight green               tinge communicated                  by
 prudiat of pot-ash, but not till                                 it   has been added to             it   many

   As   the oxygenated         salts arc formed        by the action      of  hepa
tic gas on the metals,           it cannot        be   doubted      that they are
very common.            Bergman (Dissert. Tti. 6.) observes, "that
cold martial waters, when fresh, almost always have an he
patic    smell   :"   it seems very probable then that this salt of
iron   may be found in almost all such waters,                        f doubt not
that it has been frequently mistaken fur inuii.it                      of lime, to
which in     its properties       it approaches       very nearly.
   Though      I  have purposely avoided all medical discussion in
this  essay,  I  cannot abstain from bestowing                a moment's con
sideration    on one very obvious question.                   What, it will      be
asked, are the medical properties              of   manganese     ?  Is it useful   ?
Is it innocent?          Is it noxious?         That    it is innoxious      I cer
tainly know.         Dr. John Johnstone              (Essay on    Mineral Poi
sons,   page 134.) has shown              that     it may be taken iu large
doses without       injury   ;  and he has informed me, that he has
since confirmed the fame fact frequently.                     I wish    I could   as
well answer the first question            ;  but what the medical virtues
of this   substance may be, is a subject which still remains                      in
a great measure         unexplored.         It  is certainly well worth the
attention of men of science.                To   those who are inclined           to
labour in this field I take have to suggest, that they should
use cither the carbonator some other salt of manganese : the-
hlaek oxyde,       I apprehend, must be hardly soluble in the hu
man fluids.
                    XIX. THE NEUTRAL SALTS.
   These are the same           as  of the other water, but in different
quantities.       The gallon contains of muriatof magnesia                      58  j
  muriat     us  soda 330 ; lulphal of soda 62 grains.
                          XX. THE RESIDUUM.
    A  still larger residuum         is obtained, alter the separation             of
 the neutral     salti, from this than from the other water.                    The
 gallon leaves 146 grains.              Its properties are the fame as             of
 that already described           (xtv).

 EttraS o/a Utter from Dr. Hotels,                         dated Sept. 2$tb, 1797.
     "   In the analysis of the waters of the new baths                          I have
 conjecture'! that the decomposition of oxygenated muriat of
 mercury is occasioned by a minute portion of sulphur, at
 tached to some os the substances dissolved in the water (1 11.).
 J  have attempted              to verify this conjecture,          and not without
 fuei ess.        Wishing         to collect some quantity         of the precipitate,
 I  evaporated          a  gallon of the water         tohalsits bulk; but found,
 that now the salt of mercury was dissolved without decompo
 sition.       I added, therefore, the salt to the water without
 boiling;       and        suffered     the   precipitate    to    subside.     By this
 process,       I could collect no             more than a grain from a gallon
 of   water.          I   threw this upon alkali heated to redness;                  but
                                                                                     the

the whole instantly evaporated with                          a dense smoke.             I   mixed,
therefore, another portion (procured in the same manner)
with alkali, and heated them in a crucible : still I failed to
colled        any sulphur from the alkali (as                      I    had hoped) ; but               I
now perceived that, as the crucible became hot, the matter
burnt away with a blue flame, as sulphur does.
     *'
          Sulphat of argill is not decomposed by this water when
it   has been         reduced       by evaporation : however, it gradually
separates some              of the abundant               sulphat       of lime     ;    which is
probably caused by its attracting the water which held it in
solution.
     "I       think it right here to observe,                          that   I   have recently
met with this water in such                     a   condition that it caused                 a   per
manent decomposition of sulphat of argill.                                    This precipitate
is extremely minute                 :     I    have      not as yet determined the
cause      of   it,   but
                        I    suspect      it   to be carbonat            of magnesia."

X HAVE                already mown                 in   my      first   memoir*             on    the
red lead         of Siberia,            that    this mineral             contains        a   parti
cular metal, which            I     promised            to examine with more atten
tion.         The Council           of Mines having furnished                        me with       a
pretty large quantity of the red lead, considering its scarcity,
I    have been able           to make          a   series    of experiments sufficient
to determine its principal properties,                          of which    shall now
                                                                                  I
give an account;              but   it   will   first be necessary to recapitulate,
in   a    few word?, the substance of my former memoir, in order
that what       I      have to say at present may be rendered                                    more
intelligible.
     I.   I   shall observe, that on               boiling      the red lead reduced to
a    powder with two parts of the carbonat of pot-ash, the                                       sead

  combined itself with the acid of the carbonat             ; and    that the
  alkali wot afterwards        united with a particular acid,          which
 gave it an orange-yellow             colour, and the property of        pro
 ducing crystals of the fame colour.
     a. That this hew combination was decomposed by mineral
 acids ; and that on causing the liquor, in which the decom
 position had been effected, to evaporate, there was obtained,
 on the one hand, the salt formed by the mineral acid which
  had been added        ; and on the other, the acid      of  the red lead,
 under the form of elongated prisms of a ruby colour.
     3. That the combination of the acid of the red lead with
 pot-ash formed, with thenitrat of mercury, a precipitate of a
 cinnabar red colour; with the nitrat of lead, an orange-yet-
 low   sediment     ; with the nitrat of copper,       a precipitate     of  a
chestnut-red, &c.
     4. That this acid alone became green by the contact of
light, by a solution of tin and of the greater part of metals.
    5. That the fame acid, either free or in a state of combi
nation, combined itself with borax, microcosmic salt, and
glass   ;  and communicated to them a beautiful emerald-green
colour.
    Such, in      a few   words, are the principal properties         of the
acid     of  the new metal        contained in the red lead,          as  an
nounced        in   my first memoir.           I (lull now      proceed     to
examine the other characterizing              marks of this substance ;
and shall enlarge chiefly on thole which ought to make us
consider      it as    a  particular     metal,  and    on   those     which
distinguish it from other bodies of the fame class.
             Ex p. I. Atlion us Acids        on the Tied   Lead.
    If   one   part of the muriatic         acid, mixed with       as  much
water, be poured over the red lead, reduced to powder, there
will   be formed muriat         of   lead, which   deposits    itself under
the form      of white     crystals,   and  the liquor    assumes a very
beautiful orange colour.
                                                                           In

                       in the Red Lead of Siberia.                           363
    In  this operation the muriatic acid, as is evident, com
bines with it in virtue of           a greater   affinity to the lead, from
which it    separates the natural acid,          which it then     dissolved    in
the water of the muriatic acid.                When     suitable proportions
os the acid, water, and lead have been employed, is the liquor
be    evaporated      by a gentle heat and without the contact                   of
light, you may obtain crystals of the acid of a ruby red
colour.       But if too great a quantity of the acid be used,
or an acid too much concentrated                 ;  and, above all,       if heat
 has been       employed in the process             ;  instead  of   a red acid
 you will obtain          a   dark green liquor, which is then           a  com
 bination     of the oxyde of           the   new metal      with the muri
 atic acid.      It will     be seen    hereafter   what are the causes          of
these     essential       differences: at present         it  is sufficient      to
 mention them.
     The sulphuric        acid decomposes       also the red lead, by laying
 hold    of  the oxyde ; but          I did not employ it       to extract the
 acid, because,       if  ever so little a quantity more than is neces
 sary be added,        it is very difficult to separate it.
     The nitric acid does not produce any change in the nature
 of the red lead, only that when aided by the action of heat
 it effects its solution ; but on cooling, the greater part of the
  red lead separates itself with all its properties.
          Exp. II.           Action  of Alkalies    on the Red     Lead.
      Caustic alkalies do not seem to decompose the red lead,
  for they dissolve it entirely, and form with a kind of triple
  combination       ;   the properties       of which I did not examine
   minutely.
      Alkaline carbonats, on             the contrary,      decompose      the red
   lead completely         ;   and   there is formed, on the one             hand,
   carbonat of lead         ; and  on the other,      a soluble   salt composed
   of the metallic acid and of                the base   of the carbonat       em
    ployed.
      The   salts formed by this acid          with alkalies crystallize into
   prisms,   or  into    laminae    of  a  golden yellow colour, the forms
                                                                                  of

of which     I have not been able lo determine accurately,                on
 account of the small quantity        I could make.
    These salts have a flight metallic       taste :    they dissolve  with
effervescence, and assume        a green   colour     :  they are decom
posed by acids and alkaline earths,           which form orange yel
low precipitates.
  Exp.    III.    Aclion   of Acids   on the  Acid of the Red Lead.
    Among the mineral acids,           the muriatic        is the only one
which acts in a remarkable manner on that of the red lead.
Indeed, whether the red lead be distilled, or its acid with the
muriatic acid     a little concentrated, there is soon disengaged
oxygenated      muriatic     acid, and     the liquor assumes a very
beautiful green colour.         The cause of this may be readily
conceived : the muriatic acid takes from that of the lead a
part of its oxygen, and reduces it to the state of a green
oxyde, which is held in solution by another portion of the
muriatic acid.
    As this experiment announced          to me that the oxygen docs
not adhere     strongly    to that metal,      I   was desirous to know
whether its acid mixed with the muriatic acid would dissolve
gold:   I  therefore    put into this mixture        a piece   of gold leaf,
which   was dissolved in a little time by the help of a gentle
neat,  and the solution had a yellowish- green colour.                 This
acid then produces the fame effect          as the   nitric acid in aqua-
regia, in regard to the solution of gold.
    The sulphuric acid, cold,      produces noessect upon this acid;
but when warmed it makes it assume               a  blueish green colour,
by favouring, no doubt, the disengagement                   of a portion of
its oxygen, as it does in regard to the oxyde of manganese
and the acids of tungsten and molybdena.
    The sulphurous acid       lays hold    of  a part     of the oxygen   of
 this acid, becomes sulphuric acid, and reduces                 that of  the
iead to the state   of  an oxyde,    which it dissolves.
                                                                      Exp.

                                 in the Red Lead            of Siberia.                          365

     Ex    P.     IV.        Reduclion of the Oxjde                of the Red Lead.
     An experiment which could not but excite my curiosity
was, to know                 whether the aoid of the red lead, treated in                             ft
suitable manner, could be reduced to                               a   metallic state.           For
this purpose I put 72.                    parts of this acid,
                                          extracted by the
muriatic acid in the manner before mentioned, into a cruci
ble of charcoal, which                    I   placed in another crucible                   of earth
filled with charcoal dust.                        Having     then heated         it for half an
hour in           a forge sire,      I   found in the charcoal crucible a me
tallic mass of a whitish gray colour, in the form of needles
interwoven through each other, and which weighed 24 parts.
The result of this operation fliows that the acid of the red
lead contains               a large       quantity of oxygen,                since    of   72 parts
employed, 24 only,                   which make one third,                    were converted
into metal.
                           Ex P. V.        Properties       of the Metal.
     The      small         masses   with which         I    was obliged to make my
experiments did not allow me to discover                                 a great      number of
properties in this metal.                          The few, however, which                   1   ob
served are sufficient to characterize                            it,   and to induce me            to
                       particular place among the metallic substances.

powder, which at first wa» green.
                                                                                                 This

 $66                                  On the Metal contained
   This powder is acid ; dissoves in water; combines itself
 with alkalies, from which it disengages the carbonic acid
and precipitates metallic solutions, exactly with the                                          fame
phenomena            as the acid             of   the natural red lead.              It    therefore
appears to me, beyond a doubt, that                                  I   have      made here,     in
every respect, the particular acid, such as                        it           exists in the red
lead   of which it forms                   one     of the elements.
   My experiments,                     and the phenomena they gave rife to, as
mentioned in this memoir, authorize me to consider the sub
stance which mineralizes the lead in the red lead                                         of Siberia
not only      as a     metal, but             as a      particular metal, which,               with
the general properties                     of the      metals already known,               possesses
very distinct characterizing                           marks that belong to no other.
What metallic              substance, indeed, is there,                   which, converting
itself into an acid of                 a    ruby red colour, has the property,            in
that state, of becoming green by the light, by caloric and
metallic substances, and of precipitating the nitrate of mer
cury of a cinnabar red colour; lead of an orange yellow
colour; nitrat of copper of a chestnut red colour ; of dissolv
ing gold conjointly with the muriatic acid ; of precipitating
the tanning principle of a brown colour, and alkaline
prusliats green            ?    Without doubt              there is none.
  On account                   of     these       properties,    and       by the advice          of
Cit. Fourcroy          and    Hauy, I propose to call this metal ebrime,
which signifies            colour; because its combinations are, indeed,
all more or         less       coloured.           I   however must confess that this
appellation          is not suited to the metal itself, since it has no
particular colour                ; and        that besides, each                metal has one
peculiar to itself, more or less different. I am not, there
fore, attached to this name more than to any other that may
be given      it,   provided           it    express any        of   its most striking and
most characteristic qualities.
  The    brittleness             aud infusibility         of this    metal do not give nt
reason   to   think            that   it    can be applied to very many useful
purposes   ;    but we may                    still hope that,           if   it   can be round
hereafter in larger quantities,                          the combinations            of its acid
                                                                                               with

                        f« Ibe Red Lead osS'tbtria.                                  %6"l
with metallic oxydes, and of its oxyde with vitreous sub
stances, will furnish very beautiful and durable colours for
ihe art of painting and enamelling.    This hope appears to
me so much better founded, as                   I   have already discovered           the
oxyde of this metal in the emerald, in which it forms the
colouring principle.  I have also found it in the matrix of
the red lead,        in the     state   of   a green oxyde combined with
the lead      ; and     I   have    no doubt that it may be found in
many other combinations,                 when minerals shall be examined
with more         care than they have hitherto been.
   It   results i hen that chrome is a peculiar metal before un
known        ; that this metal, infusible and crystailizable, has little
affinity with oxygen, from which it derives however two
thirds of its weight; that this acid of a red colour dissolves
in water         and combines with alkalies, earths aud metal?,                         to
which it communicates different colonrs,                           but more or left
analogous to its own ; that it readily loses a part of its oxygen
either by light, caloric, or the contact of certain metals, and
 the greater part       of combustible         substances, by pasting through
all     these circumstances to the state               of      a green   oxyde   ;    and
 hence it is that this acid, and all its combinations, yield, by
 heat,  certain quantity of oxygen, and communicate to glass
         a
 a beautiful green colour.

communicate my ideas on the subject, and to give others an
opportunity of examining                             it further, and            of      perhaps    pro
ducing some thing that may be better calculated                                         to answer the
intended purpose.                  It    is,   indeed, much to be wished, that an
accurate hygrometer could be invented                                  ;   as   it   may be readily
conceived that such an instrument would be of the utmost uti
lity, not only to naturalists, but also to farmers and other».
   The most common hygrometer, known under the name of
a    weather-house, founded on the property of several twisted
                              is
substances to untwist themselves in   moist atmosphere, and        a
then      to twist themselves               back when the weather                        is   dry. The
substances chiefly employed are                           cat-gut; and, when                   required
on   a   large scale, hempen ropes. Cassebois,a Benedictine monk
at   Metz,       proposed another hygrometer, which consists                                      of the
gut of    a   silk-worm.           When that                  insect   is   ready to spin, there
are found         in    it   two        vessels      proceeding from the head to the
stomach, to which they adhere, and then bend towards the
back, where they form   great many folds. The part of these
                                          a
vessels    next the stomach                    is   of   a   cylindric       form, and about             a
line     in   diameter.            These            vessels    contain          a   gummy sort of
matter from             which           the worm spins its silk                     ;    and, though
they are exceedingly tender, means have been devised to ex
tract them from the insect and to prepare them for the above
purpose.          When the worm                      is   about to spin,         it     is   thrown in
to vinegar, and suffered to remain                                 there twenty-sour hours,
during which time the vinegar                                is   absorbed          into the body     of
the insect,        and coagulates                 its juices.          The worm being then
epened,       both the         vessels,        which          have now acquired strength,
are extracted          ;     and, on account of their pliability, are ca
pable     of considerable               extension.                That they          may not, how*
ever, become too weak, theyare stretched only to the length
of about         fifteen or twenty                   inches.        It     is   obvious that they
must be kept sufficiently                       extended           till they         are completely
dry.       Before they attain to that state they must be freed,                                          by
means       of   the,   nail of the singer, from                    a   slimy substance which

weight which certain bodies acquire by the moisture                    they

in  regard to drought and moisture.
   Mr. Lowitz found at Dmitricwssk in Astracan,on               the banks
of the Wolga,      a thin blucisti kind of slate which           attracted
moisture remarkably soon, but again             suffered   it  as soon   to
escape.    A  plate of this slate weighed, when brought to a red
heat, 175 grains, and, when saturated wiih water, 247 : it
 had therefore imbibed, between complete dryness and the
 point of complete moisture, 72 grains of water. Lowitz sus
pended a round thin plate of this slate at the end of a very
delicate bajance,     fastened within      a wooden frame, and sus
pended at the     other arm    a   chain of silver wire,       the end    of
which    was made      fast to a   sliding nut that moved up and
down in a small groove on the edge of one side of the frame.
 He determined, by trial, the position of the nut when the
balance was in cq'iilibrio       and    when it had ten degrees of
over- weight, and divided the space between these two points
 into ten equal parts, adding such a number more of these
 parts as might be necessary.         When    the (lone was suspended
 from the one arm os the balance, and at the other                a Weight
 equal to   175 grains, or the weight of the stone when per
 fectly dry, the nut in the groove (h.wrd the ixcess of weight
 in grains when it and the chain were so adjusted that the
 balance   stood  in equihbrio.       A  particular apparatus on the

excess    of weight          to ten parts   of   a   grain.       Lowitz remarked
that this hygrometer in continued wet weather gave a mois
ture     of more      than 55 grains, and in a continued heat                       of   j 13
degrees of Fahrenheit only                il
                              degree of moillure.
    In my opinion, it would not be necessary, in order                             to con
struct     such a hygrometer, to procure argillaceous (late from
Astracan,        as several       other argillaceous kinds of slate, as well
as stones and         other substances,          possess   in an equal degree the
fame property.               If   a   person, for example, presses with the
finger on     a   marble slab,          a gray free-stone         or a piece of glass,
it will immediately attract                 the insensible         perspiration, and
become tarnislied.
    The hygrometer thus                  invented     by Lowitz was however
attended with this fuult, that it never threw                           off the moisture
in the fame degree                as the atmosphere        became drier.            It was
also sometimes              very deceitful, and announced moisture when
it ought to have indicated that dryness had again begun to
take place in the atmosphere. To avoid these inconveniences
I   would propose the following method                        :
    1.    Take    a   squire bar of       steel about      two lines in thickness,
and from ten to twelve inches in length, and form it into a
kind of balance, one arm of which ends in                              a screw.    On this
screw let there be screwed a leaden bullet                        of   a   proper weight,
instead     of   the common weights that arc suspended.
   a. Takeaglass plate about ten inches long and seven inches
in breadth, destroy its polisli on both sides, free it from all
moisture by rubbing it over with warm ashes, suspend it at
the other end of the balance, and bring the balance into
equilibrium by screwing up or down the leaden bullet.
    3. Mark now the                   place to which          the leaden          bullet is
brought by the screw,                 as accurately    as possible,          for the point
of the     greatest dryness.
   4. Then take away the glass-plate from the balance, dip
it completely in water, give it a shake that the drops may
ruu off from          it,   and wipe them carefully from the edge.
                                                                                  5- Apply

lance, and bring the latter into equilibrium by screwing the
 kaden bullet.                 Mark then         the place              at which         the bullet
 stands, as the              hijiliest degree of moisture.                                                  «

 well-dried woodsufficiently large to suffer the glass-plate to
                                %
move up and down.   An opening must be made in the lid,
exactly           of such a     size as to allow the tongue                    of   the balance         to
move freely.                 Parallel to the tongue apply                  a graduated            circle,
divided into   number of degrees at pleasure from the highest
                        a
point of dryness to the highest degree of moisture. The box
 must be pierced               with small     holes on all the four sides, to give
a free pallitge to the air ; and to prevent moisture from pene
trating into the wood by rain, when it may be requisite to ex
pose it at a window, it must either be lackered or painted.
To        it at all times from rain, it maybe covered, however,
        save
 with a fort of roof fitted to it in the most convenient manner.
But all these external appendages                            may be improved or al

VII.    Method employed in Spain for making the Alcarrazas,
     vrVeffels used then for cooling Water. By Cir.LASTEYiuB.

XXLCARRAZAS                           are a kind         of     vessels     used      in Spain for
cooling water intended                  for drinking.                 As they          are exceed
ingly porous, the water oozes through                                      them on all sides;
the air which comes in contact with                               it,   by     making        it   evapo
rate, carries            off the caloric contained                    in   the water in the
vessel, and             by   these   means      renders          it     remarkably cool                 t.

These vessels, which are               of"   different forms       and sizes,      a*e
manufactured in various parts                   of Spain,    and arc generally       of
a grayish white colour.                 The     most celebrated       place for   this
species       of pottery and that from which all the vessels of this
kind used at Madrid are brought, is Anduxar in Andalusia.
The       earth    employed for making them is procured on                         the
banks of a rivulet called Tamusoro, which is situated at                           the
distance        of a quarter of a      league from the above town.
¦
      The    use  of  these vases was introduced into Spain                   by the
 Arabs.         They   are still used in Egypt, as well as in different
parts of        Africa;     and are known in the East Indies,                  Syria,
Persia, China, and other parts                   of Asia.
      It  is astonishing that these vases were never introduced                     by
the Arabs into Sicily.                  I   never    saw any     of them in any
 part of that island.               This singular fact          proves,    that the
¦simplest       and   most      beneficial usages are rarely imitated bv
 tvitrs, the congelation        o( water     enclosed   in a small glass ball covered
 with    a  cloth dipped in ether, care being taken to renew it in propor
 tion    as it evaporates.     It is well known that coldness may be efl'ccted
 by liquors much       less volatjc than ether,        either by exposing the va*c,
 the surface     of which    has  been moistened with them, to a current of
.air, or by swinging it round         a point of suspension,    which by movipg it
 through the air serves to favour the solution of the vapour in the at
 mosphere.         From these principles it will be readily conceived on w lut
 depends       the property of the alcarrazas above mentioned.              On bring
 exposed to the open air, or rather to a current              of air, the water they
 contain becomes cool in          a  little time, and to such a sensible degree,
  that in summer,       when the thermometer          stood at pM° F. in    the shade,
 at Madrid, the water has been known to descend to the temperature                   (,f
 water preserved a considerable           time in a cellar.   These vases, however,
 cannot belong used, unless care be taken to fdl them only with vejy
 pure water, and such as is little charged with the sulphas of lime
  (selenite).      Turbid    water soon       closes up the pores even     of filtering
  paper ; and the same effect        will be produced by water that holds in so
  lution sulphat of lime, because the water abandons it in proportion as
   it unites with the air in a state of vapour.           To open the po es, closed
   up by earthy salts, it will bv sufficient to keep these         vases for some mo
   ments in boding water.          Edit.

       I hough France       is   so near to    Spain, and though there has
  always been great          intercourse      between    these two countries,
 no traveller has ever yet given an account                of the   process enir
 ployed in the fabrication of the above                vases.    L he iutroduc*
 tion of them into France would, in my opinion, be attended'
 with great advantage            ;  for, besides the pleasure of drinking
 cool water during the great heats, we ought to take into
 consideration the           benefit      that would arise from them           in
 regard       to the health.         I  have,   therefore,    procured correct
 information         respecting    the manner in which these vases are
 made in Spain ; and             I have brought alcarrazas         to France, as
 well    as the earth      employed in the fabrication of them.
     Cit. Darcet was desirous of analyzing                   this white marly
earth      ;  and, by employing all the precision neccsiary for that
 purpose,       he found that 100 grains          of it contained 60 of c al-
eareous earth mixed with alumine and a little oxyd                       of iron
difficult       to  be   dissolved,      and    36$   of  siliceous   earth  also
mixed with alumine and the fame                      oxyd   *.   The quantity
of iron       may be estimated at almost a grain.               The process for
fabricating the alcarrazas is very simple;                  and, as the earth
employed abounds in France, it will be easy, by the method
which        I   shall explain,      to establish    manufactories       of this
kind     ;   the expenses     of which will      be trifling,   and the profits
certain,       if the  public do not refuse lo adopt a useful practice.
    The preparation given              to   the earth may be reduced           to
three principal operations.
     1// Preparation.         Suppose      it were necessary to manufac
ture 150 pounds of earth : after it has been dried, and divided
into portions of the size of a walnut, it is macerated in a
bason or tub, by proceeding in the following                    manner    : The

"workman takes three or four celemins of earth *,                                        which are
spread out equally in the bason, and water is poured                                        over     it;
he then             throws in three or four celemins more                                 of earth,
which          are watered         as before ; and                this operation is repeated
until        the tub be sufficiently                     full.      In pouring on           the     last
water, care is taken not to add more than may be neceffarjr
to cover the whole mass.                              The   earth is suffered to remain              in
this     state      for twelve hours              ;    after      which     it is worked          and
 kneaded with the hands, in the tub, until it is                                        reduced     to
'the consistence of a tough paste.   The earth                                          is then     de»
posited on a smooth                  platform covered with brick, kept ex
ceedingly clean,                  and over which is strewed a little sifted
ashes.           It   is formed into a cake about six inches in thick
ness, which is smoothed                       on the surface as well as at the side?.
It   is left in that state until it begins to crack                             ;     after which    it
is freed from the                ashes       adhering to           it,   and removed        to ano
ther tiled place made exceedingly                                clean.
     2   d   Preparation.             To this           earth     the workman adds seven
pounds of             sea salt,   if   he wisties to        maktjarras, and only the
half     if    it   is   destined for the             fabrication of totifas or cantarot.
This difference                 arises from the greater                   or   less    capacity     in
tended to be given to the vases.                                  The    larger the vase      is,   its
fides must be              so   much thicker                in   order that    it   may have the
necessary degree                 of    strength        ;    but the earth, at the fame
time, must be more porous, otherwise the water would not
filter through with                   ease   ;    and, for this reason, the workman
adds       a   greater       quantity            of    salt when          he wishes        to make
jarras, which are much larger than the botisas and cantarot.
 The earth   kneaded with the feet, adding the salt gradually
                      is                                                                            ;
and this labour              is   repeated, at least three times, without the
necessity        of adding         more water, as the moisture retained                             by
the earth           is   sufficient.
     3</     Preparation.             The earth,            after being subjected to these
different preparations,                  is      fit to be applied to the lath.                   The

                                                                                                  man

 man who is employed for this work ought to knead it well
 with his hands, taking care to extract the stones, even the
 smallest     which      he may meet with,             as  well   as every      other
 foreign body.          He then forms it into lumps, which                     he ap
 plies to the lath to be made into vases or jars.
    The alcarrazas         may be baked in any kind              of   furnace used
 by potters.         Those employed in Spain are eighteen feet
 square in the inside          ; and live sect three inches in height.
The    flame enters by a hole, one foot four inches in diameter,
 situated      in  the    centre.        Such   a furnace will contain            800
 pieces    of different       sizes,    including $oo jarras.            Pottery of
 much greater strength than the alcarrazas may be baked in
the fame furnace,           if  care be taken       to keep     up     the   fire   for
one or two hours longer.                  The alcarrazas, which require to
be    half baked, runan there ten or twelve                      hours, accord
ing to the temperature                of   the   air, or the greater          or   less
quantity of fuel employed.
    Processes different from that which                 I have here described,
arc pursued in some of the potteries in Spain                      ;   but they all
depend on the fame principles                      After the earth has been
pounded, it is suffered to macerate in                  a tub for    twenty-four
hours    ;   the whole       is   stirred    round with a stick, and it is
freed from the straws or other foreign bodies                        that float on
the surface. The stones and coarser parts                   of  the earth fall to
the bottom        of the veslt I, and the finer is drawn             off by a hole
four inches above it.            The    earth is then left to dry to a certain
degree requisite       ;   and    it is afterwards        deposited     in   a moist
place, to be employed            as may be       found necessary.          In other
manufactories, the earth, when dry, is ground below                        a  roller ;
after which it is sifted,           and, the proper quantity of salt and
water being added,            it is then kneaded.           The proportion of
fall is not every where the fame.                   In  Come places       the fame
quantity of earth requires             a  half less  of fall.    Care is always
taken      to choose       earth of a proper quality,              without       ever
having occasion to add to it               a  mixture of saud.           The    same
earth is employed           also for common            pottery ; the only         dif-

for several hours to              a   current of air, in order that the eva

                        III.     Number        of   primitive Forms.
I    N   the examples            before mentioned     paral-I      have chosen         a
lelopipedon for nucleus, on account of the simplicity of it*
form.     have hitherto found that all the primitive forms
             I
may be reduced to six, viz. the parallelopipedon, general,                        in
which comprehends the cube,' the rhomboid, and all the
                                                                                            solids.

                      Theory of Crystallization.                      377
solids, terminated by six faces parallel two and two ; the
regular tetraedron     ; the octaedron with triangular faces        ;  the
hexagonal prism ; the dodecaedron           with rhomboidal planes j
and the dodecaedron        with   isosceles triangular planes.
   Among these forms, there are some found as nucleus,
which have the measure of their angles different in different
kinds of minerals.        This will appear less surprising when
we consider that these nuclei are composed              in the first in
stance  of elementary moleculæ, and that it is possible tha
fame   form of nucleus may be produced in one kind by ele
ments of    a  certain nature, and in another kind by different
elements ;     as  we see integral      moleculæ, some cubic          and
others tetraedral,    produce similar secondary forms, in conse
quence of different laws of decrement.              But, it is worthy
of remark, that all the forms, hitherto met with as nuclei^
in the different species, are among the number of those
which    have a particular       character    of perfection    and     re
gularity,   as the cube, the         regular octaedron, the regular
tetraedron, and the dodecaedron with equal and similar rhom-
buses for its planes.        These    forms are a sort of limits at
which nature arrives by different routes, while each of the
forms, placed between these limits, seems to be attached to-
one   unique kind, at      least as far as can be judged         by the
present state   of our knowledge on this        subject.
               IV.  Ports* of the integral Moltcula.
   The primitive form        is that obtained by sections made          on
all the similar parts of     the secondary crystal    j  and these sec
tions, continued parallel to themselves, conduct to a determi
nation of the form of the integral moleculæ,              of which the
whole crystal is an assemblage.           This  requires certain con
siderations   that relate to the most delicate point of the theory,
which    I  shall now explain        with  as  much precision     as the
narrow limits to which         I am obliged to confine myself will
allow.
                                                                  There

  378                       Theory es Crj-Jlallization.
      There is no crystal from which              a  nucleus in the form          of a
 parallelopipedon may not be extracted,                     if  we confine       our-
 selves to six sections parallel two and two.                     In   a  multitude
of     substances     this    paralleopipedon is the last term                of the
 mechanical        division,     and     consequently        the    real    nucleus.
 But    there are certain minerals where this paralleopipedon is
 divisible,   as  well as the     rest  of  the crystal,    by further sections
 made in the different directions of the faces ; and there
 thence necessarily          results   a  new solid, which             will   be the
nucleus,       if  all the parts       of  the secondary          crystal, super-
added      to   this nucleus, are similarly situated.                   When       the
mechanical division conducts to                a parallelopipedon, divisible
only by sections           parallel to its six faces, the moleculæ                 are-
parallelopipedons similar to the nucleus                  ;   but, in all other
cafes,    their form differs from that of the nucleus.                        This   I
shall illustrate      by an example.
     Let aebsno           {fig. 60.) be a cube having two                of its solid
angles a, s, situated on the same vertical line. This line will
be the axis       of   the cube ; and the points a and                s  will  be its
summits. Suppose this cube to be divisible by sections, each
of which,       such as a b n, passes through one                of  the summits
c,   and by two oblique diagonals a b, a n, contiguous to this
summit.        This     section   will  detach the solid angle /          j  and as
there are six solid angles, situated laterally, via. *, b, c,                r, o,  n,
the six sections will produce an acute rhomboid, the summits
of which will        be confounded        with   those os the cube.          Figure
6  1  represents this rhomboid existing in the cube, in such a
manner that its          six lateral   solid angles b,      d,f} p, g, t, cor
respond to the        middle of the faces ac b i, c r s b,b in s, &c.
of    the cube.       But geometry shows that each of the angles,
at the summits          b a  g, d sf,     p  sf, ice. of       the acute rhom
boid, are equal to 6o°, from which                it follows that       the lateral
angles    a  if,   a  gf,   Sec. arc equal to       iao  degrees.
     Besides,   it  is proved by theory, that the cube results from
a decrement          which     take place by a single            range    of   small
                                                                      rhomboids-,

rhomboids,            similar to the acute rhomboid, on the                                          six   ob
lique ridges a          b,a g,          a,-,    s   d,   sf,    s    p.       This   decrement             pro-
duces two faces, one on each side                                    of    each     of    these ridges,
which      makes in all twelve faces.                       But           as the   two faces, which
have the fame ridge for their line                               of departure,               are on the
fame plane by the nature                        of the decrement,                    the twelve faces
will   be reduced             to six, which                are squares ; so that the                         se
condary solid is a cube.                        This       result is analogous                  to that       of
the    very obtuse calcareous                       spar before mentioned.
     Let     us now suppose that the cube                                  {Jig. 60.) admits, in
regard to its summits a, s, two new divisions similar to the
preceding fix, that is to fay, one of which                                           passes      through
the points c, i,         0, and            the other through the points                              />,   n, r.
The     first    will   pass also through the points                                 b,   g, t,     and the
second through the points                           d,f,       />,   {fig. 61 and 62.)                of    the
rhomboid         ;    from         which        it    follows that these two divisions
will   detach each           a    regulartetraedron                  bageordsfp {Jig. 62.),
so that the rhomboid                    will    be found converted                       into   a    regular
octaedron         ej {fig.            63   ),   which will                 be the real nucleus               of
the cube     ;       since    it   is   produced           by        divisions similarly made,
in   regard to the eight solid angles                            of the cube.
     If we      suppose the fame cube to be divisible, throughout its
whole extent,                by
                            analogous t* the preceding,
                                  sections                                                                 it

clear that eachof the small rhomboids of which        the as                               it   is
semblage, will be sound, in  like manner, subdivided into an
octaedron, with two regular telraedra applied on the two
                                                         op
posite faces of the octaedron.
     By taking        the octaedron          for nucleus, we may construct
around this nucleus                 a   cube         by
                                                regular subtractions of small
complete rhomboids.                     For example,     we                if        suppose decre
ments      by   a    single       range  of these rhomboids,                             having        h    for
their point         of departure,              and made
                                        direction parallel to        in   a
the inferior edges        g, de, df, of the four triangles,
                                  gf,      e
which unite to form the solid angle    there will result four         b,
faces, which will be found on level, and, like the octaedron
                                                      a
with     six solid       angles, similar decrements                                around the other
                                                                                                           five

 five  angles    will produce twenty faces, which, taken four
 »nd four, will be equally on a level, which will make, in
 the whole, fix distinct faces, situated as those of the cube
 (Jig. 60.)  ; so that the result    will  be precisely the same as     in
 the cafe of the rhomboid considered          as  nucleus.
    In whatever manner         we proceed      to subdivide     either the
eobe, the rhombus,        or the octaedron, we (hall always have
solids  of two forms,     that is to fay, octaedra and tetraedra,
without ever being able to reduce the result of the division tp
unity.     But the moleculæ of a crystal being necessarily simi
lar, it  appeared to me probable that the structure              was as  it
were interspersed     with  a  multitude of small vacuities, occu
pied either by the water of crystallization or by some other
substance ; so that,     if it  were possible to carry the division to
its limits, one of    the two kinds      of  solids in question would
disappear,    and the whole crystal would be found composed
only of moleculæ of the other form.
    This idea is the more admissible, as         each octaedron being
enveloped      by  eight tetraedra,      and   each   tetraedron    being
equally enveloped by four octaedra,           whichever of the form*
we imagine to be lupprefled, the solids that remain will joiu
exactly by their edges;       so that in this respect,      there wiH be
continuity and uniformity          throughout      the whole extent     of
the mass.       The manner in which          each    octaedron is enve
loped by eight tetraedra may be readily conceived,              if we take
care that in dividing the cube        (Jig. 60.) only by      the fix sec
tions given by the rhombus, we may depart at pleasure from
any two, a, j ; 0, b ; c, n ; », r, of the eight solid angles,
provided that these two angles be opposite to each other. But
if we depart from the angles a, s, the rhomboid will have
the position (kovrnjig.      6t.     On   the other hand,       if we  de
 part from the solid angles      0, b, these  angles will become the
summits of a new rhomboid {Jig. 64.) composed of the same
octaedron as that ofJig. 63, with two new tetraedra applied
 ©n the faces b   dj, t gp (Jig.       64-), which were unoccupied
 on the rhomboid of fig. 62.          Figures 65 and 66 represent,

die, sg p,        of  the   octaedmn    ;   the    other, that in which
they would rest on the faces bfg, dtp.                   It is thence seen,
that whatever may be the two solid angles of the cube as
sumed for the points of departure,             we (hall always have the
fame octaedron, with two tetraedra contiguous by their sum
mits     to the two solid     angles in question ; and          as there are
 eight of these solid angles, the central octaedron             will  be cir
 cumscribed by eight tetraedra, which will rest on its faces:
 The fame effect will take place if we continue the division
 ¦always    parallel   to the first sections.       Each face of the oc
 taedron, then, however small we may suppose that octaedron
 to    be, adheres to a face     of the   tetraedron,     and   reciprocally.
  Each tetraedron then is enveloped by four octaedra.
      The structure I have here explained is that of sparry fluor.
  By dividing a cube of this substance we may, at pleasure, ex*
  tract rhomboids, having the angles formed by their planes
  equal to 1 ao° or regular octaedra, or tetraedra, equally re
  gular.      There are a small number           of other  substances,    such
   as rock crystal*, carbonate        of lead    (sparry lead),   &c. which
   being mechanically divided beyond the term at which we
   should have a rhomboid or parallelopipcdon, give also parts
   of various different forms       assorted    together   in a  manner even
   more complex than in sparry             fluor.     These mixt structures
   necessarily occasion       uncertainty respecting the real figure of
   the integral moleculæ which belong to the substances in ques
   tion.     I   have, however, observed that the tetraedron              is al
    ways one of those folids which            concur to the formation         of
    small    rhomboids or paralldopipedons that would be drawn
    from the crystal by a first division.          On  the other hand, there
    are substances, which, being divided in all possible directions,
   resolve themselves only into tetraedra.              Of this   number are
    garnet, blend, and tourmaline.               I (hall soon gire examples
     of  this result of the mechanical division.

       In   short,      several minerals are             divisible into right trian
 gular prisms.                Such       as the    apatite,     the        primitive form            of
 which is          a   regular right hexaedral prism, divisible parallel to
 its   bases       and its planes, from which                   necessarily          result right
 prisms with             three         planes,     as   may be seen by                   inspecting
fig. 68,           which represents one             of   the bases             of the     hexaedral
 prism divided into small equilateral                         triangles, which are the
bases       of
          many moleculæ, and which, being taken two and
                 so
two, form quadrilateral prisms with rhombusesfor their bases.
  By adopting then                      the tetraedron        in the doubtful cafe of
which I have spoken,                     we should reduce,            in general,              all the
forms of integral moleculæ to three, remarkableby their sim
plicity      ;    viz. the parallclopipedon, the simplest of all the                                so
lids which have faces parallel two and two                                 ;     the triangular
prism, the simplest of all prismsj and the tetraedron, which is
the simplest of pyramids.                         This simplicity may furnish a
reason           for the preference          given to the tetraedron                      in sparry
fluor, and the other substances of which                              I    have spoken.                  I
shall, however, forbear deciding on this subject,                                   as the      want
of   accurate          and precise observations               leaves to theory nothing
but conjecture* and probabilities.
     But the essential object               is,   that the different forms to which
the mixt structures in question conduct, are                                   assorted       in such
a   manner, that their                  assemblage       is    equivalent           to    a   sum   of
small parallelopipedons,                    as we have seen               to     be the case in
regard to sparry flour             ;     and that the laminae                  of superposition^
applied on the nucleus, decrease                         by   subtractions of one or
more ranges             of   these parallelopipedons            ;     so   that the basis           of
the theory exists independently of the choice which might
be made of any of the forms obtained     the mechanical         by                                  di
vision.
     By     the help         of this   result, the decrements to which crystals
are subject,           whatever be their primitive forms,                            are found
brought back to those which take place in substances where
this form, as well               as     that of the moleculæ, are indivisible

pose their surface.                   Let      us suppose the dodecaedron                    divided
in the direction of                 its   laminx, and, for             the greater simplicity,
let us make              the sections pass through the centre.                               One of
these sections,             viz. that which                will   be parallel          to the two
rhombuses           DLFN,                 B   HOR,         will concur with            a    hexagon
which would              pass       through        the     points       £,   C, G,     F,I,   A,    by
making the tour of the crystal.                            A    second section parallel to
the two rhombuses                     U    L  F    P,    BEAR,            will coincide with

the sections will be confounded with four new hexagons ana
logous to the preceding. But        resuming all these hexaby

    different ridges        EC, GP, PI, LA, &c

                                             diagonals of the twelve rhom-
    buses    will   subdivide      the whole surface        into 24 isosceles tri
   angles, which will be the halves of these rhombuses. 4. Since
    the planes       of the   sections pass also through the centre          of the
   crystal, they will detach 24 pyramids with three faces, the
   bases     of which, if we choose, will be the external triangles
   that make a part of the surface               of  the dodecaedron,       and   of
   which       the summits       will  be united    in the centre.
        Moreover,       if  we take, for example, the six tetraedra          which
   have      for external faces the halves of the three rhombuses
   CEDL, CLGH, CKBH,                             these six tetraedra     will form

   GHBANF,              and the third through the hexagon BEDFPO.
   Fig . 69      represents also the two tetraedra, the bases            of which
   make part of the rhombus               CLGH.         One of    these is marked
   by the letters        L, C, G, S,     and the other by the letters        H,C,
   G, S.        By applying what          has   been said to the other nine
   rhombuses, which              are united three        and   three   around the
   points F,        A, H      (fig. 69.), we (hall have three new rhom
   boids;       from which        it follows, that      the 24 tetraedra,     con
   sidered six and six, form four rhomboids ;                  so that  the dode
   caedron may be conceived               as  being itself immediately com
   posed     of   these four rhomboids,         and   in  the last analysis   of 24

   angles,       each formed        by three planes, we might have consi
   dered them as being the assemblage                  of  the four rhomboids;

 faces, such as            CL GO,            is common            to two rhomboids, one
 of which would              have         its summit in           C,    and the other in         G,
 and which would themselves have a common part                                        in   the in
 terior of the crystal.
      It   may be further remarked,                        that   a    line    G S {fig. 69.),
 drawn from any one                       G {Jig 68.) of             the solid    angles     com
posed       of three       planes,        as far as the centre          of    the dodecaedron,
 is,   at the fame time, the axis                   of the rhomboid, which would
 have its summit                in   G,     and    one of the edges of that which
would have its summit                       in   C   {fig. 68 and 69).               The com
posing rhomboids then have this property, that their axis                                           i»
equal to the side            of the rhombus.                    With     a    little attention   it
will       be easily seen, that             in   each tetraedron, such             asCLGS
{fig. 69.), all             the faces are equal                 and similar isosceles tri
angles.
     If we     should continue the division                       of    the dodecaedron          by
lections pasting between those which we have supposed to be
directed towards the centre, and which should be parallel to
them, we should                  obtain tetraedra always smaller, and ar
ranged        in   such     a   manner, that, taking them in groupes of
fix, they would form rhomboids of                               a    bulk proportioned to
their own.
     The     tetraedra,         which would be the term                       of the division,

of    calcareous          spar.
      This variety            results from          a   series   of laminæ     decreasing          at
the four edges, on all the faces of the primitive dodecaedron.
For       the more simplicity, let us first consider the effect                            of this
decrement in regard                       to the        rhombus     C L    G H {fig. £8).
We         have just seen that this rhombus was supposed to belong
in    common to two rhomboids, which should have for sum
mits, one, the point                     C,   and the other, the point                 G. Let     us
suppose that the laminæ applied                            oh tms       rhombus decrease
towards their four edges                       by      subtractions of    a   single range         of
small rhomboids,                   in such         a   manner that,        in regard to the
 two edges       C       L,    C    H, circumstances               arc the fame as           if   the
 rhombus belonged to the rhomboid which has its summit in
C    ;     and that, in regard to the other two edges                             G     L,   GH,
 the effect         is   the       fame       as   if   the rhombus        belonged to the
 rhomboid having its summit in                             G.      This   disposition        is   ad
 missible here,               in    consequence           of   the particular structure            of
 the dodecaedron,                   which permits              us to obtain small          rhom

     The    results  of  the four decrements           being thus perfectly
 similar to each other, the laminx of superposition,                  applied on
  the rhombus       CLGH,        and on each        of the other     rhombuses
 of   the dodecaedron,        will form     as many right quadrangular
  pyramids, which will have for             bases   these same rhombuses.
 In Jig.    71 may be seen the       pyramids which           rest on the three
 rhombuses       CLDE, CEBH, CGHB                              (fig. 68.), and
 which have for summits the points m,                    e, s   [Jig. 71.); but
 on account of the decrement             by a simple range, the         adjacent
 triangular faces,       such as  E  m   C, E * C of the two pyramids
 that belong to the rhombuses             CLDE,           CE     B H,   are on a
 level, and form       a quadrilateral     EmCs.          But    we had twehe
 pyramids, and consequently            forty-eight triangles.          Dividing
 by two, we (hall then have twenty-four quadrilaterals, which
 will  compose the surface        of  the secondary crystal.            But   be
cause the rhomboidal bases          of   the two pyramids extend more,
 in proceeding from L to E or from H to E, than in proceed
 ing from D to C or from B to C, the sides jiE, E * of the
 quadrilateral will be longer than the             sides   Cm, C s. More
 over, we shall        evidently have m          E equal to E s, and C m
 equal to     C s.    The quadrilaterals will then              be trapezoids,
 which will have their        sides equal     two and two.
    I  am acquainted with no crystalline form where the stria?,
 when they exist, point out, in            a  more sensible manner than
in this,     the mechanism        of  the    structure.        We may        here
 see the series of decreasing rhombuses            which form each of the
pyramids       CLDEwi, CCBHj,                   &c. (Jig. 71.),      and some
 times the furrows arc         so deep     that they produce          a kind   of
stair, the     steps  of which    have a more particular             polish and
brilliancy than       those  of their   facets, which are parallel to the
faces     CEDL, CUBE,                &c. of      the nucleus.
v the    latter are applied one upon the other,       is always equal to a sura
ef rhomboids,      though al first view it does not appear that this should
be the case, according to the figure       of  these laminx, which repruaent

    If   the decrements stop abruptly at a certain term, so that
the     pyramids are not terminated, the twenty-four                  trape-
zoids will be reduced to elongated hexagons, which will in
tercept twelve rhombuses parallel to the faces              of the nucleus.
This     is the variety to which        I have given the name      of inter-

    In the fulphure of zinc          the regular octaedron results from
a   decrement by      a range     around the eight solid angles, com
posed     of three planes, viz. C, B, O, G, F, D, A,            I {Jig.  68) .
The     fame substance assumes also the figure             of a regular te-
traedron, by the help          of   a decrement by one range on four
only      of the eight     solid   angles before      mentioned, such as

extracted from the dodecaedron,                             and made      it   afterwards      pass
to the figure         of that        dodecaedron,              by   the successive           appli
cation of all the laminæ of superposition                                 by   which    it   is   co
vered.       On the contrary,             it      seems proved, that from the first
moment the crystal             is    already          a   very small dodecaedron,              con
taining      a    cubical nucleus proportioned to its small size, aud
that     the      crystal     afterwards increases                      by   degrees without
changing           its form,         by   new layers           which envelop            it   on all
fides,       so that the       nucleus increases                  also, always preserving
the same relation with the whole dodecaedron.
                                                                                                  Let

    Let  us make this more striking by an example taken from
a plane     figure.    What I     am going to observe respecting            this
figure may be easily applied to             a  solid, since we may always
conceive      a plane figure     as a section    of  a solid.    Let   ERFN
then {jig. 74.) be an assortment os small squares, in which
the square      ABCD,         composed      of forty-nine partial       squares,
represents      a section   of  the nucleus, and the extreme squares
R, S, G, A, I, L, &c. that of                the   kind of    stair formed by
the laminae        of  superposition.        It may    be readily conceived
that the assortment began by the square                  ABCD;         and thai
different files of small squares were afterwards applied on
each of the sides of the central square, for example, on the
side   AB,   first the five squares comprehended between               I and As,
next the three squares comprehended                  between    L and    O,  and
then the square E.              This increment        corresponds    with that
which would          take place    if the dodecaedron        began    by being
a   cube, proportioned to its bulk, and which                    increased    af
 terwards     by the addition       of continually      decreasing    lamina:.
     But, on     the other hand, we may conceive that the assort
 ment was at first like that represented by fig. 76, in which
 the square a b c d is composed of only nine molecular, aud
 bt ars upon each         of  its sides only one       square e, n,   ft   or  r;
 and that afterwards, by means of the application of new
 squares,      arranged     around the former, the assortment                 has
 become that of figure 75, where the central                  square a b' c d'
 is formed      of twenty-five       small    squares,    and bears on each
 of  its sides a file    of three   squares,     plus  a  terminating     square
 /,«',/"'      or  r,   and   that, in short, by        a further application
 the assortment        of fig.  75 i» converted        into that of fig. 74.
 These ilifll    rent transitions will give an idea of the manner in
  which     secondary      crystals   may augment in bulk,            yet retain
 their form      ;  from which it is       seen   that the structure is com
 bined with that augmentation ot bulk,                   so that the law, ac
  cording to which         all the laminæ applied in the nucleus                of
  the cr) stal,wheu arrived at its greatest dimensions, successively

 decrease,   in departing from this nucleus,               existed already in
 the rising crystal.
    The theory      I    have explained,         similar in this to other
 theories,    sets out from      a  principal fact, on which it makes
 all facts of the fame kind to depend, and which are only as
it  were corollaries.       This  fact is the decrement         of  the lamina?
superadded      to the primitive          form   ;  and   it is by bringing
back this decrement to simple and regular laws, susceptible
of   accurate    calculation,       that theory arrives          at results    the
truth of which           is proved     by the mechanical             division    of
crystals,   and by observation         of their    angles        But   there still
remain new researches to be made, in order to ascend                        a flrw
steps   further towards the primitive law? to which the Creator
has subjected      crystallization      ;  and which        are nothing       else
themselves      than the      immediate effects of his supreme               will.
The object of      one     of  these researches would be to explain
how these small            polyedra,      which     are,    as   it were, the
rudiments of crystals of         a sensible    bulk, represent sometimes
the primitive form, without any modification                   ;  sometimes      a
secondary    form produced in virtue of              a  law   of   decrement      ;
and    to determine the circumstances which                  produce decre
ments on the edges, and those which give rise to decrements
on the angles.        I   have already paid attention to the solution
of this problem,       as delicate as     it is interesting ; but hitherto
I  have only had conjectures,             which,     before they deserve to
be published, require to be verified             by more attentive        labouT
and more profound meditation,

      H    £    principles of dynamics in general, and of statics in
particular,        have already           been     so   fully explained         by   some          of
the ablest mathematicians in Europe, that little or nothing
of   consequence further to be expected on those subjects,
                             is
unless our mode of calculus be either greatly improved or
totally changed.                  And      as    neither of these events             is   likely
soon to take place, we ought certainly,                         in   the mean time, to
apply to the common concerns of life the principles of which
we are already            in   possession.        But   since war and merchandise
seem at present                to be the         chief business of all European
nations,        and since neither the one nor the other can be
carried on to any great extent without navigation, nor can
any vessel with safety be navigated without  proper degree             a
of stability;           it   is    therefore      a    matter   of    the greatest im
portance          to      determine with               accuracy       the    stability             of
nautical        vessels   of      all kinds.
     However operofe                and difficult the necessary              calculations
may       in   some cafes become before the degree                      of this      essential
quality can be obtained, yet they all depend                                upon the four
following         simple and obvious theorems, accompanied                                    with
other well known stereometrical                         and statical principles.
     Theorem              I.   Every floating body displaces                a   quantity of
the fluid in which                it   float?,    equal     to its own weight             :   and
consequently, the specific gravity of the fluid will be to that
of   the floating body,                as the magnitude              of the whole             is   lo
that of the p*rt immersed.
     Theorem II.                  Every floating body         is   impelled downward
by its own             power, acting in the direction of
                       essential                                                                   a
vertical line passing through the centre of gravity of the
                                                                                      whole        s

394                         Mode         of calculating        the
whole    ;     and     is impelled             upward by the reaction                   of the
fluid which supports               it,   acting in the direction of               a    vertical
line passing through the centre of gravity of the part im
mersed   :therefore, unless these two lines are coincident, the
floating body thus impelled must revolve round an axis,
either in motion or at rest, until the equilibrium restored.                     is
  Theorem               III. If           by   any power whatever                a    vessel      be
deflected from an upright position, the perpendicular distance
betweert  two vertical lines pasting through the centres of
gravity of the whole, and of the part immersed respectively,
will   be as the stability      of       the vessel, and which         will      be positive,
nothing,       or negative, according                 as the metacentre           is    above,
coincident with or below, the centre of gravity of the vessel.
  Theorem IV.       The common centre of gravity of any
system of bodies being given in position,    any one of                if
these bodies be  moved  from one part  of the system to
another, the corresponding motion                       of the common                 centre of
gravity, estimated            in any given direction,                will   be to       that of
the aforesaid body, estimated                    in   the same direction,                as   t   he-
weight of the body moved                   is   to that   of   the whole system.
  From whence            it   is   evident, that          in   order to ascertain the
stability of any       vessel, the position of the centres of gravity of
the whole, and        of the partimmersedmust be determined; with
which,       and   the dimensions of the vessel, the line of floatation,
and angle of deflection, the stability or power either to right
itself or overturn may be found.
  In    ships      of war   and merchandise, the calculations neces
sary   for this purpose become                   unavoidably         very operose and
troublesome        ;   but they may be much faciliated                      by   the experi
mental method pointed                    out in the     New Transactions of                    the
Swedifli Academy of Sciences, first quarter of the year 1787,

   In river        and canal boats, the regularity and simplicity                                 of
the form      of    the vessel itself,          together with the compact dis
position and homogeneal                   quality of the burden, render that
method for them unnecessary,                      and make the requisite calcu

                   Stability   of River and Canal Boats.                     395
lations become very easy.             Vessels   of this kind     are generally
of the    fame transverse section throughout their whole length,
except a small part       in prow      and stern,     formed by segments
of circles or other        simple curves ; therefore a length may
easily be assigned such,         that any      of  the    transverse    sections
being multiplied thereby, the product will be                     equal to the
whole solidity of the vessel.                 The form of          the   section
AB CD         is for the most part either rectangular             as  in fig. 1.
 (Plate XIII.), trapezoidal as in fig.               2. or mixtilineal      as in
fig. 3. in all which MM represents                   the   line of floatation
when upright,         and    EF     that when inclined           at any angle
 MXE;        also  G  represents the centre         of gravity of the whole
 vessel, and    R that of    the part immersed.
     If  the vessel   be loaded quite up to the line            A B,    and the
 specific gravity    of  the boat and burden be the same, then the
 point    G is  simply the centre      of gravity of the     section  A BCD;
 but    if  not, the centres       of gravity of       the boat ami burden
 must be found separately,             and reduced to one by the com
 mon method, namely, by dividing the sum of the momenta
 by the sum of weights, or areas,                which in this cafe are         as
 the weights.        The point R         is always the centre        of gravity
 of   the   section   M M C D,         which,     if  consisting    of different
 figures, must      also be     found by dividing            the   sum    of the
 momenta by the sum of the weights                      as  common.        These
 two points being found, the next thing necessary is to de
  termine the area of the two equal triangles MXE,                      MXF,
 their centres of gravity       0, 0, and the      perpendicular projected
 distance     «nof     these points on the water              lineEF.        This
  being done, through            R  and parallel to      EF    draw    RT    = a
  fourth proportional        to   the    whole     area    M M C D,        either
  triangle    M X E or       MXF,         and the distance n n ; through
  T,   and at right angles to          RT     or   EF,     draw   TS    meeting
  the vertical axis of the           vessel  in S the metacentre; also
  through the      points G, B,      and parallel to S       T, draw N G W
  and B    V;    moreover    through S, and parallel to E F, draw
  WSV        meeting the     two former in V and W j then S W is
                                                                                as

  or negative, according         as   the   point S is above, coincident
  with, or below,       the point    G.     If now      we suppose      W     to re
 present      the weight   of the whole         vessel   and burden         (which
 will    be equal     to the section       MMCD            multiplied        by the
 Jength of the vessel), and P to represent the required weight
 applied at the gunwale           13   to sustain the vessel at the            given
 angle of inclination       ; we shall always have this proportion :
 asVS:SW::W:P;                           which      proportion       is general,
 whether       SW     be positive     or negative; it must only in the
 latter cafe be supposed to act upward to prevent and overturn.
      In  the rectangular vessel,      of given weight      and dimensions,
 the whole       process is so evident, that any further explanation
 would       be   unnecessary.       In the trapezoidal vessel, after
 having found the points G and R, let AD, B C be pro«
dueed until they meet in K.                 Then since the two section*
MMCD, EFDC                    are equal, the two triangles               M M K,
EFK          are also equal; and        therefore the Tectangle           EK       X
BF       =   KMxKM            =   KM';       and since the angle         of incli
nation is supposed to be known,                the angles at      E    and    F   are
given.        Consequently,     if   a   mean proportional             be    found
between the sines of the angles at              E and F, we           shall     Have
the following proportions          :
As     the mean proportional thus found           :  fine  £E : : KM          :  KF,
And       as   the said mean    proportional       : fine L.  F  : :   KM : KE;
therefore M E, M F become known ; from whence the                               area
of either triangle MXE or M X F, the distance n n,                               and
all the other requisites may be found.
     In  the mixtilineal section,      let A B =       9 feet
                                                              = 108 inches,

      Again   :  Let  us suppose the mean length           of the  vessel to be
  40 feet, or 480 inches, and we (hall have the weight of the
  whole vessel equal to the area of the section MMCD =
  4936*7808 multiplied by 480 = 2369654784 cubic inches
  of water, which weighs exactly 85708 pounds avoirdupoife,
  allowing the cubic foot to weigh 62*5 pounds.
     And, finally, as SV : S W (i.e.) as 58-645 : 3*573 : :
  85708 -3760 + , the weight on the gunwale which will
  sustain the vessel at the given inclination.            Therefore a     vessel
  of   the above     dimensions, and weighing             38 tons, 5 cwts.
  28 lbs.   will require  a weight     of    1 ton,     13 cwts. 64 lbs. to
 make her incline       150.
     In this   example   the deflecting power has been supposed
  to act   perpendicularly on the gunwale at B                 ;  but   if   the
 vessel  is navigated    by fails, the centre velique must be found;
 with which,       and the angle     of deflection,      the   projected    dis
 tance thereof on the line         SV    may be obtained ; and             then
 the power, calculated        as above,    necessary      to be applied at
 the projected point, will be that part              of   the wind's      force
 which     causes the vessel      to   heel.    And      conversely,    if  the
 weight and dimensions of the vessel, the area and altitude
 of the fails, the direction and velocity of the wind be given,
 the angle of deflection may be found.
X. New       Method    of freeing    Molasses   from their sharp Tafe,
    and rendering them       ft to   be used instead     of Sugar,       From
    Crell's Chemical Annals, 1 798, Vol. I. Part %.
V./ADET Devaux,               according to the experiments made
by Lowitz, gives the following method                :  Take twenty-four
pounds of molasses, twenty-four pounds of water, and six
pounds of charcoal coarsely pulverised             ;   and   having mixed
them in a kettle,         boil tbc whole over a slow wood sire.
                                                                      Whca

                       Description of a Dynanometer.                   399
When the mixture has boiled half an hoar, pour it into a
flat vessel, in order that the charcoal my subside to the
bottom     ;   then pour off the liquid, and place it over the sire
once more, that the superfluous water may evaporate, and
to give      to the molasses their former consistence.            Twenty-
four pounds of molasses          will produce twenty-four pounds of
syrup.
   This method          has been employed on a large scale with the
happiest      effects   ;  the molasses become       sensibly milder, and
can be employed in many articles of food ; though in dishes
where milk is used, or for cordials mixed with spices, sugar
is to  be preferred.
 XI.    Description       and Use os the Dynanometer, or Instrument
   for   ascertaining the relative Strength of Men and Animals.
    Invented       by   Cit.   Rue.  ni Kit.    From Journal de l'Ecole
    Polytechnique,          Vol. II.  6th Year.
 w,HEN                Sanctorius     invented    his balance, he taught
 us   what      we    lose by insensible     perspiration ; and no one,
 without      this discovery,      would perhaps ever have imagined
 that the matter thrown out from the body is more than half
 what we receive as nourishment.                  Knowledge no less im
 portant might be acquired, had we the easy means of ascer
 taining, in a comparative manner, our relative strengths at
 the different periods of life, and in different           states of health.
 Buffon and Gueneau, who had some excellent ideas on this
 subject, requested me to endeavour             to invent a portable ma
 chine,    which,       by   an easy and     simple   mechanism, might
 conduct to      a  solution of this question,       on which they were
 then engaged. These philosophers were acquainted with that
 invented by Graham, and improved by Dr. Desaguliers, at
 London      ;   but this machine, constructed           of wooden-work,
 was too bulkly and heavy to be portable                ; and, besides, to
 make experiments on the different parts of the body, several
                                                                  machines

 400                              Description and U/e
machines were necessary, each suited to the part required                                          to
be tried. They were acquainted also with the dynanometer
of Cit. Leroy of the Academy of Sciences at Paris. It
consisted      of      a metal        tube ten or twelve inches                        in length,
placed vertically on              a    foot like that         of       a   candlestick,         and
containing          in the inside        a spiral        spring, having above it a
graduated         shank terminating in a globe.                            This (hank,        toge
ther with the spring,                  sunk into the tube                   in proportion to
the weight acting upon                  it,   and thus pointed out, in degrees,
the strength of the person who                    pressed     on the ball with his
hand.
   This instrument, though ingenious, did not                                      appear suffi
cient, however, to Buffon and Gueneau                         ;    for they wiflied not
merely to ascertain               the muscular force              of   a    singer or hand,
but to       estimate that        of    each limb separately,                    and    of   al) the
parts   of the body.           I (hall not here give an account of the
attempts     I      made      to fulfil the wishes of these two philo
sophers,      but only observe, that in the course of my experi
ments   I    had reason to be convinced that the construction                                    of
the instrument was not                  so   easy as    might have been expected.
Besides the use which                  an enlightened naturalist may make
of this machine,             it   may be possible             to apply             it   to many
other important              purposes.          For example,                it   may be em
ployed with advantage to determine the strength of draught
cattle  and, above all, to try that of horses, and com
        ;
pare    with the strength of other animals.
        it                                    may serve                          It
to make known how far the assistance of well-construct
ed wheels may           favour the movement of        carriage, and        a
what    is   its vis inertia in proportion to the load.  We might
appreciate        by   it,   also, what resistance the                     slope   of   a   moun
tain opposes to          a   carriage, and be able to judge whether                              a
carriage     is   sufficiently loaded in proportion to the number
of horses     that are to be yoked to                  it.   In    the arts,          it   may be
applied to machines of which we wish to ascertain the re
sistance, and when we are desirous to calculate the moving
force that ought to be adapted to them.                            It       may serve, also,
                                                                                                 as

as a Roman balance to weigh burdens.                   In  short,   nothing"
would be more        easy  than to convert it into an anemometer,
to discover the absolute force of the wind,              by fitting to it a
frame of      a determined size filled up with wax-cloth               ;  and
it would not be impossible lo ascertain by this machine the
recoil of fire-arms, and consequently the strength of gun
powder.
    This dynanometer, in         its form and size, has a near resem
blance to a common graphometer.                   It consists   of  a spring
twelve inches in length,          bent into the form of an ellipsis ;
from the middle of which arises            a semicircular piece of brass,
laving     engraved     upon it the different degrees that express
the force of the power acting on the spring.                 The whole of
this machine, which weighs only two pounds                 and a half, op
 poses, however, more resistance than may be necessary to de
 termine the action        of  the strongest and      moil   robust    horse.
 The simplicity of      its mechanism        will  be better illustrated    by
 the following description         :
     A,   an elliptical spring, seen in perspective,          covered with
 leather, that it may not hurt the singers when strongly              pressed
 on with the hands,         {see  Plate   XIII.)      This  spring is com
 posed of the best      steel  well welded and tempered,          and after
 wards subjected to        a stronger    proof than is indicated by its
 graduation, in order that it may not lose any os its elasticity
  by  use.
     B, a piece   of steel strongly    fastened to the spring by means
 of   a claw and screws,         in order to support        a   semicircular
 plate   of brass  C, mounted        on the spring, seen geometrically.
  On this    plate are engraved        two arcs, one divided into n>y-
  riagrammes, and the other into kylogrammej. Each ot these
  arcs is still further divided by points, which express the
  weight    in pounds de marc;           and    all these degrees having
  been exactly valued         by accurate     weights, it thence        results
  that all dynaujmeters of this kind may be compared                      with
  each other.

    D,     a small   steel   support, adjusted like the former to the
 other branch       of    the spring, and having a cleft towards its
 upper extremity to receive             freely    a small     copper    lever  E,
 which is kept in its place by          a small    steel  pin a. The whole
 of this mechanism is          seen  of its full  size at    H.
     F,  a steel index, very light and elastic, fixed upon its axis
 by a screw in the centre of the brass semicircle. This index
 has a small bit      of leather or cloth glued upon the small cir
 cular part G, in order to render the friction on the plate
 easy, uniform,       and almost insensible.           It  is to be observed,
 that this index is terminated by a double point,                   adapted to
 the divisions on both the semicircular               arcs.      The   first, di
vided into myriagrammes and points, expressing ten pounds
 de marc,     serves for all experiments which oblige the spring
to be elongated        in the direction      of its  greater axis, as is the
cafe    in trying    the strength     of the reins ; in        a word, for all
 trials where it is necessary to draw the spring by the two
ends.       The second, divided into kylogrammes and points,
expressing pounds          de marc, is destined     for experiments which
compress the two sides           of  the spring, as      in trying    the force
of   the hands.
    J,   a small   plate    of  brass which      covers      the mechanism,
to prevent it from being injured.              This    small plate has on       it
also   a divided arc, the degrees       of which     correspond     with those
of    the first arc  of the machine        ;  and by the play        of  a small
index b, which          is under the plate, the movements of the
spring may be ascertained.
    K,   an aperture      in the covering plate, through which may
be introduced a small turnscrew, for the purpose                   of tighten

on the needle of the mariner's compass, in which the lower

  a horse or any other draught animal.
     The    effects  of this machine        may be thus explained          :    If  a
 person presses on the spring with the hands, or draws it out
 lengthwise, by pulling the two extremities in a contrary di
 rection,      the two fides of the spring           approach each other            ;
 and    in proportion       as  they    are brought       nearer,    the     small
 lever   of   the mechanism pushes' before it the index,                 which,
 by the tightness       with which        it   is screwed in its place,        will
remain at the point to which it has been brought by the pin
d, in consequence of the force acting on the spring.
     The muscular       force   of  the arms, or rather the strength              of
the     hands, may be tried by laying hold of the two                         sides
of    the    spring nearest to the centre,           as may be     seen figure
R;     so  that the arms may be a little stretched, and inclined                      -
downwards, almost           at an   angle of 45 degrees.           This posi
tion, which appears the most natural, is also the most con
venient for       a  man to act with his full force.               It  is to be
                                     D   d 1                      recollected,

recollected, that the lower arc of division, divided into kylo-
grammes, is that which                     serves to express the force                          of the
hands, and         of all the actions which                         press         the two fides
of    the spring.        The       strength         of   the hands may also be tried
one after the other           ;    and     if   an account be kept                     of    the de
gree    of   pressure    of   the right hand, and then                        of     the lest, and
these two sums be added together, it                              will   be found that the
sum-total       is,   in general,          equal     to the strength                  of both the
hands when acting together.
     To try    the strength           of   the body,           or rather the reins, the
person must place his feet on the bottom part                                    of   the rack      O ;
one     of   the ends    of   the spring        is       then to be placed                 in   one of
the hooks of the rack                       and the hook                      to be put into
                                                                         is is
                                       ;                            P
the other end.            In this position                the body               perpendicular;
the shoulders          only being inclined                    a   little forwards, to be
able,    in throwing              back the body, to pull the spring with
all the force which               a   person    is   capable of exerting.                       In this
situation, represented                by   S,   a   man may raise                a   great weight
without being exposed to those accidents which                                             might      be
occasioned       by    an effort made              in    a   more constrained               position.
     Nothing      can be more convenient than this dynanometer
to ascertain       and compare the strength                       of     horses and that              of
all draught animals.                   Figure   T        (hows, in        a      sufficient man

The trials     I   made on this subject                      are not extensive; but as
they were conducted with care, they may serve to give                                           a   very
just idea of the absolute force of horses of middling strentjth.
 For this purpose    employed four horses of middle size, in
                         I
good health and well-conditioned,                             which were subjected                    se
parately      and in succession to the same trial.                               The       sirst   drew
equivalent to 36 niyriagrammes the second 38^        ;                                ;     the third

riagrammes        ;     and   if      we take        the mean             of this sum,               we
shall have,        for the sirength             of ordinary              horses,       36 niyria

     From Neue Nordische Beytragc, Vol. V.
J.     AM   now acquainted with the secret of our silversmiths
for silling up the engraving in plate             with      a  black,    glassy,
durable mass, respecting          which   we have so often conversed            j
and it is very singular that the Russians must have derived
this process from the Persians and the Indians.
      They take half an ounce of          silver,  i\ ounces of copper,
3£ ounces of lead, 12 ounces of sulphur, and a* ounces of
 sal ammoniac.          The metals are melted together and poured
 into a crucible, which has been before filled with pulverized
sulphur made into a paste by means of water                 ;  the crucible is
 'lien immediately       covered that the sulphur may not take fire,
 and this regulus is calcined over a smelting fire until the
 superfluous sulphur be burnt away.                 This regulus is then
 coarsely    pouoded, and, with a solution               of   sal  ammoniac,
 formed into a paste, which is rubbed into the engraving on
 silver plate.     The    silver is then wiped clean, and susscred             to
 become      so  hot under the muffle, that the substance rubbed
  into   the strokes    of  the engraving      melts    and adheres to the
  metal.     The   silver is afterwards wetted with the solution               of
  sal ammoniac,         and   again placed      under the muffle till           it
  becomes      red   hot.     The    engraved     surface      may     then   be
  smoothed      and   polished    without any danger             of  the   black
  substance,     which is an artificial kind       ot"  silver ore (fablerx.)^

  cording to the Principle followed by the ancient Greek and
  Roman Painters, discovered                    by the        Abbe Rf.quen'O,            and
 Jince praclifed with much Success at Rome.                                   Communi
  cated    by   Mr. Charles Heathcote Tatham, Ar
  chitect.
 JL   H E following        receipt      for painting in encaujlo, copied
from an original paper,              was presented to Mr. Tatham, at
Caferta near Naples,            by       Mr. Philip Hackert, painter                   to his
Neapolitan      Majesty.         It exemplifies                the mode supposed to
be practised     by the ancients               in their arabesque.                 After this
manner     a large    bath was decorated in                    a casino     of the king of
Naples    at Belvidere          near Caferta,                 the walls and          vaulted
ceiling of which were entirely covered with encausto,                                  under
the direction of       Mr. Hackert, who                       was so obliging           as    to
accompany       Mr. Tatham               to visit the success          of    it,   which he
did, much to his satisfaction, when upon his travels                                   in    the
year 1795.
  The     first preparation      is      as   follows     :   Infuse   a    pound of gum
tragacanth*      in   a   proportionate quantity of water, for twen
ty-four hours, in         an earthen vessel.                   When this solution             is
pretty thick,     add to        it   mineral colours              of   any     fort, broke
into pieces without being pounded, and which must after
wards be prepared     the following manner;
                           in
  Put     an    ounce of white                 wax        and     an   ounce of gum
tragacanth into        a   small         earthen         vessel   well glazed,          toge
ther with two or three pounds of water, and keep the ves
sel over  brisk sire, that the ingredients may become
          a                                                                                  li
quid, stirring them continually with  small stick.   When     a
the whole are well dissolved, take the vessel from the fire,
and, aster the liquor            has cooled,              sleim   off the wax from
the surface.      The oily parts of this wax                           are     left in the
gum water, which            must          be afterwards strained                   through    a
piece   of linen cloth.          This liquid              and the colours prepared

               Methods employed in Encaustic Painting.                                          407
with it may         be kept several months,               in   bottles closely stop
 ped, after a little brandy or spirit             of wine          is added to            it,   and
will    be good even at the end            of several     years.
     The colours         moistened     with the solution of gum traga-
canth must, for the greater                   convenience,            be ground with
pure water, and afterwards with the above-mentioned pre
paration, till they become exceedingly fine    and they may         ;
then be employed for painting all forts of figures or land
scapes in arabesque, in the manner of distemper or degauebe.
When        they     arc perfectly dry,        they are then covered with
white liquid          wax, warmed           by    burning          coals        placed          in   a
chaffing-difh            when the wax begins to melt,                           is   spread out
                                                                        it it

a    proper rubber or piece 6f soft cloth.
     The   second        method of preparation,                    which         was found
more convenient,           is   the   following       :   Having put                 an    equal
quantity of white wax grated and of gum arabic in an earthen
vessel, with as much water                as may be necessary                   to render            it
more or      less    thick, according         to pleasure,          the same process
is   then to be followed        as    in the preceding cafe           :         the      colours
must be finely ground with this mixture,                            and may then be
employed for painting.
     These two preparations were employed with great success,
for three     years,      to paint various pictures,                 decorations and
ornaments,          ordered      by    the empress            of Rufiia         :     and       the
transparency of the colours produced                      a   most brilliant effect.
In the beginning of the year 1791 the three ablest artists in
encaujlo, M. dell' Era, in the hillorical line; M. Cani-
povecchio for landscapes    and M. Vincent Angcloni for
                                      ;
arabesque      ornaments,        used     them with        a       very happv effect,
and the pieces they produced               were not inferior               in    lustre and
brilliancy    to the finest paintings in oil mixed with varnish.
Several    trials were made in this way on walls, wood, cioth,
paper, copper, and marble; and                 it   was found           that paintings
on    the latter substances could be washed                   by   means o!          a   sponge

dipped in water, but that Joo strong friction penetrated                     to
the colours,     and carried     off  a part     of them.       Paintings on
walls or wooden pannels           resisted   friction much better ; but
if  the   hand pressed too hard,           some    of   the colour was de
stroyed, especially in places to        which the liquid wax had not
sofficientlv penetrated.
    To   prevent these inconveniences,            trial was made      of other
 preparations,      pointed out before          by the Abb6 Requeno,
agreeably     to several passages      of Pliny      and   Vitruvius. These
trials were perfectly successful,          and paintings executed          with
the preparations, as hereafter          mentioned,       resisted  much bet
ter friction     with   a wet sponge.           The mechanism           even  of
painting in this manner, with these colours, was found
more convenient and much easier, because the colours did
 not dry    so speedily    as those prepared        in the first and second
 manner.
    The preparation of colours agreeably to                the last method    ii
 as  follows: Take a vase of vitrified earth,               and place it over
 a small fire  with an ounce of white wax             ; and  when the wax is
 melted, add four ounces of olibaniim (incensomasebio), reduced
 to powder, which must be also dissolved with the wax. This
 mixture must be put into          a small     vessel   with water, and you
 will obtain     a   hard   brittle crayon, which            must   be mixed
 with    the colours when ground up.
     The   fame process may be followed with mastic, by taking
 five ounces    of that   substance and two        of wax, and this crayon
  will  serve  for the brighter colours.             For darker colours the
  crayon may be made          of four ounces of            asphaltos   and two
 ounces    of wax.

         HE         epidermis of the human skin is perhaps the best
expanded            and the       easiest    to be detached        of any,     and for that
reason     I
        made it the subject of the following experiments.
   The human skin becomes shrivelled in hot water, and
divides itself into two distinct parts, the epidermis aud the
eutis.  The latter resembles then in its consistence a softened
 cartilage.  The continued action of warm water at length
 dissolves the cutis, but does not sensibly affect the epidermis.
 Alcohol            kept     a    long time         in digestion on the epidermis
 likewise produces no effect.                       Caustic alkali dissolves              it,   and
 the fame           effect       is   produced      by    lime,    though more slowly.
 There   then an analogy between the external covering of
               is
 the human body and that which covers silk. From these
 observations             we are authorized to deduce the following con
 sequences,          which may be applied, without overstraining the
 principle,              to the operations          of tanning.          1.   If    we     plunge
 into     a    tanning infusion              a   piece of skin       covered        by    its epi
 dermis, the tan penetrates only on the flesli-fide                                :   the other
 side    is    secured from            it   by   the epidermis, which          is   not    suscep
  tible   of any combination with                        the tanning principle.
    2. When the epidermis                          is   removed      by
                                                                     the operation                  of
  liming,        the tan then penetrates                  on both fides of the skin.
     3. Lime, which                    is   generally employed for taking off the
  hair,    seems to act only                 by
                           dissolving the epidermis.  Lime-
  water has more action than undiffolvcd limej but its effect
  ceases the moment that the small quantity of lime held in
  solution          is   combined with the epidermis                 :    hence the neces
  sity    of renewing             the lime-water till the whole effect required
  be produced.

  XV. Of a        remarkable Cure effected by the Use as Carbonic
     Acid Gas, communicated in a Letter to bis Excellency
     Prince     Demetrius de Golitzin, Minister of the Imperial
     Court of Russia at the Hague.             By M. D. Jan sens of
     Ooflerbout.        From the New Transactions of the Imperial
    Academy of Sciences          at Petersburgh, Vol.    I.
                                              Oosterhout, Nov. 23d, 1778..
  In the conversation I         had the honour    of having with your
 Excellency on the medical virtue of carbonic acid gas, or fixed
 air, I promised to give you an account of the effects it might
 produce in the putrid fever, by being injected into the rec
 tum   ;   but though in the following cafe,         which is certainly
 very uncommon,            I have   not exactly followed     the method
 pointed out bv your Excellency,           having been obliged to give
 as much       of   the   cinchona or Peruvian bark        as possible,   I
 however believe that it greatly contributed to the cure.
   The wife of        a   bargeman at    G. Berg, named N. Swart,
 aged    thirty-two, of       a sanguine  temperament and a found
 constitution from the time of her birth, was attacked, after
 her third natural delivery, according to every appearance                a
 favourable one, which happened            on the 6th of October at
 two o'clock in the morning, with            a fever that began on the
 8th.     ft may be right to premise,         that on the 6th she was
exceedingly well, and her evacuations were perfectly free.
   On    the 7th they flowed less,        and she began to complain
of  lassitude, a great heaviness       in all her limbs attended with
a loss   of appetite, and the disappearance of milk from her
breasts.      At the commencement of the third day the eva
 cuations were stopped, and the fever came on by cold and
successive sits      of shivering with retching       and pain    in   the
head, which was not acute, but accompanied with                 a sensa
tion like that of       a weight pressing on the cranium, and from
which     stie  suffered less when in bed then when sitting up.
These symptoms were followed by             a great  heat,  with vomit
ing of   a  bilious, greenish, highly corrupted stuff: her tongue
                                                                     was

                  A  Curt   by  Carbonic Acid Gas.                        41 1
was covered with a viscous matter of a yellowish colour the
two first days, but it was afterwards          brown till the 6th.
    Her breathing was short, oppressive, and accompanied
with a fetid smell. The pulse, which was weak, beat from
 90 to 94 in a minute.          The heat was not examined by
a   thermometer.      The urine        was    red   and    fetid,   without
sediment.      The patient had a violent thirst,             and   drank a
 great deal  of whey with lemon juice.
   On the     second   day   of the fever        ssie was    affected     with
delirium,   coma, restlessness, and a dread              of death.         On
the third    all these symptoms increased.                On    the    fourth
there was an involuntary             discharge    of urine,      &c.       On
the fifth   there   came on a diarrha           of   a bilious and pu
trid matter  ; and the delirium being then continual,                (he suf
fered every thing to escape her.            On   the sixth the symptoms
were no better.      On   the seventh the tonsils were white, and
this thickened secretion,       at length, covered all the           parts   of
the mouth    ;  deglutition became difficult, there was fubsultus
tendinum, and the patient with her trembling singers picked
the blankets.      On  the eighth all the symptoms were as be
fore, with vibices half     an inch in       diameter, which          rose   in
small blisters, and appeared on the breast,              the hands,        and
other parts of the     body.       On    the  ninth    these blisters      dis
charged    blood,   for the most part thin and             corrupted, the
ground of which was in some            a  brown purple, and in others
red.   The cheeks      were    also   of   a brown purple colour, the
eyes   hollow,    and the pupils much dilated.              At  last   a  cold
sweat broke out on the face, the hands and sect;                 the mouth
quivered, and the cheeks,        lips, and all the members of the
body were slightly convulsed.
   All  these    bad symptoms gave reason             to  be apprehensive
for the life of the patient        ;  but the pulse continuing          regu
lar gave me some hope.             While      the   patient was in thisT
condition, being     called  in   to  consult   with   the physician who
had treated the case according to the rules             of  the art,    I  ad
vised the application    of carbonic       acid gas by the rectum, to
                                                                       gether

 4T3                 -A Cure    ly Carbonic Acid Gat.
 gether with the following decoction               : Twenty-five grains        of
 salt  of  tartar   (carbonat of pot-asti) dissolved in five ounces
 of   a strong decoction of bark.              I gave five ounces of this
 decoction, in which         I  had put      as   many drops       of spirit of
 vitrol (sulphuric acid), to extricate the fixed air.
    This     injection was given twice the two first days, and
 only once daily for the three following.
     In regard to medicine, the patient took every hour,                    in  a
 cup-full of     tea, the following      decoction     : Cinchona or bark
 in   a coarse     powder, four ounces, digested in a sufficient
 quantity    of common water for              three hours,    till reduced     to
 two pounds.         I dissolved   in a pound of this decoction         a  grain
 of salt of tartar, to which I       added the other pound, into         which
 I had put as many drops            of spirit of vitriol  as  were necessary
 to saturate the alkali, and disengage             the carbonic acid gas*.
    On the tenth day all the symptoms were the fame, ex
 cept that the sweats were less cold.                On the eleventh they
were still     less so ; and    perspiration proceeding equally from
every    part of    the body,       the tonsils began to look better,
deglutition was         not  so difficult, and the delirium was not
so   continual.       From time      to time the patient was collected,
and called for the urinal.
    The twelfth      and thirteenth she was still much better              j the
colour of the cheeks            was almost       natural,    and the    vibicei
became of        a brighter red ;      the convulsions ceased,         and all
the other symptoms had almost disappeared.                      On the four
teenth a perfect crisis took place in regard to the urine and
perspiration.        On    the   fifteenth the       patient felt no more
sever, and had        no symptom of        disease   except great debility;
so  that on the twentieth day           stte  was perfectly reestablished.
    During the      course    of   the disease    her breasts were flaccid
and very small, without          milk   ; but having visited her on the

of joining   the ingredients.     Edit.
                                                                          tenth

    I  have     been particular         in detailing this cafe, that your
 Excellency,       from the       circumstances both of the nature of
the   disease    and of its cause, which was probably a stoppage
of the floodings after delivery, might the better be enabled
to judge of the medical virtue of carbonic acid gas ; and,
at the fame time, to see the reasons I have had for varying
the application.           I  was afraid      of a putrefaction or universal
gangrene ; against            which      I  prescribed     bark ; and     as  the
latter could not prevent the extrication                 of the carbonic acid
gas,     I added the substances necessary to produce                 it.
 XVI. ExtraS of              a Memoir        on    the Fossil   Bones    of Qua
    drupeds.       By Cii.      Cuvies.         From Bulletin des Scieuces,
    No. XVU1.
       HE       author's object in this memoir was to collect, as
 far as possible,        every     information        respecting    the   various
 kinds of      fossil   bones hitherto found, whether seen by him
 self or described        by others;       to examine the skeletons,          and
 to compare them with               those   of animals now existing        on the.
 globe, in order to determine how far they are similar or dif
 ferent.      The following are          the kinds which he examined            :
      1.   The bones and tusles           called by theRuflians        the bones
 and horns       of   the mammoth.            Such foflil remains are found
 in various      parts    of Europe.         This animal      is a kind   of  ele
 phant nearly resembling that of Asia, but differs from it in
 the alveoli of its tusks being longer ; that the angle formed
 by its lower jaw is more obtuse,                   and   that   the laminæ os
 which     its grinders are composed are thinner.                  A living  ani
 mal really analogous           to it is not known,         though it has hi
 therto been considered            as a   common elephant.
                                                                          a. Th«

  4 >4              On the Foffil Bones of Quadrupeds.
      2. The remains        of an animal which         have been found on
  the banks       of   the  Ohio in North America,            and which the
  Americans        and   the English consider as those,        of the mam
  moth also, though this animal             is very different from          the
  preceding. Remains of it are found also in Europe and Asia.
  It  must    be almost      of  the fame height as the elephant,           but
 more bulky.          Its tusks are smaller ;      its grinders are armed
 with    large    cutting points, the section          of which     presents,
 when they         are worn      down,    double     transversal   lozenges.
 There are three grinders on each fide ; one              of which   has four
 points, the second six, and the other eight.
      3. The animal, the teeth of which tinged by copper
 furnish the turquois.          Of these fossils there was a mine at
 Sinore     in Languedoc.           Remains     of    the   fame   kind     are
 found in the department of           Ain, in Peru, and other places.
 This animal        must    have resembled      the preceding ; but the
 points of      its grinders     arc  of  a conical form,        and, when
worn down,           their section    presents,   first a circle,     then a
 semi-oval, and then the figure of a trefoil            ;  which has made
them be confounded with the teeth of the hippopotamus.
Some       of  these teeth      have  twelve    points, others      six,   and
others four.
     4. The hippopotamus.            There are found in France, and
other countries, teeth and the fragments of jaw bones, in
which      the author has never          yet been     able to discover any
thing      different from       those  of  the   common hippopotami.
As    he never saw, however, a whole bone, he cannot affirm
the indentity.
     5. That species of rhinoceros with an elongated cranium,
the bones      of which are found in Siberia, Germany, and
other countries.           The author     has seen teeth and        portions
of   the jaws found in France,          which appeared to him to be
long to this animal.            The principal characterizing mark of
this species consists in the osseous partition of the nose.                  A
living animal analogous to it is unknown.
                                                                         f. A

                   On the Foflil Bones of Quadrupeds.                                           415
  6".    A   grinder with two transversal eminences, in the pos
session   of Cit. Gillet,          and      of which     germ is preserved in
                                                           a
the National Museum.                     It   has no resemblance to the teeth,
nor to the germs of the teeth, of any animal, whether living
or in a fossil state, hitherto known. The only teeth to
which it       bears a resemblance                  is   the    last lower grinder                   of
the rhinoceros.             This tooth indicates, then,                       the existence
of   a sixth       fossil    species          analogous        to     no     living       animal
known.
   7. The animal, twelve feet in length and six in height,
the skeleton of which was found below the earth in Para
guay, and is now preserved in the Cabinet of Natural                                            His
tory belonging to the king of Spain at Madrid. By a mi
nute comparison of the bones of this skeleton with those of
all the known quadrupeds, the author proves that it is                                          a   pe
culiar    and distinct species,                which      approaches          nearer to the
sloth than to any other kind, and that it might be named
the giant-sloth.  Cit. Cuvier here mentions, occasionally,
an interesting discovery he has made, that the ai", or three-
toed sloth (bradjpus tridaflylus, Lin.) has naturally and
 invariably        nine cervical vertebræ.                     This    is the first known
                               by C. Daubenton,
exception to the rule established                                                          that all
 the viviparous quadrupeds have neither more nor                                         less       than
 seven cervical vertebræ.
     8. The animal,              remains of which               are found         in the ca
 verns near Gaylenreuth                  and Muggendorf,              in the margraviate
 of Bayreuth in Franconia.                         Several      have        considered               this
 animal       as a sea-bsar        ;   but it differs from            it,   as   well     as        from
 all the bears known,                  in   the form of its head, characterized
 above       all   by   the projection             of    the forehead;           the want              of
 the small tooth, which the bears hitherto known have be
 hind each canine tooth                ;      by   the osseous canal of the hume-

 several other circumstances                       in   the figure and           proportion of
 the bones.          It     is   however to the bear that this animal has
 the greatest affinity.
        9. The carnivorous animal,                      bones of which are found                         in

the plaster stone         of Montmartre.
                                   The form of its jaw
bones, the number of its grinders, the points with which
they are armed, indicate that this species mast belong to
the genus of the canis.   It however does not exactly re
semble any known               species   of that genus. The              most striking
distinctive mark         is,   that the seventh lower grinder                       is   the
greatest     in the animal           of Montmartre          ;   whereas        it   is   the
fifth in the dog, wolf, fox, &c.
     10.   The animal,         a   lower jaw       of which, found near Ve
rona, has been considered                by   Joseph      Monti     as   a    portion of
the cranium of the sea-cow                 ;      an opinion        adopted         by all
geologists, though contrary to the simplest principles                          of com
parative anatomy.              This jaw, according           to   Cit. Cuvier, has
belonged to an animal approaching                      near to the mammoth,
the animal of the Ohio, and that of Sinore,                           though speci
fically    different.        Its   most particular          characterizing           mark
consists in the beak formed                by    its fymphysis.

It    evidently distinct from all the stags known, and even
     is
from the elk, to which      has been referred, on account of
                                    it
the enormous          size     of its horns, the           flatness      of   the upper
part of them, and the branches that arise from the root.
Several     figures   of them may be seen in the Philosophical
Transactions.
     12. The genus of the ox alone furnishes several species of
fossils.  The skulls of two which have been described                                     by
Pallas, were found in Siberia.    One of these he referred to
the common buffalo           j     but he afterwards referred             it   to   a   par
ticular species named ami, originating from Thibet.    Cit.
Cuvier proves,          by
                    osteological comparison, that this skull
does not belong to the buffalo.           The other kind appeared to
Pallas to belong to          the buffalo of the Cape, or the musk-ox
of Canada.        Cit. Cuvier            shows      that they      could not have
belonged to the former              ;    but, not having the cranium                      of
the ami nor the musk-ox,                 he does not speak with certainty
of their identity or non-identity with                    these fossil crania.

                        On Atmospheric Air.                       41 7,
The author    describes,  also, two sorts   of crania found in the
mosses in the department      of La Sotnme,      and which have a
great resemblance    to those  of the urus, which are nearly one
fourth larger.
    Cit. Cuvier concludes his     researches as follows    :  1. It is
not agreeable to truth to assert that the animals of the south
have formerly existed in the north, their species not being
perfectly identic.     2. That there have existed in all coun
tries animals which do not exist at present, and that are no
where to be found in any known part of the globe.                  He
therefore leaves it to geologists to make such changes or ad
ditions, in regard to their systems, as they may think neces
sary to explain the facts which he has thus established.
XVII.     Observations   on tie  Constituent  Parts  of Atmospheric
    Air.   By Count de      Morozzo. With the Remarks os
    F. Van Humbolt.              From the Journal de Physique,
    Fruclidor, 6tb Year.
 IN     the memoir which       I  published    in 1784, on animal
                                                      I
respiration in dephlogisticated     or oxygen gas,      offered some
reflections respecting the constituent parts of atmospheric
air, founded on experiments I had made.            Lavoisier, in his
Elementary Treatise of Chemistry, does not agree with my
experiments. That author fays, that the component pam
of atmospheric air   are 73 parts  of mephitic or azotic     gas, and
37   of oxygen    gas, eminently     respirable.    It will ihen    be
seen, adds he,    that when animal substances are dissolved         in
the nitric acid, there is disengaged a great quantity of gas,
which extinguishes a lighted candle, injures animals, and
which has a perfect resemblance to that part of atmospheric
air which is unfit for respiration. Is to 73 parts of this fluid
we add 27 of oxygen gas, obtained from mercury reduced
to the state of an oxyde by calcination, there is formed a
    Vol.I,                        Ee                             fluid

41 8                               On the Cmjlituent Parts
fluid perfectly similar to that of the atmosphere,                              and   which
has all its properties.
     The following,                 on the       other hand,     are the corollaries
which         I   have deduced from a great number                     of experiments
made          to ascertain            the duration of animal life                 in noxious
aeriform fluids, mixed in different proportions with oxygen
gas, tending to illustrate the real composition                         of atmospheric
air.
      i.     The examination by     of burning tapers is not
                                                 means
accurate for ascertaining the salubrity of the air.   I shall
quote only two examples.      A fifth part   of oxygen gas
mixed with air contaminated                             by the vapour   of sulphur,
suffered          a    candle to burn, while an               animal shut up in it
died         in   a few seconds.             A    seventh part        of the       same gas
mixed with air vitiated by the vapour                         of charcoal,         supported
flame, while an animal died in it almost instantaneously.
  2. That pure and salutary part said to be contained in at
mospheric air, which forms a third of it according to
Scheele,              and a fourth according to Lavoisier,                     is not a real
dephlogisticated                   oxygen gas ; since this gas united with
mephitic airs, in a much                         less   proportion     than a third or
fourth, supports the flame of a candle after an animal dies
in     it,   which      is   not the cafe with atmospheric              air.
      3. The           real component pans            of atmospheric air are still
unknown           ;      since,       with   a   mixture of different gases, no
thing        has been         obtained       but compound        gases,         which hive
indeed            some       properties      of air, but      never     those      of atmo
spheric air.
      The author,             to    illustrate   the question,       relates      eight cha
racterizing marks of atmospheric air, acknowledged      phi                           by
                                                  multitude,
                                                                          by by
losophers   and adds,
                  ;    that though  he tried,   a
 of experiments,               to compose         atmospheric air,                mixing de
 phlogisticated gas with                     different mephitic         gases, the gases
 so    obtained always contained something not to be sound
 in    atmospheric             air.
                                                                                           He

       He    repeated the experiments             of Lavoisier,      by mixing 73
   parts of     fixed air (carbonic acid gas), obtained from lime,
   with    27    of   gas obtained from            the red precipitate.          This
   mixture, indeed,         exhibited       to him all       the characters and
   properties      of atmospheric air, but it             differed     considerably
   from it in its essential property.
      A  candle is suddenly extinguished in atmospheric                       air in
  which an animal has died            ;  another animal could not live in
  it  an instant.       On   the other hand, in this artificial mixture,
   a flame    burnt with vivacity         ;   and a second animal,           a spar,
  row, lived 25 minutes, a third 14 or 15 : a light, introduced
  after the death of the third sparrow, burnt still with a bright
  flame.      " Tbit     mixture then          does   not form an elajlic      fluid,
  serf "eclly similar    to  that   of  atmospheric        air, and having all
  Ut properties."          He   tried    to add to this mixture phlogisti-
  cated    gas, inflammable          air, and that in which an animal
  had died.        A   second and third animal lived               in them some
  time, and      a candle was      not extinguished.
     Remarks on the above Observations,                 by  F.   Von    Uumloll.
     The memoir of Count Morozzo                   treats  of  a very    important
  subject with which I have been engaged for some months.
  The Italian philosopher           has observed the difference            between
  natural atmospheric         air and an artificial compound of azot
  and oxygen ; but, in my opinion, he goes too far,                       in assert
 ing   that atmospheric       oxygen is not vital gas ; though I agree
 with him that we are not able to form an aeriform fluid,
 such as the illustrious         Lavoisier announces in his Elements
 of Chemistry, perfectly similar                to that    of  the atmosphere.
  I   however find         that this difficulty consists           neither in our
 ignorance of the quantity, nor of the quality of the                           two
 gaseous bases.         The   difference       found between          the effect  of
 natural and artificial atmospheric              air, is to be ascribed to the
slate os tbe combination          in which        the oxygen is joined to the
 azot.     The      atmosphere      is not a       mixture:      its   constituent
 parts ought to be considered            as   in   a state  of  chemical combi-
                                       £t:                                  natioit

410                On   the Constituent       Parts, &ci
nation.     It is for this reason that the two bases              of   a specific
gravity   so different, that of azot and that of oxygen, do not
entirely separate from each other, though the high regions
are most charged       with azot.        Hence azot retains          so strongly
the last portion of the oxygen, which phosphorus,                        the   sul.
phure of pot-a(h, and other acidifiable bases ought to take
from it j and I have for this reason seen that the nitrous gas
acts in proportions very different in decomposing                   the natural
atmospheric air, or       a  compound of 27 of oxygen and 73 of
azot.    But how could Morozzo think to imitate the atmo
sphere by mixing        the carbonic         acid and oxygen           ?   He has
confounded azot with the carbonic acid gas.                      But he     assures
us that his atmospheric air with a carbonic                  acid base, gave
the same specific       weight as atmospheric               air.    Here      is a
very striking experiment          : one cubic inch        of azot weighing
0,46624      grains,   while      the fame       cubic inch of carbonic
acid weighed 0,67500 grains                !   Morozzo       tells    us that a
candle burnt in his artificial mixture with a very                        brilliant
flame {conjiamma         lucidijfima)    .    By combining 0,25 of the
carbonic acid with 0,75 of oxygen,                I  have seen a wax taper
extinguished.       The     same thing took place when,                 in com
pany with Taffeart in Vauquelin's laboratory,                     I  mixed two
parts  of the carbonic       acid   gas with ten parts        of   atmospheric
air.   There is then formed             a  new chemical combination                 :
 the carbonic acid lays         hold   so strongly     of  the oxygen        of the
atmosphere,      that the affinity presented by the lighted                    wax
 taper  is   not powerful enough              to   take   it away.         In my
 work on the analysis          of    the   mephitic vapour of mines,
 which is about to be translated           into French, it will be seen
 that there exists airs not unfit for respiration, which are com
 posed  of 0,27 of oxygen, 0,70 of azot, and 0,03 of carbonic
 acid gas.     It is the state of the combination, and not always
 the quantity of oxygen, which renders air more or less capa
 ble to destroy animal life, or to extinguish flame.

                         LUMINOUS                   FLUID.
TlHERE             arc two principal opinions entertained                                 by phi
losophers      respecting the nature            of      the luminous fluid.                 Some,
with             of Epicurus, think that this fluid is a conti
        the school
nual emanation of the luminous body which throws to a
distance a portion of its substance.  This is what is called
the     emission     of light,         and     was the opinion                     adopted           by
Newton.
     Others, among whom is Euler, think that the luminous
fluid is diffused throughout infinite space, and that it is acted
upon by the luminous              bodies as the air is by sonorous                                  bo
dies.      This opinion        appears         to    Cit.      de la Metherie much
more probable than the former.
     One of the strongest objections made to this opinion                                   is,     that
light   is   never propagated      but in           a   straight line. Objects can
not be seen, except            when no opake body                       is    interposed            be
tween them and the eye, whereas sounds are heard                                         in     everv
kind of direction.             Euler     replied            to this,         by   faying, that
bodies are permeable            to sounds.              Besides there are circum
stances where sounds also cannot be propagated
                                                                                        in in
                                                                                  but      a    right
line; for example,         in   echoes which are heard only                                     a   very
small space.
      Chemists likewise arc divided                  in     their opinions respecting
the     luminous      fluid.     Some believe                it   to be an elementary
substance, and others have confounded                             it   with sire.         Richter
believes that
                    it
                    is   composed        of    the inflammable principle and
caloric.
      Benedict Prevost has endeavoured                        to estimate the gravity
of    the luminous fluid.          He made to float on water verv thin
found plates of tin, and               these       bodies were            repelled when               a
cylinder of        red hot iron was presented to them obliquelv at

focus by       a lens were made to             fall upon them.            Prevost is     of
opinion that the rays of the fun penetrating the tin-plate are
thus combined" with a matter more dense, and form therein
a very expansible             fluid; but being     less subtle,     it becomes sus
ceptible of acting by impulsion on very large masses, and
issuing with impetuosity from the plate, but more rapidly
from the focus, pushes it backwards, and pursues its way
through the water, which acts as a conductor to this fluid.
      The author conjectures, from                 these experiments, that           it is
possible to determine the gravity                 of light.       It is well known
that it takes about eight seconds to come from the fun to the
earth, that is to fay, to traverse               a space     of about thirty-three
millions of             leagues.      According      to some suppositions,             he
finds that the light which in                  a second os     time falls upon the
surface     of a    square league,          containing        2,283 toises on each
side, would         weigh about a dram (gros)                   and a quarter.           It
may be readily perceived                   that all thrse calculations arc very
hypothetical        ;    and we may add, that from some experiments
made      by      Professor      Wilson of Glasgow*, with                  a    view to a
different      object, there is reason for calling in question                        the
essct produced upon the thin plates, or tin foil,                          as   being at
all produced        by the impulse            of light.       Heat only seems to
be here concerned.                   The water    at first    being of an uniform
temperature, has all its parts in a                  state    of equilibrium         and
rest. When the tin foil is heated,                        it is evident that       a very
active cause is introduced tending to destroy that equilibri
um.       Heat being communicated by the tin to the water in
contact with           portion of the water endeavouring
                        it,   that                                                     by
it« expansion to move from under the tin, must tend to move
the tin from its place.

lowing communication,               entitled,
    "  Some Hortulan Experiments                 about the engrafting            of
Oranges- and Lemons              or Citrons,      whereby is produced           an
individual      Fruit,    half" Orange and         half Lemon,        growing
together     as one     Body upon the fame Tree."
    We     have here orange          trees (faith the intelligence          from
Florence),       that bear a fruit which is citron on one side and
orange      on the other.         They have been brought hither out
of other countries,          and they are now much propagated by
ingrafting. This           was    confirmed to       us (fays the    Editor ot
the Transactions of the Royal Society), by a very ingenious
English      gentleman, who           asserted,    that himself     not only
 bad seen,        but    bought       of them, anno         1660,    in Paris,
 whither      they     had been      sent by Genoa        merchants ;         and
 that on some trees he had found an orange on one branch,
 and a lemon on another branch, (which is not so remark-
 able   as    what follows ;)          as   also, one   of   the fame      fruit,
 half  orange and half lemon ; and sometimes                   three quarters
of one,      and a quarter       of  the other.
    In  the third part of the           Reports of the Board of Agri
culture, among the foreign communications,                      we fee, with
equal pleasure and astonishment,               an account     of  the  Ameru
can apple,        which,      by a peculiar mode of budding *, is
half   sweet and       half four, half white and half red, without
the least    confusion of the respective halves.
    At Mr. Mason's, florist, Fleet-street,                opposite    the Bolt

                    INTELLIGENCE.
                                LEARNED                SOCIETY.
 A     H   E   directors of the Imperial Academy of the Searchers
into Nature,             have proposed the following questions as sub
jects for prizes          :                                                                ,
  I.      In which of the known                      parts    of vegetable productions,
the bark           (cortex),       inner bark           (liber),         wood        (alburnum et
lignum), pith (medulla), does the                            sap ascend        ?     Does   reflux
                                                                                            a
of the     sap towards          the root, proportioned to the ascent, take
place in the bark or the pith, or                        in       both     ?   And,      if    this be
the cafe,          by   what way         is   it   conveyed         from the interior parts
to the bark         ?     What      course does               it,   in particular,             take to
pass      through the leaves to the bark                      ?
   The Academy                  particular, that the motion of
                              wishes,         in
the sap     in the bark upwards may be proved or refuted  both                                 ;
 by   a   careful repetition, varying the circumstances,                                  of the    ex
periments which have already been adduced                                       as   a   proof of    it,
and       by   a   sufficient      number of well chosen and appropriate
new experiments.                   The        best    founded           experiments, which
piove the ascent              of   sap   in    plants, have been enumerated                          by
Duhan.tl,           in    Physique des            ytrirts,     b,    v. chap, a, art.           7

 and the most        important of       them are as follows :        1.  If  a
 plant is suffered to imbibe        a coloured     fluid, it ascends in the
 vessels    between    the pith and the bark, penetrates              to the
Jeaves, and then proceeds through the bark a certain space
 downwards,         2. When a plant or a twig is compressed at
 the bottom by        a  ligature,    a   swelling takes place upwards
 towards the ligature.         3. When         the bark  of  a tree is  taken
 off, without injuring the interior part, the upper edge of the
 wound produces a greater quantity of moisture than the
  under.      4. Under these circumstances an excrescence is
  formed on the upper part of the bark, and not on the
  under;     and   the renovation        of  the inner bark, which         has
  been lost, takes place from the top downwards.
      II.   What beneficial       use    may practical medicine derive
 from     Humboldt's well known experiments on Galvanism
  and metallic irritation      ?
      The Academy          expects     that the diseases and cafes, in
   which Galvanism may           be useful,      will  he accurately deter
   mined by proper experiments;                 and that   the experiments
   will   be clearly and fully described.          Experiments, however,
   on persons apparently        dead, are to be omitted.
      The Academy         requests all answers        to these questions,     if
   founded on experiments actually made by the authors, to be
   legibly written in       Latin; to       be inscribed    with any motto
   according to pleasure ; and to be accompanied with a sealed
   note, having on it the same motto, and containing in the
   inside, the name, title and place of residence of the author ;
   and to be transmitted, before the first of October 1799, to
   the president     of  the Academy,          G.  II.  R. von Schreber at
   Erlangen.
       The prize, for      each question,       is a gold medal    of twenty
    ducats   value,   bearing the usual impression,          aud  will be ad
   judged to the author       of the best papers, by the commissioners
    of  the Academy,       on the 5th of January 1S00.

                                 MAGNETISM.
     Wenzel          has proved thai cobalt is susceptible        of magnetic
  attraction,      and has     magnetic poles.        Klaproth has proved
  that the purest nickel, that even of the Chrisoprasus,                 is also
  susceptible     of  the same attraction,      and    has magnetic poles.
  The   serpentine      of Humboldt       has magnetic poles,         but does
 not attract iron.         The   cafe is the fame with several sorts          of
 lava.     Here then are bodies which have polarity,                   without
 attracting      iron.     Are   there   bodies which act upon iron
 without having polarity?            Tralles,   a  geometrician of Berne,
 has taken       very   small fragments      of Humboldt's serpentine,
 ¦which   had very perceptible poles,           and having placed them
 close to very strong magnets,            the poles    of which      were op
 posite to those      of the serpentine,     the poles of the      serpentine^
 became inverted.
                               MINERALOGY.
    Several      mineralogists     think    that the metallic veins          in
mines diminish           always in thickness the deeper they pro
 ceed ;   so   that these veins resemble a kind os wedge, the
base   of which       is directed  towards the surface of the earth,'
and the point towards the centre.               But this is not      precisely
the cafe.        Several    veins appear indeed       to be   of  that form    ;
Hut there are many others,             the form    of which      is quite the
reverie.       Humboldt        fays that the      vein  of Kuhchacht         at
Freyberg,         which     coutains     argentiferous      galena,     grows-
broader, instead of becoming narrower, the deeper it goes;
and yet     it  is one    of  the deepest worked,        as  it proceeds     to
the   depth       of   several   hundreds      of fathoms.         Those     of
Goldcroiiach         in Franconia,      which     contain     arsenical    and
auriferous pyrites, are much broader at a certain depth than
at ihe surfaces.
        COLD PRODUCED BY COMP»ESSED                             AIR.
   Those machines employed for strongly compressing                        at-
musjheric       air are well known.         Professor   Pictet of Geneva
                                                                         says,

                        Pbyjiohgy  Gravity of Water.                                            qxj
says, he has seen this air, thus compressed,                                 produce a very
great degree        of cold when                the cocks         were      opened        to suffer
it   to escape.   To demonstrate this in an easy manner, let a
small     quantity of water be put into a compressing machine.
When        the air escapes,              it.   issues    with     a     hissing      noise,     and
carrjes with        it   a   part    of    the water;             and at the end               of the
operation, the water adhering to the cock, will be found
converted      into ice.       To explain this phenomenon, we may
suppose that        a   portion of the water, which   carried off           is                     by
the air,      is   reduced to an aeriform state, or that                              of vapour.
But this      could not be the cafe,                     unless    a   pretty considerable
quantity of caloric were combined with the vapour.                                               The
remaining drops of water are therefore                              sufficiently deprived
of
                                                is
     it   to be congealed.                It    in       the fame manner that the
rapid evaporation of ether,                     applied       to the ball        of   a   thermo
meter,     makes the liquor speedily descend several degrees.
                                    PHYSIOLOGY.
     Dr. Scemmering             has proved,              bya   great number               of   obser
vations, that the degree                 of intelligence of different animals.
is   always    in   proportion to the bulk                    of   the brain,         compared
with that of the nerves.                        Man       has the most voluminous
brain, and his nerves are very small                          :
                                                                   it
                                                                   is       this which gives
him his high degree of intelligence.  The ass has very large

                   a              Dr. Ebel has published on

soon to be able to lay before our readers.
                             GRAVITY OP WATER,
     Bodies are dilated             by   warmth,          and consequently                become
specifically       lighter the hotter thy are.                         On     the contrary,
they are contracted            cold, and become
                                by                                     so   much denier the-
colder they are.             But this law of condensation                        is   subject to
some exceptions          :    melted metal, for example,                          dilates to       a
certain degree as            it     becomes         solid     ;   water experiences              the:

same dilatation        in congealing.     To find then      the greatest
specific gravity of water, we ought not to take ice,               for we.
know that it swims on water.             We must make choice of a
certain degree       of heat between that of congelation and that
of  expansion.        Experience has determined this point to be
about 410 of Fahrenheit.          Consequently, to find the greatest
quantity of water which can be contained in a vessel of a
given capacity, we must take water at that temperature.
   This circumstance should be attended to in determining
measures      of capacity.     Some people are      so well aware of it
that they buy liquids in cold, and endeavour            to fell them    in
hot weather.
                            METEOROLOGY1.
   On   the 10th instant, about twelve o'clock at night,             a re
markable meteor was observed by one of the masters of the
Free-school at Alnwick,           and another person;        it appeared
in  the south-west,      at a considerable   altitude.   At   first it was
no bigger but far brighter than a common star, but presently
expanded into the form and size of an apothecary's pestle.
It was then obscured by a cloud, which was still illuminated
behind   ;    when the cloud was dispelled, it reappeared with
a direction south and north, with a small long streamer,
cutting the pesHe a little below the centre, and issuing away
to the eastward.         It wa* again obscured, and on its reap
pearance, the streamer and pestle had formed the figure of a
hammer,         or  a cross ; presently    aster the streamer,      which
made the shaft to the hammer, or stalk to the cross, assumed
two horns, at the extreme point towards the east, resembling
a fork.      It was then obscured a third lime, but when the
cloud   passed     over, it was changed into the shape os two half
moons, back to back, having            a short  thick luminous stream
between the two backs ; it then vanished totally from their
fight.     It  is observable,    that every new appearance became
brighter and        brighter, till it became an exceedingly bril
liant object, all the other stars       in comparison      appearing     to
                                                                        be

 The radius of this semicircle was about aa degrees,

 Some said that it was        a sign     of the anger     of God     against the
changes      which had taken place            : others, of an opposite opi
nion,     said that God had crowned the republic                :  others agairi
thought that the great circle which                  seemed to embrace        all
this hemisphere, announced              a  general peace."       The writer of
the account concludes,            " I   had no great       difficulty    in per
suading the majority that these signs were the effect of                     the"
vapours      and exhalations occasioned            by the heat.       Ten  years
ago   I  fliould not have been         so successful."

   Cif. Chaptal, having         been lately engaged in examining the;
causes     of the fixity   of certain     yeHow     colours, has observed,
that the yellow colour extracted from vegetables is in general
in the inverse ratio of its splendour. He has endeavoured to
ascertain     the cause which renders            the pale yellow more du
rable,     and has discovered        it in the existence of the tanning
principle, which         is found united with the yellow principle
in most vegetables.         By analyzing fustic (mortis (infforio) he'
obtained,       ist,  a principle partaking of the nature of resins'
or gums, and which can communicate a beautiful yellow
colour; ad, an extractive principle, which is also yellowy
and furnishes a beautiful colour            ;   3d, a  tanning principle,     of
a1 pale yellow colour,          which grows black in the air and by
ebullition  it      tarnishes the colour of the other two princi
ples.      As it   was necessary to separate the tanning principle,
in order     to leave to the rest the full vivacity          of their colour,'
Chaptal found means to accomplish that object by a simple
and cheap process.          He boiled, with the wood,             some animal
                                                                      substance

substance containing      gelatinous matter, such     as bits of skin,
strong     glue, &c.     The tanning principle      precipitated   itself
with     the gelatinous matter, and       the bath held in solution
only the principles which produce a lively and          strong yellow.
By the help of this process, colours as bright          as those com
municated by yellow weed            {reseda  luteola) and quercitron
bark, may be procured from several vegetables.
                            NEW COINAGE.
    We have       already mentioned (p. aao.) that     it was proposed
 to improve our coin, and that the subject was referred to the
 Royal Academy.           The following     circular notice has been
 since issued to the academicians.

  the fame into their consideration, the president has accord

        In   consequence     of the   above notice, a meeting took place
  at the time appointed, when several drawings and models
  were produced, which were afterwards forwarded to the
  Lords of          the Committee       of Council, for his         majesty's     in
  spection.
       Much ought         to be done.      If historical      facts are not to be
 recorded          on our coins, the whole intellect and                abilities of
 the artists        of Great Britain ought          to be concentrated as it
 were in one focus to produce the acme                     of excellence.

       We     have     to announce that a considerable             improvement
 bas lately been made             on the German-key               for extracting
 teeth.        Mr. Charles Brown,          surgeon,       having for some time
 past turned bis attention to the structure                    and mechanical
powers of those instruments used in the lesser operations of
surgery, it appeared to him, that the German-key most
commonly in use, notwithstanding the various improvements
it    has undergone, partly by professional                men, and partly by
instrument-makers,            was not well calculated to extract             teeth
with       safety and ease.      Having      had great experience           in this
particular branch of surgery, he endeavoured,                    and with suc
cess, to remedy the defects that were still obvious in the                       in
strument.           As   the one produced      by   Mr. Brown        possesses    in
an eminent degree many advantages over all others, we
shall, in a future number, present our readers with a descrip

a        circumstance          mentioned                   Pallas, who fays,          that the

                      Observations    on a
                                             Musi of lion
   irregular and somewhat          compressed figure like a rough gra
  nite;      was covered externally with a ferruginous kind of
   crust; and the inside consisted of malleable iron, brittle when
  heated,      porous like   a large sea sponge,       and having its inter
  stices filled with a brittle hard vitrified substance           of an amber
  yellow colour.         This   texture and the vitrified substance ap
  peared      uniformly    throughout       the whole mass,         and with
  out any traces of flag or artificial fire.
      Dr. Chladni (hows with a great deal of ingenuity, that
  this mass neither originated by the wet method ; nor could
 have been produced by art, the burning of a forest, by light
 ning, or by        a volcanic eruption.          It appears    to him much
 more probable that it is of the fame nature                  as the so  called
  fire-balls {bolides) or flying dragons, and he quotes a variety
 of observations made on these phenomena; from which lie
 endeavours       to prove that they do not arise from an accumu
 lation of the matter of the aurora borealis ;                 a  transition  of
 electricity from one part of the atmosphere                 to another;     aa
 accumulation of porous inflammable substances in the higher
 regions, or the catching sire of a long train of inflammable
 air ; but that their component parts must be considerably
 dense and heavy, as their course fliowsin so apparent a man
 ner the     essects  of gravity;    and because their mass, though           it
 distends      to a monstrous size,         retains   sufficient consistency
 and      weight to continue        an    exceedingly      rapid   movement
through a very large space, without                  being decomposed or
dissolved,       notwithstanding the resistance of the atmosphere.
It    seems to him probable, that this substance is by the effect
of     sire reduced    to a tough fluid condition ; because its form
appears sometimes          round and sometimes elongated, and as
its extending till it bursts,            as well as the bursting itself,
aliows us to suppose           a previous      capability of extension by
eiatlic fluidity.        At any    rate,   it appears to be certain, that
suih      dense matter at    so  great a height is not collected from
particles to be found in our atmosphere, or can be thrown
together into large        masses    by any power with which we are
                                                                 acquainted    ;

                            found in Siberia*                                    3
acquainted; that no power with which we are acquainted
is able to give to such bodies so rapid a projectile force in a
direction almost parallel to the               horizon    ; that   the matter
does not rife upwards from the earth,                  but exists previously
in  the celestial regions, and must have been conveyed                    thence
to our earth.         In  the   opinion       of Chladni,      the   following
is the only theory of this phenomenon that agrees with all
the accounts hitherto given; which is not contrary to na
ture in any other respect          ;     and which     besides seems to be
confirmed by various          masses       found on the spot where they
 fell.
    As earthy, metallic       and other particles form the principal
component parts of our planets, among which iron is the
prevailing part, other planetary bodies may therefore consist
of similar, or     perhaps     the      fame   component parts, though
combined and modified in               a very   different manner.          There
may     also be dense matters accumulated                 in smaller      masses
 without    being in immediate               connexion      with    the    larger
 planetary bodies,       dispersed        throughout infinite      space,     and
 which,    being     impelled     cither      by   some projecting         power
or attraction,        continue     to move until        they approach the
earth or some other body              ;   when being overcome          by their
attractive force, they immediately fall down.                    By their ex
ceedingly great velocity,            still increased    by the attraction       of
 the earth and the violent friction in the atmosphere,                 a strong
electricity    and heat must necessarily              be excited,    by which
 means they are reduced to              a flaming and      melted condition,
 and great quantities of vapour and                different kinds of gases
 are thus disengaged,       which distend the liquid mass to             a  mon
 strous size,   till, by    a still     further expafion      of  these    clastic
 fluids, they must at length burst.             Mr. Chladni thinks           also,
that the greater part of the shooting- stars, as they are called,
are nothing else than fire balls, which differ from the latter
only in this, that their peculiarly great velocity carries them
past the earth at a greater distance,               so that  they are not       so
strongly attracted      by it as to fall down, and therefore            in their

moment,          and are again speedily        extinguished,         when they
get    to such      a diliance from the earth that the air becomes
too much rarefied for the existence              of  fire.
    The    grounds on which        Dr. Chladni founds           the above the
ory, respecting        the  origin of    the before-mentioned            mass     of
iron,     and its similarity to the productions of sire-balls,                 are
further explained by the author in the following manner                         :
    I; As    sire-balls consist ofdense and heavy substances, which
by their exceedingly quick movement, and the friction thence
excited     by the atmosphere,        become      electric,    are reduced        to
a state    of ignition,     and   melted     by the      heat,    so  that they
extend      to a great size, and burst      j it    thence follows, that in
 places where fragments, produced by the bursting                      of  a fire
ball, have been found, substances endowed with all these pro
 perties mull also have been sound.              Iron, however,        the prin
cipal component part of all the              masses     hitherto found,      pos«
idles     all   these  properties    in a very eminent degree.               The
 weight and toughness          of   the principal component             parts     of
 fire-balls, which must be very considerable,                  since,   with   the
 greatest possible distension,        they retain consistence enough to
 proceed with the utmost           velocity through such an immense-
 space without         decomposition of their mass,               and    without
 their progress being obstructed by the resistance of the air,
 agree perfectly well with melted iron j their dazzling white
 light has by many observers been compared to that of melted
 iron ; iron also exhibits the (ame appearances of flaming,
  smoking, and throwing             out sparks,       and all these       pheno
  mena arc most beautiful when they take place in vital air.
  Of   the extension      by clastic fluids expanded        bv the heal, and
  of  the contraction       which follows from cold, traces may be
  discovered      in the internal     spongy    nature ol the iron         masses
  which have been found,            and in     the globular depressions of
  the exterior hard crust, the latter         of which gives         us reason to
  suppose,      that in these places      there    have been air bubbles,
                                                                          w  hich,

                           found      in Sibtria.                                           5
which,     on cooling,     sunk    down.        The mixture of sulphur
found in various masses, agrees also exceedingly well with
the phenomena       of fire-balls,      and     especially            with the great
inflammability     of sulphur in       very thin impure                   air; for it is
well known that suphur in an air-pump                       will      take sire in air
in which few other bodies could do the fame.                               In   regard to
those masses    in which no sulphur was found, this mav have
arisen from the sulphur escaping in vapour, since some time
after the appearance       of fire-balls       a strong smell               os sulphur
has been     perceived.     The     brittleness        of    the Siberian             iron
mass when       heated,    may arise from some small remains                            of
suphur, which may perhaps             be the cause          of   the facility with
which fragments of this mass,           as   well      as that        found at       Aix-
la-Chapellc,    could be roasted.
   2.   The whole    texture of the masses betrayed                       evident    signs
of fusion.     This, however, cannot            have been occasioned                    bv
any common natural or artificial               fire; ana particularly for
this reason,    because iron so malleable is not fusible in such
fire, and, when it is fuled with the addition of inflammable
matters, loses its malleability,           and becomes                like common
raw iron.      The vitrified   substance       in the Siberian                   mass is
equally incapable of being fused in               a     common sire.                  The
sire then must have been          much stronger than that produced
bv the common natural and artificial means,                           or the fusion
must    have been effected by the          force of exceedingly                     strong
electricity, or perhaps        both    causes       may have               been com
bined together.
   3. Besides the similarity of the above-mentioned masses,
the circumstances respecting their falling are so like, that
they cannot be considered          as merely      accidental, and there
fore give more credibility to the accounts.                      This being           pre
mised, the      principal question      then     is,    whether the pheno
mena of this kind observed were the effects of thunder,                                 or
*rose   from detached       fragments        of sire-balls            ?   Several cir
cumstances     quoted     bv Dr.   Chladni      seem        to oppose the idea
of their arising from thunder          ;   but agree             so   perfectly with
                                       B   3                                         every

6                    Observations      on a   Mass of Iron
every circumstance remarked in regard to fire-balls, that, with
out asserting any thing absurd, every relation of this kind may,
he fays, be admitted in their full and literal extent. In the at
testations respectingthatof          Agram, it is mentioned that several
people,     in different parts      of the kingdom, saw and observed
the bursting       of  the fire-ball,     and    heard    its   explosions       and
noise in the atmosphere,             and perceived      also thai something
fiery sell from the heavens,             so   that it was       a  circumstance
generally known           in the neighbourhood,            only      that on ac
count of the distance            it was not exactly known                  in what
place it had         fallen.    Hence it may be concluded,                    that it
was no effects of lightning,            but an actual fire-ball.             Light
 ning, at    a time pf     the year when storms are not uncommon,
 would not have excited universal              attention, much          less  would
 it   have been     observed     at a great       distance    as a falling fiery
 mass.       From the similarity        of   the   masses,     it is also highly
  improbable       that, in all the places where they were found,
  fusible parts only should have been               discovered,        and    should
  have been changed in the same manner by                     lightning;        espe
   cially  as   in  places    struck    by lightning no mafles                of   the
  like kind       have   been     found,      but    always vitrified          earthy
   particles, &c.
       4. It is totally incomprehensible how, on the high (late
   mountains, where the Siberian mass was found, at a con
   siderable distance from the iron mines;               in the chalky soil of
   the extensive plains of America, where for                  a   hundred miles
   around there arc no iron mines, and not even                      so  much as a
   stone to be found;        and at    Aix-la-Chapelle, where,              as  far  as
    the author knows,        there are no iron works,             so  many ferru
    ginous particles could be collected in            a small space, as         would
    be necessary to form masses           of  1600,    15000,      and 17000, up
    to 33600 pounds.             This circumstance sliows that these
    masses could as little have been fused by lightning, as by
    the burning of a forest, or of fossil coal.                      These masses
    were   found quite exposed            and    uncovered, and not             at any
    depth in the earth, where we can much more readily admit
                                                                                  such

                             found in Siberia.                                y
 such an accumulation           of ferruginous particles to have been
 melted by the effects of lightning.
     Should it be asked how such masses originated, or by
 what means they were brought into such an insulated posi
 tion; this question would be the same as if it were asked
 how the planets originated.           Whatever hypotheses we may
 form, we must either admit that the planets,                if   we except
 the many revolutions           which     they    may have      undergone,
 either on or near their surface,          have always been since their
 first information,     and ever    will be the fame;      or that nature,
 acting on created         matter,    possesses    the power to produce
 worlds and whole systems, to destroy them, and from their
 materials to form new ones.               For   the latter opinion      there
 are,   indeed, more grounds than for the former,                as alterna
tions of destruction and creation are exhibited by all organized
 and unorganized bodies en our earth; which gives us reason
to    suspect   that   nature, to which greatness          and    smallness,
considered     in general,    are merely relative terms, can produce
more effects of the fame kind on             a larger scale.     But many
variations have been observed on distant bodies, which, in
some measure,        render    the bst opinion       probable.       For   ex
ample, the appearing and total disappearing of certain stars,
when they do not depend             upon periodical changes.           If   we
now admit that planetary bodies have started into existence,
we cannot suppose that such an event can have otherwise
taken place,      than   by conjecturing        that either particles       of
matter,     which     were    before   dispersed     throughout      infinite
space,    in  a more soft and chaotic           condition,     have united
together in large masses, by the power of attraction               ;  or that
new planetary bodies have been formed from the fragments
of much larger ones that have been broken to pieces, either
perhaps    by some external       (hock, or by an internal explosion.
Let whichever of         these   hypotheses    be the truest,     it is not
improbable,      or at least not contrary to nature,        if  we suppose
that a large quantity of such            material particles, either on
account of their too great distance,           or because prevented        by
                                   B 4                           a stronger

a stronger      movement in another direction,              may not have
united themselves to the larger accumulating mass of a new-
world; but have remained insulated, and, impelled by some
shock, have continued           their course through infinite           space,
until    they approached     so near to some      planet   as to be    within
the sphere of its attraction,           and   then by falling down            t©
occasion     the phenomena before mentioned.
    It  is worthy    of remark, that iron        is the   principal      com
ponent part of all the      masses   of this kind hitherto      discovered ;
that it is     found almost     every    where on the surface of the
earth,    as a  component part of many substances in the vegta-
ble and animal kingdom;           and that the effects of magnetism
give us reason to conclude, that there is a large provision of
it in the interior parts of the earth. We may therefore
conjecture that iron, in general, is the principal matter em
ployed in the formation of new planetary bodies                  ;  as is  still
further probable by this circumstance,              that   it is exclusively
connected with the magnetic power *               ; and also on account
of their polarity, may         be necessary      to these bodies.         It   is
also probable,      if the  above    theory be just,       thai other sub
stances      contained    in such     fallen masses,     such as sulphur,
siliceous earth, manganese,          &c.    may be peculiar not to our
globe alone, but may belong to the common materials em
 ployed in the formation of all planetary worlds.

IT is     much      to be wished, that men practically                versed   in
the various manufactures of Britain would turn their atten
tion to the best means of disseminating                 a   knowledge     of the
principles and        operations which         have been determined by
experience as the best to be followed in the large way, ac
cording to local and other circumstances.                      A    candid and
liberal communication           of individual        observation, by pro
moting the common interest,               would tend ultimately           to the
benefit of each manufacturer, by the increased improvement
and perfection of their various articles              ;  for the real welfare
of any particular branch          depends     less  upon the superiority of
one man's article over that              of another, in        the fame     line,
than upon the general superiority of a national product over
 that of any other country  a preeminence that depends
entirely on the aggregate             mass of industry,          ingenuity and
 intellect exerted on the one or the other.
     What I recommend          is the more necessary,             as inaccurate
and fallacious principles are often brought forward by men
 of science, even the best intentinned, from a want of that
 practical knowledge, which can only be acquired by a Ion"
 and personal acquaintance with the processes carried on in
 the large     way    of manufacture.          The mischiefs         hence    oc
 casioned     are incredible    :    it tends    to separate       the man      of
 science     and   the manufacturer;          it  (hackles     the latter   with
 increasing prejudice;         makes      him     view the      former with a
 suspicious    eye ; is the principal reason why science has beeu
 so  long excluded from our manufactories                 ;  and why the ac
 curate results    of  the laboratory have so long been despised by

 io                    Stridures on    Mr.     Collier's
mcnt on an extended              scale.     The    artist   and    the man      of
science should mutually           inform each other          :  principles will
then, and not till then, acquire consistence and correctness,
and their value       will  be established     on the surest foundation.
    The    precept   I inculcate I      stiall myself follow,        to the best
of my ability, by communicating,                  through the medium           of
the Philosophical Magazine,            a series  of  papers intended as an
introduction to       a  knowledge of the manufacturing of iron in
this country, with details of the various processes in                   use : to
be followed by        a series of experiments        relative    to the princi
ples   of iron   and steel, which have occupied my leisure time
for some years past, and which present some facts not gene
rally known.          But   as it   may    tend to clear the path, and
enable me afterwards to proceed                 with    less   interruption,     I
shall in this paper confine myself chiefly to the                 corrtctingof
some mistakes        into which      Mr. Collier,       in his Observations
on Iron and Steel,         has been betrayed          by a want       of know
ledge     in  the   mechanical       processes      now in use, and           the
minute       practical    details   of   the    various modifications          of
iron.      These   can only be deduced,           with certainty, from          a
keen, personal, and long continued investigation os the con
firmed modes of practice on            a large scale.        To   spread infor
mation, on     these   interesting subjects, and to correct erroneous
opinions,      formed from the perusal             of writers eminent in
the scientific walks of life, are the reasons stated by                      Mr.
Collier for presenting the public with his observations.                      To
pass    over   his  observations      in silence,     would be doing him
as    well as  the public injustice,        since it would be to aid the
dissemination of that eiror,           which     he so laudably wisties to
root out; in his endeavours              to the performance           of which,
 he surely oimht to meet with             the assistance and approbation
of   every one interested       for the welfare and          prosperity   of his
country.
    One rock on which          Mr. Collier splits,       is in censuring and
quoting the French chemists, and others, without recollect-
 in<r  whether the fuel used it the same in France as in
                                                                        Britain  ;

Britain     ;   and      also that chemical            writers in general, from
necessity       as     often     as    choice,       confine   their experiments
simply to the laboratory                  :    these,   however accurate,           will
always be found materially varied when followed out on a
large scale.
     When        M.      Fourcroy       states     the length    of time    necessary
for cementing steel, most evidently he alludes, not to                              steel
 manufactured             in the      large      way,   but to that      effected      in
 chemical experiments ; else, he never could have mentioned
 an earthen       low       It  is well known that bars            of iron  f th  of an
 inch     in thickness,            the    length is no way           material,       will
 pass    into the        state   of   good steel during        12 hours    cementa
 tion with         a    white heat.             Had M, Fourcroy meant any
 other than barjleel, he would not have mentioned iron as
 the substance to be operated upon.
      In   regard       to the time necessary for cementing steel on a
 large scale,       Mr. C.       has struck the extreme          from the chemical
  gentlemen whom he quotes, and who only give the results
  from their laboratories                   In the lengthened process of 16
  days,     stated      by   Mr. C.      as    being the requisite      time for ce
  menting malleable iron into steel, he includes the time which
  the    furnace is allowed to cool,                   before   the workmen           can
  penetrate to the contents; and this period may be lengthened
  or shortened from local circumstances.                       The    process,    I  pre
   sume,      is reckoned        complete when the iron is deemed suf
   ficiently saturated with carbon: this is judged of by the trial
   bars : if these are found perfect, then the whole conversion
   will   be in      a   similar   state :      should the furnace after        this re
   main     a   month unemptied,                 this adds Bothing to the real
   length       of time         necessary       for cementation : I have seen
   several     instances,         where       tht workmen        have    emptied the
   furnace of high converted                    steel, for drawing into        German
    steel, upon the          1 ith day.
       It would        be a very difficult matter for          Mr. Collier      to point
    out any greater advantage                   which    steel possesses,    than that
    poticed by Mr. Nicholson                   ; namely, its property       of  beco    n

in short,         all its utility, when manufactured into the mauy
various instruments of use, is derived                        from this unrivalled
peculiarity of          the metal-
    It ij     impossible       to discover      what could have            led   Mr. C.
in attempting              an explanation          of    the    use   oF   "   plunging
into water,"             to say,     that it is done to prevent                the steel
"   reluming to the              state  of malleable iron :" liie fallacy of
this assertion must be obvious to the least intelligent work-
man.          Plunging and heating alternately arc                       U.e speediest
methods            for    bringing        steel    back      to malleability       :   the
fcldomer it is plunged or heated,                      the longer it      ail!  preserve
the carbonic              principle,      and     consequently'         remain      good.
 Has Mr.          C.   been      told   that    at steel     manufactories,        where
bar     steel    is drawn into shapes,             and bars       of various dimen
sions, that all these arc immersed                    in water,     left they stiouW,
if   left without this precaution to cool                      in the open air, be
come malleable iron?                  Were this the cafe,           steel  could never
be subjected           to the file  nor could file* be struck                because
l'tcel    could not then exist unless in                   a  hardened      stale.     Let
me ask Mr. Collier, whether, at those manufactories of steel
which         he has frequented,             the     trial bars taken         from     the
aperture        of the furnace were found, when cold, in the stale
of malleable iron, or               otherwise     ?
    The       note at the bottom             of   page 47 is c-xtiemcly            vague.
 Can there be an expression more indefinite,                           than that       " a
 partial abstraction of oxygen takes place by plunging hot
 metal into cold water?" From what is the oxygen ab
 stracted      ?    Is it from the hot metal, or is it the oxygen of
 the decomposed             water    ?  If from     the former, pray what state
 of    the metal does           Mr. C. allude         to  ?  Pure   fie el c>  ntains no
 oxygen       ;  malleable iron, properly manufactured, is also void
 of    the base       of   vital  air: crude iron alone contains oxygen,

that the oxygen of the               decomposed        water partially         united
with the hot metal            :     this,    without further explanation,
would       be  (till very unsatisfactory j           since it docs not specify
 the modification         of the metal operated            upon,      l'lunge veiy
hot malleable iron into cold water, and                      part of the water
 will   be decomposed        ;   its oxygen      will unite with       a  portion     of
the iron; this portion,               however, will be found to                  have
 separated from        the bar or mas*,           to have       loll its metallic
 brilliancy and weight, and to have pa fled into the stale of a
 black oxyde. Similar phenomena Like place in treating
 steel after the same        manner.         Crude iron       in less    susceptible
 of changing its metallic fracture               by Inch treatment; though
 it is rendered very infusible by the expulsion of its carbon.
     Mr. C.      fays that
                                " blast   furnaces      are like two four-fided
 pyramids joined          base to base     ;" Mr. Chaptal           lays llie samu
 thinss, and such       I question      not may be their shape in France.
  In Britain however          they are entirely conical, excepting 6 or
  7    sect at  the under end, which forms a square Inline!                         :   a
  more just idea of the figure would be conveyed by comparing
  them to two inverted            c< nes,   the bale      of   the larger resting
  upon that of the smaller.
      In charging     the furnace      Mr. Collier       ha* forgot to mention
  the    principal    material, and          its  proportions,       viz. the ors,
  and erroneously states, that            "   equal portions       of    coal cinder
  and     lime-stone"       are introduced, without even mentioning
  whether these proportions are by measure or weight.                              The
  proportions of ore, coal, and lime-stone, are very various at
  different works;          the whole        depending upon an               intimate
  union      and    knowledge       of   the quantity        and quality       of    the
  various principles and substances                  contained      in    each   :   the
  proportion       of materials        besides     is varied      at pleasure,         to
  produce ihc quality of crude iron wanted.
      At    some     works the quantity of lime                used is     1  to 3     of
   cinders by weight,           but this is an       rxcdlive proportion,           and
  is only      necessary to correct the             impurities      of    some iron
                                                                               stones ;

  stones ;   in common       i  to 4 or 5 is used, and where Cumber
  land or Lancashire          ore   is smelted in contact with        wood-
  charcoal, J5th will abundantly suffice.
      From Mr. Collier's description, a person            unversed    in   the
  mode of conducting blast furnaces would                  be apt to con
  ceive that the furnace was first charged, and then kindled to
  effect reduction     :   this of course conveys an idea that fre
  quent filling and kindling are necessary.               The furnace        is
  first sufficiently heated with coal cinder alone;           the charging
 then commences, and continues hourly for a great length
 oflimc!  two, three, and four years : instances have been
 of    a  furnace continuing to smelt,           without much interrup
 tion, for nine     years.
    The mention of bellows is         a proof howdesicientMr.Collier'9
 information      has been respecting        the present general     state  of
 machinery       attached     to iron works.       Excepting     a very few
 charcoal furnaces, all the blast furnaces in Britain are sup
 plied with air from cast-iron cylinders of various dimensions,
 constructed on various plans. The compression of air from
 these is greater than could possibly be obtained by means                  of
 bellows, more fit for combustion, and capable               of supporting
 a  column of mercury of six inches, which              is equal to 6,784
 feet   of water.     By such     a  heavy compression     of air,  1500    to
 1800 cubical feet       will   pass  through the discharging pipe into
the furnace in one minute,              when its diameter does not ex
ceed     2f or 3 inches at most.
     Mr. Collier writes with more information on                the manu
facturing of bar iron.          Still however hedoes not distinguish,
with sufficient accuracy, between the various processes. The
second      method he describes is only followed out where bar
iron is manufactured with charred wood: the effects produced
by the     use  of wood-charcoal         are so material,   that they un
doubtedly merited         to be   mentioned,     and particularly distin
guished from those of charred or raw pit-coal.
     One of the principal operations, well known by the name
of   the Puddling       Process,    is very  slightly noticed,     and in a
                                                                    manner

                    Observations    on Iron and Stcil.                    I j
manner not easily to be understood.            Dr. Beddoes       has lately-
given   a    more     accurate detail of the       various phenomena
exhibited during that operation*.
   The substitution of       large rollers, in place   of   the stamping-
hammer,       is well calculated to overcome         a large quantity      of
iron, and for imposing             on the bar a beautiful            finish,
especially    if  afterwards    passed   under a small      tilt-hammer;
but the quality of the iron must still              be inferior    to that
manufactured         with   heavy hammers.         The    compression      of
the bar, on all sides, when            passing   through the grooved
rollers, must tend to enfold, rather than expel, a portion                 of
the slug   ;   whereas     the   heavy blows of     a  hammer, which
with the helve weighs from 3 to 40001b. cannot fair more
entirely to dissipate all the substances fused in contact with
the iron,     and to give a degree       of fibre   and tenacity not to
be acquired by a regular and continued pressure.
   Numerous and diversified are the opinions respecting the
existing causes, which          constitute the very great difference,
in quality, between the bar iron manufactured in Great
Britain, and that made in Sweden, Siberia, Spain, Sec. I
have    reason     to   imagine    that this difference arises neither
from the       rust,   acquirtd    by  the iron being laid in damp
 places, nor yet from the superior richness of the foreign ores.
In Siberia      and Sweden the iron is pushed             off to market at
staled periods, and becomes comparatively old kept, merely
from the great distance it has to travel before it can reach a
market.       Mr. Collier      seems inclined     to impute this supe
riority to   a greater    quantity of iron contained in the ore ;
and to its being more destitute          of mixtures    :  hence he    states
 the average     of  the Swedisli ores to be 70 pounds pure iron 
 crude iron he must mean          in  the hundred, and English ores
 30 to 40.       I have seen many of the northern ores, some of
 them very rich in iron, equal to 65 and 70 per cent, j but
 many more of them not yielding beyond 40, and some of
 them as low      as  so. Norwegian      ore from the mine       of Horke-

                                                                      Dhal

Dhal-Gnibe       is powerfully obedient to the magnet, yet yields
only 31 pounds in 100 of the ore.
    Admitting, however, that rich ores make a superior qua-
lily of iron, why then arc not such qualities produced from
the ores found in Cumberland            or Lancashire, since the hæ
matites and kidney of the former are as rich in iron as the
finest Swedish ores     ?  Mr. Collier     should    have distinguished,
too, between the argillaceous ores,            commonly called        iron
stones,    sound   in strata more or less inclined to the horizon,
so   universally diffused and smelted        ;  and those    of Cumber
land and Lancashire, formed into knobs, or in vertical strata,
which arc only partially used.         The former       are the only ores
used in quantity to produce gray crude iron, and contain                  of
iron from 18 to 4a pounds in 100: the latter are used in
great part for fabricating the inferior qualities of crude iron,
such as ship ballast,     forge pigs, &c. &c.          The Cumberland
ore exhibits a variety      of qualities   and   proportions of iron:
   The    fine Hæmatites ore yields      of iron   68 to 7olbs. per 100.
               Kidney        -                     60 to 63.
               Common              -     -        53 to 60.
   Lancashire ore will be found to yield, upon an average,
57 pounds iron in 100.
    I should be apt to ascribe      the general superiority      of foreign
iron over British,      solely to the use of wood charcoal            in all
the   stages  of the operation   ;   and the superiority      of the indi
vidual fabrics over each other, to the native excellence of
the iron contained in the ore.             It is well known that the
Swedish marks of bar iron,AsVnd O                       O, are manufac
tured from a peculiar ore, found in the mine               of Danimora     ;
and that no other Swedisti        ores yield such a      quality of iron,
even when manufactured in the same manner and with the
same fuel. It is the fame in Siberia, where the old and new-
fable fabrics have gained, by the native superiority of the
iron contained in the ore, an excellence little inferior to the
 principal Swedish marks.            From numerous experiments I
 am convinced, that the iron contained in our iron-stones, or
                                                                     irgil-

   argillaceous ores of iron, is in many of                a superior quality,
   and capable    of producing bar iron       equal to foreign,       if treated
   in the same manner       : this, however, is out        of the question      in
   Britain,   and can never be a subject         of general contempla
   tion  ; though by those who have opportunity the experiment
   might be made.
      Most of the bog ores of Sweden and Rusiia contain                       less
   iron than some of our iron-stones, and give out a much less
   portion  of volatile matter in torrefying;             so that such iron
   stones, by severe torrefaction, might be reduced             to contain as
   much iron in 60 or 63 parts as in 100 when in a raw state.
   Several of the sine iron-stones found in Lanarkshire are
  composed as follows:
      Iron                             40
      Carbonic acid, sulphur, occ.38, which flies offin torrefying.
      Clay, lime   and silex            32
                                     100 parts: so that in 100 pounds
  of iron-stone thus    roasted,    there would be contained of iron
  64^    pounds.    Ores in such      a state,  and containing          such a
  quantity ol iron, would most likely smelt            ti   great advantage
  in contad with wood -charcoal.             In distinguishing the qua
  lities of crude iron, Mr. Collier has copied the. French
  writers, without      adverting to the difference between the
  fracture of crude iron manufactured with pit-coal, and that
 produced with the charcoal of wood              ;   this last is that de-
 Icribed by the French metallurgists.              Crude iron manufac
 tured with pit-coal     is either white, mottled; or gray          :  of    the
 latter colour there are many sliadis;              the darker the gray,
 aud the larger the grain,        the softer and more fusible          is the
quality of    the iron.    T hese properties are expressly derived
from, aud dependent upon, the proportion of fuel                 used   in re
duction;      the greater the quantity of fuel, the larger and
more brilliant will be the grains of the fracture of the metal.
The carbon contained in         crude iron  for      all  crude iron con
tains cat bonwillbe in exact proportion to the relative quan-

thy of fuel made use of. Mr. Collier asserts, that         the second
state of the metal only contains it; and although           he admits
of a third Hate of crude iron, manufactured with a          still larger
proportion of fuel, he lakes no notice of the invariable conse
quence, viz. an extra combination os carbon. Query, Can it
be said with propriety, that crude iron hold* carbon in solu
tion, when it can be separated from it by simple mechanical
division ?
    It is to be wished that    Mr. Collier    had furnished an ana
lysis  of those ores, found in   the neighbourhood      of Sheffield,
which he fays contain phosphat of iron, and from which
they derive their cold short quality : if the property of form
ing cold short irons is a proof of the existence of phosphat of
iron in the ore, then     I know of no     ores that do not contain
it;   as  I have never seen crude iron       that could not he con
verted into cold short iron,     at pleasure,    by the management
of the process of malleability.        I would not wish       to deny
the existence of fiderite  1 cannot  for it is already       an esta-
blislicd truth;    but I cannot subscribe lo its being the exist
ing, alterative principle in the ore, which contaminates the
iron, and renders it brittle when cold ; unless I am con
vinced, bv its having been precipitated from tbe o>v, before it
came in contact with combustion. The great Lavoisier him
self appears to have been uncertain, whether the substance
called sidcrite    was a binary combination or not: hence he
classes  it among   the phosphurets, and expresses his doubts          of
the oxygen.it ion   of the phosphorus Mr. Chaptal, however,
in experiments, which I suppose have been made posterior
to  Mr. Lavoisier's publication,        has proved it to he a real
solution of iron in the pholphoric acid.          What    I   contend
for is this, that the siderite of iron may be an unknown com
bination, formed during the process of making the iron mal
leable.     At   some suture period     I shall enter more at large
into what I     conceive  to be the existing causes     of cold      and
short hot irons, and adduce experiments for their support.

    The account of case-hardening is very unsatisfactory                        ;   and
although the analogy betwixt it and the cementing of                               steel
be great, yet it would puzzle any one to make bar steel from
iron by following             the process described       ;   and   still  more to
produce        bar    steel   from cast-iron,       by   cementing         it in the
manner mentioned by                 Mr. Collier.
     I  hope    Mr. Collier will       not feel offended        by the freedom
with which          1   have examined his observations. Great are the
improvements wished for, and expected,                      in the manufactur
ing of iron       ;    and it is only by nnmerous experiments,                      and
liberal dis'-ustions, on the subject,             that these great desiderata
 are to be obtained.

 JL     LATIXA          is a metal    exceedingly refractory, unchange
able, very compact,                and capable    of receiving       a sine   polish.
 This singular metal has never yet been found but in the gold
 mines of Choro.               The Spaniards gave it the name of juan

 rounded.        These grains are irregular, ductile, aniTfwseeptible
 of being attracted by the loadstone.                   It   is never pure,          and'

 ao                        Observations       on  Platina,
  and   its colour inclines a little more to that              of  silver than   to^
  that of iron.
      During     the time      I  resided     at Corunna      in 1770,     the  in-
  tendant general of Galicia, I'ittra Buena, who came origi
  nally from Saiut-Malo, made me                   a present of a small ingot
  os platina,      which was combined with a great deal of zinc
  and red copper. This ingot, which weighed about eight
 ounces, was in Spain considered                  as a  very rare and curious
  specimen.        Buflbn afterwards gave me two dishes of                 a  mix
 ture altogether similar,            which       had   been manufactured at
 Lima.        If  platina be thus manufactured in Peru, it needs
 excite no wonder that travellers have not thought it worth
 while    to bring      to Europe      works made by          a  mixture which
 deprives      this metal of the advantages               it has in its natural
 (late over all other metallic substances.
     It is believed      that platina was not known              in Europe be
 fore   the appearance         of Don Antonio            de  Ulloa's Voyage,
 printed in 1748 : but it appears that it was                 known to Julius
 Scalier ; for he mentions a similar metal in one of his works
 printed at Franckfort            in 1601.         "  Know also,"        says  he,
 "   that in Honduras,         a district between        Mexico     and   Darien,
 there are mines which contain a metal never yet brought to
 a state   of   fusion    by fire, or by any of the arts employed               hy
 the   Spaniards'."         Scaligcr then knew that there had been
 discovered,      between      Mexico       and   the isthmus of Darien,          a
 metal so refractory that the Spaniards had never been able to
melt it.     He    made use      of this    as an  argument against Jerome
Cardan,       whom he attacked on account of the definition he
 had given       of metals.        This    passage,   which is curious and
decisive,    was pointed out to me by Izquierdo,                 director of his
Spanish majesty's cabinet, who is not only an able naturalist,
but well acquainted with the arts, to which he is                        a friend
and a patron.

    In  the Memoirs      of  the Swedish Academy for 17,51, there
is an account of several experiments on plalina,              by Theodore
Scheffer;     but the most       interesting of     these is one     which
proves that     this metal may be reduced             lo complete     fusion
when united with        a verv small     quantity of arsenic.     William
Lewis, who       made    a valuable series       of experiments on       the
fame subject, would not repeat the experiment of Schesser,
because it appeared       to him absurd to reduce a refractory me
tal to a state     of fusion, by      means     of  a substance    which    a
moderate heat        sublimes and         volatilizes,    'she illustrious
Turgot,     whose    talents   and virtues, superior        to the age     in
which he lived, will be handed down to the remotest poste
rity,   sent to Peru during his administration the celebrated
botanist    Dombei.       This    voyage,    the object   of which com
prehended      great   and enlarged      views, was of equal       import
 ance   to the arts and the sciences ; and Dombei,               according
 to the instructions given        him,   was to spare no pains to pro
 cure for men of science such          a  quantity of platina     as  might
 be useful to them in their researches.            Turgot, whose know
 ledge   in natural philosophy was profound and extensive, had
 foreseen that a metal        indestructible by its nature would bo
 of inestimable      value in the construction         of  telescopes,   and
 of   those instruments which navigators employ at sea to de
 termine the longitude by the distance              of the    sun and stars
 from the moon.           All   opaque bodies       are not equally pro
 per for reflecting the light in a regular manner,              and indeed
  those which possess this useful property are very sew in num
 ber.     Tempered      steel, pyrites known         under the name of
 the Inca's stone, and glass covered at the back with tin, can
 not be employed in forming              specula for telescopes,     though
 they reflect the light regularly.          The violent friction neces
  sary lo polisti tempered      steel ; the nature     and    imperfections
  of  pyrites ; the    difficulty of avoiding double refraction in
 quickGlvered glass,       are the causes which prevent          these sub
  stances   from being used.          Opticians,     therefore, have      hi
  therto been obliged to employ for this purpose              a metal   com-

 which they vary to           a certain degree.     This metal, which is
 attacked      by all acids, soon tarnishes        when exposed      to the
 air.    To    preserve     the polish  necessary    to these specula,    re
 quires   a Ciire and     attention which few people          can bestow;
 and   the great superiority         of reflecting   over refracting tele
 scopes ha.s not induced astronomers               to give them the pre
 ference,     as it is exceedingly difficult to guard them from rust,
 especially      when they are frequently used in the night-time.
    Herschel, however, did not entertain the same apprehen
 sions ; and       by means of       a large   reflecting telescope,    that
celebrated        astronomer was       enabled    to discover   the planet
which      bears his name.         With this instrument      also he made
other intere sting discoveries.           Herschel, we are assured, em
ploys magnifying            powers which      astonish   all astronomers;
but when they shall employ the like means to examine the
stars, their astonishment          may perhaps be lessened.        We     are
indeed taught by experience, that the image of an object is
never very distinct, unless it occupy on the retina the space
of half     a   minute   ;   and  we may assure ourselves      of this, by
looking       at   Jupiter through a good reflecting or refracting
telescope,       which magnifies the diameters of objects more
than a hundred times.             The   disk of Jupiter, which will        be
well defined on being magnified to this degree, ceases to be
so when the magnifying power of the telescope is reduced to
four or five times.           This fact  is confirmed by a scries    of ex
periments made at Calais by my colleague Fourcroy.                      It   is
then evident, that extraordinary magnifying powers are more
 favourable than hurtful in observations             made on objects the
diameters of which arc infinitely small.
    If  the discoveries       of Herschel    were not sufficient to show
the great superiority of reflecting over refracting telescopes,
it would not be difficult to call in theory to the aid of expe
rience   ;   and    it might be proved, that the aberration of re-
frangibility, which cannot take place in reflectors, is never
entirely removed in the best achromatic telescopes.                     The
                                                                       laws

dispersion     are    susceptible      of variations.        The    substance     of
glass    is never perfectly homogeneous.                  Reflection,      optical
illusions, and llie      loss  of light,    are unavoidable in achtoraatic
telescope*,     on account         of"   the    multiplicity    of  glasses em
ployed     in their construction         ;  but the specula oi telelcopes,
whatever be the nature of the substance                    of which they aro
 composed,      are not liable to the same faults.
    In  speaking     of achromatic         telescopes,     it is impossible      not
to recollect, that the immortal blulcr was led to the disc ivtrv
of   them by a reasoning          purely metaphysical.             By reflecting
 on the structure        of  the    eye,    this great geometrician con
cluded, that the Supreme Being had composed that organ
of different humours, onlv for the purpose of destroying the
aberration of refraugibilitv.                If the metaphysical ideas of
Eider on the       structure     of    the    eye do not accord         with the
numerous experiments which                    my colleague Tenon enabled
ine to make on            the humours which compose that organ                      ;
the inference he ittew from them                  was not lei's happy,        since
it suggested to him the plan of making achromatic telescopes
by employing two different refracting substances.                              'J he
Knglifli exclaimed           at first     again this idea of Enter; but
John Dolloud, who             at first opposed that eminent mathema
tician's theory-,       found in the great difpei lion of flint glass
the means      of   realizing it. The nature of the researches of
 that ingenious optician, aud the advantages                   he derived     from
 them,     have    well entitled him to (hare \sith                 Eider in the
glory of this noble and important discovery.
    The    glass of lead    is not the only kind that causes             a  strong
dispersion ; for several          other kinds of metallic glass            possess
the fame useful property.              Some philosophers have imagined
that tbere is a constant relation between the specific gravity
of glass and its dispersion; but it is to be remarked, that
the dispersion      which takes place in ether and spirit os wine
is stronger than that produced                 in water, which is a much
heavier liquor.         Though opticians hitherto hate employed

view only the improvement of flint glass,                           I (hall here offer
some observation?,                which      may be      of use   to those who wish
to become candidates for the prizes.
     Flint    glass     is    brought      to us     from England in very thin
plates.         It is blown into globes, which                     are    cut up and
stretched out when they have attained                        to the proper size and
thickness.           Blown glass will consist of parallel layers,                   if the
workman is not able to take up at once the necessary qnan-
tity of matter           ;  and these layers,          the   junction of which           is
    *
      This    idea has been realized by Dr.          Dhir of Edinburgh.        Flint  glass
reflect1;   the giccn light considerably         less than  crown glass, in proportion
to the whole refraction           of red and violet light; so that when the diver
gency of the red and violet light c-used by the redaction of the two
mediums        is equal,   the divergency       of  the red and ereen light is always
greater in the cmwn than in the flint glass, and the divergency                     of  the
violet and green light is always           less  in the crown than in the flint glass.
Afier     a variety of experiments, Dr. Blair discovered that the rnuiiatic
and nitric acids, which are dispersive fluids of considerable strength,
instead     of refracting the green light less than crown glass,         in proportion to
 the whole refraction          of the ted and violet light, refracted     the gieen light
more than crown glass in proportion to the whole refraction of red and
 violet light; he thcrvfoicmi.\cd these two kinds of dispersive mediums
 and thus o: tained a medium which disperses the rays much more than
 i rown glass, and yet causes them          all to diverge accurately in thesarnc pro
 portion in which they ate made                to diverge   by the refraction   of crown
 glass;   whiih     entirely lemoves the aberration         fiom the unequal refrasgi-
 bility of light. For this discovery Dr. Blair hasobtained              a patent.   Edit.
    +  This memoir,          the author tells us in a note, was read on bis public
admission        into the Academy of Sciences at Paris, in the year 17"6. It
 was printed in the second part           of his foi/age to Martagntcar; but that
part, owing to an             accident   whish could neither       !* foreseen nor pre

rarely perfect, will form laminæ, that may be easily observed
on looking at the edge of the glass.               Undulating       threads are
almost always found also at the joinings                of the layers.        Op
ticians distinguish        two kinds of these threads, the                first of
which     they call ropes,      because they are        full and of different
densities    :  they are always prejudicial to the goodness               of   op
tical instruments.          The     second    are less    troublesome,         but
more common.              They   are capillary tubes,         tchich produce
two pencils of light in a direction                 perpendicular to their
 axes.
    I  have already given,         in  a  work entitled Memoires          fur la
Mecbanique        et  la Pbyjique,     a  method of obtaining large ob
ject glasses from thin plates of flint glass, and of freeing
them from theads when their disposition in the substance
of    the   glass does     not render it impossible.            This    process,
which     I  have still brought to greater perfection,              consills     in
exposing the glass to           a   sire sufficiently strong        to melt it.
 When      the glass is soft,     it must be rolled up with a pair               or
 iron    pincers, and formed            into  a   cylinder three inches in
 thickness.       Those folds which would infallibly               result    from
 too rapid bending ought to be carefully avoided.                    The eJges
of  the glass must be kept in by a           ring of clay.      The cylinder
 must then be left in the furnace a sufficient length                 of time    to
 be annealed ; and when this operation is terminated, it must
 be polished,      in order   to discover its faults.        It  is then to be
 fawn through at the places most filled with threads,                     and to
 be put into the furnace a second               time to give it the proper
 form.
    The detail into which             I   have   entered on the nature           of
glass proper for optical purposes,             ought not to make us lose
fight of the         great  advantages       which     reflectors have over
achromatic        telescopes.      Since the discoveries        of Herschel,
the utility of the former cannot be doubted                   ; but it is of
great importance to employ, in the construction                   of these in
 struments,      a   metal the polish of which may be bright and
unchangeable. Twenty pounds of this precious metal, which
                                                                             were'

 36                     Observations         on  PIa tina,
 were presented      to me       by the minister of the marine, or*'
bearing an account given of the utility of mv researches,
bave greatly contributed            to    their success.       Opticians who
study the nature      of   those substances used in the composition
of    specula,   know that no metal or semi-inetal can supply
the place of tin.       It   is tin which       renders    red copper brittle,
elastic, and susceptible       of  a fine polisti.      This metal produces
also the fame Effects on all         other metallic substances.             Pla-
tina is subjected to the fame law. But I shall not here relate
the numerous trials I was obliged to make before I could
obtain a satisfactory       result.      I  stiall confine myself to an ac
count of that process,         which was attended with the greatest
success.
    The platina ingrains must Ve purified in a strong fire by
means of nitre and the salt of glass*.                 To the platina, when
purified,     add the eighth part         of that    metal employed in the
composition of common specula; for tin without red copper
would not produce        a good effect.          This mixture      is then to he
exposed to the most violent heat, which must be still excited
bv the      oxygen gas that disengages             itself from     nitre when
thrown into the sire.           One melting would             be insufficient :
five    or fix arc requisite to bring the mixture to perfection.
It   is necessary that the metal         should be in a state      of complete
fusion at the moment when it is poured                   into the mould.      By
this process    I have  been enabled          to construct a telescope with
platina, which magnifies the diameters of objects five hun
dred times, with a degree of clearness and distinctness requi
site   for the nicest observations.            The   large speculum      of pla
tina weighs fourteen pounds            :   it is eight inches in diameter,
and its focus is fix feet.       This speculum, which            is unchange
able, was cast and polished          by Carrochez.
    The utility of platina in the arts is not confined to the
construction of telescopes and nautical instruments.                     Robin,
a celebrated      watch-maker,           wished     to employ it in making
   *   The flux used in the English glasshouses, and called by the work
men tand'fir.     Edit.
                                                                              for

For me        escapements     and compensation balances.             lie   is of
opinion, that this metal is extremely proper for the holes in
which the pivots move, because it preserves oil without the
least alteration. Platina has no occasion, like gold, to be com
bined with any other metal, to render it               sit for being    used   in
the arts.        This new    metal afforded me excentric watch            dial-
plates       superior to    those brought from England.              Cotteau,
an       ingenious enameller, who himself made various expe
riments with platina, told me, that for his art he preferred
it    to all other metals.       Platina is also a metal of inestimable
value for constructing different instruments of chemistry.                      I
 have formed        it into crucibles*.
      The experiments which          I lately  made at Saint     Gobin with
 Deslandes, director of the           plate-glass   manufactory,        do not
 permit me to doubt of the utility             of crucibles     made    of pla
 tina in bringiug flint-glass to perfection; and Deslandes, who
 has been        able to give to the glass of Saint Gobin               a supe
 riority which foreigners cannot dispute, is of my opinion in
 regard to crucibles       of this metal.      Crucibles indeed       of earth,
 whatever be its nature, become in part vitrified.                   The    glass
 which thence results is imperfect            ; and  it maybe     seen   by the
 naked eye, that the vitreous substance contained in the cru
 cible does not form one homogeneous mass.                          It may be
 readily perceived, that crucibles          of platina cannot     be attended
 with the fame inconvenience.

        Since this memoir was read,   1 caused to be cast a crucible osplatina
 capable     of containing thirty pounds of stint-glass; and to give it more

OlMPLE         immersion in oxygenated         muriatic acid, letting
the article remain in it    a longe*   or shorter space os time, ac
cording to the strength      of the liquid,       will  be sufficient   lo
whiten an engraving.        If it  be required to whiten the paper
of  a hound book,    as it is necessary that all the leaves should
be moistened     by the acid, care must be taken to open the
book well,     and to make     the  bovds    rest  on the edge of the
vessel,   in such a manner that       the paper alone be dipped         in
the liquid : the leaves must be separated from each other,              in
order that they be equally moistened          on both sides.
   The liquor assumes a yellow tint, and the paper becomes
white in the fame proportion.          At the end of two or three
hours the book may be taken              from     the acid liquor and
plunged into pure water, with the fame care and precaution
as recommended in regard to the acid liquor, that the water
may exactly touch the two surfaces          of each leaf.    The    water
must be renewed every hour to extract           the acid remaining      in
the paper, and to dissipate the disagreeable smell.
    By following this process, there is some danger that the
pages    will not  be all equally whitened,          either because the
leaves have not been       sufficiently separated,       or because the
liquid has had more      action on the front margins than on
those near the binding.        On this account        the  practice fol
lowed by book-binders,         when they wish to whiten printed
paper, is to be preferred. They destroy the binding entirely,
that they may give to each leaf an equal and perfect immer
sion ; and    this is the second process recommended by               M.

  tervals scarcely sensible.            The acid     is then poured         in, mak
  ing it fail on the fides of the tub, in order that the leaves may
  not be deranged by its motion. When the workman judges,
  by the whiteness of the paper, that it has been sufficiently
  acted upon by the acid, it is drawn off by a cock at the bot
  tom    of    the   tub,    and its     place   is supplied        by clear, fresti
  water,    which weakens            and    carries off the remains of the
  acid, as well      as  its strong smell.        The     leaves are then to be
 dried, and, after being pressed, may be again bound up.
     " The leaves may he placed also vertically in the tub ; and
  this position seems to          possess    some advantage, as they               will
 then be     less  liable to be torn.         With this view I constructed
 a wooden frame, which              I  adjusted to the        proper height, ac
  cording to the size of the leaves             which      I  wished to whiten.
 This   frame      supported      very thin flips      of wood, leaving only
 the space of half        a line between them.              I  placed two leaves
 in each of these intervals, and kept them fixed in their place
 by two small         wooden      wedges,      which     I  pushed       in between
 the   slips.     When        the    paper was      whitened        I lifted   up the
 frame with the leaves, and plunged them into cold water to
 remove the remains            of the acid,     as  well as the smell.            This
 process   I  prefer to the other.
     " By this operation books are not only cleaned, but                           the
 paper acquires a degree of whiteness superior                     to what     it pos
 sessed  when first made.            The   use of this acid       is attended also
 with   the valuable advantage            of destroying ink spots. This
 liquor has nu action upon spots of oil, or animal grease ;
 but it has been long known that a weak solution of potash
will effectually remove stains of that kind.

         To oxygenate             the muriatic acid, nothing is necessary                        but
    to dilute       it,   and mix        it    in   a   very strong          glass vessel    with
    manganese,            in such    a   manner that the mixture may not oc-
.   cupy the whole content of the glass.                           Air bubbles       are formed
    on the surface of the liquor                  ;    the empty space becomes               silled
    with     a    greenish      vapour    ;    and, at the end of some hours, the
    acid may be further diluted with water and then used.                                   It   has
    an acid taste, because the whole                      is   not saturated with oxygen              ;
    but    it     possesses all the virtues of the                     oxygenated         muriatic
    acid.         This    process may be followed when there                         is   not time

brilliancy       ;       and tlie dirtiness    of   the paper,        which     offends the
eve, makes the subject, lose much                       of    its charms and attrac
tion.       It is        a great    misfortune, therefore, to those who pur
chase books for the fake                   of reading them, when                the objects
of their enjoyment are injured by ihe too close application
of a candle or lamp. For this reason M. Deschamps, at the
request     of       a    man of letters, to whom an accident of this
kind had happened, devised the following process, which was
attended        with complete success:
  After having gently warmed the paper stained with grease,
wax, oil, or any fat body whatever, take out as much as
possible of it by means of blotting paper.    Then dip a
small brush in the essential oil                    of well rectified spirit of tur
pentine,         heated        almost                  (for when cold it acts
                                           to ebullition
only very weaklv),                  and draw it gently over both fides of the
paper, which must be carefully kept warm.                                This operation
must      be     repeated as many times as the quantity                          of    the fat
body imbibed by the paper,                     or the thickness of the paper,
may render necessarv.                      When      the     greasy substance          is en
tirely removed, recourse may be had to the following method
to restore the paper                  to   its former whiteness,             which is not
completely restored by the first process.                           Dip another         brush
in highly rectified spirit of wine,                     and draw       it,   in like man
ner, over            the      plate which         was      stained,    and particularly
round the edges, to remove the border, that would still pre
sent    a      stain.         By     employing       these     means,        with      proper
caution,         the       spot    will totally disappear:            the paper       will   re
sume its original                  whiteness; and       if    the     process    has     been
employed on               a   part written on with common                ink, or printed
with printers ink,              ii    will experience no altertion.

    VI.     Observations    on  I be Mole, and lie Means of extirpating
        that deftruSwe         Animal.          From Economischc Hefte,
        Vol.   VII. Part    5. and Vol.      IX.   Part 4.
     JL   II E    great   damage     which moles          occasion  in cultivated
   land, and        particularly in gardens, is well known ; and the
   best means       of remedying this          evil is by destroying all those
   that make their appearance,              as  far  as possible.    The    secrets
   which quacks fell for extirpating these destructive animals
  are of very little avail; and even poison produces no effect, as
  the mole does not drink, and lives only on roots and worms.
  In    regard    to gins and      traps, the moles must be enticed to
  them by some kind of bait, which does not always produce
  the intended effect.            Buffon      advises    a  trench to be dug
  around the hills under which they conceal themselves,                       and
  thus      to  cut them off from all communication                     with the
  neighbouring ground.              This method requires           three or four
 people to dig trenches         ;  and though it may prove effectual, it
 is attended         with too much          trouble.       The other methods
 proposed by different naturalists are neither easier nor more
 certain *.
      It is well known that this animal                lives  unJer   the earth  ;
 and     if  at any time it comes forth from its holes,                it is onlv
 when compelled to do            so,  ir  consequence       os large quantities
 of water accumulated             after   the heavy rains which           fall in
 summer, or when the earth                is so much         parched and dried
by the continued drought, that it can no longer continue its
labour; but it again            creeps      back into the earth          when it
finds a spot convenient for its purpose.
     This animal,       as already    remarked, feeds upon roots and
worms, and for this reason is generally found in rich fertile
soil;     but never in that which is marshy or stony.                    In the
    * Valmnnt de Bomare recommends              suffocating them in their holes
by means      of sulphur.   Edit.
                                                                          winter

                                Observations       on the      Molt.                         ot
winter time it retires to elevated                       places,        because it is tbere
best      secured from inundations.                  In summer, however, it
descends         to the low hillocks               andflat land, and above all
makes       choice         of   meadows        for the place of its residence;
because it finds the earth there freslierand softer for it to dig
through.             If     continues long dry, it repairs to
                          the weather
the borders of ditches, the banks of rivers and streams, and
to places contiguous to hedges.
     The mole             breeds generally at the beginning                     of winter,
and       the months            when they are found big with young are
January        and        February.       In       the    month         of April     a great
many       of their young           may be seen.               Among        122 caught       in
the month  of May by my method, there were only sour big
with young.   This animal cannot live without digging; it
m    obliged to find its nourishment in the bowels of the earth                                ;
and on that account is under the necessity                               of making        those
long      subterranean            passages     which are found between                     one
mole-hill        and another.             In   general         it begins to dig five or
six inches under the surface                   ;    it scrapes the earth before it
on one side till the quantity becomes too great for it to labour
with      ease ;     it then works towards the surface                     ; and    by push-
ing with its head,                and    the assistance          of its nervous paws,
gradually raises up the earth                       which        incommodes          it,    and
which        produces            those   small      hills       so   common        in fields.
After getting rid of               the earth        in this manner,            it   proceeds
forwards, and continues its labour                            as before.       The further
it   goes the more hills are produced.                           At     each period    of    its
labour      it   throws up four or five.
     In   places overgrown with grafs                     and        shrubs,   the mole      is
often contented with only forcing                        a    passage    through between
the    roots     ;    and when the earth                 in   gardens has been newly
watered,         it   keeps itself at the depth               of scarcely half       an    inch
under the surface.                 This animal (bows                 an equal aversion to
great cold and violent beat;                       and    in   order to avoid both,          it
forces its way, when either prevail, to the grea'rst depth                                   in
the earth.

     It continues       its labour at all times, because it is          neceflarv
  for it to procure nourish merit.              It is absolutely false that it
  sleeps throughout the winter,               as some       naturalists have as
  serted ; for it throws up the earth                in the coldest season,      a.*
  well   as  during       the summer.         It   is most     busily employed
  towards the end of winter,               and     at that     period forms the
 greatest number           of hills.    To this it       is  impelled by more
  than one reason.           In  the first place, it must provide nourish
  ment for its young          ;  secondly, it finds it       easiest at that lime
  to dig its     way     through     the   earth    ;  and lastly,    as the   air
  begins to be milder,           the animal then recovers that strength
  which it had         lost during the intense cold.              At this season,
 therefore, it is most proper to pursue means for extirpating
  this animal, as it can be destroyed with greater cafe while
 employed        at its  labour.
     The    male is much stronger           than the female, and the hills
 thrown up by the former are much larger as well as more
 numerous.           The periods when the mole is most busily em
 ployed in disrging are in the morning, at fun-rife, at noon,
 and at fun-set.           In dry weather moles are observed to throw
 up the earth for the most part only at sun-rise, and in                   winter
 when the earth has been somewhat                    heated by the sun's rays.
     A   person     may easily      discover     how many moles arc con
 tained in      a   certain space of ground, by counting the fresh
 raised mole-hills which have no communication with each
 other.      I  must remark also,         that this animal has very          bad
           being almost totally blind ; but its hearing,                  on the
 sight,
 other hand, is so much the more acute.
     I  shall now       proceed to the method           of destroying them.
 Immediately at dav-brcak it will be necessary to make a tour
round the carden or meadow, from which it is wislied to
extirpate      the moles     ;  for al that lime they will be all found
at work,       as may be seen        by the hills newly thrown up.             If
the person is then close to the             hill,    he must proceed      as the
                do, and turn up with          a stroke    of  the spade the  hill
gardeners
             with the digger.          The     passage    is then cut through
together
                                                                          before

                                Obstrvathti            on the        Mole.                        35
before the animal is aware                       of   the attack, and therefore               it has
not power to escape.                       If the    mole-hill         be fresh, even       though
the animal may not be throwing up earth, the person ought
not to lose his time in waiting, but should immediately pro
ceed to the op-ration                     above mentioned.
  If you         find a fresh hill standing by itself,                            which seems to
(how by its situation that it has no communication with any
other, which is always the cafe when the mole has worked
from the surface downwards in endeavouring lo procure a
more convenient habitation,                            after the       hill    has been turned
up with the spade,                   a   bucket of water should be poured over
the    mouth of the passage.                           Bv these means the animal,
which is         at   n" creat           distance,     will     be obliged to come forth,
and may be easily caught with the hand.
  You           mav discover             also whether a hill             has anv communi
cation with another,                      if   you apply your ear to                 it,   and then
cough or make               a   loud noise.               If    it   has no communication
with       the    neighbouring                  hills, you will             hear     the    terrified
animal          make       a   noise       by   its motion.            It     will then     be im
possible for          it   to escape;            and       you may either pour water
into the hole, or turn up the hill with                                       a   spade until    the
mole       is   found   ;      for   in    general        it   never goes deeper           into the
earth than from fifteen to eighteen                                 inches.
      When        any      of    the beds            in   a     garden have been newly
watered, the mole, attracted                              by   the coolness        and moisture,
re.ulily repairs thither, and takes                             up    its residence in them,
makinga           passage at the depth                    of   scarcely an inch below the
surface.          In that        case     it   may easily he caught.                  When you
sec   it   at    woik,      you need only tread behind the animal with
your feet on the passage to prevent its retreat, and then turn
up the hill with  spade     a                   by
                             which means you will be sure to
                                          ;
catch it.
      When you dig               aster     it   with      a    spade, the animal forces its
way downwards into the earth                               ib   a   perpendicular direction,
in order that  may better escape

return upwards.                                 %
    People in general         are not aware         of  the    great   mischief
occasioned      in fields and gardens by these animals.                 We are
how ver informed by Buffon, that in the year 1740 he
planted fifteen or sixteen acres of land with acorns, and that
the greater part of them were in           a  little time carried away by
the moles to their subterranean            retreats.       In many of       these
there were        found half a bushel,          and    in others      a bushel.
Buffon,     aster this circumstance,          caused     a great    number of
 iron traps    to be constructed,        by which        in  less   thau three
weeks he caught 1300.             To this    instance     of  the devastation
occasioned      by these animals, we may add the following                   : In
the    yenr   1742     they   were    so numerous in some parts                 of
 Holland, that       one farmer alone caught between               five and six
thousand      of them.        The destruction         occasioned       by these
 animals is however no new phenomenon.                     We    are informed
 by history,       that the inhabitants      of    the  ifland    of Tenedos,
 the   Trojans,     and the   Æolians,    were infested by them in the
 earliest   ages.     For this     reason    a    temple was        erected     to
 Apollo Smynthius,          the destroyer    of moles.

  last summer from the best authenticated facts.
     In visiting     the loch  of Clunie, which          I  often did,     I  ob
  served in it a small ifland at the distance             of  180 yards from
  the nearest land, measured to be so upon the ice.                   Upon the
                                                                         island,

                          in regard   to tic Mole.                          37
 island, lord     Airly,    the  proprietor,   has    a    castle   and small
 shrubbery.       I  observed    frequently the appearance            of fresh
 mole-cast*, or hills.        I for some time took it to be the water
mouse,     and one day asked the gardener          if  it was    so ?  No,  he
said,    it was the mole; aud that he had caught one or two
lately.      But that si\e or fix years ago he had caught two in
 traps  ;   and   for   two years     after   this    he     had     observed
none.       But about four years ago, coining ashore in                a sum
mer's evening in the dusk, the 4th or 5th ot June, to o'clock
 P. M. he and another respectable person, lord Airly's
butler, saw at      a  small distance    upon the smooth water some
animal paddling to, and            not far distant      from,     the island.
They     soon, too soon     ! closed with this feeble passenger,           and
found it to be our common            mole, led by     a most      astonishing
instinct from the nearest point           of land (the        castle- hill)  to
take    poflesfion    of this   desert island.     In    was at this time,
tor the space of about two years,             quite free from any sub
terraneous      inhabitant;     but the     mole has for more than            a
year   past made its     appearance      again, and       its operations      I
was witness to.
    In  the history    of this animal I    do not, at present, recollect
any fact     so striking; ; especially    when we consider the great
depth of the water, both in summer and winter  from six
to ten, fifteen,      and some places       a? deep    a* thirty or forty
feet, all round the island.

    Composition and Properties of Urinary Concretions.                           By
    George Pearson, M. D. F. R.                          S.    Read before the
    Royal Societj; December 14,                       From the Philosophical

    Transactions.
                        I.  Historical Observations.
TlH        E notion generally entertair.e         1,  of the  nature of urinary
concretions,        consisted with the names           given them *, till the
lad twenty years        ; although the experiment of Slarc, Frederic
Hoffman,          and   Hales,   long before        showed      that these sub
stances commonly consist            of animal matter.             Galen indeed
imagined that pity/xa, or viscid animal matter, is the basis of
animal concretions; but, in his days, earth was believed to be
the basis     of animal matter. Alkaline medicines              were, however,
employed by the Greek physicians in                  diseases  from calculi.
     The experiments of         the    alchemists also made             it appear
that earth was only a part           of  the matter       of concretions.          It
 was probably tlie observation            of  the deposition and crystal
 lization      of  saline  bodies, which         suggested       the   notion      of
 urinary calculi being of the nature of tartar.                   Such was the
 opinion       of  Basil Valentine,      and    after    him    of Hochemer,
 belter known by the nime of Paracelsus;                     but, whether the
 latter adopted the denomination Duclecb from its import, or
 from caprice, has not been ex; lained.                     Van Helmont,            a
 century after his prototype Paracelsus, being (truck with the
 experiment in w hich he discovered the concretion of salts in
     »
        Urinary conci etions have obtained their denominations, like mest
  other tilings, from U'eir obvious propeitics. Accordingly, in our lan
  guage-, they arc j.opulaily known by the names stone and gravel, or Kind,
  fiom their icse::;lilaiicc to the stales of earth so named: and we find
  names    of the same import in other languages, such asxiS*.-,     (Arltæxs;        ;
  XiemTic,  (C.'KLics Am ELI ancs ; >J.»u/,.cf, ( A11L Til's) ; M'lha, (various

  sa.) to notice names which have die same meaning.

                On the Composition and Properties,           &c.                 3*°
 distilled urine by alcohol, was led to depart from his adored
 master's opinion, with respect lo the nature os calculi ;
 although he acknowledges the merit of Paracelsus,                    in having
discover     d the solvent      Lut/us, (a calcareous stone also called
 Septarium,)      which Van Helmont says is preferable to alka
line lixivium.        He   also says, that when the archeus              spirit of
 urine meets with       a  volatile earthy spirit, and cloo not act in
a due     manner,      a   concretion       will  be formed       ;  but,    in   a
healthy state,      although       all urine contains        the     matter of
urinary calculi,      no concretion can take plate,               because      the
 archeus, or vital power of the                 bladder,   counteracts          its
 formation.
    As   to the   kind   of    earth composing calculi,         the only dis
tinction of c.irihs,       till  about the last    half century,       was into
absorbent       and    non-absorbent;         but,   since    the     absorbent
earths      were   distinguished into calcareous, magnesia,                   and
alumine       or clav, the calcareous           was  considered        to be the
earth    of urinary concretions;             apparently however for no
other reason but its obvious               properties,   and    its    extensive
division through the whole animal kingdom.
    At length, viz. in 1776, the experiments of                  the wonder
ful Scheele vere          published      in Sweden,     but were         scarcely
known       in this country till          1785.    These experiments ex
ploded     the opinion     of   the earthy nature      of calculi,     and sub
stituted that     of their consisting of a peculiar acid, resembling
the succinic, and of a gelatinous matter, without any earth.
Afterwards about T«0 of their weight of lime was found by
Bergman       ;  which, for      a cause   now well known,          had eluded
the    acuteness     of Sehccle.        Although      the  experiments of
Scheele were confessedly unqueitiotiablr,              and were ably sup
ported    by the learned Bergman, some very eminent chemists,
having obtained different results by their own experiments,
adopted a different opinion           of  the composition      of   these con
cretions.       The immortal,        and ever to be deplored, Lavoisier
supposed these substances to consist            of acidulous     phosphate       of
lime and        animal    matter,      many of them         being       partially
                                          D 4                            fusible   j

40                On the Compujiticn and Pnpertiet
fusible; but still it was the unrivalled Schecre who discovered
that the urine of healthy persons contains superphosphate,
or acidulous phosphate, os lime; and who also indicated the
experiment which verified his opinion,                that phosphue      of
lime is the basis of bone.
    Experiments have been likewise made, for the mod part
in a rather   desultory     wav, and most of them by persons but
little practised     in chemical inquiries,         which   at hast afford
evidence, that urinary concretions are very different,                w>'°
respect to the proportion        of  the ingredients in their compo
sition, and perhaps        also in kind.     M.   Fourcroy,     who how
ever, must not be classed with inexperienced chemists, I
believe first obtained prussic acid by sire, and by            nitric acid,
from these concretions;           and   showed     that  they sometimes
conuin     phosphate     of ammoniac      and os suda ; which may be
dissolved out    of  them by water.        M. Fourcroy also savs, he
found magnesia in the         intestinal calculus of a horse; wbteh
calculus was     a  triple combination,      of   one part   of phosphate
of ammoniac,          two parts of magnesia,         and   one   of water,
besides traces    of animal     and vegetable matter.
    Dr. Link, in       a  very elaborate dissertation,       published at
Gottingen,      in 1788,     on  urine and     calculi,   concludes that
urinary    concretions consist       of phosphoric acid, lime, am
moniac,     oil, the basts os     different kinds of gazes, together
with the acid sublimate of Schecle, although he did not suc
ceed in obtaining it.
    It is a proof   of Dr. Black's      sagacity,   that he should have
been able to perceive,        from  a sew   experiments, that unnarv
concretions consisted ot animal             matter and       the earth   of
 bone, before the composition of this earth was demonstrated
 by Gahn.
     In this historical   sketch it fltould be noticed, that alkaline
 substances,   though uled by the Greek physicians, and aller-
 wards by the alchemical physicians, appear to have been laid
 aside by the regular practioners, for a century or two pre
 ceding their revival, by the famous Mrs. Stephens, in 172c.
                                                                       Ikr

                         of Urinary      Concretions.                        41
Her prescription brought into             vogue the theory of these me
dicines operating by their causticity. The successful ufe, by
Mr. Colhomr, us potash saturated with carbonic acid, ac
cording to the discovery of Bewley and Bergman, and the
still further improvement in practice, from the use os soda,
as well as potash, super-saturated             with carbonic acid, by ilic
discovery      of   a  peculiar method by             Mr. Sehweppc,        have
completely refuted         the theory      of the     agency of alkalies on
the principle      of causticity.
    It  appears,    from the preceding brief history, as well                 as
from     the confession      of  the latest and        best writers,   that the
experiments hitherto made,               rather     "   afford  indications   of
what remains to be done, than furnish demonstrations of the
nature     of animal concretions."                It is allo too obvious to
need explanation,         that more efficacious and innocent prac
tice, in diseases from these concretions,                   can only    be dis
covered by a further investigation               of their properties. It is
 with this view,       as well    as  for the    fake of cheinica! philoso
phy, that      I think it my duty to submit to the Society some
 of  the observations       I  have made,       in the course of inquiry on
 this subject.
    The   observations      which     I dial! now offer, are principally
 on    a substance,     which mv experiments inform me is .very
 generally    a  constituent of both urinary and arthritic concre
 tions.    It is a substance obtained by dissolving              it out os these
 concretions, by lye of caustic fixed alkali, and precipitating
 it from the solution by acids, in this way, Scheele separated
 this matter     ;  but he did not consider its importance,               nor of
 course    at all investigate       its properties.        He does not even
 fceni to have been           aware that      it  was a distinct constituent
 part   of the urinary concretion          ; for, when he relates the        ex
 periment of precipitating matter from the nitric solution of
 calculus by metallic salts, no distinction                  is made between
 t'\c precipitations in this experiment, and that in the former                  :
  yet we can now show, that in the one case the precipitate
 is  a  peculiar animal oxide, and in the other they are metallic
                                                                    phosphates.

 4i                 On the Composition and Properiui
phosphates.          As Scliccle obtained       an acid sublimate,        it has
 been imagined by some writers, that the precipitate by any
acid (even by the carbonic) from the alkaline menstruum,
was an acid ; the fame as that obtained by sublimation, and
which, in      the new system         of chemistry, \\a         been denomi
nated     hlb'ic   acid.      The following       experiments ihow          that
these substances are different species us mailer.
                                II.  Experiment i.
     250 grains of a white, smooth, laminated, urinary calcu
lus, and the fame quantity ot a nut- brown one, with an
uneven surface,           both   of which     were   of   a   roundish figure,
were pulverized together*.               300 grains of theie pulverized
calculi    were triturated with three ounces and a half, by
measure,      or five ounces, by weight, of lye of caustic soda.
The mixture          became      thick,   and copiously       emitted ainmo-
niacal gaz.         After digestion for a n ght, and then boiling,
with the     addition of five ounces of pure water, J olHaiiicd,
by filtration,        five ounces ot clear colourless           liquid.    Boil
ing    water was repeatedly          poured   upon the strainer, till what
passed   through        it was almost tasteless,      and remained clear,
on the addition          of diluted sulphuric acid.
     (a) The matter remaining on the strainer, being dried,
was an impalpable, white, tasteless, heavy powder, which
weighed 96 grains.
     {b) The five ounces of filtrated liquid, having been                     set
apart, on standing, deposited              a white, opaque, crantilated,
soap-like matter, from            a colourless clear liquid         The liquid
being decanted, the              deposit    was dried,     and     was then an
opaque, brittle,          soap-like matter, which            dissolved   readily
 ui   water,      giving     a   clear but     not    viscid    solution,    and

tasting weakly of soda.                This soap-like                 matter    weighed
iSr, grains.
   (c)      The decanted      liquor, (£,) being mixed with the                    above
filtrated    liquors, on evaporation to three ounces, afforded no
deposit on standing, although it was a very heavy and soapy
liquid      to the feel;      but, on adding                diluted    sulphuric    acid
gradually,       till it ceased to become               turbid,        a sediment     was
deposited, which was a very light, white, impalpable powder,
in weight, when dried,               26 grains.             The liquid from which
this     powder was         precipitated, being                evaporated,      afforded
nothing but sulphate os soda, and                       a   few grains       of crystals,
which       seemed to be phosphate               of     soda.     There        was also a
blackish        matter,     which burnt like horn, or other animal
matter, and did not leave               a    pink or rose-coloured matter,
on evaporating the solution                 of it in nitric           acid to dryness,
but left a carbonaceous residue; whereas, the white preci
pitate,     so treuted,     afforded    a   beautiful pink matter.

in eight ounces of pure water;
    1.      A little of this solution, further diluted by one ounce
of water, grew milky                on adding      a            of nitric acid,
                                                        sew drops
 but became         less so     on Handing.            On adding more nitric
acid, and heating             it,   the mixture             became     quite clear:     by
 adding     a   few drops     of lye of     caustic soda,        a
                                                                      very llinht curdv
appearance         took place.
    2.   On adding,        to the same diluted solution,                 a   little of the
 diluted sulphuric or muriatic acid, inilkiness ensued, and re
 mained, although the acids were added till the mixture was
 extremely four.            On adding        lye   of   caustic soda, much more
 than to saturate the superabundant acid, the mixture became
 clear again; and, on adding the acids       second time, the    a
 milkincss was reproduced.                  It   was found that the milkinesi
 could be produced and destroyed, or clearness be produced
  bythe alternate addition of the acid and alkali, for an up..
 limited number of times.                   If   the nitric acid however was
 used, at length no milkiness could be induced.                              If carbonate

        3. Lime water was rendered turbid by this solution, bnt I
     neglected to examine the precipitated matter.

    drops of concentrated nitric acid, being evaporated                    to dry
    ness,     sometimes      a pink, and at other times a blood-red,              or
    rose-coloured matter was left           ;  which,     bv further application
    of  fire, became       black.
       5. Carbonic acid, digested and sliouk with this solution,
    did not render it turbid.
        6. To the whole           of   the    remaining solution was added
    diluted sulphuric acid, to saturate the alkali.                 On standing,
    a copious precipitate took place, from a clear liquid ; which
   precipitate, being           washed and dried,          was   a mass   of  very
   light, mica-like, whitish crystals, amounting                  to 123 grains.
   It   was      estimated    that the solution         ulVd    in  the   Experi
   ments      1. 5.     would have produced         12    grains, and that the
.
   30 grains of soap-like matter, (b,) not decompounded,
   would have yielded about 14 grains more.

   mouth.
       2.   About one        part of it     only dissolved      in 8co parts of
   boiling water;         which    solution did not redden paper stained
   with turnsole, nor           the solution      and tincture     of this   lest ;
   neither did it change turnsole paper,              reddened     by acid, to    a
  blue colour.          On cooling,     the greatest part     of what   had been
  dissolved was deposited,          in  a crystallized state, equally on the
  fides and bottom         of  the vessel.     This crystallized matter       had
  the properties abovementioned               (d). Boiling water was found
  to dissolve a much greater          proportion of urinary J: one, and also
  of gravel, than of this precipitate.

   4. The precipitate being boiled with lye of carbonate
                                                         of
loda, more seemed to be dissolved than in pure water ; but
the solution was clear, and, on evaporating it nearly to
             and pouring cold water upon           it,   on       paper strainer,

scarcely      any thing      but the   soda passed         through with the
water;       the precipitate remaining behind on the paper.                  The
result     was   the fame,     when this experiment was made with
a lye of corbunate of ammoniac.   The result was also tl»e
same, with water in which red oxyde of mercury had been
boiled; which        was also boiled         with this precipitate,           and
filtrated after cooling.
   5. A little of the precipitate being triturated with quick
lime, hot water was poured upon it. The filtrated liquor
gave the precipitate back again, on adding muriatic acid.
    6.   I   he precipitate exposed to flame,            with     the blow-pipe,
turned black,        emitted         of burning animal matter,

 staining the platina spoon black.
    7.    Five grains of the precipitate,             in half       an   ounce of
 water, were       left to stand in              warm
                                        room, during the

 months of August and September last, without any sigu
 of putrefaction appearing, or any obvious change taking
 place.
    8.    Twenty-four ounces of boiling water                     were   saturated
 with the precipitate, aud divided into            six    portions   ;   from each
 of which, on cooling, most of again precipitated.

 of soda, (the pneumatic apparatus being alibied,) discharged
 no carbonic acid into lime water; but                a   transparent      solution
 was produced, and, on cooling, very little was precipitated.
    The      secoud portion was,       in    the fame manner, boiled in             a
 little lye of caustic soda; which gave             a     transparent      solution
 od cooling, without any precipitation.
                                                                              The

 4<5               On the Composition and Properties
     The third portion being boiled with lime water, very little
 more seemed to be dissolved than in pure water.
    The fourth portion being boiled with 4 grains of subphos-
 phate of lime, or calcined bone, no more seemed to be dis
 solved on account          of this addition.
    Nor    was more dissolved in the fifth portion, by the addition
 of 4 grains of        phosphate      of lime,    made by dropping phos
 phoric acid into lime water.
    And     the result was the fame            with the sixth portion,         to
 which    were added 4 grains           of superphosphate       of lime,   made
 by adding phosphoric acid to lime water,                   so as just to make
 a clear solution, and then evaporating the solution.
    9. Urine seemed to dissolve, or at least to suspend, a greater
 quantity of the precipitate than mere water ; so likewise did
 water with      a little sulphate of      soda.
    10.   The precipitate did not            render solution      of hard    soap
 at all curdy ; but on adding              the precipitate       to solution ot
 sulphuret of potash,           it became very turbid.
    11.   The precipitate produced a strong effervescence,                  even
in  the  cold, with nitric acid, but the fumes were not                    those
os nitrous acid      :  there was a clear solution, which, on evapo
ration to dryness,           afforded   black matter, surrounded           by   a
pink, or blood-red margin.
    12. The substance, with sulphuric acid, turned black,
and emitted fumes copiously, which were scarcely those of
sulphureous acid          ;  and, on evaporation,         a  black mark only
was left.
    13.  I  first digested, and then boiled, in water, the precipi
tate with prtifliate        of iron  ;  but the filtrated liquor       afforded
no precipitation with sulphate             of iron.
    14.  Two drachms, by            measure,     of nitric acid, of    the spe
cific gravity    of 1,35,     were poured upon 7 grains ofthe preci
pitate.     A   violent effervescence took place, which was soon
succeeded by a complete solution.
   A   few drops of this solution, being evaporated on ~                  glass,
                                                                             left

lest a black mark, surrounded                 by  a   pink margin.           A few
drops os nitric           acid    being evaporated          from this residue,
nothing but a still          less  black mark, and         a  few red spots re
 mained.
     Nitric acid     being; added a third time, nothing but a black
mark,     still smaller, remained           ;  which entirely         disappeared,
on evaporating this acid from it                a  fourth time.
     I  found that       a few drops      of this solution,        so diluted that
 they did not contain the Tjp, or even                  a   much smaller part,
of    a grain os the precipitate,             on evaporation, left           a pink
 stain on glass.
     The whole of         the rest    of the solution         was distilled in a
 very low temperature, so that a drop only                       fell about every
half-minute,        till  a thick brownish sediment remained, with
 a red   margin.         A   similar distillation       was performed,         with
the distilled liquor,          a second    time, when there remained                a
 little whitish thick matter. On              a  third distillation, as before,
 with the distilled liquor, towards the close white fumes arose;
 and about     half   a  drachm     of liquid, which now remained in
 the retort,     being left to stand, prismatical crystals, decus
 sating each other, were formed.                    They had a sharp taste,
 but were scarcely sour; were very soluble in the mouth,
and evaporated         in white fumes, leaving a very flight blaci
stain.
     15. Twenty        grains of the precipitate were introduced into
a   tube,  {  of  an inch wide in the bore, sealrd                  by melting at
6ne extremity ; which extremity was coated,                          and the tube
 was silly bent for retaining            sublimate,       and     collecting gaz.
The temperature, from the               sire  applied, was at lirst very low,
but was gradually increased,               so as    lo make     the coated part,
containing       the     charge,     red hot.        At  first,   the   precipitate
turned black,         and a little water         appeared.        Secondly,     gaz
came     over, which           had the    smell     of empyreumatic liquor
cornu cervi.       Thirdly,      a brown sublimate appeared,               and gaz
a* before,     but also with prudic acid gaz.                   Fourthly, black
                                                                            matter,

 48               On the Composition and Properties
 matter, staining the tube,        as if from    tar, or animal      oil.    On
 cooling,     there was found     a residue,    of nearly     three grains,    of
 pure carbon.        The sublimate      was    principally       carbonate of
 ammoniac;         the rest was    animal oil.         The gaz     discharged
 was   nearly half its bulk, or 5 cubic inches by measure,
carbonic acid ; and the remaining 5 cubic inches were
nitrogen gaz, containing pruffic acid and empvreumatic oil.
    I  treated in the fame manner,            the fame quantity         of red
dish crystals,      deposited spontaneously         from urine.       The    re
sult was     not very different from that of the former experi
ment.       The gaz     was more offensive,           smelling like     putrid
urine, and the carbonaceous residue was more copious, and
contained lime and phosphoric acid                ;   at least the   lixivium
of it became      white, on dropping into it oxalic acid; and it
became      slightly curdy, on adding lime water.
   I  treated in the same manner, some quite round and
smooth     concretions, of the size of black pepper feeds.                 The
products were the fame          as the  former, but the gaz was still
more offensive,       and in smaller quantity ; and the carbona
ceous matter was more copious.
   I, in   the fame way, subjected         to experiment 20 grains of
a nut-brown       light calculus,     which     I    had previously ascer
tained to contain the matter above described,                     which wag
precipitated from caustic soda by acids.                The products      were
of the   fame    kind    as the  former;     but    I  could find no trace
of phosphoric acid in           the   residue,    which      I did of lime,
and the gaz was        less  offensive.     The carbonaceous           residue
was not, in weight,        3  grains.
   It will   be proper, before      I  proceed      further,     to point out
some   of  the more obvious conclusions from the above                     ex
periments.
   1.  It  appears    that at least one half of the matter             of   the
urinary      concretions subjected         to the above         experiments
united lo caustic        soda, and     was     precipitated from it by
acids.     (II, ad.)
                                                                     a. This

                                  of Urinary        Concretions.                                  49
      5.    This precipitate            docs      not indicate acidity to the most
 delicate         tests; (e, a.) and, as it is inodorous, tasteless, (e, 1.)
 scarcely soluble in cold water, («, a.) does not unite to the
 alkali of carbonate of potash,                        of    soda,       or of ammoniac,
  ('>      3»   4-) nor to    oxyde of mercury,                (/,
                                                          4.) nor to the lime
 of lime-water,                 (e,    8.) nor decompound soap, [e, 10.) or
 prussiate           of iron,         (/, 13.) and, as its combination with
 caustic soda resembles                   soap,     more than              any double            salt
 known           to consist      of   an acid and alkali, this precipitate docs
 not belong to the genus acids.
   3. As this precipitate could not be sublimed,                                            without
 being decompounded, like animal matter,      15                           (e,        )    and also,
 for the reasons mentioned in the last paragraph,                                      it    cannot
be the fame thing as the acid sublimate                              of Scheele, or the
 fuccinic acid.
      4-    As    it   docs not appear             to be putrefcible,                 nor form    a
viscid solution with water,                  it   cannot be referred to the animal
mucilages.
  5. On account of its manner of burning in the air, under
the blowpipe, (e, 6.) and its yielding, on exposure to sire in
close vessels,             the distinguishing products                  of animal matter,
 (especially ammoniac and pruflic acid,)                           as    well    as   on account
of its affording             a    soap- like matter          with        caustic       soda,    this
precipitate may be considered as species of animal matter;
                                                     a
and, from its composition being analogous to that of the
substances called,               in the new system of chemistry, animal
oxides,         it   belongs to that genus.                  Its peculiar and specific
distinguishing              properties are,          imputrescibUity, facility                    of
              insolubility in cold water, and, that most

         I                   of various other conclusions in this
             do not avail myself
    place, because thev relate especially to the agency of medi
    cines for preventing and removing concretions ; and of
    course      do not           properly fall wiihin the views of the Royal
    Society-
         Having found the                above precipitate to be an oxide,                 and
    not,     as is   commonly supposed, an acid,                     I thought it    probable
    that,      like other analogous oxide.*,                  it    was acidifiahle,     and    I
    suspected that           I    had really rendered it into the acid stale, by
    the nitric acid ; which, in the above experiments,                                  {e, 14.)
    had imparted oxygen to                      it,   and thereby rendered         it   soluble,
    deliquescent, pungent, and volatile.                           This change     also would
    account for the nitric solution not affording the precipitate.
      In order to obtain, for examination, an adequate quantity
    of this          supposed          acid, the following experiments were in
    stituted,         with       the    three     acids (vis. the oxymuriatic, the
    nitio-niuriatic,              and     the    nitric), which can acidify oxides
    analogous to the present one.
         Experiment          I. Twenty- five              grains of the above           animal
    oxide, (for      will now venture to call it,) and three ounces
                        so I
    of nitric acid, of the specific gravity of 1,25, were put into                              a
     retort, and the hydro- pneumatic apparatus was adjoined.
        At very low temperature,
               a                       clear solution was made.
                                                          a
     First,     soon after the solution began to                     boil,    33 ounces,       by
     measure,         of   colourless       gaz came over, which were succeeded
     (secondly),           by white fumes,                filling   the apparatus,       and   2^
     ounces more             of gaz.        Thirdly,      a   white sublimate ascended,
     and there was           a     strong   smell of       prussic acid.       The sublimate
-    was very readily waslied out, being very soluble, and tasted
     pungent or sharp, but not Lur.     Fourthly, the distillation
     being renewed, more white sublimate appeared,                                  but ouly    3
.    arc of very different kinds as the case with the matter of the brain,

     oxide of urinary concretions.
                                                                                         ounces

                           es Urinary Concrttions.                           51
ounces more of gaz came                over ; and then the retort only
contained a dark-brown             solid matter.
     The  first portion    of gaz, viz.     23 ounces, consisted    of about
equal    bulks of carbonic acid and atmospherical air.                     The
second portion,         viz.  23 ounces, was two-thirds         of   its   bulk
carbonic acid, and the rest nitrogen gas. The third portion,
or 3 ounces, was atmospherical air, with a little carbonic
acid.
     Nitric acid was poured, in the fame quantity as before,
into the retort. An effervescence immediately took place,
which was       succeeded by a transparent         solution.   The distilla
tion yielded gaz of          the same    kind   as before, but in smaller
quantity,      with white fumes, and white sublimate.                  When
only about 4 drachms, by measure,                  of liquid remained in
the retort, a little of it was evaporated          j and, when reduced
to a solid matter, it turned black, and took fire, leaving a
oarbonaceous residue; but, before this,             a margin of beautiful
pink matter       appeared.
     Nitric   acid was poured, as before,         into the retort, for the
third time, but very little gaz ascended, and much                less   white
fumes than before.             The distillation     proceeded,     till about
one drachm-measure             of liquid remained in the       retort    :  this
 being left to stand,        prismatic crystals were formed in          a very
 small   quantity of liquid.          These crystals did not taste four,
 but sharp,      and     they reddened       turnsole paper.      Adding       a
 little soda to    a   part of .them,     to see whether    I could form       a
neutral salt,     I  \va>  surprised by the extrication      of ammoniac.
To another portion of           crystals   I added sulphuric acid,      which
 disengaged      nilric acid.       A   third portion of crystals,        being
 exposed over a lamp,           wholly    evaporated,    without leaving a
 mark behind.           The remaining matter in           the  retort     being
 examined, was found to be nitrate                of ammoniac.          It  was
 plain that the nitric acid had, by parting with oxygen to the
 carbon of the oxide, formed carbonic                 acid.    The tarbon
 being thus carried off, of course the nitrogen and hydrogen                   of
  the oxide    uniting produce ammoniac            ; which,    uniting with
                                        Ej                                   the

    but     <rreat    part      of   the nitrate   of ammoniac was carried                       off"   in
    the vapour state, exhibiting white fumes, and sublimate, as
    above observed.
         The     mode      of making         the experiments with the other acids
    was     of   course different from the former experiment.
         Experiment             ri. Twenty-five
                                  grains of the above animal
    oxide, and half an ounce of water, were put into a bottle
    capable of containing three pints                      ;    a stream        of oxymuriatic
    acid gaz, from- manganese and muriatic acid, was made to                                       pass
    into the bottle, and upon the charge, for twelve hours                                   ;    and,
    for twenty-four               hours more, oxymuriatic gaz kept issuing,
    but in smaller quantity, and circulating                          through the bottle.
    The ovide, by this time,                    was completely dissolved.                    Upon
    adding lime to a little of                 the solution          of   it,   ammoniac was
    disengaged        ;    and,       upon adding sulphuric acid, there was                             a
    disengagement of oxymuriatic acid.        On evaporation, how
    ever,   I     obtained nothing but muriate of ammoniac, with
    which        was mixed           a   little manganese.
         In this experiment,               I     could not doubt that the carbon
    had been carried off, in the                   state       of carbonic acid,            by      the
    oxvgen       of   the oxymuriatic              acid; and thus ammoniac was
    compounded,                 from the union of the two remaining consti
    tuent parts of the oxide,                   viz.    the nitrogen            and    hydrogen.
The oxymuriatic acid, united                        to the ammoniac, parted with
 oxygen,             and     became          muriatic      acid      during      evaporation;
 'hence, muriate                 of ammoniac       was formed.
         Experiment          in.       The   above experiment was repeated, only
    the gaz was nitro-muriatic gaz, from                         a   mixture of nitric and
    muriatic acids.                  The   result was the fame as               in    the last ex
    periment,         except that the product was                    a    mixture      of nitrate,
    and muriate,           of ammoniac.
     I      made       other experiments               of the     fame      kind   ;    but their
^results were              so   nearly the same         as those above related, that
I      shall     not give an account of them.         By the unexpected
   issue   of    these      experiments, all my hopes of acidifying the
                                                                                        -   animal

animal oxide were exploded j but I am indebted                       to that
pursuit for the curious discovery of the change of the molt
common basis of urinary concretions,                 (ihe animal oxide,)
into ammoniac           and carbonic acid, by the oxygen of the
above acids;         which will    be found extremely important,              as
it  enables us to interpret many phænomena,                   iu a variety    of
cafes beside the present.           It now    appears,     that the inflam
mation mentioned in one of the above experiments,                         (and
which       also happened    in several others,) on evaporation of the
nitric solution of the animal oxide,             was from the nitrate         of
 ammoniac, the nitrum fiammaus of                the old chemists, com
 pounded in those experiments.                This inflammation          takes
 place sometimes, on evaporation            of nitric solutions, both of
 urinary concretions, and of urine itself evaporated to the                state
 of   soft  extract, on account of the ammoniac already existing
 in  theso substances.        The composition of ammoniac also ex
 plains the      disappearance of the whole matter os some sorts of
 nnuary concretions,         a very small residue     of black matter ex
 cepted,      by repeated affusion     and evaporation ot nitric acid,
 from the solution os them in this menstruum.
     It remains for      me to give an account        of    the 96 grains      of
 powdery matter left on the paper strainer,             {a  ;) which are the
 insoluble portion,       in lye of caustic       soda,   of   300- grains     of
 urinary concretions.
     l. A      small portion   of the insoluble matter, being        exposed
  to flame with the blowpipe, did not turn black nor yield any
  smell of animal matter ; but it bucamc whiter, and I could
 just agglutinate the powder into one mass, although                    I   was
  unable to render it fluid.
     ¦m.   The fikrated liquid, from      a little of the matter boiled in
  water, became very turbid and white with oxalic acid : with
  lime water it grew barely curdy ; and it did not alter the co
  lour of turnsole, or of violet juice.

     This nitric solution, having        been evaporated,      to  carry off
 most     of  the free   acid, instantly became very curdy on the
 addition of lime water.
     It  grew thick and white on addingsulphuric             add, yielding-
 a  copious precipitate of sulphate oflime.           One portion of the
 supernatant liquor upon this precipitate, on evaporation, af
 forded an extract-like matter ; which readily melted, as phos
 phoric acid does when it is mixed with           a little  earthy matter.
 To    the other portion      of this supernatant liquor        was added
 liquid caustic ammoniac,           producing   a precipitate which       af
 forded no sulphate        of magnesia with sulphuric acid.

  IX.    Chemical Considerations on the Use of the                Oiydt    -f
     Iron in dyeing Cotton.          By J. A. Chaptal.            From    ¦*:'.
      Annales de Chimie, Vol.         XXVI.
   1 HE        oxyd  of iron  has such an affinity with cotton thres
that,    if the latter be plunged in a saturated solution        of iror.
 any acid whatever, it immediately assumes a               ebony
 colour,     more or     less  dark according to the streqgiii

                               in dyeing CoUon.                                    55
liquors.     It   is  both a curious and               easy  experiment,         that
when cotton is made             to pass through a solution             of   the sul-
phat of iron, rendered               turbid by the oxyd which remains
suspended      in    the  liquor,        it will    be  sufficient to dip the
cotton in the bath to catch the last particle                       of   the oxyd,
and     to restore to the         liquor      the  transparency it has lost.
The solution then, which                  before    bad  a  yellowish appear
ance,     becomes     more or       less  green, according         as  it   is more
or   less charged.
    The colour given         to cotton by the oxyd            of iron      becomes
darker, merely by exposure to the air; and this colour,                           soft
 and agreeable        when taken           from the bath, becomes               harsh
 and ochry by the progressive oxydation                   of  the metal.         The
colour of the oxyd            of iron is        very fast: it    resists   not only
 the air and water, but also alkaline leys, and soap gives                          it
 splendour without sensibly diminishing its intensity.                       It is on
 account of these properties that the oxyd of iron has been
 introduced into the art of dyeing, and been made a colour
 ing principle of the utmost value.                   But I   have been able to
 give a new extension          to the applications         of this   oxyd ; and      I
 (hall here confine myself to the only results                 I   have obtained
 worthy     of entering into the operations of                    the dye-house,
 and which have been employed with success for several years
 in my manufactory.
      In order   that the oxyd          of iron     may be conveniently ap
  plied to the cotton thread, it is necessary to begin by effect
  ing its solution, and         in this      cafe acids   are employed         as the
  most usefiii solvents.       Dyers almost every where make a mys
  tery   of the acid     which they employ;              but it is always the
  acetous,    the sulphuric,          the nitric,    or the muriatic.           Some
  of   them   ascribe    great      differences     to the solution       of iron by
  ihe one or the other acid, but in general they give the pre
  ference to the acetous.              This predilection appears to me to
  be sounded      much     less    on the difference       of  the colours that
  may be communicated by the one or the other fait, than on
  the different degrees of corrosive power which each exercises

on the fluff;             That of           the sulphat and               munat         is   so great,

it   will certainly        be       burnt;          whereas        solutions        by   the acetous
or any other vegetable acid are not attended                                        with the like
inconvenience.
      Iron      appears to be at the fame degree                          of oxydation in the
different acids, since                   it   produces         the fame          shade       of colour
vihen precipitated              ;       and      any acid solvent may be employed
indiscriminately,                  provided the nature                    of the        salt and the
degree       of     the saturation            of      the acid be sufficiently                   known;
for the subsequent operations may be then directed according
to this knowledge, and the inconveniences which attend
the       use    of    some         of      these     salts may be prevented.                       This
without doubt             is   a    great advantage            which the man of                   science
enjoys over the mere workman, who                                    is   incapable       of varying

cotton will assume                  a     chamoy colour,                more or less dark ac
cording          as the   solution          is   more or less charged.                   The affinity
of    the cotton to tlic iron                    is   so   great, that     it   attracts the me
tal, and takes            it   in    a   great measure from the acid by                           which
it    was dissolved.

      is by such or almost similar processes that dyers com
municate, what is called among workmen, an ocbre or rust
colour.   But these colours are attended with several incon
veniences            to the artist.        I.    Strong    shades burn or             injure
the cloth.             3. This colour          is harsh, disagreeable          to the eye,
and cannot be easily united                     with the mild colours furnished
by vegetables. I made attempts therefore to avoid these in
conveniences, and succeeded in the following manner ;                                       I
tread the            cotton cold in        a   solution   of the sulphat of iron,
marking three degrees, wring it carefully, and immediately
plunge it in a ley of potash at two degrees, upon which                                     I
have poured to saturation a solution                       of     the sulphat       of alu-
mine        :   the colour is then brightened, and becomes infinitely
more delicate, soft, and agreeable.                        The sulphat no longer
attacks the tissue of the stuss; and after the cotton has been
left in the bath for four or five                   hours, it is taken out to be
wrung, washen and dried.                         In this manner         we may obtain
every shade that can be wished, by graduating the strength ot
the solutions.              This      simple process,         the theory of which
presents itself to the mind                 of   every chemist, has the advan
tage       of furnishing         a colour very agreeable,          exceedingly fixed,
and, above all, extremely economical.                         I employ
                                                                     it with great
advantage            in dyeing nankins, the             colour of which has infi
nitely more fixity than that of the English (dyed) nankins*.
It       possesses over the        latter the advantage            of    resisting leys ;
and the only fault               I have   discovered      in it   is,   that   it   becomes
brown           by   the action      of astringents.

indigo and the oxyds of iron.                       I    obtained only a dirty earthy
green of different shades, and exceedingly poor. The oxyd
of iron combines on the other hand very easily with
the red of madder, and produces a bright violet or phuu
(pruneau) colour, the use of which is as extensive as bene
ficial in the cotton manufactory. But if we mould confine
ourselves       to apply these two colours to cotton,                                 without hav-
ipg employed a mordant capable of fixing the latter, the
colour would not only remain dull and disagreeable by the*
impossibility of brightening                    it,     but   it   would still be attended
with the           great inconvenienceresisting  leys. We

through        a   solution of iron,             more or           less     charged according
to the nature of the violet required                          :    it     is    then to be care

passed      through the solution of iron till                      it     has been previously
galled     ;   the iron     is   then precipitated in               a     blueish oxyd,            which
combined with               the        red    of madder gives                   a    most      brillian*
purple,        more or          less   dark according to the strength                            of the
galling and         of    the ferruginous               solution.          It    is   very difficult
to obtain an equal colour                      by   this process,               and     in   manufac-
torics an equal violet                 is   considered        as   a    master-piece of art.
It   is   generally believed that              it   is   only      by   well-directed mani
pulations          that    it    is    possible to resolve                this problem, of                so
much importance in dyeing.                            But I        am convinced that the
great cause of the inequality in this dye that the iron de                is,
posited on the cotton receives an oxydation merely      ex                                         by
posure to the air,               which       varies indifferent                 parts     of it.    The
threads which              are     on the outside             of   the hank are strongly
oxydated, while those in the inside, removed from the action
of    the air, experience               no charge.            It     thence follows,                    that
the inside         of     the     hank presents            a    weak (hade,                  while the

exterior part exhibit* a violet almost black. The moans to
remedy this inconvenience is, to warn the cotton when it is
taken        from the solution of iron,              and     to expose        it to the
madder moist.               The colour will become more                     equal       and
velvety.          The     solvents    of    iron are almost the fame sot thta
colour       as   for the yellow colour already mentioned.
     I   suppress here every          thing that   regards manipulation,               that
I may attend    only to chemical relations j and on that account
I   shall mention an observation which may serve to guide the
artist in brightening the violet on his cotton.                        The            red   of
madder and the oxydof iron deposited on the                        staff"   determine
the violet colour.                 This colour     becames     red     or blue, ac-
Cording        as   either of the two principles predominates.                         The
dyer knows by experience how difficult it is to obtain                            a   com
bination which produces the tone                     of colour      desired,           espe
cially when it is required to be very full, lively and durable.
This object, however, may                   be obtained, not only be varying
the proportions of the two colouring principles,                            but also by
varying the process               of brightening.        The only point               is,    to.
be acquainted with the two following facts                      ;    that. the          soda
destroys the iron, while the soap,                  by   strong ebullition,           seizes
in preference            the red     of   the madder.      Hence     it     is,   that the
colour        may be inclined to red or blue,                 according           as yon
brighten with one or the other of these mordants.                                     Thus,
cotton taken from the madder dye, when washen and boiled
in the brightening liquor with 30,00 of soap, will give                                       a
superb violet; whereas you will obtain only plum colour            a
in   treating       it   with soda.
     Theoxyd             of iron precipitated on any stuff unites                       also
very advantageously                with the fawn colour furnished             by   astrin
gents, and by varying the strength of mordants an infinity
of shades may be produced. In this case,    less  combi

 then       it is brought to the                 state    of black oxyd,          as has been

ftom the bright gray to the deep black, by merely passing the
cottons impregnated with the astringent principle through
a solution        of iron.         The oxyd               is then precipitated itself by
the principle which is fixed un the (tuff.
     An observation, which may become of                                   the utmost     value
for the art of dyeing,                     is,   that the most usual astringent ve
getables      all    furnish      a     yellow colour, which has not much
brilliancy, but which has sufficient fixity to be employed
with advantage.      This yellow colour     brightened in the.      is
series of vegetables, in proportion as the astringent principle
is   diminished,          and the viyacity               of   the colour     is   augmented
in the fame proportion.                     It    is    difficult then to obtain yellow
colours which are at the                    fame         time durable         and brilliant-
These two valuable qualities are to each other in an inverse
ratio   ;   but   it     is   possible to unite the colouring principles                       in
such   a    manner        as to   combine splendour with fixity.                         Green
oak bark unites perfectly with yellow weed, and sumach
with    green citron.            It   is    by    this mixture that we may be able
to combine with the oxyd of iron vegetable                                     colours,       the,
splendour of which                 is   equal to their durability.
 I      shall conclude            these reflections              with    an observation        in
regard       to the employment of astringents in the dyeing                                    of
cotton.       It    has been pretended, that    increasing the pro by
portions of         sumach and the bark of  alder trte or oak, these
substances          might        supply          the     place    of gall-nuts in dyeing
cotton red.         I         ssiould have received the more pleasure from
this discovery,          as    galls tend to render our colours considerably
dearer, and as           I     could have procured sumach at       very low       a
price, since        it   grows almost every where in the dry parts                             of
our southern districts.                    But   I     can safely assert, that      it   is   im
possible to employ these as substitutes,                       in whatever doses they
may be used.              The colour               is   always much paler, pooler,
and leso      fixed.      I      know that the             case   is    noj the fame in. re

 then remains fixed in their tissue, and in a greater quantity,

 nuts, which owe their development to animal bodies, retain
 a. character      of anitnalisation,      which they transmit           to the
 vegetable      stuff,   and by these means augment its affinities

 this combination.             This animalisation becomes            useless  in
 operating upon woollen or silk.

   IIIERMOMF.TERS                   have   hitherto    been    defective     for
 meteorological purposes, in           so far as   they only point out the
 degree    of   heat at the moment         of inspecting them, but do
 not (how what the difference           has been, from the time of one
 observation to another.
    The ingenious Robert Hook, in the end of the last cen
tury, mentions his intention of making a thermometer for
the above purpose          ;  but it does not appear      that    it  was ever
executed      :  neither docs he explain how it was to have been
done.

Royal Society               of London,            is made to (how its greatest rife
or fall from one period of observation to another.                                       This is
done by means of two small pieces of black glass, which
float on two different surfaces of mercury, within two glass
tubes hermetically sealed.                       These floats, when raised to their
greatest height,              adhere     to the sides            of   the tube,   by means
of a spring of glass, and become stationary, although the mer
cury falls.   After the observer has noted the temperature,
he, by a magnet held in his hand, draws down the float to
the surface of the mercury, in consequence                                of   a small    bit of
steel wire being enclosed                    in the float, and the instrument is
prepared          for another observation.                      This is an ingenious in
vention,          but requires too delicate workmanship to be fit for
common use              : besides,       it cannot          be made to record the de
grees     of   heat at intermediate periods.
  The thermometer lately invented by Dr. Rutherford, of
Ealilish, and described in the 3d vol. of the Edinburgh
Transactions,               is also an ingenious contrivance, but has the
fame defect            of marking only               the extreme          points to which
the liquor has risen or fallen in two separate glass tubes.
    Some years ago it occurred to me, that an air thermometer
might be used for the purposes required ; and accordingly
I read to this society a description of the instrument. But
having         formed another instrument                         of   a more simple con
struction,        I    beg leave to give a description of it.
    A B,       (ig. 1. (Plate       I.) is   a tube about 14 inches long, and
I of an inch               calibre, of thin glass,               sealed or closed at top.
To       the bottom,           which is bent upwards,                    there is joined a
glass tube 7 inches long, and                       T*3   ths   of an inch calibre, open
at top.           The tube          A   B    is   silled        with alcohol,     and from
£   to   £   is   silled with mercury.             As          liquids are incompressible
by weight in               any perceptible degree, neither the alcohol nor
mercury will               be affected      by    the weight of the atmosphere.
    FD     is   a     scale   of   brass or ivory, about 61 inches long,                    di

wire,                        reaching to H, having a knee
            termed the float-wire,
bent at a right angle, which raises one index, and depresses
another, according as the mercury rises or rails. This part
of the      apparatus           is defended           from wind or rain by means of
a glass tube        j\ inches long,                  closed at top and open at bottom,
so wide as to Aide easily Over the scale,                                    and, by means                of a
brass rim cemented                    to     it,   made to fit exactly to the circular
base    of the         scale.      This cover             need not be taken off, except
when        the instrument                 is      to be prepared                for an observation.
 [The operation of the float and                                  indexes        will      be better un
derstood from fig. 4, where                          a   similar apparatus, but belong

  F     G    is   the scale fixed to                 a   circular' piece of wood or brass
 D,     through which the small tube                                   is   made to pass.                Prom
 G     to   F     is   a   piece      of the        smallest gold wire stretched along
 the scale, fixed at the ends                            by   two pins.           L     L       are two     in

 wire in such              a   manner         as to slide             upwards and downwards
 with       a   very small force not more than two grains.                                            H, the
 knee       of the float-wire                 before described,                  is   made to encom
 pass the small svire between the two indexes,                                             so   that, when
 the float rises, the upper index                                     is   moved        upwards,           and,
 when        it   descends,           it   leaves the upper index stationary,                              and
 pushes         down the lower one, which                                   is   also left stationary
 when the float rises.                     When          the instrument               is   to be prepared
 for an observation, the one index                                    is   to be pulled down, and
 the other raised,                      by   means        of      a   bit of wire,              bent for the
 purpose,          until both of them touch the knee                                        os the float-
 wire:          and when           it   is    again observed,                 the upper index               will
  point out the greatest degree of heat,                                         and       the lower the
  greatest degree               of cold,        finee the time they were set.

sions.        The      large tube may be 40 inches long,                  and not in
creased in diameter ; but the small tube ought to be enlarged
in diameter, and not in length. The alcohol will thus be af
fected by heat or cold in as short a time as that before de
scribed.
    It   is unnecessary          to explain the clock-work.                 It    is suffi
cient to say, that a hollow cylinder of any light substance,
7  inches long and 5 inches diameter, is made to revolve
upon a vertical axis once in 31 days or a month ; piece

                                                 close to the

numbered at top, 1, 3, 3, &c. each of which is subdivided
into fix parts, to answer to 4 hours. The length of this cy
linder    is divided by lines surrounding                  or zones, in such

          piece of black lead pencil,

in their order, they will form a thermometrical chart, by
which the variations of heat and cold, during the year, may
all be seen and compared by one glance of the eye.
    By inspecting fig.         3. the effect      of  the instrument may be
seen.      It appears that the paper had been put on the cylin
der the first day        of  the month,         at midday,     when the    ther
mometer stood at 450} that it fell gradually till midnight to
85'; thereafter it rose till the 2d, at 1 P. M. when it stood at
4a0  j  then     it  descended       at midnight        to 35° ;  that  on the
4th at noon it rose to 50 j and at noon the 10th of the
 month it stands at 400.
    If 3 inches be added to the length of the cylinder, it may
 be made to delineate the variations                 of the barometer as well
as the    thermometer,           and   thereby to form a complete chart
or view of the progress            of both of them. And if instruments
of this kind       were kept      in different     parts  of the country,    and
 their charts compared together, it would afford much in
 formation with regard to meteorology.

it rises.          The      range      of    the    scale is about 3 inches,              being
equal       to that      of   a   common barometer of the best construc
tion, which has               a     bason wish a very            broad surface.            This

mon barometer, the one rising while the other falls.
   Fig. 4 represents the tube D C, &c. on a larger scale.
This part of the instrument is constructed exactly in the
fame way as the scale, float, &c. of the thermometer de
scribed      in    the article immediately preceding the present.                              F

embraces          a   very small            wire stretched        along     th-e scale,       and
thereby       raises or lowers them as the mercury                             rises or falls
in the tube           D C.
     The barometer                is   prepared         fur observation, by bringing

knee of the float-wire.                        When next           observed,       the upper
index will point out the greatest depression                                os the mercury
 or lightness of the                  atmosphere        ;    and the lower the greatest
rise   of   the mercury            or weight of              the atmosphere         since the
scale was prepared.
  By this mean*, the variations of the atmosphere arc much
more truly pointed out than      the common barometer   by                                      ;
for   it   often happens, that, during tempestuous                             weather,        or
before       it,   the      mercury both rises and                   falls within         a   few
hours, or during the night-time                           ;   which variations cannot
be     noticed         by     any      of   the barometers now               in    use.       The
sudden fall and rise, or even the rise and fall                             of the mercury,
always denote an extraordinary agitation                             in   the atmosphere.
By     a    common barometer the mercurv mav be at the fame
height       in   the morning               that   it   was the night before        ;     which
leads to      a     conclusion,             that   as there      has been no agitation
of    the mercury,            there will be calm or fettled weather                       :   but

                                                Springs.
    A HE spring               is,   in   a   variety of pieces of mechanism,                               not
 only      a    very    useful       auxiliary,            but         in    some       (as       in pocket-
watches,             gun-locks,           8cc.) an indispensable                        requisite.         But
from the difficulty of getting springs to stand,                                             as the      work
men express             it,   to     their temper, they are not                              so   frequently
applied to the purposes of mechanics                                    as   otherwise they might
be.  Great judgment                        and skill, as every one knows who                                   is
conversant with the subject, are required                                         to give to        a    metal
spring its due degree of temper                               ;   for,      if   made        too       hard,   it
snaps      ;   if   not hard enough,                it   sets.         Metal springs, however,
frequently fail from another cause, which   very little under                     is
stood   in consequence of which, the failure
           ;                                    usually attri                           is
buted, though,                as presently               will     be        seen,      unjustly, to the
unskilsulness           of the workman.                   It      is   a   circumstance not com
monly observed respecting                       a     metal spring, that                     if   it   has not
something to            stop against,          but       is   suffered to vibrate after per
forming the requisite action,                         it   will,       in    a   fliort space of time,
if    the action           be frequently repeated,                           either break or               set.
Whence liiis property                        arises   is      not at present the object of
inquiry.         It     is   mentioned that, in cafes                               which will admit
of   it,   this iiKonvenieney                  may be guarded against.                              In   those
cafes      in   which the vibration cannot conveniently be avoided,
a   wooden spring,                  which      is   not subject to the like ineonve-
niency,         is   the best, and, perhaps, the only                                    substitute.           A

if   permitted to vibrate, its temper or elasticity suffers not
the smallest diminution.
     A  gentleman, some few years ago, established a mill for                  a
manufacturing purpose,            in which, having         occasion   to apply
springs under the circumstances mentioned above, he at first
attempted        to make use       of  metal    ones,    but in vain, being
never able to make them stand                  a single   day's work.        He
tried every kind       of steel, and employed many different             work
men,      but still without success.          Merely     as a   temporary ex
pedient, till such time         as he   could get a fresh supply of steel
springs, he one day tried a wooden one, which, to his
agreeable surprise, completely answered his purpose j and
from that lime,         as  may be concluded,           he never used any
 other than wooden           ones.     The experiment was perfectly
 decisive   :  the springs were in daily action for four years suc
 cessively,    making, in      a   common way, from forty               to fifty
 strokes in a minute on an average.               At  the expiration      of the
 four years, those springs           which had escaped accidents were
 as elastic,    and as strong, as when first put into action.               The
 wood they were made of was red deal, clean grained,                        and
 perfectly free from knots.
     To many manufacturers who employ machinery for                          va
 rious purposes, in which springs, that must be suffered to vi-
 orate, form a part, this information, which may to some
 appear trivial,      will  be found     highly    useful.

ments made on board the Union and other ships at Sheer-
ness, are worthy                of attention, and cannot be too lirongly
recommended to the notice                 of every person who wishes to be
mailer of a simple and efficacious method for destroying con
tagion, or preventing it from breaking out, where there may
be reason to fear, from concurring circumstances, that there
is a danger of such an evil manifesting itself.
   The experiment on board the Union was conducted by
Mr. Menzies, late surgeon to his majesty's sloop Discovery,
and by           Mr, Baffin,        surgeon      of       the    Union      ; aud when        it   is
considered,          that fresh contagion was daily pouring                             into the
hospital         from the Russian              vessels,         which    were at that time
lying in the Downs, and which had brought with them a
speies of fever that might in every fense of the word be
termed an epidemy, it will be allowed, that the success which
attended          it was such that it cannot be too generally known.
     The wards            were extremely crowded, and the sick                          of   every
description lay in cradles, promiscuously arranged, to the
number of nearly two hundred                      of which, about one hun
                                                      ;
dred and fifty were               in different stages of the above malignant
fever, which was extremely contagious,                                 as appeared       evident
from its rapid progress                and fatal effects,               among the attend
ants on the sick, and the ship's company.
     The utensils           and     materials provided for the process were
the following:              A     quantity of sine sand, about two dozen
quart earthen pipkins,                    as    many             common         teacups,     some
song slips         of glass     to be used as spatulas,                 a   quantity    of con
centrated           vitriolic     (sulphuric)         acid, and         a   quantity of pure
nitre (nit rat         of potash).
     The         process was conducted in the following manner :
 1   st,   All   the ports and scuttles were sliut up the sand, which       ;
 had been previously heated in iron pots,                                   was then scooped
 out into the pipkins                by   means           of    an iron ladle    ;   and     in   this
 heated          sand,     in each pipkin,         a      small teacup was immersed,
 containing           about half an ounce                       of   the sulphuric       acid, to
 which,           after   it    had acquired          a        proper degree       of   heat,      an
 equal       quantity of nitrat of               potash          in powder       was gradually
                                                F   3                                        added,

 added,     and the mixture stirred             with a glass spatula      till thr
 vapour arose from it in considerable quantity *.                      The pip
 kins were then carried through the wards by the nurses and
 convalescents,         who kept walking about with them in their
  hands, occasionally putting               them under the cradles of the
 sick, and in every corner where any foul air was suspected
 to lodge.        In this manner they continued fumigating, until
 the whole space between decks was fore and aft filled with
 the vapour, which appeared like a thick haze.
      The vapourat        first excited    a good deal    of coughing among
  the patients,        which gradually         ceased  as  it became more ge
 nerally diffused through the wards:                  part of this effect, how
 ever,    was     to be attributed        to the inattention      of  those who
 carried the pipkins,             in putting them too near the faces of
 the sick ; which caused them to inhale the strong vapour,                      as
 it immediately issued from the cups.
      The body-clothes            and bed-clothes       of   the sick   were,   as
 much      as  possible,      exposed to the nitrous vapour during the
       That  the fumes of the mineral acids possessed the property of stop
 ping   contagion   was proved by (.'us ton asfai hack as the year 1773, who,
 by   means  of the  ftimesof muriatic acid extricated from themuriatofsoda
 (sea salt) by the sulphuric acid, purified thcair of ihecatlicdialofDijon,
 which had becn.so much infected by exhumations that they were obliged
 to abandon the building.           The process was afterwards published under
 the form    of"   Instructions for purifying the air in the military hospitals
 of the French lcpub'x;"         a copy of which appeared in the journal dul'hy -
 sique, Ventosc, an      2. eie   Fianc. The piocex consisted in removingthe
 patients,   heating some common salt, prc\ iously moistened           with water,
 upon a stove, ami th'ii pouring sulphuric acid upon the hotsalt. Inan
 instant the sulphuricaiid begins to act upon the salt, combine* w.th hi
 soda, and disengages its acid, which rises in the state of vapour. The
 opeiator then leaves the room, and shuts the door; and, alter twchc
 hours, returns and opens the windows, to admit fresh air.

                             Process for destroying Contagion.                                        Ji
fumigation             ;    and all the foul         linen removed from them was
immediately                 immersed      in    a   tub of cold water, afterwards
carried on deck, rinsed out, and hung up till nearly dry,
and then fumigated before                        it was taken to the wash-house                            :
a   precaution extremely necessary in every                                case    of infectious
disorder.           Due attention wa3 also paid                        to cleanliness and
ventilation.
     It took about             three hours to fumigate the (hip.                             In about
an hour after, the vapour having entirely subsided, the ports
and scuttles were thrown open for the admission                                         of   fresh air-
It could          be plainly           perceived, that the air of the hospital
was greatly sweetened                     even       by t'ii3      first fumigation.              The
process was            again next morning ; and the people
                            repeated
employed, being now better acquainted with       were more                        it,
expert, and finished the whole    about an hour's time. In
                                                       in
an hour afterwards, the vapour, having entirely subsided, the
fresh     air was freely admitted into the hospital                                      as before.
Fewer pipkins were employed for the evening fumigations
than for those of the mornings,                           as the    frclh air could not be
admitted          so       freely after the former            as   the latter.
     The       pleasing        and     immediate eff.-ct of the fumigation                            in
destroying the offensive and disagreeable smell, arising from
so many sick crowded together, was now very perceptible,
even      to      the nurses            aud attendants          ;    the    consequence               of
which was, that they          lo place some degree of confi
                                        began
dence in its efficacy, and approached ihe cradles of the                                              in
fected with less dread                 of being       atta<   ked with the disorder               :    so
that the sick were better attended, aud the duty os the hos
pital was more regularly                        and       more cheerfully               performed.
In   short,       a        pleasing    gleam        of hope seemed now to cast its
cheering            influence          over    that general         despondency, which
was before evidently pictured                        in   every countenance, from the
dread         and          horror each        individual        naturally         entertained of
being, perhaps, the next victim to the malignant                                         powers of
a   virulent contagion.
    It   is   a   remarkable fact, that from the 36th of November
                                                F4                                              J795>

1795, when the fumigation                            was       first resorted to,                 till    the
25th of December,                          not a person on board was attacked
with the fever,though in the three months preceding, more
than one third of all the people in the stiip had been seized
with the distemper, and of these more than one in sour were
carried off by it           ;   and the probability               is,   that the sickness and
mortality             would have gone on, increasing in proportion t.i
the diffusion of the contagion, and to the increasing despond
ency of the people, who considered themselves as         many                                 so
devoted victims.
     Tin:    advantage           of the fumigation was not                     felt     by   the (hip's
company and attendants alone, whom                                    it   preserved from the
baneful           effects       of    the fever     :    the sick and convalescents
derived almost an equal benefit                           from          it.    The symptoms
of the           diser.fe       were       meliorated,         and      lost    much of their
malignant appearance; and the advantage                                       of pure air, and
                                                                                   a
free from stench, to convalescents, may be                                             readily con
ceived.
     Great confidence                 is    always dangerous.                  It      proved        so   on
the present occasion.                      On the       17th    of December they ima
gined        themselves              so   secure, that they discontinued the cus
tom         of fumigating                 morning         evening, thinking that
                                                        and
once        a   day    was sufficient         ;   on the 25th, one of the nurses
suffered         a    flight attack;          and on the 26th,                 a   marine,           who,
for     a   week before,              had been      in   a    state     of intoxication,                 was
seized       with       the fever,          of which      he died.             These two acci
dents gave immediate alarm                          :   they returned again to the
practice of fumigating twice                        a   day   ;   and         from that time to
the extermination                     of   the    disorder, there              was      not an in
stance       of  a    person suffering from contagion on board tbe (bip.
     The        success     of       the experiment            was not confined to the
Union        :    the power of the nitrous vapour to destroy contagion
was equally displayed on board the Russian stiips in which                                                 it
was employed.                   The        safety too with        which         it     may be em
ployed, in any situation, without inconvenience                                              or rilk os
tire,   is   another great recommendation in its favour.

            An improved Instrument for drawing Teeth.                       73
    From     the description that has              been    given  of the pro
cess,   no    person     can be at any loss in resorting to the
same     kind    of fumigation.            It is only    necessary to observe,
for the sake      of  those who may not              be   versant  in chemical
pursuits, that the ingredients ought                   lo   be pure,   and that
metal     vessels   or rods must not be employed.                 Any kind of
metal getting among the ingredients would cause the vapour
to be very noxious, instead of salutary.                  The fumes that rife
should be white ;         if they   arc   of a   red colour, there is reason
to suspect the purity         of  the ingredients.
    The importance of this discovery                need not be insisted on :
it is equally applicable         to every species        of putrid contagion,
even to the plague itself.             It  should therefore be used       in all
hospitals and parish workhouses                 ;  and should be constantly
resorted to by the proprietors              of all large works, on the first
appearance       of infectious      disease   among the people employed
ia   them   :  indeed, it     should      be employed even as a preven
tive in all situations, where             a  number      of people, from the
 nature    of their   business, are obliged to be crowded together,
 or where, from local circumstances,                    there  are reasons   for
 suspecting     that the purity of the air is injured by noxious
 exhalations or other causes.               If  there be any circumstances
 in which      its  utility might be called in question, it can only
 be in cafes       of inflammatory diseases ; for, in such, super-
 oxygenation has been found hurtful.

    From tbe Journal des Mines, No.                      XXXIV.
1       HE    fragility     of chrome,          the     resistance    it   offers to the
action 6f     fire, and the        smallness of the masses                 in   which    it
has hitherto been naturally found, do not leave us any hopes
that this metal can ever be of great utility in the arts. This
assertion, however, may be going rather      little too far for
                                                             a                      ;

                                                                                    likely

           the O.ryd    of Chrome, and        the Chromic    Add.             75
likely to be of much benefit to society,              is sometimes      found,
after a certain period, to         be applicable to many            important
purposes in the arts and the sciences.
   The    acid and the oxyd        of this metal, however, may                be
of the   greatest  utility. The former, on account of the beauti
ful emerald green colour which it communicates, even to
emamel, without undergoing any alteration in its shade, will
furnish painters in enamel with the means of enriching their
pictures, and of improving their art ; and the second, by
the beautiful cinnabar red colour which it assumes and pre
serves    in   its  combination        with mercury,       the   orange red
colour which it gives with lead, and the canuelite red which
it communicates         to silver, may become         exceedingly valuable
to painting in oil and in water colours.
    It will   be   no  less useful    in chemistry,       by furnishing       an
excellent reagent        to detect    the    smallest quantities      of mer
cury,    silver,   aud    lead,  dissolved      in acids, by the different
colours it produces in them when its action is                 assisted  by an
alkali.     But in     the same manner as this acid serves lo dis
cover the presence           of   the above-mentioned           metals;      the
latter, in their turn, may         serve   to discover the chromic acid,
if it   has been     previously put in        a   condition lo produce the
 effects before mentioned.
    If  abundance of the chromic                 acid should     one day be
 found in any other combination than that of lead ; were it
 extracted by means of the carbonat of potash, we might
 make the red lead artificially,          and furnish,     in great plenty,
 an excellent orange          red colour for painting,          which    is fold
 very dear in Siberia, where it is employed for that purpose
with great effect. In this respect great benefit might be
 derived from the red lead, which is disseminated in small
 crystals or lamina?,       in the fissures of quartzy and free-stone
 matrices', where they           are commonly         found,    by reducing
                                                                          them
     As many of our leaden may not be acquainted with the history             of
ihts red lead,   we shall give the  following sboit account of it: The     fossil
                                                                         known

  j6                   On   lie   Use  of 'Chrome ,     &c.
  them to powder, and afterwards boiling it in                   a  solution of the
  carbonat of potash, and mixing with the niirat of lead this
  solution, after its excess in alkali has been saturated with the
  nitric acid.        By    this    process     red lead may be formed as
  beautiful as the natural, and perfectly free from the matrix.
      There is reason to presume             tha.t chrome, in the         state of an
   oxyd, or in that of an acid, will be found either free or                        in
   combination       with other substances ; for the analysis                  of the
   emerald    of Peru    has shown to me that its colouring                 principle
  is supplied by the oxyd           of this   metal ; which is a very agree
   able presage for the goodness and fixity of this colour, since
   we know that the emerald may be exposed lo the most
   violent degree of heat without being discoloured.
       I have found also that the yellowish green velvety crystals,
   which often accompany the                red lead    of Siberia,      are formed
   of chrome and          lead,     both     united in the oxyd state.              In
   certain fragments of red lead there may be                      seen    also green
   crystals, which have the fame form, the fame dimensions,
                                                                                  and
   known under the name of red lead was discovered by M. Pallas, in 1770,
   in the gold mine of Bercsof, near Ekaterimbourg in Siberia, under the
   fonnof prisms with four planes with, or without, terminating pyramids
   of a beautiful orange red colour, generally fixed in a quartzy matrix, to
   which they adhere     so  strongly that it is difficult to detach them.
       From theabove mine have been pi ocured all the specimens ofthis sub
   stance preserved    in the cabinets of Euro|>c, which shows that it was for
    merly very abundant; but we are a-suicd that for some years it has be
   come exceedingly scarce,        and that it is sold at  prcs« nt  for its weight in
    gold, especially when pure and of a tegularform. Specimens whit h do
    not possess a regular form, or which have been reduced to fragments
   are applied to the purposes      of painting, in which       art  it is exceedingly
   valuable, on account of its beautiful orange yellow colour, its durability
   in the air, and the facility with which it can be mixed with oil. Profc-
   gor Pallas expresses himself thus inspeaking         of this mineral, in his. Tra
    vels during the year 1770, under the         article of the gold mine of Pisth-

combinations originally exilled in the                                state   of the chromate

to that of oxyd, and converted the red into green.

   "8              On the    "Phosphorescence     of  the Luciole.
      The light of       the luciole does not depend on the influence
   of any external cause, but merely on the will of these insects.
   While they fly about at freedom their shining is very
  regular     ; but when they are once in our power,                   they shine
  very irregularly,         or do not shine         at all.     When      thev are
  molested they emit a frequent              light, which appears          to be a
  mark of their resentment.               When placed on their               back*
  they (hine almost without              interruption,      making continual
  efforts     to turn themselves        from that position.          In  the day
  time it is necessary to torment them in order to make them
  shine, and thence it follows that the day to them is the                    sea
  son  of   repose.      The luciole emit light at pleasure from everv
  point of their bellies, which proves that they can move all
  the parts of their viscera independently of each other. Thev
  can also render their phosporefeence               more or    less  vivid,  and
  continue it      as  long   as  they please.
     The faculty of sparkling            does    not   cease  on their bellie*
 being torn, or opened             by an     incision.     Carradori saw part
 of   the belly     of   one separated from the rest          of  the body, the
 light of which was almost extinguished, grow luminous all
 of a sudden for some seconds, and afterwards become
 gradually extinct.           He sometimes saw a like portion, which
 had been separated,             pass   suddenly from the most brilliant
 state    to that of total darkness,            and   afterwards resume        it?
 former brightness.            Carrauori ascribes this phenomenon to
 a remainder         of irritability, or      a stimulus     produced by the
air, which appears             the    more probable,         as a mechanical
irritation produced the fame effect.
    A    slight compression        deprives the luciole        of their power
of    ceasing to shine.          The author      is inclined to believe that
the movement by which they conceal their light, is executed
by drawing back their phosphoric substance into a particular
membrane or tunic.                He supposes also that the sparkling
consists     in  a trembling      or  oscillation of the phosphoric ma:-.
He    is  of opinion that       there is no emanation         of a phosphoric
substance,       and that the whole phenomenon takes place in
                                                                              the

Trrc  interior part     of the luminous          viscera.    When the shining
is at its greatest degree        of height, it is         so  strong that     a per
 son may by        it  easily  distinguish         the hours on the smallest
 watch, and the letters of any type whatever.
     The phosphoric          part   of     the     luciole    does     not extend
further than to the extreme               rings of     the belly        It is there
enclosed      in  a  covering composed            of two portions of mem-
hranes, one       of which forms the upper, and the other the
 lower part      of the belly, and which are joined together.
 Behind     this receptacle is placed the phosphorus,                    which re
 sembles a paste,        having the sniel! of garlic,             and    very little
 taste.    The phosphoric matter                 issues   from     a  fort   of bag
 on the slightest        pressure   :   when squeezed out, this matter
  loses its splendour in a few hours,                  and is converted into
 a  white dry substance.            A   portion of the phosphoric belly
 put into oil, shone          only with       a feeble     light,    and was soon
 extinguished.         In water,     a  like portion slionc with the fame
 vivacity    as in the air,       and for      a  much      longer time.         The
 author thence concludes that the phosphorescence                            of the
 luciole is not the effect             of flow inflammation, nor of the
  fixation of azotic        tjaz   as   Gcettling       thinks,     as the    oil in
  which they mine            does   not contain          a   single    air- bubble:
  besides, the phosphorus         of   these insects shines in        a barometri
  cal  vacuum.         The observation           made      by Foster,      that the
 luciole diffused       a more vivid light in oxygen                  gaz than in
  Atinoiphcr.c      air, does not, according to Carradori,                   depend
  upon   a combustion more animated by the inspiration of this
  gaz, but on the animals feeling themselves, while in that
   gaz, in   a   better   condition.         "    Whence then arises," fays
  the author,      "  the phosphoric light of the luciole ? I am of
  opinion," adds he, " that the light is peculiar and innate in
  these insects,      as  several    other productions             are peculiar tu
  other animals.          As   some animals have the               faculty of ac
  cumulating the electric fluid, and of keeping it condensed in
   particular organs, to diffuse           it afterwards at pleasure,           there
   may be other animate endowed with the faculty                        of keeping
                                                                                    in

in   a condensed     state the  fluid which constitutes light.      It  is
possible that by a peculiar organization          they may have the
power     of extracting the light which enters into the com
position of their food, and of transmitting             it to the reser
voir    destined    for that purpose,     which they      have  in their
abdomen.         It  is not even impossible        that they may have
the power to extract from the atmospheric air the luminous
fluid   ; as other animals have the power           of extracting from
the fame air, by       a  chemical process,   the fluid of heat."
     Carradori    discovered     that the phosphorescence        of the
luciole is   a  property independent      of the life of these animals,
and that it is chiefly owing to the soft state        of the phosphoric
substance.       Its light is suspended    by drying, and it is again
 revived by softening it in water ; but only after a certain
time of desiccation.          Reaumur, Beccaria, and Spallanzani
observed      the fame thing in regard to the pholades and the
 medufa.
     By plunging        the  luciole alternately into lukewarm and
 cold water, they sliine with vivacity             in the former, but
 their light becomes extinct in the latter          ; which, according
 to the author,       depends    on the alternate agreeable and dis
 agreeable     sensation    which they experience.       In warm water
 their light disappears        gradually.    Dr. Carradori tried on
 the luciole and their phosphorus the action of different
  saline and spirituous liquors,        in which they exhibited        the
  fame appearances        as other phefphoric animals.         These last
  experiments prove that the phosphoric matter of the luciolr
  is only soluble    in water.

deposited in these excrescences,          is, together     with the curculij
of   the centaury,     a new species.        It  is  of  a   longisti    figure,
covered below with short yellow hair, and above with golden
yellow velvety spots.          Its corslet is variegated       with     specks ;
and the covering        of   its wings with      specks    and     stripes.     It
has a short     proboscis, and fliows some likeness to the curculio
vilkjiis of Gvoffroy. Its        larva represents a fort      of ichneumon .
By chemical       analysis it exhibits some traces          of common salt;
by distillation with       a strong   dry heat,     some volatile lixivious
salts ; and it contains, besides these, some gelatinous,                   and a
little sebaceous and        slimy extractive        matter.       If   about     a
dozen or fifteen of these infects, when in the                 state   of  larvav
or even when come lo perfection, be bruised and rubbed
(lowly      between   the fore-singer and thumb             until they have
lost their moisture, and is the painful tooth, where it is hol
low, be touched with that singer, the pain ceases sometime*
instantaneously.         This power or property the singer will re
tain for a year, even though it be often washed and used.
A    piece   of (hamoy leather will         serve equally well with the

plete success.       In two of these cases the hollow teeth arose

local.                    <U+2666>
    If the gums     are insluiucd, the remedy is         of no avail.        Ac
cording      to Professor     Gcrbi,    the   hollowness in          the teeth
arises from an acrid matter           which irritates the nerves,            and
which is neutralised        by the juices     of  the insect.
    This pr perty of curing          the tooth-aclic       has been disco
vered     in other infects,      as appears   by   a paper     of Dr. Corra-
dori,    iuterted  in   the   Ghrnale f.sch-medtco of Brugnatelit,
Part    I. The     experiments were made in the town of Prato,
where the property of some insects to cure the tooth-ache
had been known among the peasants, even before any thing
was published on the subject by Gerbi and Comparini. A
certain Luigi Mari is here made to assert, that he laid hold
of about     a dozen   of these insects    with his    singers, and heaped

them over each other, by which means                         his singers,        for a
whole year,       though he daily washed his hands, were en
dowed with the property             of curing     the looth-ache,        by merely
touching the affected tooth. The author of the letter affirms,
that the following          method will always afford relief.                    The
infect described by Roffi,           in his Fauna Etrusca, under the
name     of   carabus cbryfocephalus,            is to be held for some mi
nutes between         the thumb and the fore-singer, and the                         dis
eased    tooth and the gums are to be afterwards touched with
that finger.       If the   pain does not         cease   on the first touching,
the singer is to be well dried, and must be applied to the in
sect    ag.iin, and then to the tooth             ; and    this is to be conti
nued     alternately till the pain          entirely.
                                             ceases    M. Cypriani
asserts, that he cured every cafe       of the tooth-ache, without
exception, by         this method, within the space of eight or nine
minutes.
   More infects         possess    the   like property, and experiments
made with the following were equally successful.                         The cara-
bui ferriigincus        of Fabricius         ;   the coccinella septem punc-
tala (the lady bird)        ;     the chrysomela pvpu/i, and the cbrrso-
mela sangu'tnolenia.              It would appear that this property be
longs to various kinds of the coleopterj.
   The    idea   of   these insects being endowed             with the property
of curing the tooth-ache is not confined                          to     Italy   ;    for
Dr. Hirfch, dentist to the court of Weimar,                           asserts    [Ver-
kundiger, September               24, 1798), that he           employed them
with the happiest effect, except in some cafes where his pa
tients were       females.         Dr. Ilirfch fays, that             he look that
small insect, sound commonly among corn, cocanellasiptem-

founds parts of the gums, as well as the diseased tooth. Dr.
Hirfch adds, that he made the fame experiment few days                  a

 up, leaving only the wings and an empty shell                ; and there
 fore  proposes     to physicians, to       turn their attention to the
 finding out of sonic method for preserving              the virtue  of  the
 insect,  so that its efficacy      may he in full vigour throughout
 the year.
    Professor   Gobi's work        on the virtues said to be possessed
 by the antioduntalgiau          was sirlt announced in this country
 by  Dr. JJcddoes,      in  a  paper published     in  the Monthly     Ma
gazine fur November 1796 ; but in such a cautious manner
as evidently to (how that he was afraid an improper degree
of credulity might          be ascribed to him.         He   has however
proposed, that impregnated fhamoy leather should be import
ed by the way     of Leghorn       ;   but as the  virtue seems to belong
to several coleoptera       in this country, such an importation           is
tin necessary.     The impregnating of leather (other substance?
might    also be  tried) by rubbing it with the insects, seems a
good way of realizing what has been proposed by Dr. Hirsch.
    The fear of having credulity imputed should never hinder
the publication    of physical     facts, announced by men       of learn
ing and reputation, however unaccountable they may ap
pear ; for, no one will pretend that we already are acquainted
with all the laws of nature          :  on the contrary, they .ought to
be made generally known,              that their truth or falsehood may
be established     by numerous          experiments, especially when,
as in the    present     instance, the means are so much within
the reach of every person who may wish to determine the
matter for himself.
    While on     the subject     of tooth-   ache, we may add, for the
information of those who have not perused Dr. Bcddoes' in
genious publications          on the medicinal effects       of factitious
airs, that charcoal has been found to relieve the pain.                 Mr.

 one day,     when in great pain, filled the cavity of the tooth
 with     the charcoal dentifrice, and was surprised to sinil
 herself in        a   f.w    seconds free from pain.            It might probably
 be urged,          that any substance silling the hollow              of the tooth
 mechanically,               and thereby            preventing the access of atmo
spheric air, would produce the same effect                                :     but        I   am rather
 inclined to attribute die temporary good effect experienced                                                     in
 this cafe, to the power of the charcoal *.

height.        For       example,       when the water              in the cylinder                    H
stands at      K,                               A        L

suppose the cock D open that the air may escape), the water
will continue to slow from H into A till it stands at
the fame horizontal line.
  The higher the water K                      is raised in         II    the greater is the
weight of the column, and                    the quicker the escape                    of the air.
liy    these    means          M. Van-Marum obtains what Messieurs
Lavoisier       and        Meusnicr         call    pressure        in       the    gazometer,
merely by the higher level                    of    the surface          K    over     L.        That
the height          of    the water in       H      may be observed,               a   glass tube
MM        about      i£    inch in diameter, and connected with                                  it,   is
placed     between            H   andA, in which the water will always
have     the fame           altitude as    H. An ivory scale, divided
                                              in
into inches and                lines, fastened to            a   cork ball,         floats upon
this water, and            serves    to (how the difference                  of    the altitudes
ot the water at           L    and   K.
     The cock            N,    fitted     to the top      of      the open cylinder                O,
serve?,    together           with the cock          P,    to preserve             the pressure
perfectly uniform.                  Suppose,        for example, that                  a    constant
pressure       of   water     of two inches high                 was required, as much
water must be suffered to flow continually into                                H       as   is   equal
in  bulk to the quantity of water that this pressure of two
inches forces from II into A. For this purpose, sill the
cylinder       O    with water to the height of four inches, and turn
the cock       N until         the pressure         of    the four inches              of water,
which     is   maintained            by   the cock       P,   forces through            N into H
a   quantity of water exactly equal                        to the quantity that                    the
pressure       of two inches            forces from       H into A. The index Q
of the cock N,             and the scale        RS,      serve to give to           the cock           N
the exact opening required                  ;      this having           been       determined
beforehand, and the scale divided accordingly.
      The cock       N     begins to open when the index                           It   is    turned
towards        S;    and, for this reason,                the gradation            of       the scale
                                                                                             begins

 begins at R.        When     the index is in a vertical position, the
 cock is completely open.
    As it might perhaps            be difficult    to give      to the cock     P,
which is connected with           a cistern   of water,       such an opening
as  not to permit more water to flow through it than neces-
                           a height of four inches in the cylinder O,
far}- for preserving
a waste pipe TT is applied at this height, which suffers all
 the superfluous       water   of  the  cock    F   to run off.          In order
 that it may be more conveniently observed, whether the cock
 P has a sufficient opening tor maintaining a sour-inch co
lumn of water,       a glass tube    U, marked       at the required height,
is applied on the outside, connected             with the cylinder O.
    To    sill this gazouieter,    nothing more is necessary than to
let   water run out from the cylinder              H.       For this      purpose,
the cock         V  must be opened       until the water           in H. stands
lower than that in         A. The cock D, and the cock \V, stand
ing over       the bell X, are then opened             The air contained in
 X  rises through the pliable tube           YY       into A.        This silling
may be continued,            by leaving the cock         V open, that the
water which proceeds through the syphon                    from A to 11 may
 run out, and the surface of the water in                   II  stand always a
few    inches lower than that in          A.      At the       fame     lime the
bell   X    is to be supplied     with new gas in the usual manner.
When the operation of silling is completed, the cock V is
to be shut, and that        atZ opened;     the lower       pirt of   the open
ing of the key of which is in the fame horizontal line with
 zero of the kale,         which stiows in cubic inches the altitude
of  the water      in A.    By these means the water falls no lower
in  A    than to the above-mentioned             line;      and     A   is conse
quently filled with air to the beginning               of the    scale a b. Be
fore the cock       D   is (but, care must be taken that the water in
 the bell     X do  not stand higher than the water that surrounds
it in   its tub,    which may        be effected,       if   the    bell be de
pressed in the tub till the internal and external altitude of
the water be perfectly equal ; and the air in A will then be
 of the lame density as that of the atmosphere.

    The gazomcter is famished with                  a    thermometer          fg,
\\ hich is  so cemented      with sealingwax         into   a    piece   of cop
per   e, that  the bulb of it is within the gazometer. By these
means the temperature of the air used may be known, and
its weight accurately ascertained. The tripod on which the
gazomcter stands facilitates the adjustment of the apparatus,
and a brass bottom screwed upon the tripod is furnished
wit'i   a brass   rim or lip to receive the glass          A  and keep      it  fast
in us place.        Exactly at the upper level of this rim the scale
a   b commences.        The  scale is   of ivory,   and fastened on a flip
of brass,     and at the ends are two square pieces                of  brass, by
which it is     made fast, by means         of two    screws, to the cover
 at the top,     and to the before-mentioned              lip.     The    scale is
divided in the common method, by pouring equal measures
 of water   (suppose a cubic inches) into the glass,                 and mark
 ing the height of each on the scale, or,                  as   the glasses      are
 nearly cylindrical       except at the neck,         it may be sufficient
 to use at once 32 cubic inches,             and divide the          height into
 16 equal     parts  ;  the neck    of  the vessel must be divided,               as
 above, by 2 cubic inches at a time.
     To explain     the use  of the gazomcter it is only necessary to
 show how the          syphon GFEI it filled at the commence
 ment of the experiment.             This   is done almost in the fame
 manner in which          M. Lavoisier filled      the syphon,         which he
 employed in order to fill the lamp               used    in  the experiment
 respecting     the combustion      of oil V       The method           is as fol
 lows :  The two cocks N          and P are to be opened at the fame
 time,    and to be kept      so until    the cylinder        H   is completely
 filled with water.       The  pipe    GG, which        is open both above
 and below, as the crooked pipe            FE    is not vet joined to it at
 F, will   be filled at t!ie fame time with the cylinder.              The     tube
 G G is    then to be stint below by the cock b.                   This cock       is
 fixed into a piece      of brass,  which     is fastened      in   the cylinder
 H    by sour screws, the heads        of which     may be seen at         i,i,i,i.

the cylinder     H,  and is made fast at the top             by   a piece   of
brass,   which is screwed to the interior edge of              the cylinder
by two screws,      the heads      of which     are seen at    K.    As  soon,
therefore,    as h is shut, the     crooked pipe       FE  is to be screwed
to  G G    and the cock      B.     The cock B       is shut, the screws is
to be unscrewed        to open the tube         at that place, and water
poured by means of            a  funnel into the orifice thus opened.
As    soon as the pipe         EF    is full,  the orifice is again shut.
The cock      b being then opened, and afterwards               B,   so much
 water runs from      H, through the syphon GFE I, that A will
 be  completely filled, if care be taken, by opening the cocks
N    and  P,  that the water in       H  stand always higher than that
in A.     To    hasten the silling     of  the glass     A, it will   be con
venient to sill the cylinder        H almost entirely.
    In order that the bent pipe        E F may      be fastened air tight to

justed in the fame manner into             a piece    of copper    soldered to
 the tube    G G.     All   the tubes    of this   apparatus are adjusted
 to their respective     cocks in the fame manner.                It will   be
 sufficient to grease slightly the surface of any of these conical
 pieces, before it is put in its place, to prevent all communi
 cation with the air of the atmosphere.
    The balloon, for      the composition        of water,  placed upon its
 tripod between the gazometers, differs from that of Lavoisier,
 principally in the manner of shutting it in order to prevent
 the entrance of air.           For this purpose there is a rim of
 copper a a      {fg.$)       fixed   on the neck of the balloon,           by
                                                                        means

  means of plaster of Paris, which, that it may afford no pas
  sage to   the atmospheric air,          is coated over           with   common
  cement above the edge of the band a a,                      as  'may be    seen at
  b b ; and    this cement is covered with             a   stripe os linen cc, a
 quarter of an inch in breadth, dipped in the white of an egg
 mixed with lime.          The rim of copper a a, has a copper ring
 dd,    soldered    to it at right angles;          and on which the plate
 of copper      e e  is ground,     in   such    a   manner that it is suf
 ficient to grease slightly the upper surface of the ring d d,
 when a vacuum is to be made, taking care to apply so little
 grease that     it may not      penetrate     into the balloon.            To   ex
 haust the balloon there is         a  cock which communicates by                   a
 bent tube with an air pump placed behind the balloon                         ; and
 to prevent     the working of the air pump from                      shaking the
 balloon, this bent tube is made in part of elastic gum.
    The    plate of copper       et   is kept     down upon the ring d d
 by   six screws,     two of which        may be        seen    at ff,   placed at
 equal distances        around the neck of the bniloon,                    and   by
 means of which          the plate     ee may        be made        to press   very
 strongly on the ring dd, on turning these screws by the help
of a key. Both of the gazometers are made to slmt in the
fame manner.
    The inferior     surface  of  the plate     t  e  is covered, as far as it
covers the opening         of  the balloon,       by     a  thin plate    of   pure
silver,   in order that      the vapours      formed during the experi
ment may not touch the copper.                   For     the fame reason the
bent tube /»», in the balloon,              is also made           of  pure silver.
At   the extremity      of this  tube is a piece         of platina, having       a
very small aperture, scarcely sufficient               to afford a passage to
a very fine needle.        The part «, which           serves as a conductor
to kindle the hydrogen gaz by an electric spark, is also made
of platina, as far as it is not enclosed in the glass tube o o, by
which it is insulated. I have preferred platina for these
two parts, in order to prevent the oxydation of the metal,
which the heat produced by the combustion of the hydrogen
gaz in oxygen might occasion.                   The      tubes f>pf>f>      which
                                                                              serve

serve to conduct the gazes                  into the balloon,       are made       of
glass,     and cemented           into the copper tubes        q q,   which     have
conical extremities like those above described to six them on
the     cocks.        These      glass   tubes     are   raised   a  little    above
the     edge      of   the   cylinder     H,    to prevent      the water from
passing into the balloon, should you happen to sill one                        of the
glasses     A,    and neglect to shut well the cock              C.
    It will       be proper to make the glasses               A,  pretty large,     if
they can be procured so, in order that the gazometers may
contain         the    more air.       It will however          be best to make
them rather high               (28 or 30 inches) than wide, in order
 that the exactness of the scale a b may not be diminished.
M. Van-Marum                 answers     an objection which he fays may
possibly be urged            against    this apparatus, namely, that the
combustion            is obliged to be suspended every time that the
gazometers need to be replenished                       with either oxygen or
 hydrogen.           He    says   this is no solid objection, as he finds
 that, since he used phitina for conveying the electric spark,
 lie never        fails to kindle        the   hydrogen the first moment it
 enters the        billoon    ; and that,      besides,     the combustion       of  a
 cubic foot of hydrogen gaz, in order that the water produced
 may not contain acid, ought to take                    six  hours.    Those who
 wish      to make experiments            of longer duration,        have only to
 attach      two other gazometers ; by which means, while the
 one     set  is emptying, the other may be replenished.
     For ihis       purpose      it will    be necessary to have,        instead    of
 the cock        u, two cocks         Z  1,  Z 2, (fig. 4) screwed to a piece
 of copper        fixed to the cover         of the balloon; and by whkh
 each     of   these cocks has a communication                with the bent tube
 /  »/,   by means        of two holes x, x, which             proceed obliquely
 through this piece, and end in the tube /.                       The    first gazo-
 meter, which communicates with the balloon by the cock
 Z   1, being almost              emptied, the cock         Z  2,  of  the    second
 gazometer, may be opened, after having made the pressure
 in   the second         gazometer equal          to   that   in the first.      It is
 evident that the pressures                 of  these two gazometers being
                                                                               equal,

equal, the velocity with which the hydrogen gaz enters the
balloon,       will not   experience   the  least change.       When    the
 first gazometer is entirely empty,          the cock   Z  I  is (hut, and
the first gazometer is silled; and the cock           Z i   is not opened
till   a   little before the second gazometer is totally emptied.
The second gazometer is then to be filled again, and in this
manner the combustion of hydrogen gaz may be continued
by these gazometers to any length of time without interrup
tion.       To introduce      the oxygen gaz without          interruption
into     the balloon by means         of two gazometers, it will         be
sufficient that the two cocks, which form             a  communication
between        the gazometers and       the   balloon, be immediately
fixed in the covering        of the latter.
     Both halves of the apparatus being similar, the letters of
reference are only marked on that part which is given in
outline upon the plate.
XIX.        On the Choice    of Steel, and    the Methods    of hardening
     and tempering it.        By  Mr.   S.  Vakley.        Communicated

the fame         individual  :
under a great disadvantage (notwithstanding his excellent
theories) for want of the experience of the practitioner,
                                                                        and
the practical man seldom has a theory to guide him.                      He
knows from experience that certain things or operations will
produce a particular effect, but can give no reason why.
His application         to business   has not allowed him          time to
search into causes, nor to reason upon effects; and it would be
difficult to persuade this useful class of men how much theo
retical knowledge might be gained by applying their lei
sure hours        to study,   and  how much pleasure might be de
rived from thus uniting theory with practice, which so mu
tually    assist each   other.
                                                                      I was

                    On hardening ami tempering SUtl.                               93
 I   was    led    to   these      reflections by       reading     Mr. Collier's
 paper on iron and steel (inserted               in the first number of your
excellent Magazine), in which                     he gives some methods            of
 hardening and           tempering        steel ; and     concludes by faying,
 that the springs for penknives are covered over with oil be
 fore    they arc exposed to the fire to be tempered,                     but gives
 no reason for that application.                  I  shall therefore     endeavour
 to supply that defect, and               add some other observations             on
 the management of steel, conceiving that any useful hint
on    a subject     so  universally applicable to the manufactories
 of this country will            be   of   general    benefit.     It is   a subject
of   the first importance to the practical mechanic                     :  take this
 useful substance away, and he would be utterly incapable                           of
 proceeding one         step   forward,       and would       soon be convinced
 that   steel is  of more       value than gold itself.
    I :or ordinary purposes, the method noticed by Mr. Collier
will    answer very well, both for hardening and tempering ;
 but in many         cases  it is necessary that the           steel should    be   of
 the best quality, and be both hardened                   and tempered in such
a manner as to preserve the greatest hardness possible without
 brittleness    ;  and steel      is  of   more or less value in proportion
as it possesses this property in             a greater or less degree.
    Steel, when soft, can be wrought into almost any form as
well     as   iron,    welding excepted,           of which      the better sorts,
particularly      cast   steel, are    incapable.       It  can be forged,     filed,
turned in       a  lathe, drawn into wire, rolled into large plates,
&c.    Sec.   and, when by these means brought into the desired
form, it can then be nude                so hard as to be capable         of cutting
the hardest substances (the precious stones excepted), while at
the fame time it is almost proof against being itself worn by
friction    :  but in this      state it i»  brittle, like all other hard       sub
stances,      and    for many purposes            must    have    this brittleness
lessened, and this is what is termed by workmen,                       tempering,
and consists in giving it certain degrees                  of heat according       to
the temper desired,            which may be produced in any degree
until    the whole effect       of hardening       i<  destroyed,    and the sictl
                                                                                    is

shall offer a few remarks, proved                                by long experience                        ;   and,
first, on the choice of                    steel      for such purposes                     as   require the
best that can be procured for making cutting instruments,
such as gravers,                  punches, turning tools, chisels, &c. &c. to
be employed in turning or cutting tempered                                              steel, and sub
stances that are too hard to be cut by tools made                                                of ordinary
steel : for these purposes                      cast steel is undoubtedly the best ;
but even this sort differs in quality.
     The general mode of choosing                                such as is most suitable sor
the above purposes                    is to break            a   bar, and observe its frac
ture, and to select the closest grained ; but this mode is not
always certain, owing to the difference made in the fracture
by the         steel      being hammered under                        a greater             or   less degree
of       heat,       steel     being much improved by being hammered
under          a    low heat,        and even when cold ; and when over
heated, being quite spoiled for the above purpose.                                                    It   is ow
ing       to this circumstance that the best sorts                                      of   cast steel are
incapable              of    being welded             as   above mentioned.                           Another
method              is,     to harden     with        as   low       a    heat as possible              a      piece
of steel,        and then to break              it,   and observe its fracture: but this
is    not wholly to be depended                            upon        ;     for some            steel breaks
with       a   very close grain,               and     yet       is   not of            a   good       quality.
But the            surest     method      is   to have one end                     of   a   bar drawn out
into      a    small rod under            a    low heat, an obscure                              red for         in
stance, or but little above                           then heat                as before, and sud
                                                                           if it
                                               ;
denly plunge                it   into pure cold water                 :        it   proves hard, anil
                                                           it,
requires           a   great force to break                it         is   good, let its fracture
be what            it   may*;       and   I     have       always found that the speci
mens that hardened with the lowest heat, and when in                                                            llui
state      required          the greatest force to                    break        them, proved the
best steel.               Having thus       selected steel fit for the required use,
     
          This     circumstance      deserves particular attention, as workmen, in
general,       reject such steel as bieaks with                  a   coarse fracture, even though
it   be   of such      a    quality as to require      a   great force to bicak                  it   after being
hardened.
                                                                                                               and.

and, with the precautions already noticed, given it the pro
per form, it may be hardened ; but the fame method will
not answer for all purposes.                        Some pieces,                from their size
and figure, arc very difficult to be hardened                                   3   if   they are
large, they heat the water                in immediate contact with them,
and the heat is communicated                             to the rest       of    the water, so
fast    that it    prevents        the        pieces       from        being cooled          quick
enough to produce the desired effect                             :     this is in part         pre
vented by continually moving the piece about in the water ;
but when too large to be hardened                          by this method,                 a stream
of water        must be employed               ;    and for such pieces               a6   the face
of large anvils,          a   birch "broom                 is used         with     advantage       to
break the bubbles that arc formed by the continual disen
gagement        of air,   mid which,           if not swept          away, would prevent
th3t intimate contact and uniform succession of the stream
necessary to produce the degree                      of    hardness required.                Other
articles, from their length, are difficult, and almost impos
sible to be made hard without bendimr, or otherwise altering
;heir figure : this circumstance occasions a great deal of
"rouble     ;   and many       a   piece           of work    is spoiled,            after a good
leal   of labour    has been bestowed upon                          it.    The method that
iias succeeded bcli with me is, either to enclose the piece or
pieces intended to be hardened                        in an iron cafe or box, open
Jt   one end (for the more ready dropping the pieces into the
water), and giving            ita    flow,          yet regular heat            ;    then to take
the cafe out       of the     sire, and drop the pieces into the water
in     such manner as         will   allow          them to come as little                  as pos
sible in contact          with the air.                   This   method             answers        two
good purposes at once,                causing            the heat to be more equally
applied, and preventing the contact of the air, and of course
any staling; and when the work has been polished and well
defended from the air,     comes out nearly as clean as
                                         it                                                          it
was      before.     When          the        greatest       possible           hardness      is   re
quired,     it    may be obtained                   by   using quicksilver instead                   of
water; but this can only                       be employed                 for small articles.
For some purposes steel                  is   required       to have        a   superior degree

     of   hardness given to its surface,          such as in    the cafe of files,
      &c. This     is obtained by using a coarse powder made               of  lea
     ther slightly burned,         hair or horn, either in raspings or in
     powder:     this is mixed with a little common salt, and the
     files, when just red hot, are thrull into          a heap   of this powder,
     some   of which adhering            to   their surface is carried into the
     fire with them, and gives them              a cafe   hardening    : the    salt
     fluxes   upon     their surface, and         defends them from the air
     while    passing from the fire into the            trough of water, into
     which    they are plunged to harden.             The workmen        fay, the
     longer this water is used for this purpose the better.
         We   are now come to the            last process    called tempering,
     for one method of which            fee  Mr. Collier's paper; but         that
    method cannot be conveniently applied in all cafes, and has
    several disadvantages,       some     of which I    shall mention.      First,
    each piece       must be made bright that the change of                colour
    may be better seen, and must be heated singly or nearly so ;
    and pieces      of irregular figure cannot        be made to receive         an
     equal degree      of heat in all their parts,        so  that some will be
    softer   than others.        These circumstances would retard the
    manufactory of many articles very much, and prevent their
    being afforded       at the present prices, such as the springs ot
    gun locks, door locks,           various articles in clock and watch
    work,      &c. &c.        The     necessity    of making them bright
    enough to mark the change of colour is obviated by smear
    ing them with oil or tallow, which helps to apply the heat
    more uniformly,         and marks the temper as well as by observ
    ing the colour,       or nearly so; or by putting the things to              be
    tempered      into    a  proper    vessel,   and adding so much oil or
  J tallow   as will   cover   them,       and then holding them over die
+
    fire or the     flame of    a  lamp until      a sufficient beat is given.
    By this means        the most irregular pieces           may be uniform])
    heated, and great numbers may be done at one time, and
    with    great    certainty   :  thus are clock        and   watch pinion?,
    watch     verges,     balances,      &c. tempered;        sometimes     many
    dozens at once;           and no more          lime is necessary for the
                                                                           u hole

beat is continued until the smoke becomes                                            more abundant,
and of a darker colour, it will be equal                                           to a brown,                     arid

mild fort of          steel       is   employed.               If the       tallow        be   heated              so   as
to yield     a    black smoke, and still more abundant, this will dt*-

drawn;       this would equal                   a    full blue colour.                      Increase               the
heat    till the tallow continue                           to burn,           being ouce lighted,
and this will denote                   a    pale blue         :   and      if      the    whole           of the

                            MATHEMATICS.
    The mathematical          class had      proposed      for the year    1798
the following      prize question       :
     " As   the labours    of  the ablest astronomers        have left  several
 points respecting the variation in the obliquity              of the ecliptic
 to be explained,        the Academy invites the Learned to turn
 their attention to this subject once more,                 and  will  adjudge
 the prize     to that    paper which shall contain the most inte
 resting researches on it.                                                      

  the tenth volume of the New Transactions                    of the  Imperial
  Academy of Petersburgh            ;  and    has brought together, ki            1

  of the   academy     was to fee removed,            as far as poffible, the
  difikulties with which         the subject       is still  attended,    it 'has

ing considerations       :  In    regard to observations         of  the obli
quity of    the   ecliptic,     astronomers        do not appear to be yet
fully   agreed.     The     academy        wishes,     therefore, that these
observations      may be carefully           examined,       and   particularly
that the following question may be explained : How far can
the old observations be employed with advantage, and how
far back may we venture to go in making use of them ?  la
regard to the theory, one             of  its most important principles,
without doubt,        is to determine the masses            of  the perturbing
planets, and especially         of Venus.         The academy       desires that
these may be deduced            from principles          independent of the
obliquity    of the ecliptic     ;   and, above all, that the candidates
will   endeavour     to discover      how the mass of Venus may be
determined from considering the motion of the nodes, not
withstanding       the    difficulties     which     the   movement of the
ecliptic opposes to this research          ;   and also how a smaller mass
aligned     to Venus       than that found by              M.  de la Qrange
would agree with the motion of liie apogeum of the fun, as
the contrary seems to arise from the formulae                    of that   great
geometer.       Lastly,     how far Ilerschcl's observations             of  the
satellites of Uranus         are sufficient to determine the mass             of
that   planet.  The      application of       the general solution      of  the
problem would become much more useful,                        if none of the
planets were omitted to be taken into consideration;                      for in
that cafe the equations, which                  arise,  might be compared
with    those obtained        by    M.   dc la Grange,        by his solution.
And, on this occasion,          the question proposed by himself             will
occur, viz. Whether the              masses   of the planets, let them be
what they may, provided            they are positive, will give the equa
tions at ail times with positive and unequal roots?                 In  regard
to the mean values,         the maximum          and minimum,       the periods
of the variation, Sec. should any direct method be disco
vered of determining them, it would be necessary that the
author, considering the complex nature of analytical ex
pressions,    should    be as       accurate    in his calculations as pos
sible; but     if  they *rc determined by repealed trials, it is

required that the author will at least bring proofs a posteriori,
that the results found are subject to no doubt. To conclude,
the academy is far from requiring that all these conditions
should        be fully     and   completely complied with.            It will,
without         hesitation, adjudge        the   prize to that paper     which
shall present        new and satisfactory         conclusions in regard       to
one article only         of  so   abstruse    a  matter ; for it has given
such extent to the question, merely to open a wider field to
thole who are fond of employing their time in astronomical
 researches."

     "    1.   As it    is a certain fust that the base             of carbon contaiued
in   the usual           animal       and       vegetable     manures is one of the
principal articles of nouristiincht to plants, what other sub

common manure, and may be employed with the like                                           essen

this question, of so much importance to agriculture, will
ground their proofs not merely on theory alone, but in par
ticular ori experiments properly made and accurately ob

     "    2.    By what         process, and from what seeds,                  such as those
of flax, poppies,the fun-flower, or other oily feeds, which
can be procured without  great expense, or be cultivated iu
abundance, can an oil be extracted, to hipplv with advan

an   J
    finality of oil procured by expression, depends, without
doubt, not only on the nature of the feeds, but also on the
¦process employed to obtain it.   The physical class wisties,
therefore, that those desirous to answer this question will
attend to two circumstances, viz. to the feed,                                that it may he
of   a   kind     lit   for yielding good          oil,    and also to the process bell

Le tier from            bis    Pnijjian Majesty to           the   Academy of Sciences

and useful for the public good.
 I        cannot conceal              from       the academy, that its labour*,
taken in the aggregate, have always appeared to me too little
                                                  11

I OZ                Lttlir    from bis PruJJiati      Maj tjly
directed towards the public             benefit.      It   has confined itself
too much to the discussion             of   abstract lubjects,       and to en
riching     metaphysics       with speculative        theories and learned
discoveries ; and has not paid sufficient attention to direct its
labours to objects of real utility, the improvement                        of the
arts and sciences ; a serviee by which the Academy                      of Paris,
for example, notwithstanding                its many defects        and vicious
organization,          formerly distinguished itself.            I  could wish
then that the Academy                 of Berlin would bumatiiz* itself
more,     if I may      use the expression,      than it has hitherto done,
by giving encouragement               to efforts     that contribute to the
happiness of common life,                to    the improvement          of   every
thing that concerns its wants, and to its conveniences, by
the constant application of the theory of the sciences to
things, rather than lo speculative meditations                 ;  that it would
excite the national industry, which                so often makes attempts
in new channels without               success for want        of the    necessary
knowledge, by furnishing it with the principles suited                           to
that art which it exercises; that it would endeavour                             to
 purify the different         systems   of moral and literary education
 from many vague and erroneous principles,                     which fashion,
and the imagination of some enthusiastic                    pedagogues,       have
introduced,        and    which     must     degrade     future generations        j
 and that it would combat the prejudices and delusions                      of the
 people,    as   well  as the   licentious and destructive efforts of the
 false philosophers        of the   present day.
     It is by directing the labours            of the different    classes  of the
 academy        towards objects of this             nature,    and towards a
 multitude of others, the influence of which is equally                         sa
 lutary to     the state and to its subjects,           that this institution
  can acquire the most glorious             titles to the gratitude         of  the
  public.      The    talents   of its members authorize me to enter
  tain great hopes,        and seem to have need only             of permanent
  impulse in a good internal direction.                    It belongs       to the
  academy       to   call forth the principles           of it from its own
  bosom .      The following        are a few general points, which may
                                                                              serve

 having maturely w eighed               them, will make the application
 of   them    in detail,     and    will draw up articles of regulation,
 which it will        take care to lay before me to receive my                ap
 probation and signature.
     The ancient regulations of the academy, above all that of
 the year 1746, will be retained, and put in force so far &
  they are not abrogated by the new,
     I  shall take care to appoint a president distinguished by his
 rank      and   literary      talents.    His duty,       above all, being to
  maintain the established order, to concentrate and direct the
 labours and talents of the different members towards objects
 useful     to the      public    and    honourable to the academy, to
 watch over the administration                 of its finances, and        be its
 organ with my person,              it will  be necessary to fix the extent
  and limits of his functions by an express article.
     The economical commission of the academy, which                           has
 hitherto subsisted, shall be abolislied, and its place supplied by
  a  directory*.        The members who              composed      the commis

   the management of its finances, and, above all, the direc
   tion of the academy towards objects of public utility, (hall be
   the province of the directory.            Its deliberations (ball be de
   cided by    a  plurality of voles.      Each member (hall have on©,
   and the president two.
      The influence      and rights     of  the directors     in their  classes
  seem also to require to be more particularly defined and re
   gulated   ;  and the    academy     will   take care to make provision
  on this head by an article in its regulations.
      The members of the academy (hall be either honorary, or
  ordinarv.       The former, not being properly obliged to en
  gage in its labours, cannot enjoy any of the lucrative ad
  vantages     of the academy, except in regard to medals in cafe
  they are present.        1 he ordinary members (hall be divided
  as  hitherto into four classes.
      Each class (hall be composed of a director and fix mem
  bers,    which will form a whole of 24 academicians, besides
 the members of the directory.               It will be proper lo adhere
 in future to that number,            and not to admit new          members
 but when there are vacancies.                There can therefore be         nt>
 new election but when the members of each class are below
 fix in number. As at present there are classes which have more,
 it may     perhaps    be possible to transfer some         of   them to the
 cl?,sses   which have not the fixed number, or to those which
have fewer supernumeraries, in order to establish                  a kind    of
equality between the classes, and by these means to approach
as near as possible to the order to be observed in future.                  In
the    last place,  the   riehl of electing     its members     fliallbe  preT

by a plurality      of voices of   all the members.        I, however,     re
serve to    mvscif that of confirming or rejecting.
     The   large public library at Berlin, as well as the collection
of natural curiosities,       shall be united in future with the aca
demy, and cntrulied to its direction.                 It will be therefore
necessary to determine, by a regulating article, the arrange
ments to be made in that respect; and as it \vill be requisite
                                                                          that

that the principal librarian be an academician, the academy
will have the less hesitation to admit Dr. Biester* among
its members,       as   his knowledge and literary merit have al

    To conclude, through I             am     disposed    to preserve   to the

revenues,     I, however,      reserve to myself the right         of deciding
more particularly         on this subject, after the          new state of its
economy for the next year shall have been presented to me

     IN  the  sitting of January id, 1798, a paper was read by
 F. von Dalberg, On the gamut and musical fyjlem of the an-
 and llindoot. The author took as the grounds of bis dis
 sertation   a paper    of  the late  Sir William Jones, published in
 the Asiatic Researches, and combined with it what he had
 learned during his residence in Italy and England, partly
 from the conversation of Richard Johnson, the friend of Sir
 William Jones, and of there ; and partly from manuscripts.
 He brought as proofs, that the Hindoos were acquainted
  with the art of noting music, not only several                  of their mu
  sical pieces and a figure       of their principal instrument called
  vina, but     also   their mythology, in which their principal
  tones and     notes are personified        as   deities, which have been
  hitherto    unknown.         M.    von    Dalberg obtained figures           of
  these, collected by Johnson in India, in order that they might
  be engraved.        In  the   writings of the Hindoos            every thing
  i« personified.      According      to their ideas, music, like all the
  other sine arts, came from heaven.                  They    consider  musical
  Mines as real beings        which marry other           tones  ;  aud   hence

    At   the fame       time was read a paper transmitted to the
academy      by Major George Vega,              entitled,    " Mathematical
considerations on the directions of gravity,                  the length    of  a
pendulum that swings seconds,               the method of determining
the latitude       from     the  true   elevation   of the pole, and the
length of a degree         of the meridian in different latitudes, by
means of       a solid    globe revolving       with    an   equable     motion
round an immovable axis ;              as  also on the form         of  the sur
 face  of  the water      in  a state  of equilibrium on        such a globe ;
 and oh the necessity          of correcting the apparent latitudes or
 altitudes of the pole, in order to obtain the real latitudes,
 both by calculating the distances              of places from their lon
gitude and latitude, and also by delineations made on a por
 tion of such a globe, upon any projection at pleasure,                      re
 gard being had to the spheroidal form              of our earth."
    M.   Burckhardt transmitted           to the academy a paper under
 the following title, which was also read             :
                                                         "  On    the employ
 ment of combinatory              analysis   for determining         the sines,
 tangents, &c.        of  the sum     of several angles, when         the sines,
 tangents, &c. of single angles are given."
     A paper was transmitted likewise from M, Topfer, on the
  doctrine of combination,           and its application to analysis.
     In  the    sitting of February 3, was read               a  paper    on she
"H0ix« Mtya*a,         transmitted by       Dr. W. G. Tennemann                at
 Jena.     In this paper, which will           appear in the Transactions
 of the Academy,          the author endeavours         to (how, that the so
  called magna ttb'ica        of Aristotle  are an extract from those          of
J^icomachus.
     Some remarks            were   then   read by     M. Zizman         on the
  cultivation     and    employment of the monarda (oswego-tea)
  as a spice.       The author found the           monarda       fjlulosa    and
  dutymaLiiW.          to be plants, the leaves, flowers, and, in par

                                                                           kinds

employed as tea ;           the flowers improve the taste         of brandy,
and     give it  a  flavour like that of peaches,            &c.     The most
important part, however, is the feeds. The author described
the method of cultivating this plant, and also of preserving                   it.
     Professor    Trommfdorf          at    Erfort    transmitted     a    paper
entitled,     "  Collections towards a more accurate knowledge
of   the nature    of Strontian earth."
                                 FRANCE.
     IN    the public sitting      of the National Institute, Vende-
 miaire 15, after an account had been read,                  by the secretary
of   each class,   of   the labours    of the Institute,      C. Camus gave
an account       of   the    labours undertaken by the Institute as a
 body, or executed under its direction.
     C. Cuvicr     read a learned though simple and clear memoir
 on an animal, bones of which are found in the plaster stone
 in the neighbourhood of Paris.                  He   began     by explaining
 how a single bone, especially           if  it belong to the head, or an
articulation,      is sufficient to make            known very nearly the
 whole structure of an animal, respecting which naturalists
 have no other knowledge.                A tooth, for example,          said he,
 indicates whether an animal is carnivorous,                   or feeds upon
 vegetables.       If it  is carnivorous,       its stomach    is formed in a
 certain manner ; the animal unites with the means of attack
 and defence the agility necessary to reach                its prey   :  its feet
  must have a certain form :           in  a word,      it has all the habits
 common        to that kind        of animals, &c.           After explaining
  this principle, C. Cuvicr applied it to the bones found in
 the quarries of plaster stone, and which are so abundant
  that not a decade         passes   but the workmen break several              of
  them in digging out the stones.              He examined       a great many
  of  these  bones, and thinks himself authorized to                assert,  that
  they belong to a graminivorous animal similar to the camel,
  pot now existing alive in any known country.

which it is hoped                  may be naturalized in the southern de
partments of France, such as the alligator pear {laurus p<.r-

World     to the kingdom of Valencia, where it produces fruit.
Its fruit is pulpy, of the size of a very large pear, and is cat

There arc           also       several alimentary plants, such as two kinds

white and red potatoc,                    convolvulus batatas, ecc.
   Among the curious plants are remarked in particular a
species of fern, the stem of which is three feet and a half in
height and three inches in diameter, and is at present termi

  HO                            Medicine,
 ness to an extraordinary fact, to me totally new, and            which,
 in. my opinion,     cannot easily be accounted         for.   One day,
 when some people in this neighbourhood were preparing to
 churn butter, they were astonished to find all the cream of a
 line Prussian-blue colour. The caseous part was only blueisti.
 Every attempt to discover the cause os this extraordinary co
 lour was fruitless, though the cream exhibited the fame ap
 pearance for nearly three months.            It cannot be ascribed to
 the   vessels  in which the milk was generally preserved, as
 they are always kept perfectly clean, and covered with fir-
 boards.      The cows   were in exceeding good health, and fed
 on meadows on which            they had grazed for several years.
 This milk was used as food without any hurt ensuing, and
 it betrayed no particular taste ; but the cream and caseous
 parts were thrown away, as they inspired some dread.                 The
 cream gradually      changed its colour; but this could not be
 ascribed to the means employed            during the continuance of
 the phenomenon, means indeed             so ridiculous that    I  do not
 think it worth while    to detail them:
    " In  the Ephemerides of the Curious of Nature, Dec. od,
 1688, we find instances of milk being coloured green, black,
 red, and yellow    ;  but I  am acquainted with no observation
 similar to that above mentioned."

Bcrchtold resolved lo publish the process                     ;  of which 3000

Italian, and 6000 in the Turkish                       language.        The work

 some       observations on the regimen proper for patients at*
 tacked by this        disease     ; and    an Appendix,          containing cer
 tificates of cures already performed, and                    a list of   the places
 where the above method has been practised with success.
      In a little tract just published by Dr. Tazwell (secretary
 to Mr. Geary, the late American minister,) at Paris, a new
 method is announced of employing the nitrous acid in the
 syphilis, which we are informed has been used with great
 success at Paris.          As it    is there conceived to bean improve
  ment upon        the present        modes      of administering oxygen in
 syphilitic ulcers, &c.            and    as the practice with the nitrous
 acid is at present       a   subject of some controversy,              it may not
 be unworthy of the attention of our medical readers.                             Dr.
  Tazwell's formula          is as follows     :
               Oxygenated Ointment            {invented       bj Aljon)    .
       R . Take hogs      lard lib.    j.  melt it over a slow fire, and then
  add    of nitric acid (of 52         degrees)     3ij.      Keep carefully stir
  ring     the mixture over the fire          with    a glass rod     till it begins
  to boil, and then         set  it by to cool.
       It is of  great benefit in cafes          of syphilitic ulcers,         herpes,
  and psora.

Repeated      experiments have convinced him that one               of the
most frequent causes        of the apparent death      of so many new
born     children,    arjses from the      trachea    being filled with
water ; and that they might in general              be saved,    by giving
them such         a  position that the water should run out.             Of
thirteen children considered as dead,            and which were com
mitted to his care,       twelve   were restored to life by the above
simple means.
   The    above is announced       in a foreign Journal, but appear*
evidently to be founded upon some mistake.                By   the experi
ments of Dr. Goodwyn it appears impossible                that water can
of itself in    any case    enter   the trachea   :  even drowned peo
ple are not suffocated by this means, but by the mere ex
clusion    of the oxygen of the atmosphere necessary to support
 animal life.       In those experiments in which water has been
 forced into the trachea, it has always been absorbed,                if the
animal was suffered to live.
    In our   last  Number, (p. 426.) by        a mistake   of the Printer,
the following observation         was omitted after the article on the
production      of cold by    compressed air :
    The explanation given of the phenomena in the Journal
 de Physique, from which we extracted this article, is inad
 missible in the present instance        ;  for it has been proved by
 Dr. Darwin's experiments, published in the Philosophical
 Transactions,       that cold is produced by compressing          air even
 where water is not present,          and that the heat      of the air b
 absolutely     squeezed     out by    condensation, and         pastes  out
 through the substance         of  the condenser.       The     compressed
 air therefore, when allowed to escape, must rob water, or
 any substance with which it comes in contact,               of a portion
 of  its htit.

 XN ATURALISTS hitherto                  have distinguished only three
species   of   the   genus    horse,    or animals which             have   not
cloven hoofs, viz. the horse and              the   ass,   which are both
found wild      in  the desert regions      of Asia,     and   the beautiful
striped  zebras, which, with so many other singular animals,
is peculiar to Africa. I have had an opportunity, however,
of becoming acquainted with a fourth species (Plate V. fig. 2 )
the Mogul name of which has been long known in Europe.
But respecting this animal zoologists            as yet have been        under
great doubts;      because the accounts given             of it   were either
defective   or little to be depended on,         as  might readily be ex-

scarcely         ever to be found but in the mountainous                           deserts    of
Eastern Tartar}', between Siberia, India, and China.                                    I bare
thought proper' to give to this animal the Greek name
bemionos ;            which       the ancient Greeks applied not only to                     the
mule, but also to a wild timid species,                           capable of propagat
ing,        similar in form to the mule, which were, in some
measure,           known to them, and which probably were the same
as the djbiggelai.                 Aristotle is the first author who mentions
 this animal, in the sixth book of his Natural History, where
 he distinguishes it very clearly from that produced between
 the hoffe arid the ass, or the                    ass and the      mare ; and he gfres
 it    the name         of   hemionot,         because      this species,        which    M-ere
 then found in              a wild state in Syria,              and exceedingly timid,
 had as great a resemblance                       to the mule as       thewiW      ass has     to
 the tame *.               This      supposed species          of wild half-ass, nine of
 which          were      brought to Phrygia,                under the reign of Phar
  isees,        where they were long preserved,                       and   of which      three
 were alive at the time when Aristotle wrote-, propagated re
 gularly, and were therefore a peculiar specie* and not a
  bastard race.              The       same author mentions this cirturrfstance
  expressly,           and also Syria the native country                    of the     aTVriCnil",

a red fox colour,                 which      are exceedingly swift.                         They are
very un tractable ; and when caught in gins are sometimes
carried to the king of the Prasians. Thole of two years old,
or under, can be tamed; but the old ones are                                        as    wild as the

   For     the earliest account              of    the existence             of this       species      of
the horse in modern times,                        we are indebted to the diligent
lMefTcrschmidt, who from the year 1720 to          travelled                        iji6
 through Siberia, by command of Peter I. for the purpose of
making discoveries in natural history.                                 Besides this traveller
and Gmelin,               who explored the fame districts twenty years
after, no one before me has had an opportunity of examining
this animal with the eye of a naturalist.                                   Messerschmidt dis
tinguishes the dshiggetai, very properly, from the horse and
the   ass ;     and notices it in his Xenium Ijidix Sibirica, or Ca

 which, as he fays in his journal, was made from three that

 journal, unfortunately for                     the further osteology                     of the djhig-

 has never yet been printed.
        Gmelin, when in Dauuria,                         did every thing in his power
 by sending out hunting parties to procure one of these ani
 mals, but without               success        t-      Afterwards, however, by the
 tare of his friend and fellow-traveller Muller, he had an op-
 portunity, in returning from the Lena, to draw up a descrip
 tion of this animal at Irkuzk ; but this description, which
 still lies in manuscript              among other papers,                           is so   unintelli
gible, that it is almost useless for the naturalists                                  of the      present
 day.       Zoology,         in general, was not Miiller's principal ta
 lent    ; and       however much                service he may have rendered                           to
botany,        his descriptions of animals,                          as    may be         seen    by the
specimens            published, are exceedingly defective.                                 During my
travels through              Siberia,      I    considered            this animal            as   alroolt
unknown          ;    for the Jesuit missionaries,                         who on various oc
casions      have made excursions                     from China into the Mogul
provinces, fay little more of                           it,    in the accounts of their
travels,     than merely to mention fts name                               J.
. I      wasal great pains therefore, and spared no expense.
during my travels, particularly when         the neighbourhood        in
of the solitary deserts on the borders of the Ruffian empire, to

  country of     the     Moguls      and   the great desert      of Gobi.       In
  these wastes,      which are very thinly inhabited,               where   Mef-
  ferschmidt and Gmelin became                acquainted       with the dshig-
  getai,   I  was so fortunate as to obtain             a  description of this
  rare animal.       The neighbourhood of             the river   Argun    is the
  part within the boundaries of Siberia where these animals
  are still to be found       ;  for they have long since retired from
 the rcli of Dauuria,           where they once abounded,           to the   Mo
  gul deserts,      on    account of the increase            of population in
  the former.       They frequent, in general, the whole extent
 of   the    desert   of Gobi, as far as the boundaries of Thi
  bet   and' India     ;   but they are      moll     abundant in the dry
  (.lains near the lake Tarei, which afford plenty of herbs and
  pools of salt water, and in the hilly districts of Abagaitu.
 The reft of Dauuria abounds with rocky and high moun
 tains covered with snow, which,               as  well    as districts covered
  with wood,     these animal? never frequent.
     These animals wore found formerly in herds in the                       dis*
 trlcts near the Argun.            At   present,   however, none arc         seen
 there but single ones which have strayed,                  or small dispersed
 herds, except when sreat drought takes place in the Mogul
 districts, and drives them northwards.                     In the country of
 the    Mt.guls,     on the other         hand, and        particularly in the
 abo\ c-rncniioncd          desert  of Gobi,      thev are at ail times col
 lected into large herds;           and   are well known to the         Moguls
and the Tungulians            under the name          of il/biggeLu, which
signifies     song-eared.        They    must also extend themselves            10
the country ofSoongarey,               because they were known to the
Soongarcy Calumet, whom               1 had an opportunity       of converting
with on the Wolga, under the above                     name,     a»  an animal
totally diflerent        from the wild       ass,   which they call kulan,
and    which    by the wild Coffaos' is called            taiia.    But in    the
wi stern part     of Great Tartary it        appears,      that  the   dihigiie-
tai is never found ; for the rvirgisians            are acquainted with no
middle animal between              the   wild    horse and      their kulan or

form the boundaries of its native country on the                  east  fowartft
the extensive ridges of Thibet and India ; Tor the accounts oT
travellers who have spoken of wild asses in Syria and Persia,
are not accurate enough to enable us to judge whether the
dfhiggetai is found in these countries, which                    I  very' much
doubt.
    The dsliiggetai seeks the open dry plains and                     the decli
vities of mountains covered with cood nourishing                      herbs and
grafs,   as is the cafe     with all Danuria and the country or ttit
Moguls, which           are full  of mountains.         It  is saitfttyat thew
seldom approach          the water, and       that   they can continue            a
longtime without drinking; which,                   to an animal destined
to live in deserts,        where often for      a hundred wersts there is
not to be found        a  dfop of drinkable water, is        a very necessary
property.
    The onager       aud the wild horse have yielded to the persever
ance and courage employed by man to tame them, and render
them fit for being draught animals, and animals of burden;
but the dfliiggetai,        like the African zebra *, has never yet
been tamed,         though the Moguls, who are born horsemen
and shepherds, have often tried to breed foals                 of this    specie,*
which they        have caught.        I  am however of opinion,              th.^t
we ought not to abandon all hope of rendering the dfliig
getai    a domestic        animal,    if serious attempts       were made        in
 Dauuria      on foals when caught and shut up in proper en
 closures, which no wandering               people have      an    opportunity
 of doing.       Should such an attempt succeed, mankind would
 procure in this animal,            if broke for riding, not            only, the
 fleetest and swiftest hunter,          but give to the eastern part of
 Asia,    India    and    China, in particular,        where the common
 horse,     as is well known,        does not thrive,      a far   more useful
 draught animal,          because these regions are as it were its            na-

guls do not prove the intractablenese of the dstuggctai ap
pears probable from this circumstance, that the Kirgisians
assertthe fame thing, on account of the fruitless attempts
they have made in regard to the onagers or wild asses, which
wander through their territories in thousands ; though the
people       of   the east,    who live in settled habitations,                         have not
onlymade these animals domesticated since time immemorial,
but, as we fee by Varro, Columella, Pliny, and the testi
mony of other authors, employed with great advantage, in
stead of mules, wild asses, which they caught and tamed.
Varro        fays expressly        *, that        the wild ass is exceedingly pro
per to be used instead                  of   the mule,           because       it can   be easily
tamed, and never returns again lo its wild condition.
  Hitherto the dshiggetni has been only an animal of the
 chafe for the          Moguls       and Tungusians,                  who consider its flcfli
 as their greatest dainty, and employ the flein to make boots.
 It    is,   however, difficult              to   kill   it  ;      for, on account of the
 keenness         of    its light and the acuientss                      of   its smell,    by    the
 latter of which,           if     lo the leeward,            it     can discover       a   man at
 the distance of several wersts,                         seldom lets the hunters get
 within         shot.     When running,             it it   is                    for the fleetest

 the hunting excusions                  of the Moguls, which                   they call oblaw,
  but must be shot,                by   lying     in   wait for       it ;    which can be best

and are always on the watch to guard against being surprised.
When they             observe any thing uncommon at a distance, the
male immediately springs forwards                         ;   endeavours, by making
a tour, to approach so near the object as to discover                                  the dan
ger, and for that purpose                          advances            two or three time*
towards the hunters, who lie close to the ground on their
bellies. On such occasions some of them are sliot : the herd
then disperse,              and for some time afford good sport to the
huntsmen.             If    the male, however, observes the danger, he
makes the           herd        which    he left behind                him    betake them
selves to flight with incredible velocity.                              The Moguls         speak
of this velocity with aflonisliment                           ;   and,      in general,      the
dshiggetai       is considered          as the swiftest           of   all the wild animals
of their country            :   for this reason the people of Thibet                      assign
it,    instead   of   a   riding horse, to cbammo, their god                       of sire   and
of war.
     The     dshiggetai always carries its head erect, as represented
in the plate      ;   when running throws                 it      entirely back, in order
that     it   may     fee       better behind       it;       and bears       its tail efect.
It     has   a   particular kind of neighing,                      which      is   louder and
shriller than that of            a   horse.        The   herds         by   which old males
are attended          consist often           of   more than            twenty males and
females; though, in general, they arc less numerous, as many
mates have no more than five or ten females.    Young males
driven from old herds generally                       folLw         them at        a   distanrt,
till    they have enticed             from them one or more females,                          or
have found some that                    have       strayed from other herds, and
thus procure to themselves                     a   few follower.-?.           At   the cover
ing     season    the old males separate from their herds the young
females not vet hot.                  The Moguls          arc said to have remarked
also, that these half-asses sometimes entice away mares from
the troops of tame horses which wander about in these dis
tricts, and add     them to their seraglio. Of this, however,
I    am not fully convinced; though, on account of the great
similarity and likeness in regard to size which thcdstiiggeui
has with the Moiul horses procreation must be much easier
                                                                                       between

in his wild state, and          if characterizing marks of a particular
fpeci-s were not visible in the dshiggetai, onaccourtof this
great similarity, we might with much more reason consider
the dshiggetai for the wild stock of our horse than the younger
Gmelin considered the wild horse as the common stock of
the horse and ass*, which,                   however, besides the mouse co
lour observed by Gmelin, which is not always uniform, haa
nothing in common with the                        ass.

 after violent exertise exhale an oily odour.

 of Pelcrlburgh          observed that            the fat        of   a   pullet   is   contained
 in vesicles smaller than those of any other animal                                 :       those   of

   tissue,     but are not found equally dispersed throughout                     every
   part of the body. Fat is found in a pretty considerable
   quantity in certain cavities of the body, as in the orbits of
  (he eyes, near the reins, in the epiploon, sometimes at the
  point of the heart, &c.                In man     there is none about the
  lungs, the penis, or the brain.                Some is contained              in the
  la ft -mentioned        organ in the cold-blooded animals : in the
  sea-dog, the ray, and many other fishes, the                      /at is      mixed
  with     the parenchyme         of  the liver,   to   which it gives consi
  derable      bulk   :  in birds and animals         that feed on vegetable
  substances, it is found around the reins.                 The fat of si sties is
  more liquid. than that            of carnivorous quadrupeds             :   that of
 frtigivorous animals has more consistence                    than the          fat of
  others.
       The quantity of fat varies much according to the differ
 ent    classes of animals ; and, if we compare the quantity of
 fat with the bulk of the body, it will be found that 6sl>es
 exhibit       the largest proportion       ;  then    amphibious         animals,
 and then the frugivorous.               The carnivorous      present the least.
 But     these are only general observations, which are subject to
 many exceptions.
      All    the uses    of fat are not yet    known; but        we    know       that
 in    some cases it becomes exhausted,               and supplies the place
of aliment.           Thus, animals which remain in              a   state   of   tor
por for several months without taking nourishment, lose their
plump appearance j from which it would seem that this is a
resource provided for them by nature.                     May it not       perhaps
serve       to   preserve animal heat       ?  The circumstances which
contribute         to its formation are still more obscure, and                  have
given rise to many ingenious ideas dignified with the name
of hypotheses.             One of the most probable is that of Dr.
Beddocs*,           which     appears    to me to clear up           many facts

hitherto inexplicable, though it issubject to man)' exceptions,
as every hypothesis must be.     The foundation on which it
        in is,
rests            that whenever there              it   a    certain diminution                  of oxy
gen          the animal system,                 fat will be produced.                       The fol-
lowing           observations         seem        to       support this assertion             :      The)
chemical              analysis of fat shows that fix parts                          of   it     contain
near five      of carbon and one of hydrogen, and some febacic
acid.        The fat parts of animals differ from the fleshy parts
only      in     this, that the latter contain                     more oxygen and azot.
By this          is   explained the change                  of muscles into             a   substance
like spermaceti,              as professor Fourcroy                    remarked in the bury
ing ground of                the Innocents at Paris.                    It     has been observed
also, that the fat augments at the expense                                    of the     muscles          in
the living body, and vice versa'*.
     This want of oxygen                      considered         as    a   cause   of corpulency
is   indicated          by   the analogy         which exists              between       obesity and
the     sea scurvy,           which       seems to be owing                    only to      a   gradual
abstraction of            a   part   of       the oxygen          in   the system.              The    seal
scurvy      is    never announced                by   meagreness           ;   on the contrary,
a    fullness      of     the habit        is   the first symptom               of that maladv.
Dr. Trotter            observes,          that when         a    negro grows rapidly cor
pulent, he docs not fail to be attacked                                 by   the scurvy;           from
which,           to make use         of   a   comparison of Dr. Beddoes,                          it   ap
pears       that corpulency                is   to the scurvy what                 cachexy           is   to
the dropsy.               All the symptoms of the scurvy prove that                                       it
arises from           a    privation of oxygen thus the surface os the

body       is     covered with livid              spots,         the    arterial blood          is   very
little florid, and, after death, the left auricle                                  is   found filled
with venous blood, which Dr. Goodwin found                                               in   animals
that had been deprived                        of life       by   oxygen.           Dr. Lind fays,
that when death has been sudden,                                  and       that no effusion              is
found       in    the cavities of the body, the auricles and the ven-
tides     are filled with blood, and especially                              the lest side        of   the

side rarely contains much blood after death.
     According              to the experiments                     of Sauffure and Humboldt,
it   appears that the atmosphere                                  of    the high      mountains con
tains        less   oxygen than                   that   of       the       lower regions;          and this
explains why                       la Condamine                   was attacked           with scorbutic
symptoms on the summit of Pinchina.                                      Much sleep and in
activity are powerful causes                                 of corpulency. In that state
respiration is              less        frequent,        a    smaller quantity             ofoxygen is
absorbed,            and the absorption                       of sit       is    diminished, while the
secretion           of it      is continually                taking place.            Leanness is        pro
duced by a contrary state, that is to fay, by the                                           effect of     ex
ercise       :   more oxygen is then introduced into the system, and
the fat is absorbed in common with the other                                              fluids.

when they wish to fatten poultry they must keep them in

longing their sleep, such                          as tares        or spirituous liquors*.               An
observation which appears curious                                          i*,   that the age when the
secretion           of   fat       is   most      considerable               is   towards the fortieth
year     ;   a      time when the arterial                             system ceases to act such           a
conspicuous part                        in   the animal economy, either because                           it
is   then ossified, or                   in   part obliterated, while the venous sys
tem, becoming more and more developed,                                                seems to acquire
that influence                 so   considerable             in old age.            Do   arteries the ac
tion of which               is      viliblv diminished, furnish at that period lest
oxygen to the                  system        ;    and may not that be the cause                     of   the
corpulency of middle-aged people                                       ?
     It   may be objected                        that children, whose venous system                       "u

  here      particularized.       It  may    happen      that, according        as
  respiration     is more or less perfect, the    blojd    may lose a greater
  or   less  quantity of carbon and hydrogen.               In proportion       as
  it  loses less, the secretion      of  the fat will   be more abundant :
  this then will afford an explanation of the enormous quan
  tity of fat found in amphibious animals, fishes, ike. in which
  respiration is not         so perfect,   because,   being surrounded by
  water, they are not in contact with so considerable                  a  quan
  tity of oxygen      as  animals that breathe in the open air.             They
  retain then more hydrogen and carbon, which                     passing into
  the arteries,      occasion    that considerable     secretion  of   fat,  aud
  probably produce that voluminous size of liver, found in fishes
  in which circulation is such that almost all the blood goes in
  to the liver, either to operate there a secretion          of fat or of bile,
  the constituent parts of which do not differ much from thole
  of the former.
      Children     do not respire in the uterus, as the foramen ovale
  is not obliterated till towards the third or fourth year of their
  life, and sometimes later : they have for the fame reason a
 very full habit       of body.      What    appears to confirm this opi
  nion are the observations quoted in the Medical Transactions
 of London,          and thole    of Professor Sandifort     of Leyden, of
 individuals        remarkable for their corpulency ; in whom it
 was      found, by dissection,         that the foramen       ovale was not
 closrd up      ;  that is to fay, that the greater part        of the   venous
 blood pasted directly from the right into the left ventricle, to
 be transmitted        into the aorta, and from thence into the whole
 system, withouthaving            undergone there any of those changes
 which arc effected on the blood by respiration*.                   The lungs
 in     such   individuals were diminislied in size,           and in a state
 of collapsion,         which     indicated that      they    had     not dis
 charged      all the functions of respiration.           This theory     seems
 to    throw      much     light    on the enormous size         of   the liver.

    Diseases   of   the    liver,  such as schirrous tumours,              Sec.
generally     attack people        who are more or less corpulent.
The blood of        persons very plethoric,       or very fat, is com
monly     of a darker colour      and more viscous than that           of lean
people, which is generally very florid.              The means of cure
afford a very strong argument in favour of this hypothesis ;
far, though obesity be rarely the subject of medical treat
ment,     yet some physicians        have treated    it like the       scurvy,
with   vegetable    acids, pulse, Sec. as affording more oxygen.
It   has been remarked,           that people who habitually drink
cyder are more meagre than those who use beer, porter, or
 other liquors of the fame kind.
    There are some countries, the inhabitants               of which         are
in  general   corpulent,      as is the case in Holland, and              some
parts   of England     ; while in others, as France, for example,
the greater      part of the inhabitants         are thin.        Docs this
arise from the difference        of food, or   is it not rather owing
to the greater or      less  purity of the air   ?   that is to soy, to        a
greater    quantity of oxygen contained in the                atmosphere?
The    above    facts appear to explain the different causes of
obesity,   and to throw        great light on the means            of   curing
various diseases, which have hitherto baffled all the effort*
of medicine.
 III.  On tbe colouring Matter of vegetable Juices and the Ac

    with a new Process for obtaining Lakes of more intense end
   solid  Colours.      By Cit. Go v ton.         llcudin     the National
    Institute  15   Vcndem. An. 6.
A-INNÆUS,             the great naturalist   of   the north, said, that
the red colour of vegetables announced in them the                   presence

                                                                        flower

               on the   colouring    Mailer of Vegetables.               tlj
flower of the violet acquired in tin             veflfels  a beautiful blue
shadcx and      the use   of it   was recommended in pharmacy for
the preparation of syrup of violets.              The original colour of
syrup which       had been changed was upon this principle re
stored by long digestion in tin ; but few philosophers paid
any attention to inquire into the cause of these phenomena,
and my colleague Berthollet mentioned only as a probability
in his Elements of Dyeing, that this effect resulted from a
combination       of the acid with the oxyd formed at the sur
face   of the  tin. Such was the state of our knowledge on this
 subject, when, struck with the difference in the colour of two
 preparations     of the fame fruit, I undertook          a continued exa
 mination of the circumstances in which these changes (oak
 place.
     I (hall omit giving      a detailed    account of the Comparative
 experiments to which          I  successively subjected     almost   all the
 acid coloured fruits, such         as the  cherry, the gooseberry, the
 plum,     as  well  as  the petals of flowers, turnsol, brasil wood,
 turmeric, &c. by treating them in             vessels  of glass, porcelain,
 metal, and metallic mixture*, or by holding them in diges
 tion, either on plates of metal perfectly clean, or on metallic
 oxyd?.     I shall confine myself      at present to results which may
 serve to throw some        light on the theory of        vegetable colour?,
 or to furnish the means          of applying them with advantage           to
  processes in the arts.
      My experiments       proved that the red colour          of fruits  evi
  dently arises from the reaction         of their peculiar acid on their
  colouring matter. That tin, in reviving or restoring the co
  lour of violets, only resumes by its greater affinity the acid
 Xvhich made it turn red.           That it   is not only tin or its oxvd,
  as has hitherto been supposed, which exercises this affinity ;
   but that lead, bismuth, antimony and zinc produce the same
   effect ; that it U still more rapid          and complete with iron         ;
   and   that the contact        of all  these metals inclines to violet
   very senGbly,    infusions which otherwise would be of a bright
   and strong red.       That    the green and acid part        of fruits Joes
                                                                           not

  1 a8                      The   EffcBs of OxjJt
 not hold thecolouring principle, disposed to become red with
 acids ; and that the coloured part conceals the                portion of the
 acid necessary for maintaining            the state    of reaction, which
 determines its shade. That if this colouring principle is mo
 dified in some vegetables so as to resist more or Jess acid or
 alkaline reagents,        as brasil wood       in   regard    to acids,     and
 turnsol in regard to alkalis,         it may be brought back to that
 condition     ; which seems to indicate that, if not essentially, it
 is at least originally of the fame nature.                That all metallic
oxyds are not equally proper to seize and fix vegetable co
 lours ; that some of them seem to attack the latter with
 the greatest case, while others retain them only in a very
weak manner.            In the  last place,    that the new metal called
tungsten carried to the utmost degree            of oxydation, and which
has not yet been tried in that respect, has                a decided advan
tage above all the other metallic              oxyds ; that      it is  capable
of forming       lakes valuable for painting,           which stand, with
out alteration,      tests  by lime water, the acetic acid or radical
vinegar,      sulphurized hydrogen gas, and even to a certain
degree oxygenated muriatic acid gas, that enemy of colours,
which suddenly burns them, and which, according to tht
expression     of Bcrthollct,     performs in     a  few moments what          ii
effected     in a long time by the combined action                 of air   and
light.      This   assertion    will excite     less   surprise,   when    it is
                                                                                  ¦
known that this is the only one of all the metallic oxyds which
withstands the solvent power of the three mineral acids.
    The    oxyd   of tungsten    charges    itself easily with the colours
of all   vegetables.     Hitherto    I  have found only one exception
in the petals     of   the nic ago, from which           I could not    extract
the     beautiful purple red, though I was                unable to discover
the cause     of my failure.
     In  general the lakes formed         with this oxyd become          darker
instead    of lighter when diluted, and it is therefore              necessary
to    soften the shade.        I have remarked that they              acquired
also mure intensity, when            I   made    the oxyd assume         a blue
colour, by boiling it in vinegar.              C.    von   Mods, one of     rny

colleagues,                  being informed of the object of my researches,
called               my attention to the aloe.                      C. Desfontaines was               so
kind            as to procure         me several species,               but   I   shall speak only
of that known under                       the name             of    the succotrine          aloe.     I
accordingly                  tried experiments on                    this plant, one of the
richest in colour,                   though it has not the slightest appearance
of it while                the equilibrium          of its principles         is maintained by
vegetable life.                  The woody fibre which is on the outside
serves as a                covering to a very viscous matter of a whitish
green colour,                     weakly acid       ;    but scarcely             has this    matter
been exposed to the air when it assumes                                   a   very lively purple
red colour, which becomes extremely                                 abundant by theprogrefg
of fermentation.                     Of this matter I                have formed lakes with
alumine,                   the oxyd    of tin,      and the white oxyd               of zinc    :    but
none could bear a comparison with that prepared by means
of    tungsten.               I   have no doubt that the oxyd                 of this new metal
may be employed                      in   the composition               of colours for dyeing,
at least for the dyeing                   of   silks which           are not intended           to be
subjected              to boiled leys.           The oxyd of tin              may be employed
for that purpose with advantage,                              as   it is not easily injured by
acids           :    but our oxyd is absolutely                insoluble.
      I     shall conclude with a reflection which                                 may add some
interest to these researches                   :      Wolfram ; from which this oxyd
is obtained, is found in                       the territories     of France*, several
mines of it are already                        known,              and the French        chemists
have                been    employed for some years in                        endeavouring to
simplify th-- processes for freeing it from foreign substances                                         :
we hope                then, that the properties                    I   have explained,             will
supply artists with new means to ensure duration to the pro

 X SHALL         next relate some experiments, made in          order to
 obtain the acid sublimate ofScheele,          or lithic   acid of the
 new system of chemistry.
      ico grains of an urinary concretion, which had          been pre
 viously found to contain principally       the above animal oxide,
 were introduced into a tube       \  of an inch wide    ;  which    was
 sealed at one end by fusion, and which also was fitly bent for
collecting     sublimate, and obtaining       gaz.    The    sealed end
was coated      and exposed to fire, first to a low temperature,
 and gradually to a very elevated one.
     1. Gaz   was discharged,     which had the smell      of   burning
 bone.
    2.  Water    appeared boiling    immediately over the        charge,
which seemed to be burning, and was turned black.
    3. Gaz was discharged, of the smell of empyreumatic
liquor cornu cerui, and about half a drachm of this liquor
was in the upper part of the tube.
    4.  A brown    sublimate   of carbonate   of ammoniac      appeared
in   the cold part of the tube ; bat in the hotter part near the
charge, was tar-like matter, and the gaz discharged had a
very offensive smell of empyreumatic animal           oil, with   which
was mixed that       of pruslic acid.
    The    coated part  of the tube    was kept Ted hot,      for  some
time after gaz ceased to come over.
    The quantity os gaz amounted to 24 ounces, by             measure:
it consisted of nearly 16 ounces of carbonic acid            gaz,    and
the rest was air,     with   a larger proportion     of nitrogen     g»*
than is contained in atmospheric air.
                                                             5.   There

         5. There was         a residue        of 30 grains,      almost pure carbon             j
 and 10 grains        of heavy black              and brown matter, a little above
 the coated        part of the tube.               In this last-mentioned matter
were many small white spicula.                       At about half an inch above
the carbonaceous residue, dark gray matter had been raised,
which weighed 15 grains.
         This sublimed            gray    matter did       not contain any ammo
niac, nor throw down any prusfiate of iron, with sulphate of
iron. It reddened turnsole paper and tincture. It dissolved
in caustic         soda;      from which solution muriatic acid precipi.
tated nothing,              for, although on dropping it into the solution
milkincss appeared,                   the liquid soon grew clear again.
         Ten grains of this sublimate dissolved in                       four ounces of
boiling water           ;    which being evaporated                to    half      an ounce,
there was, on cooling,                     a   copious deposit     of    white Jplcula*.
The sublimate               had a sharp, but not sour taste. Being boiled
in muriatic acid, and also in nitric, it did not dissolve at all;
but remained, on evaporation                       to dryness, in the fame             state as
before       :   and it must be particularly observed,                        that it left no
red or pink matter,                 on evaporating the nitric acid from it.
Sulphuric          acid did not act upon it in the cold ; but, when
heated, it dissolved               it,   without effervescence,          from which        so
lution nothing               was precipitated         by   caustic soda        :    on evapo
rating  to drvnesj, black fumes arose, leaving behind only

a black stain.  This sublimed matter did not render lime
water turbid.               Boiled in muriatic             acid,    so   as    to carry    off
all but      a   verv little free acid, on the addition                       of lime water
there was          no       turbid appearance,            but niilkines3 ensued on
adding oxalic acid.
     The spicula,            in   the     10 grains       of sublimate        above     men
tioned, seemed to be of the same nature                             as the         matter just
described.
     The whole of this sublimate amounted,                               by     estimation,
to       18 grains;         and   I   apprehend       it   is   the acid sublimate          of
Scheelc.

          From the deportion of these spicula               by   cooling, and from many
cf   the following properties,            thev appear to be analogous to benzoic acid.

 13*                On the Composition and Propersus
      The sublimate of         carbonate     of ammoniac amounted           to 20
  grains   ; and it was        black empyreumatic           animal oil which
 stained the tube.
      This experiment          was    repeated,    on 120 grains of a nut-
 brown,      very light, urinary concretion.              The   result was not
 very different       from that        of  the former experiment, except
 that the gaz contained             a  portion of hydrogen gaz.            There
 were 30 grains of the above described spicula, principally
 mixed with carbonaceous matter : they were light, and had
 only    a very   flight (harp and bitter taste.
      The experiment         repeated a third time,         with 80 grains     of
 urinary concretion,           afforded 15     grains of    the white spicula
 above described,        mixed with carbonaceous             matter.     These   I
 found did dissolve in            a large proportion       of muriatic acid      ;
 which solution yielded them, ou evaporation, in the same
 state as before.        Under the flame applied by the blowpipe,
 they first melted, and then evaporated,                without any smell ;
 leaving a flight black mark. Turnsole was reddened by these
spicula.
      In  a fourth experiment,            I found the white spicula con
 tained in the carbonaceous matter united, on boiling, with
 carbonate     of soda,     as  well as with caustic       soda  ; but, as be
 fore, muriatic        acid precipitated nothing           from the solution.
 These spicula could not be dissolved in nitric acid                 ;   nor did
 the solution       of them in water           become     turbid with oxalic
acid.      Their     taste   was, as before,       rather bitter and (harp
than four.        A   very suffocating        smell issued forth, on break
ing the tube        used in this experiment,            but it was not from
sulphur, nor from pruflic acid.
     These experiments afford evidence               of the wide difference
between       the    animal      oxide above described          and    the   acid
'ublimate of Scheele *.
    
       From these experiments,      it now appears very doubtful whether the
lit hie acid of Scheele    exists as a constituent  of urinary concretions, or it
compounded, in consequence us a new arrangement taking place, of the
elementary     matters of the concretion, by the agency of firej but it a
demonstrated,     that the urinary animal oxide is really a constituent parti
and even a principal one,       of almost all  human urinary calculi.

                               of Urinary    Concretions.                      133
     If  this conclusion be allowed            to be just, it will be necessary
to give a name to this urinary animal oxide.                        Agreably to
the principles         of   the new chemical nomenclature, the name
should      be litbic oxide.          But the term litbic is       a gross sole
cism     ; and   I trust     that philological critics will find the name
ouric ot uric oxide perfectly appropriate ; for, if it be thought
objectionable,            on account of the existence of the matter in
arthritic      as    well    as urinary concretions, still philology will
 allow its admiflion,            as  in other similar causes, ««t' t^xw'>
 it being found in greater abundance, by far, in the urinary
 passages than in other situations, and therefore falling under
 common observation,               as an  ingredient of the urine        If, how
 ever, the term          lithic oxide, or any other denomination,             shall
 obtain acceptance, I shall very willingly adopt it.
      It requires no sagacity, in aperson acquainted with the facts
 of the preceding experiments, to perceive that they                    are appli
  cable to a variety of uses in chemical investigation,                 and in the
  practice of physic. The latter              I of course   take no notice    of in
  this place     ;   but, relative to the former uses,          I  shall particu
  larly point out, that we are now able not only to detect,                       in
  the easiest manner, the presence              of the minutest proportion of
   the above animal oxide in urinary concretions, and also in
  other substances, but even to determine its proportion to the
   other constituent parts, in the space of a sew minutes, in
   most cafes, and in all in a very little time, without any other
   apparatus      than nitric acid, a round-bottomed matrass or glass
   dish, and       a  lamp.       By this    method)     I  have,    in  a general
   way, examined above 300 specimens of concretions, of the
   human subject and other animals, principally urinary ones ;
   and also many from other parts, particularly those from the
   joints.      For     these   opportunities,      I  am beholden to several
    professional     gentlemen; whose willingness to furnish me with
    specimens,       I  shall have much satisfaction in acknowledging
    on  a   future occasion.           At  present,    I must acknowledge my
    obligations to        Mr. Heaviside, in whose museum I foun J                be
    tween 700 and 800 specimens.                   The liberal    possessor  of this

134                       On the Composition and Properties
treasure offered me, what                   I   could not have taken the liberty
of     requesting,          namely, permission             to break off pieces from
any of the articles, for experiment. Mr. Edward Howard
did me the honour to take upon himself the task of writing
down the reports, and otherwise                       assisted    me.
      At this time I shall only mention,
      1. That out of 300 specimens of urinary calculi, not more
than fix did not contain the animal                            oxide above described,
«'.  about 32 out of 33 contained it.

varying from zl-o (exclusive of water,)  J|§; but, for the       to
most part, varying between                      Tiro and \*%      *.

quently found in concretions, in very different  proportions                                5
but        is
      perhaps never   principal constituent
                                   a         part of them.
  4. That the above animal oxide was not found in the uri
nary concretions, or any other concretions, of any animal
but the human kind.
   5. That this animal oxide was found also in human ar
thritic calculi, but not those of the teeth, stomach, intes
                                       in
tines, lungs, brain, &c.
      P. S.     I     think proper       to subjoin    a   sew experiments, made
after the preceding paper was written, which afford evidence
of     the truth       of   someof my conclusions, and enable                    us to ex
plain several           properties of animal concretions..
                 I.    On an Urinary Concretion from a Dog,
      This calculus may             be laid to be      a   great curiosity, for
                                                                                         it

probably the only specimen                      in   London.   owe the opportu

nity of examining              it   to   Mr. H.        Leigh Thomas, who met
with        it   in   the course of his dissections              ;    and    therefore   we
have unquestionable                    authority,      that the        concretion        was
  * In gome urinary concietions, the interior part contained this oxide.
and the exterior part had none of it. On tiie contrary,    other urinary    in
concretions,           the exterior part contained       it,   and the interior part     did
not.
                                                                                    really

                            of Urinary     Concretions.                       135
  really from the urinary bladder of a dog.                  It is worthy   to be
  noticed, that the animal appeared to be in perfect health.
     This concretion         is of  an oval figure     ;  is three inches and
 three quarters      in length,        and    three  inches in breadth ; is
 white     as  chalk  ;   its   surface is rough and          uneven.     Being
 sawed through          longitudinally,        no nucleus was found,          nor
 was it laminated,          but near the centre it was radiated, and
 contained shining fpicula.               In other      parts it was,    for the
 most part, compact and uniform in its texture.                     It weighed
 nearly ten ounces and a half.               Its specific gravity was found
 to be greater than that of human urinary concretions, in
 general ; which I have learned by experiments is also the
 case  with urinary and intestinal concretions of other                    brute-
 animals, especially with those of the horse.
    The    specific gravity      of  the present calculus was 1,7.
    That of     one from the urinary bladder             of   the human sub
ject, of the sort called mulberry calculus, and which con
sisted almost     entirely of uric oxide, was 1,609.
    That of another human urinary concretion, of                      tbe fame
composition       as the    former, but quite smooth, extracted by
Mr. Ford,       was 1,571.
    1.  The    present calculus       of the dog had no taste, nor smell,
till exposed to sire.
    2. Under the blowpipe it first became black, and emitted
the smell     of common animal matter ; it next               smelt strongly   of
empyreumatic liquor cornu err-ji ; and, after burning some
time, became inodorous, and white, and readily melted, like
superphosphate       of lime.
    3. On trituration with lye os caustic soda, there was                 a co
pious discharge of ammoniac.
    4.  It dissolved, on boiling in         nitric  acid   : the solution was
clear and colourless ; and, on evaporation to dryness,                    left a
residue    of white     hitter matter,      which, under the blowpipe,
emitted, weakly, the smell of animal matter.
    5. Upon distilling a mixture of 150 grains of this concre
tion pulverized and two pints and a half of pure water, to
                                        K  4                              three

 136              On   the Composition     and Properties
three ounces, the distilled liquid was found to contain            nothing
but a little ammoniac.                The   three  ounces of residuary
liquid,    being filtrated and evaporated,          yielded   20 grains    of
phosphate      of ammoniac,         with a little animal matter ; and
the residuary undiflblved matter amounted               to 67 grains.
    6. These 67 grains, being triturated with four ounces of
caustic soda lye, discharged very little ammoniac.                 On dis
tilling this mixture to 6ne ounce, a very small proportion
only of ammoniac was found in the distilled liquid.                     The
 residuary ounce of alkaline liquid was filtrated, and mixed
with    the water    of elutriation of    the undiflblved matter.       One
half of    those liquid?,     on evaporation to dryness,        afforded    a
 dark brown matter, amounting to 20 grains, which consisted
  of  phosphate    of lime    and animal matter.       To   the other    half
of the alkaline liquids was gradually added                muriatic acid,
 which occasioned        a deposit,    in small proportion,     of matter
that dissolved in nitric        acid, but which, on evaporation            to
dryness,     left behind only        a brownish    matter, consisting of
phosphate      of lime   and animal matter.
     7. The    residuary    insoluble substance in caustic lye, (6.)
under the blowpipe, first turned black, and then grew white,
but could not be melted.
     By diluted sulphuric acid it was decompounded.                  On the
addition of nitrate of mercury, to the filtrated liquid,           it yield
ed phosphate      of mercury      ;  and, with oxalic acid, it afforded
oxalatc of lime      ;  but no sulphate     of  magnesia   was found re
maining after these precipitations were produced.
    These experiments        fully demonstrate,     that the above con
cretion of     a  dog contained none        of  the uric or lithic oxide
above described,       but that it consisted, principally at least,       of
phosphate      of lime,     phosphate     of ammoniac,        and animal
matter.
    The   present instance leads me to explain the reason             of the
fusibility of calculi.      This    is demonstrated     by the above ex
periments, to depend upon the discharge and decomposition
us the ammoniac of the phosphate of ammoniac, during the
                                                                  burning

                                  of Urinary    Concretions.                                     137
burning away of                    the   animal matter           :   hende the residuary
phosphoric acid readily fuses, and, uniting to the phosphate
of lime, composes superphosphate of lime, a very fusible
substance.
  The        phosphate           of ammoniac being           dissolved out by water,
or caustic            alkaline lye, the remaining                    matter is infusible,
being phosphate of lime.
      A    very hard, brittle, and blackish intestinal calculus                                  of   a
dog, from             Mr. Wilson, was found               to be        of     greater specific
gravity than human urinary calculi,                              and    to have the same
composition             as   that of the dog above described.
  This          also       was    found to be the composition of                         a   white,
smooth, round, intestinal calculus of a horse,                                      the specific
gravity         of which         was 1,791.
   The          fame       composition was discovered,                   on examining a
very hard, gray, brittle, laminated, quadrilateral concretion,
said to be           from the urinary bladder, but which,                          I think,      was
more probably from the intestines,                       of a        horse.
  II,      On a Calculus from the Urinary Bladder                              of   a Rabbit.
   This             is also a curiosity, being the only                     instance         I   have
seen.           I     am     likewise indebted to            Mr. Thomas for this
specimen, which                    he very    kindly     sent me,             fitted     up as a
preparation, included in the bladder itself.                                   Mr. Thomas
found this concretion,                   on dissecting       a   perfectly healthy and
very fat rabbit.
      This      specimen         is spherical, and      of   the size         of   a small       nut
meg.            It is of a dark brown colour,                has a smooth surface, is
hard,        brittle,        and     heavy.     When broken, it appeared                              to
consist      of concentric laminæ.               Its specific gravity was 2.
      z.    Under          the     blowpipe    it.   grew black, and emitted the
smell       of animal matter while burning;                            at last      it   ceased       to
emit any smell               ;   and, urged with         the intensest fire,                 showed
jio   signs         of fusibility.

both muriatic and nitric acids, giving clear solutions.

 dryness,      and partly to the corSitcace of extract, the dry
 residuary      matter was white; and the extract-like matter,
 which     was    bitter, could not be fused under the blow-pipe;
 but, when brought to the          state  of a powder, the particles of
 it were   made to cohere loosely together into           one mass.
     4. On   dropping sulphuric        acid  into the muriatic      Motion,
 (a.) turbidness, and       a copious white precipitation, immedi
 ately ensued,       from thecompofi*jon        of sulphate  of lime.
     From   these experiments      it is warrantable to conclude, that
 the above urinary calculus of a rabbit consisted principally of
 carbonate of lime and common animal matter, with, per
 haps, a ren- small proportion ot phosphoric acid :             it certainly
 contained no uric oxide.
     I examined, in the same manner, a concretion which was
 Cud to be from         the stomach os a monkey ;          but  I have not
 evidence    of   its origin equally satisfactory      as that  of the  two
last calculi.    Its composition was found to be similar to that ot
the calculus of the rabbit, viz. carbonate of lime and animal
matter.       Its obvious properties       were also the fame      j it was
of the   size  of  the largest, nutmeg.
             III.    On Urinary Concretions of tb* Hor/e.
    I examined several specimens          in cabinets,  said to  be rc6cal
calculi of the horse, and found none of them to contain the
uric oxide above described;           but that they consisted (as well
as  the calculi from the stomach and intestines of the fame
animal) of phosphate of lime, phosphate of ammoniac, and
common animal matter, which melted like superphosphate
of lime,    after   burning    away the animal matter and ammo
niac.     As    these, and some other experiments, seemed to
concur in establishing        an important truth,       I  thought it De
cenary lo examine an urinary concretion of               a horse, which,
from its figure and size, was unquestionably from the kidney
of that animal       ; for  I  have   found by experience, that one
cannot depend entirely on the accounts in cabinets, nor
                                                                   indeed.

indeed, sometimes,         on, the assertions    of persons who collect
specimens.
    i.  This concretion, which Dr. Baillie was so good as to
give me, was of a blackish colour, was very brittle and hard,
and had no smell or taste.              It felt heavier than human
urinary calculi.
    3. Under the blowpipe it became quite black, and emitted
the smell, weakly,       of common animal matter.            It  was re
duced very little in quantity,         and showed no appearances        of
fusibility,    after being exposed for a considerable        time to the
most intense fire      of the blowpipe.
    3. Muriatic       acid   dissolved   this concretion,    with   effer
vescence, yielding a clear solution ;          which, on evaporation
to dryness,     left a  black and bitter residue.
    4. A little of the     residue (3.) being boiled in pure water,
 to  the   filtrated liquor      superoxalate    of  potash was added ;
which     occasioned      a very turbid      appearance,    and copious
white precipitation.
    5.  Nitric acid     also readily dissolved this concretion,      with
effervescence.       The solution being      evaporated,   partly to dry
ness, and partly       to   the consistence of an extract, the dry
residuary matter was white and bitterish, and the extract-
like part showed no signs of fusibility under the intensest fire
of  the blowpipe.
    6.  A. little of the concretion, being triturated with lye of
caustic soda, emitted        no smell of ammoniac.
    From these experiments it         appears, that this calculus, like
the former one from a rabbit,           consists  of carbonate of lime
and common animal matter.
    A  renal calculus of a horse, in       Mr. Heaviside's collection,
appeared, on examination, to consist           of carbonate of lime   and
common animal matter.
    Another     specimen,     however, of renal calculus of      a horse,
in the same collection, marked No. 3. was found to consist of
phosphate of lime, phosphate of ammoniac, and common
animal matter.          It  was fused under the blowpipe.
                                                                     The

 I40           On the Compnjition         of Urinary    Concretions.
     The    specimen        marked No. 8.          in the same collection,
 which was said to be a vesical calculus of a horse, appeared
 to consist of the three ingredients just mentioned.
     I have met with         two instances of      a deposit   of a prodigious
 quantity of matter in the urinary bladder of horses, which
 had not crystallized, or even concreted                 :   it amounted,      in
one specimen,          which was given to me by Dr. Marshall,                  to
 several    pounds weight;           and in the other, which is in the
 possession    of Mr. Home,         to about 45 pounds.            Its composi
tion was, principally, carbonate of lime and common animai
matter *.
    I   have not found any instance            of human urinary calculi of
a similar composition to that of the rabbit, and those us
horses above described, which consist of carbonate of lime
and animal         matter    ;  and     I   believe   that human urinary
calculi very rarely occur of            a  similar composition to those        of
the dog and horses above mentioned, which were found to
consist    of phosphate of ammoniac,              phosphate     of lime,     and
animal matter, without containing uric oxide.
    The     difference     in the constitution of urinary concretions
may depend on the difference of the urinary organs of dif
ferent animals, on the food and drink t» and on the various
diseased and healthy states           of  the urinary organs.
    I  have not found the uric oxide in the urinary concretions
of any phytivorous animal ; but, whether it would be formed
in the human animal when nourished merely by vegetable
matter, must be determined by future observations.                        In the
mean time, it is warrantable to conclude, from analogy^
that it would not, and the application of this fact to practice

mentioned.        It now    appears probable,    that such deposits frequently
take place,    although I believe they liave not been noticed before.

 facts      I   have collected, relative both to concretions and to the
 urine itself.

      Discoveries         in the North-eaft Sea, By Prose/for Blu-

      meriden.           Published        by   Major    Von Zach, May                    1798.
 As             very    little is yet publicly          known of the great fix-
years           expedition,        undertaken        by the Ruffians for making
discoveries            in the Northern Archipelago                 or Eastern Ocean,
the following             (hort account of              it,   taken    from        the    most
authentic sources,                 and particularly from the correspondence
of Dr. C. H. Merck, who                         was employed          in   the expedition
as    naturalist and               physician, with          the   Royal Academy              of
Sciences at Gottingen,                    may afford satisfaction           to those fond
of geographical
                              ^searches.
   This expedition was proposed                        by   Catherine      II.    so   early as
the month of November 1784.                            A    plan was also drawn up
for   it;       and    the command conferred upon Captain                              Billings
en Englishman,                then in the naval serviceof Russia, who had
accompanied              Mr. Bayly             the    astronomer       in Cook's           last
voyage           round the world in 1776  80.                    Three          captains of
the    second          rank were appointed                  under him, viz.              Hall,
Sarischef and Bering,                 not the son,          as Lesseps fays,           but the
grandson          of   the celebrated          Capt. Vitus Bering, who, on the
14th     of December              1741, was interred on an island in the sea
f Kamtschatka,                   named    after     himself, and where he had
been shipwrecked.
  The principal objects of this                      great and very expensive ex
pedition were,            to supply all the deficiencies              in   regard to the
important discoveries with which                        the geography            of Asiatic
                                                                                        Russia

 T42                   Account os the last Ruffian
Russia had been enriched, since the time              of Peter the Great,
by exploring that       so  little know north-east corner           of   Asia,
the land of Tschukt ; to pursue further             if possible the north
east passage, attempted        by Cook    ; and, lastly,      to  search otrt
more convenient posts for the Ruffian fur-trade             on the north
west coast   of America.
    Captain    Billings    set  out with     his instructions from Pe-
tersburgh in the end of the year 1785, and                   in July      1786
arrived at Ochotzk.          Having    passed the     winter at Werchne
Ostrog, in the        beginning of     the summer 1787           he left    the
mouth of the Kolyma or Kovyma with two vessels, the larger
of which, called the Pallas, was commanded by himself;
and the other, the Jesaschna, named                after an    arm of      the
river Kovyma,        in which     it was built,      was commanded           by
Captain Sarischef.         This   was only a preparatory expedition,
the object     of which, however, was nothing less than                       to
double Cape Tschelazka, (Cook's Cape North) and                               to
proceed by this unheard-of           route   from the Frozen Ocean
through Bering's Straits to Anadyr.           I call the  route unheard-
of,   as the  romantic voyage       of  the Starsehina Cossac Semon
Deschnew,       in the year 1648,        notwithstanding the account
of it which      the Russian      historiographer Muller is said             10
have discovered in 1736, among the archives at Jakutzk,                      i?
ftill doubted by many sceptics, who consider a connection                   oi
the northern parts of both continents as possible.
    These adventurous navigators, however, could not pro*
ceed further than to a certain point between                Baranikamen
and the mouth        of the river Tschaun ; because the impene
trable fields   of ice which      they found there,       rendered   it  im
possible for them to continue their voyage to the north-east,
and obliged them to return from Seredun-Kcrymflcy                    Oflrfji
to Jakutzk, in order to        pass the   winter.
    In   the mean time, Captains Hall and Bering were                   em
ployed in preparations for the grand expedition. The former
superintended      at  Ochotzk     the   building     of the two     vessel'
destined    for that purpose,       and   the   latter  had   the care of
                                                              transporting

for sitting them out.
    In the summer of 1789,               the   two ships were ready at
Ochotzk for putting to sea ; when unfortunately, the second
of them, the Dobrowa Namerine (the Good Intent), which
was to be commanded by Capt. Hall, got on shore just at
the mouth of the Ochochta ; and               as  her keel was broken, it
was necessary to set her on fire.             On account of this mis
fortune, Capt. Billings, with his own              vessel the  Slawa Roffie
 (Ruffian Glory), was not able to leave Ochotzk till towards
 the middle of September ; at which time he proceeded to
 Awatscha Bay, where he anchored in the month of October,
 having made in this          passage   a discovery     of  very great im
 portance to nautical geography,            as   about 300 wersts from
 Ochotzk towards the Kurile islands, he fell in with a rock,
 an hundred fathoms high and a werst in circumference,
 surrounded by      lesser  rocks which were named Jonas Island,
 and on which       many    of   the   (hips already lost have,        in all
 probability,    been wrecked.          Prodigious      flocks of sea-fowl
 come every morning from           these  rocks to the coast of Ochotzk,
 and return thither again in the evening to pass the                night.
     After wintering     at Kamtscbatka, these navigators explored,
 in  the summer of       the year     1790,     the whole chain       of the
 Aleutian islands, which seem to be of volcanic origin, and
 afterwards the large eastern islands explored by Cook ; Ona-
  taschka and Kadjak ; the bay          of Cape St. Elias, &c. and re
 turned to winter at       Kamtschatka.          In the summer of 1791
 they proceeded on their grand expedition,                 to search    for a
 northern    passage    through the Frozen           Ocean;     and   having
 landed on Gore's and Clarke's               Island, pursued their route
  from thence to the continent of America.
     As  the fields  of ice, which      extend from the Eastern Cape
  of America,    rendered    it impoffible for them to penetrate any
 further,   Captain Billings, in conjunction with               Dr. Merck,
  accompanied by one of the pilots, the draftsman, two inter
  preters, and four seamen, undertook an expedition              of discovery
                                                                     through

    144                 Account  ff the lajl Ruffian
   through the country ofTschukt from theBayof St. Laurence to
   the river Kolyma, which they had left four years before. This
   wonderful journey,       which they performed in (ledges drawn
   by rein-deer and attended        by some of the intrepid natives,
   continued from the middle of August till the end of February
   1792, when they arrived at the river Angarka, which falls
  into the great river of Anuy, after having travelled through,
   and examined in regard to geography, natural history and
  statistics,   an extensive tract of country very little known,
  the Bay      of St. Laurence    and    the iflands between Bering's
  Straits and the mouth        of  the   Anadyr, inhabited by about
  four thousand Tschuktese, who are ichthyophagi or feeders
  on fish, and the whole almost level land, destitute of wood,
 of   the rein-deer Tschuktese     from the above-mentioned straits
 as far as the     Kolyma.
     In  the beginning    of May these enterprising travellers re
 turned on horseback        to Jakutzk.      Their vessel, which they
 had left in the Bay of St. Laurence,            had in the mean time
 proceeded       to Onalaschka,      under the command of Capt.
 Sarischef,      and had wintered there,       together with a small
 cutter called the Tschorne        Orel (the Black Eagle), which
 had been built soon after their first arrival at Kamtschatka, to
 supply the loss of the       vessel   stranded   at Ochotzk,   and on
 board which were Captains Hall and Bering.
     Next    spring both vessels returned      to Kamtschatka.     The
 Slawa Roslie was left there in the harbour of St. Peter and
St. Paul     ;  but Captains   Hall   and Sarischef,   in the course of
the summer, paid a visit in the Black Eagle to the            chain of
|he volcanic Kurile islands. They then proceeded to Ochotzk,
from which they were followed, in the summer of 1793, by
the rest of the crew of the Slawa Rossie in a transport com
manded         by Capt. Billings;    and   in the winter of 1794 the
whole of the persons employed           in the expedition returned   to
Petersburgh.
    A   full   account of this remarkable and interesting expe
dition is now preparing for publication, under the inspection
                                                                     of

   time, the Academical           Museum at this place *, through the
¦
   liberality   of   its worthy benefactor Baron von             Asch, coun
   sellor  of   state, has     received a present       highly interesting to,
   natural history and geography, consisting of works of art and
  natural curiosities from these remote regions of the northern
  part of Asia,      as  well   as   of  the  north-wefl     coast  of America
   and the chain       of iflands lying      between   the two continents.
      The    specimens       of   art   of  these polar     inhabitants,    and
  above all the needle-work of the women, (who, however, for
  the most      part are troglodytes, and in their subterranean
  dwellings      (jur/en),     must consequently strain their eyes            by
  forking      at lamps silled        with train oil,) exceed in elegance
  every thing      I   ever saw      of such kind of manufacture, not
  only among savages, but even among the civilized Euro
  peans.      As a proof of this assertion, I (hall here remark,
  that they stood examination              by a magnifying glass,         under
  which    the finest embroidery          of Europe     lost much by being
  compared      with them.
      The  assertion that, except food and           drink,   there is no   obt
 ject which engages more the attention of mankind than that
 of ornament, and that a turn for coquetry is one of the
 most general      as   well as most beneficent principles in human
 nature  an assertion strengthened by this striking observation,

VI.       New     Process   for obi (lining Lemon Juice of a stronger
      Quality.           By M. Brupn atej.lt.        From Annali dj
      Chimia, Vol. H.              p. 31.
Having observed                          in the course of several experiments
that the (limy substance in lemon juice separates itself spon
taneously from that acid, I endeavoured     to find out some
 method of preventing it from spoiling during the time ne
    cessary for its separation,                   in order that the acid should not
    acquire any bad properties which might render it unpleasant
    to the taste, or uncertain in its chemical effects.
      I    expressed in the common manner the                          juice of perfectly
    tipe lemons,           and strained            it through    a   piece of linen.   In
    half   an hour        L drained it again,           to free it from a little slimy
    matter which had settled                 at the   bottom of the            vessel.     I   then
    added to        the   juice     a   certain quantity of the strongest spirit
    of wine,       and preserved the mixture for some days in a                                well-
    corked bottle.           During that time              there was a considerable
    deposit, which lo all appearance                    was of       a   slimy nature, and.
    which     I   separated by filtering paper.                  H" the         fluid was too
    thick to      pass    through the filter,          I diluted         it again    with spirit
    of wine.        After this operation,               the deposit remained on the
    paper,        which was entirely covered with                        it,   andI      obtained
     in   the vessel placed below,                 the purest acid         of   {emons         corn,
     billed with spirit of wine.

     Tf it be required to obtain the acid perfectly pure, nothing
is necessary but to separate from it the spirit                                 of wine, which
can be         best effected by            evaporation.                  The acid of the lemons
assumes,             after it has been freed from the spirit                            of wine and
the moisture combined with                                it,   a   yellowish colour, and be
comes          so
                     strong that,          by    its taste,         it   might be considered              as
                                                                                                           t
mineral acid.
     It   is   not necessary to evaporate the spirit of wine in                                     a   close
vessel,    if   the experiment                   is   made only on              a    small scale      ;   nor
is   there any danger that in open vessels anv                                       of the     acid wiH
be lost, as           it    is   too fixed to be volatilised                    by   the same degree
of    heat at which spirit                     of wine           evaporates.           This acid lus
peculiar properties, which deserve further examination.

various have been the experiments made both to prove and
to refute the Franklinean                         hypothesis.
     A    paper             by    Mr. Wilson was                 read at the    Royal Society,
December                   6,    1759,    *n   favour         0I"    the   permeability of glass,

                                                      a     and holding          ;                         it
upright         by         one edge,       while the opposite edge                      rested        upon
wax, he rubbed the middle part of the surface with                                                        his
finger, and found both fides electrified plus.
   He then held the fame pane of glass within two feet of
ihc prime conductor, which was electrified plus                                        ;   that part       of
the glass which was opposite to the conductor became elec
trified minus on both sides;                           but, in        a    few minutes,          the mi

    Many other experiments of a similar nature were made by
Mr. Wilson, none of which, however, appear sufficiently
conclusive:       I  sliall therefore      submit the following experi
ment to electricians        ; and   if    it does not prove the permea
bility of    glass to the electric fluid,            they will oblige me by
explaining the way by which the balls in the electrometer
are made to diverge         without passing           the electricity through,
 the glass.
                              EXPERIMENT.
     Cavallo's    atmospherical electrometer was placed upon a
 glass pedestal, and covered by a thick glass receiver,                  so  large
 as to admit     of a space    of above two inches           between     its sidts
 and the electrometer.        A charged jar          was then brought      within
 a little of   the apparatus,    and the balls immediately diverged
 considerably,      as   represented        in   Fig. 3. Plate IV.          Upon
 touching the receiver with the knob                 of the jar, the   distance
  between the balls was doubled            ;  but, on the removal of the      jar,
  they directly came together.             This experiment        was repeated
  upon the air pump, and the effects were exactly the fame.

     At    each hole in this frame through which the rod passes, a
brass socket           (H      a) is screwed to the lower side                      of   the frame, so
that the rod may                    pass freely        through it           ; and      that it may be

it to the frame by the screws i i. To keep the stopper
d firm in the neck of the adopter, a semicircular clip em
braces      the brass cap            g /,        and      meets     the shoulder            of    the
stopper d.         From this clip two                  brass pins enter the piece                  i,
which being drawn                    to the frame by the screws /                      /,    forces
the clip against the glass stopper d, and thus fastens it firmly
in    the neck       of    the adopter.               By the like mechanism                       the
other neck of the adopter is made                          fast to the    frame.
     The wire i      e    being moveable in                 a well-greased collar                  of
leather, the brass ball              i is    turned round, when the hydrogen
gas has been         inflamed         ;     and the wire A e turning with this
ball,    the end e is removed                 to one fide from the flame                     of   the
hydrogen gas         ;    the screw          m    serves to keep              the wire       in   the
position required.
     Previous to the        use      of this instrument                the funnels are to
be screwed         off:   the oxygen funnel at                 f;      the hydrogen fun
nel at the neck            B of       the adopter.            The hydrogen                  stopper
being removed, the adopter is to be rinsed with distilled wa
ter, and, being again put in its position on the frame                                  FG,        is
to be left to drain, the tube                    CD being         left open.          After this
the     adopter      with      its    stoppers         and     included            air is to be
weighed      :    the hydrogen stopper being then removed, the
adopter     is to be silled          with distilled water of                  a    known tem
perature,        and the stopper to be again replaced.                            By the weight
of    the water      in    the adopter its capacity                    in cubic inches              ia,
ascertained.
     The   same stopper         is   now to be taken out and dried, and
oxygen gas,under           a   preflure of        a   two- inch column of water, to
be introduced till all the water                     is   excluded      from the adopter           :
its orifice, being still under the water,                         is   then covered           with
the finger, and another person stands ready to introduce the
stopper,    which has to expel its bulk of gas,                          so   that no air can
enter against this current                  of   the gas.         The     adopter       is    now
fastened     to its fr.?.ne,          and the funnels are screwed on.                             To

air which       it otherwise would hold, oxygen gas is sucked
through     ii from    the small extremity.
    The funnels,       the    capacities   of which     arc determined by
measurement, and marked at the different heights, now con
tain atmospheric air confined by water, which is to be               sucked
out by means of         a slender syphon :       when the oxygen funnel
is thus emptied of its air, in order that none may remain in
the neak, oxygen gas is to be introduced and sucked out                   re
peatedly.      Then it      is to be charged with the fame gas,          and
the stop cock to be opened            to allow a free communication
between      the   gas    in the     funnel    and   that in the adopter,
which is now left to drain for 24 hours, at the end of which
time the water which has gathered in the tube C D i j to be
passed   off by opening the cock           D, which    must just touch the
surface   of  the water in      D, that   the oxygen gas isi the adopter
and funnel may accommodate itself to the present temperature
and pressure      of the  external air, which is to be noted, and then
the cock to be stopped. The water on the outside of this funnel
is to be kept two or three inches lower than in the inside.
    The hydrogen funnel           d is to be freed    of its contained    at
mospheric air by the same means               employed for freeing the
other funnel, and hydrogen gas is to be repeatedly intro
duced and sucked out.             At last it is to be filled with mea
sured quantities       of this   gas to the     lip, which is to   be com
 pressed  by a    column of about four inches of water.
    The   apparatus      is now ready.        The ball k of the   electrical
conductor, charged by a good machine, is to be brought near
 to the ball i ; and while the sparks pass in quick succession
 from the wire      Ae    to the point     of the  tube  fie, the cock at    i
 is to be opened quickly,         so  that the first portion of hydrogen
 iras issuing at e may be instantly inflamed ; the wire is then
 to be turned away from the flame.                The combustion    may be
 accelerated     by increasing the       column of water which       prefles
 Ihe hydrogen gas, and lessening                the pressure on the oxy
                                                                         gen

gen gas.        The   adopter is now to be kept cool by water, al
lowed to trickle down over it from the              vessel   Q.
    During      the combustion measured quantities               of  the gases
are to be introduced into tbc proper funnels               ;  and when it is
wished to interrupt tbe process,             the cock which admits the
hydrogen gas is to be quickly stopped.                  As   the vessels cool,
the oxygen gas and aqueous vapour in the addpter will con
tract in bulk, and the water in the oxygen funnel will rife
towards the brass cap f.            At this moment        the cock must be
shut to prevent the water from rising higher.
     When      the process is to be renewed, the oxygen funnel is
to be charged        with gas, and the Cock to be opened.                    The
hydrogen funnel is next to be charged                 ;  the wrre     A  e to be
turned to its first position, and the electric spark to be applied
as before.        Thus the combustion may be carried on from
day to day.         That    the electric sparks may strike quickly and
vigorously,       a communication         fliould    be made       with   a  wire
 between      the custiion     of the machine     and the brass cap m.
     As   the gases employed are not to be                considered     as   free
 from    a*zotic  gas, its presence     will at last reduce the eas in the
 adopter to the standard of atmospheric air.                  The flame will
 then become weaker, and must be watched, that the cock of
 the hydrogen funnel may be stopped before the flame is ex
 tinguished ; otherwise some of the hydrogen gas will pass
 unaltered     into the adopter, and be confounded with the azotic
 gas, from which         it  is not easily separable.
     When the       process is terminated, the quantity            of hydrogen
 gas remaining        in  its funnel is to be noted from the grada
 tions marked on            the vessel, and to be deducted             from the
 sum    of  the measures       of hydrogen    gas employed.         This funnel
 is then to be be screwed off.        The oxygen funnel         is to be treated
  in  the fame manner, proper attention being paid to the level
 of   the water,     and to the temperature         and pressure      of  the air
  at the time.       The adopter       and stoppers,      being now in the
  state   in which       they were first weighed, are now                   to be
  weighed, with the contained water, to determine its weight.
                                                                              ^To

  j£4           apparatus    for producing tJdter, c£c.
     To weigh    the water thus formed still more accurately, and
  to examine its quality, it must be drawn off        from the   adopter.
 For this    purpose the adopter* after     it has stood to drain for 34
 hours, is to be warmed by wrapping the upper part of it in
 a hot cloth : a bottle of proper size is to receive the extremity
 of   the tube  C D, and,     the stop cock being opened,         the  ex
 panded gas in the adopter will press all the water into               the
 bottle.    During    the passage    of the water, the bottle is to be
 held at such a height that the orifice of the stop cock may dip
 only 4th of an inch in the water; and when a single bubble
 of gas from      the adopter    has issued through the       water, the
 stop cock is to be instantly closed.
     The gas remaining in the adopter is now to be transferral
 into another vessel, in which it may be exposed first to lime
water, that any carbonic acid gas contained               in it  may     be
measured      : and afterwards     to fulphuret    of lime, which will
imbibe all the oxygen gas, and leave           the azotic gas in a state
 sit for mensuration.
     The quantity of      heterogeneous      matter introduced       with
the gales during the combustion being thus discovered, a pro
portionate deduction is to be made from the calculated weight
of   the hydrogen and oxygen gas employed.             The difference   oJ
weight of the azotiegas remaining, and the common air at firft
weighed with the instrument, may thus be easily determint^1
     The Society from      whose interesting minutes we make the
present extract, carried on the combustion in the manner al
ready described,       for about two hours at a time on different
days, till the column      of water in    the tube   C D was   8£ inches
in length.      At  each ol these times the temperature of the
gases and the     height of the barometer were carefully noted.

IX.     On the Principles         of Iron and Steel.       By Mr.     David
    Mush et, of tbe           Clyde of Iron Work.          Communicated      by
    the Author.
TPlI      E   general diffusion      of  coal and ironstone,      in rich and
extensive tracts throughout the island              of Great Britain, while
it  has stamped an additional value on land, has rendered the
manufacture of iron of such national importance and advan
tage, as to weigh considerably in the scale                of our commer
cial interests.       Of    late years   it ha? gained in a great measure
that just preponderance to which its magnitude and general
utility have fully entitled it. At present, however, ii must
not     be   concluded,         that   the   business   has attained     those
bounds which         set  limits to its improvement         ;  or that it has
attained     its utmost consequence           as  a source  of national and
individual wealth.            Its future    progress   will greatly depend
upon the liberal exertions of individuals, and the self-denial
of the     legislature,     by abstaining from cramping in its en
lightened march the genius of this native manufacture.
    Impressed      with these truths, the following details            will  be
found      more allied to the practice            of  the   manufacture of
iron than attached to any systematic arrangement of science;
where oftentimes the practical                student  is obliged to smile,
bewildered at the lengthened assemblage of phrases expres
sive of a simple substance or meaning.
   It  is much to be lamented that the scientific arrangement
of  the   mineralogist was not more consonant to the ideas of
the manufacturer         ;   and that the labours       of the former    were
not more directed to assimilate to the just results                of practice
his preconceived theories.
   With heartfelt        pleasure we sliould then peruse the history
and   analysis     of  the many strata        of argillaceous    ores  of iron
                                                                         with

waters sufficient for turning              machinery        :    these would forni

    It  is also much to be wished, for the improvement                          of all,
that the method and order of the new nomenclature of th;
.French school would pervade every branch                          of chemical      and
 mineralogical          science,       and  that     the     celebrated       Kirwan
would      so   far betid    as   to new model his excellent                system of
mineralogy on these principles.
    The metallic substance called iron                        is   susceptible    of    a
 greater variety        of modifications,         and possessed        of  more pro
perties     singular and useful,           than any other metal.                 Iron,
properly       so   called, is malleable.         All    the other states       of the
 metal contain certain substances in                   combination          with     the
 iron,    which render          it fusible,    brittle,    more or less        elastic,
 &c.      Pure iron         is destitute     of foreign admixture,              and is
 therefore      perfectly malleable.           A   variety        of methods      have
 been cflabliflied to produce the metal                    approaching        to that
 pure and ductile          state :    in the pursuit of this laudable               at
 tainment the following distinct modifications                         of iron    ha\c
 manifested        themselves      :
    ist, Crude,        cast, or pig     iron;    2d, Steel       ;  and, 3d, Mal
 leable iron.          Crude iron is an eager brittle metal, obtained
 by the simple fusion of ores in contact with pitcoal charred,
 or the charcoal of wood, united with                  a   certain proportion of
 calcareous        earth as a solvent or flux           :  its component part?

      These are the foreign substances which alter and contami
nate the quality of the iron ; but, as they exist in different
 proportions in various irons, it is obvious that these altera
 tions of proportion will form varieties of crude iron : the
 following are distinguishable :
       ist. Oxygenated crude iron, where             a small    portion of caT-
 bon is united to the iron,            and   where a superabundance             of
 oxygen exists.           The fracture of     such    iron    presents a white
 surface destitute       of grain, frequently diverging in          streaks, re
 sembling an early variety           of crystallization;        sometimes    it is
 mottled with specks of a black colour, which plainly exhibit
  the scanty        portion of carbonic concretions.              The external
  surface     of   such iron always cools concave,             rough,   and co
  vered      with oxyd.        In commerce thjs variety of iron                  is
  Jcnown by the names of white iron, forge pigs, ballast iron,
  &c. and its present value is from 5I. 5s. to 5I. 15s. per ton.
        2d.  Carbo-oxygenated          crude iron    *, or iron united with
  equal portions of carbon and oxygen.                   The fracture of this
   iron is light gray, presenting          a small   distinct grain j the sur
   face    of  the pig partially punctured,         less concave,      and more
    free from oxydation          in cooling than        the former state.       In
    commerce it is known by the names of gray iron,                      No. 3,
        * I am   fully aware of the novelty of tliis term, and that by some         I
    may be tiable to be censured.      I have, however,    the great Lavoisier for
    my precedent, who, in naming the compound radicals of the vegetable
    kingdom, used hydro-carbonous and           hydro-carbonic, to express the
     ternary combination of hydrogen and carbon with oxygen; in the
    former, into that of an oxyd  in the latter, into that of an acid. It
    may however be remarked, that in this way the prevailing substance
     was marked by a precedency      given to its sign, which implied that there
    existed a larger proportion    of  this than the following substance.       Let
    the present, however,     express the combination     of iron with carbon and
     oxygen    in equal portions : the precedency      giveu to carbon in begin
     ning the compound, is meant      to denote its superior agency, aud its pre
     tence being essential in the manufacture      of crude iron.

cess with carbon, and having united to it but a                             scanty
portion-   of oxygen.       The fracture of this iron              presents an
astonishing group of large, regular, metallic grains, each
presenting a prominent edge outwards ;                     in this      state   tbe
saturation     of carbon    has been         so  complete,     that it       exists

coating of shining plumbago, and completely free from oxyd.

turers  :  its present value is 81. to 81. 10s. per ton.
    These are the principal varieties of crude iron.               A     number
of intermediate qualities           are produced,        exactly dependent

tnore valuable will be the pig iron.                     A  sparing proportion of"
charcoal in the blast furnace is productive of effects com
pletely contrary to these.
     It most naturally occurs to inquire,                    to what extreme       de
gree     of combination           these alterative       principles are capable      of
with iron, and in what                  state  the metal is when this excessive
saturation is completed.
      If crude     iron is exposed in fusion, for             a  length of time, to
 absorb      carbon,        and     at the same time            is protected     from
 pxydation,         it will    receive this principle to such excess as to
 form a true plumbago.                   In this   state it either resembles steel,
 grained lead ore, or assumes an imperfect cubical crystalliza
 tion, wonderfully brittle,                 and possessed    of  a real metallic ap
 pearance        and weight          :  in this state it is powerfully attracted
 by the magnet.
       Specimens         of this singular combination                 are extremely
  rare ; several         that   I   am     in  possession   of, have regular faces
   approaching to a cubical structure, with surfaces chequered
  with numerous diagonal lines intersecting                         each other,     and
   forming rhombuses               :   these are easily displaced       with  a  knife,
  .and exhibit them composed of the thinnest laminæ imagina
   ble   : in this    state   they are not obedient to the magnet, unless
   a considerable          number of them are attached together.                   The
   specific     gravity of this mixture of iron                   and   carbon is to
    water    as   6  9694 to 1.000;              a  cubic foot weighs 435 58750
    pounds avoirdupoise.
        In manufacturing              crude iron, the highest possible pitch to
    which it can         be united with oxygen is productive                of a coarse
    metallic substance,              whose fracture is dark and porous, and
    whose      surface      on cooling           becomes     covered    with    a   deep
    earthy oxyd        5   incapable of being fused but by withstanding
    a violent heat; capable of receiving some impressions of
     malleability,        though still       possessing   excessive brittleness when
     cold. The specific gravity of iron thus united with oxygen                         i9

 only relate to these principles                  as   they become united to           the
 iron in      fusion ; they may also be presented to crude iron in
 the process         of cementation           ;   in which cafe carbon unites
 to iron in an aeriform state, distending tne particles                                and
 softening the mass            :   oxygen, on the contrary,                 attacks the
 metal and reduces it to             a   dark blucoxyd destitute of metallic
 brilliancy        and weight ; but         of this more hereafter.
    Steel, from its great affinity to crude iron, ought next to
 fae mentioned ; but as manufacturers hitherto have placed it
 as the third existing state             of   the metal,       it will   be mentioned
 in that order.
   To produce malleable iron in                         its pure state,        many   and
various have been the processes adopted                        :   these however      have
all in some measure fallen short.                       Malleable        irort ought      to
possess       no foreign mixture whatever, to be in a                            state of
purity ; but as the modes of operation have hitherto                                con
sisted in manufacturing this state of the metal from                               crude
iron,       and      iron is always found to contain princi
                   as crude
ples inimical to malleability, it is obvious, that the quality
of malleable iron will at all times depend upon the degree of
expulsion of the alterative                mixtures contained in the               crude
iron    ;   the destructionof        which,       and on the consequent mallea-
bilizaiion of        the iron, constitute the universal                  acknowledged
principles of bar-iron making.
   From the imperfect dissipation                       of oxygen and          carbon in
                                                         of
the process of malleability, arise the various qualities
malleable iron ; these may be arranged in the following or
der:        I. Hot stiortiron;            2. Cold sliort iron ; and, 3. Iron
partaking of none of these evils ; and                       so far   it may   be deno
minated pure malleable iron.
                                                                                       of

 have been        assigned for this destructive property             in hot short
 iron.     I  am    of opinion, that it arises from the iron contain
ing    a   small     portion of concrete carbon, not extirpated
during the operation of rendering the iron malleable ; and
that in      proportion to the quantity of carbon united, so will
be the shortness or fusibility of the iron : this variety of iron
is always of a dark-coloured unmetallic fracture,
    2. Cold        short iron i3         possessed  of  the property    of with
standing the most violent degree of heat, without exhibiting
the least indication          to     fusion ; it remains firm         under the
heaviest hammer,            and is capable,          while hot, of being beat
into any shape         :  when cold, however, it is brittle, and pos
sessed    of  a   small degree         of tenacity : its fracture is always
clear and large-grained, of a light blueifh colour.                       A small
portion of iron dissolved in the phosphoric acid is now
believed        to constitute          the   cold short     principle   of iron.
Besides the difficulty            of conceiving how         an acid could exist
in the violent and long-continued                   heats  of the refinery,   the
puddling and balling furnaces, wherein the metal is subjected
to motion,        frequently agitated, and extremely divided, how
doe3    it happen, that that iron on which the cold short prin
ciple is impressed, becomes more and more cold short, by a
continued         exposure       to the      combination      of oxygen with
caloric, either excited by blast or the                  attenuated heat of a
wind furnace         ?   This    fact    would imply a generation of the
alternative principle which is indeed the cafe but which
cannot be admitted,             if  the cold stiort quality is attributed to
;he   pholphatuf iron          ;   unless     recourse is had to the supposi
tion  of     a new     combination of this metallic fall during the
operation.
    If highly      oxygenated         crude iron,    of  any manufacture,       is
exposed      to the action         of  a  current of flame,      after  its small
portion of carbon is burnt out, and                    after the  mass has ex
hibited the proper signs of malleability, it will pass into the
state of cold stiort iron ; and this principle w ill exist in pro
portion to the length vf the exposure j or, in other words, in
    Vol. II,                                  M                       proportion

 tendency to quit the caloric to unite with the iron.
     3. Pure malleahle iron derives its stiength, tenacity, mal
leability, and ductility, by being totally deprived of the
 principles which constitute the cold and hot short                qualities
 of iron.     This   is effected in the course     of rendering it mal
 leable, either by the attention of the          workmen, or from the
 proper quality of the crude iron used            :  its fracture is gene
  rally clear, consisting of small regular dark blue grains              ; by
  much hammering            the iron commonly        gains fibre, and         is
 then of    a  light blue colour, uncommonly tenacious when
  cold. The excellence of pure malleable iron is also mani
 fested by the astonishing degree of heat it withstands without
 exhibiting the least sign of fusion, or without              losing   mucb
 of its metallic    parts by oxydation.
     A  line of distinction ought to be drawn betwixt the iron
 produced with wood-charcoal and pit-coal.                 As the    present
 relation of the simple        principles  of the   metal does      not im
 mediately interfere with that distinction,            it will more pro
  perly arrange itself along with the observations on the various
  modes practised       for rendering iron malleable.
      However     variously conducted the modes of operation               are
  at different    works,     and   in different countries, to produce
  malleable iron, yet the principle of operation is the                fame,
  namely,     that by diflipating the carbon and oxygen, con
  tained in the crude iron, bar or malleable iron is the              result-
      Furnaces of     a  multiplicity of sliapes have been erected          for
  this purpose ; but in the most perfect            conducted      processes
   hitherto, it   has been found,       that a heavy     loss   of  metallic
   parts accompanied the manufacture           :  40, 35, to 30 cwt. of
  crude iron have been        used to  fabricate  I  toinif  finished   bars;
  the quantity used always depending upon its aptness                        to
  become      malleable, the slrilfulness      of the workmen,             the
  operation      adopted, and the quality        of  the   malleable iron
  wished to be produced.           These observations      more immedi
  ately relate to the home manufactures            of iron with pit-coal;
                                                                          but

 that crude iron,                    carbo-oxygenated,                    which contains the
 alternative principles                 in   equal        portions,        requires     only to be
 exposed in         a     fluid state to the action of fire, either in                         a    wind
 furnace or small blast.                   By this exposure the carbon becomes
 volatilized,             and       carries off the oxygen along with it».
 Practice           has however confined the operation chiefly to the
 forge        pig (oxygenated            crude iron). This variety of iron
 becomes            sooner          malleable, but    likewise susceptible of
                                                                is
early oxydation, and consequently liable to                                         become cold
short.           Neither can            it    unite to bar iron those properties
from whence are derived great strength and ductility.
¦
         When       carbonated         crude iron          is   used, the waste then            is   apt
to be excessive            :     the metal retains for too                   long     a   period its
fusible principle,               which must necessarily expose the mass to
a    longer continued action            of the flame, whereby oxydation
on the metal              in    a   fluid    state       takes place, and        a     considerable
portion of          it    is   destroyed before the iron exhibit signs                          of in
fusibility.              Malleable iron made from this state of the metal
has       a   great tendency to be red short,                         and loses also consider
ably of its weight under the forge hammer.
     has at all times been asserted, that crude iron contains
     It
a    considerable          proportion of its parts,                   by   weight, inimical to
malleability ;'and that,                     in   the operation            of refining,        it   then

parts with this proportion of mixture, which renders tb*
 remainder malleable.                 A conclusive inference from tbi»
would be, that feme crude irons contain one half, some thre-r
 fourths, and others again an equal portion of mixture for
 iron ; feeinc these are the proportions loft by iron in the
 operation of rendering it malleable.                        The mischief with
 which this fallacious opinion is fraught                      is inconceivable ;
 especially       as  it has been supported           by men who have laid
 claim to scientific and practical abilities                    : the belief of     it
 slackens       the industry      of individuals       to attempt lessening the
 loss   of   real metal ; on the contrary,               workmen are taught to
 look upon a large proportion of it as incapable of being me
 tallized, and as only fit for destruction.
      If manufacturers         of bar iron would more frequently depriv e
  a given weight of the scoria of the refinery and puddling
  furnaces, of its iron, they would be more ableto estimate the
  portion of unmetallic parts contained in their crude iron ;
 upon finding the scoria to contain 30, 40, to 50 per cent of
  iron, equally fit for converting into malleable iron as anv
  part of the original            mass,    their attention would be more
   frequently arrested, and employed                 to devise mean?, either to
  prevent the        escape   of such  a considerable       proportion of iron, or
   to fuse such scoria so as to deprive it           of the  last portion of metal.
       The     relative    proportion by weight of carbon and oxygen
   united to crude iron is small indeed                :  the possible proportion
   in   which they can exist          will   be more easily conceived          by ad
   ducing the weight          of a  specific bulk of each and their analogy.

    Some, however, may contend for the existence of some
metallic substances along with crude iron, which may also
form part of the unmetallic                mass   :  we are however unac
quainted with any capable of enduring the violent heats used
in manufacturing iron, excepting manganese ; and this scmi-
metallic substance is found in bar iron and                      steel, nearly       in
the fame proportion as in crude iron                 :   hence it can form no
 part   of   the Jupposed      heterogeneous        matter      expelled     during
 the process of malleability.
     Steel    is   a  mixture of iron with carbon in an aeriform
 state*.       Carbon is given to iron by heating it violently, un-
 exposed to air, in contact with charcoal dust.                      The propor
 tion in which carbon exists in               steel    is various,       depending
 upon      the     degree    of purity existing         in  the malleable iron
 previous to cementation.                In absorbing this principle it
 gains weight ; and this augmentation                    of weight,     by the ad
 dition of carbon, is dependent             upon the reason already men
 tioned. Some iron, in pasting to the               state  of steel, gains T-'sth
 part of its original weight, while others gain not more than
 TfTth part.
 specific gravity than an equal bulk in a gaseous state, that is combined
 with caloric, instead of be ng combined with the metal. The enormous
 waste of real metal, in converting a given quantity of crude into malle
 able iron,     is generally  so great, that,   at present,    1 merely   wish to c;i!l
 the attention ofartists to the prevention of this waste, insteadof satisfying
 themselves with saying they hadonlya given product, because the crude
 iron employed was of such        a nature  as to be incapable     of yielding  more.
      In the  works   of those who  have treated on iron,     1 have never yet    s«n
  carbon which exists in crude iion, distinguished from that absorbed by
 malleable iron, in the process      of converting into      steel.   I could adduce
  many facts, which to me appear conclusive, to prove that carbon c;isfs
  in crude iron in     a concrete state, separable by mechanical division; and
  that it is united to steel in a gaseous state by the combustion          of its  bate,
  inseparable     in any form by the most minute mechanical           reduction.

  166             On the Principlis of Iron and Steel.
     If malleable iron was entirely freed from                 carbon in the
  manufacturing, the inference would be just, to slate that the
  weight gained was the exact measure of carbon necessary
  to form steel j but as some malleable irons afford a consider
  able portion of carbon, it is evident that the total measure
  of carbon will       depend    upon the pre-existing        quantity       con
  tained in the iron.        The greater     the quantity    introduced        the
  more brittle will the quality of the           steel  be  found, and         the
 less capable     of  preserving   its nature and a solid       form,      when
  exposed to intense degrees        of heat.
    Steel, at certain degrees of heat, possesses all             tbe    sofinefe
  and malleability      of iron  ;  but, when cold, partakes             of   the
 eager brittleness     of crude iron.        When properly hammered,
 it gains   fibre, and    then become? the most elastic state of the
 metal.      It is also capable    of  fusion at a high degree       of heat    :
 it may then      be run liquid into iron moulds,           and   afterwards
 beat out into the most solid shapes,            possessing   cohesion      and
 closeness    of grain, with an astonishing           degree   of flexibility
 and tenacity.       In this state it is called      cast steel, and   is  used
 for fine instruments, where durability,               polish and edge art
 requisite.
    In  so far therefore     as  steel   is capable     of fusion, without
 destroying its nature      ; and    as   it contains iron and carbon
 alone, it must be considered          as a variety of crude iron free of
oxygen, and       so far is partially malleable.         The fusion   of steel
destroys its    property of being       welded.     This change of    nature
is occasioned      by the addition      of oxygen in the      cast steel fur
 nace : hence we find,          that fusion     is incompatible with an
extreme degree of malleability.
    Since a small portion       of oxygen is     added in the fabrication
of  cast steel, the    component parts of this modification of the
metal will be, iron, carbon, and             a small    portion of oxygen.
Admitting then for a moment that the carbon is in the fame
state as  in crude iron,      here    then exists a similarity of prin
ciples  with carbonated iron.           Yet    there    are few but know
                                                                          the

ihe very wide difference              betwixt crude iron and cast            steel
when applied to use.
    This amongst many other                positions,    might be adduced to
prove that carbon exists united in a gaseous state lo iron, and
constitutes     (k-el  ;  or, in other words, that iron to constitute
Itcel must hold in solution a portion of carbon, not less than
-> |-,th   part of its own weight.
    Some of the foreign writers account for the difference be
 twixt (led and crude iron, by affirming that the former is
iron perfeilly reduced, to which carbon is given, and that the
latter is only iron imperfeilly reduced, and which also con
tains carbon.         This      is a feeble distinction.        Iron knows of
no    state  of imperfect         existence     as a metal ; the     particles of
iron in a cruda           state    are equally disposed to become mal
leable, lo soon       as the     carbon which has interposed itself be
twixt them is burnt out.                   The    fame    operation must take
place     before   steel    is brought back to the          state  of malleable
iron j hence, according to the reasoning of the French writ
ers, they arc both imperfect states of the metal.
     Crude iron is only so far imperfect, because it contains
carbon in a material state.                  Steel   may be said to be more
perft:ct,    because     it is united        to carbon in an elastic       stale  ;
and     iron, properly      so called,     is perfect in proportion as it is
void of these impurities.
     Steel also poffefles the sole properly             of acquiring a degree
of   hardness,     when immersed            at certain degrees      of heat into
cold water, which             enables     it  to perforate   and act upon       all
other metallic substances.               This is    occasioned by the sodden
expulsion of the caloric from the interstices. of the metal,
which brings on an in stantaneous aggregation of the particles,
and which        renders       the fracture uncommonly             close and re
gular.       Exposure to a similar degree             of heat, and cooling      in
 the open air, brings         it back   to its usual state, capable     of being
again and again hardened, and not to the                    state   of malleable
iron,     aa a late eflayist on iron has erroneously              stated.

    The following extract of a letter from the Earl of Alta-
 mont to A. B. Lambert, Esq. V. 1'. L. S. read to the Society
Jan. 3, 1 797, contains some further particulars respecting
these animals.
    " There     were formerly in Ireland two kinds of wolf-dogs,
the greyhound and the mastiff.               Till within these two years
 I  was   possessed     of both kinds, perfectly distinct          and easily
 known from each other.                The    heads were not so sharp      in
 the latter as in      the former;      but there seemed      a great   simi
 larity of temper and           disposition, both being harmless and
 indolent.       The painting in your possession is of the mastiff
wolf-dog.         (See Plate V.)
    "  I have at present five wolf-dog3 remainins;, three males
and two females           ;  in   these the    two sorts appeared      to be
  mixed.      The    dam was      of  the mastiff,   the fire,   if I am not
  mistaken, was of the greyhound kind. The fire and dam
 had not dwindled in size from any that I remember here.
 Those which now remain are too young to judge of. We
  have an old man here named Bryan Scahil, now in his                  1

 complete     :  he perfectly       remembers the hunting of wolves

 dogs, which       never   were    in  any number       in the    hands    of
  the common people.          I  conceive also, that these dogs hav
 ing no  nose,   other kinds were necessary to find the game and
 follow the scent of it. Scahil described wolves with such
 perfect   accuracy, that       I  have no doubt     of his being well
 acquainted with the animal."
 XI.     Observations     on Platina, and       its Utility in the     Arts,
    together   ivitb some Remarks on the            Advantages which
    reflecting have over c chromatic Telescopes.             By   Alexis
    Rochon, Diretlor of           the Marine     Observatory      at Brest.
    From /£«   Journal    de Physique,      1798.
                        [Concluded from page 27-]
                          FORGED PLATINA.
 ThE        reader    must   recollect that      all metals      are, easily
 melted after they have been reduced into very                 thin plates.
Thus gold leaf melts at the flame of a taper, though not
 excited by a blow-pipe.            In this manner also philosophers
are enabled to melt those small glass globules which serve
them as simple microscopes.             This observation is sufficient
to indicate the process that must be pursued in the opera
tions in regard      to forged platina.      The platina      is first puri
fied by means     of nitre and fandifer     (fel  de verre)  ; this mine
ral is then divided into very             minute particles, either by
trituration,    or by solution in nitro-muriatic acid or diluted
nitric acid, according to the method of my              colleague    Tillct.
    Nitre, antimony, arsenic, and, in short,             every substance
which becomes volatilized, may            be employed for this opera
tion; but-arsenic ought to be preferred, because it is more
easily dissipated.      The platina being thus divided into ex
ceedingly small particles, must be exposed to a strong sire,
which    must   be excited    still more by the oxygen gas that
                                                                disengages

disengages itself from nitre       in combustion.      In this violent
fire the particles  of  the platina become agglutinated ; and by
forging them at    a  white heat repeated times, the workman is
able to give them sufficient adhesion to stand being hammer
ed into plates.      The well-known       labours of Sickengen on
forged   and    laminated     platina render it unnecessary to fay
any thing     further    on this subject. Me allowed me to see
his process    ; and    to  that favour    1  am indebted for the
knowledge necessary to enable me to treat a difficult subject
absolutely   foreign to my studies.
                           CAST PLATINA.
    Cast platina is infinitely more interesting to the .arts ; and
it is on this labour that      I have bestowed my     chief attention.
The   process which perfectly succeeded with me, to cast              cm.
cibles and large pieces of platina of different forms, was, to
melt the metal according to the method of Schesser, by a
mixture of arsenic and sandifer.        The  fire must be moderate';
and for this reason there must be at least ten pounds            of ar
senic and     four pounds of sandifer        to melt    one   pound of
platina.      The   mass     then will be in      a  state  of perfect
fluidity when poured         into   the mould,    though the      sire be
scarcely sufficient    to fuse silver.   Platina in this slate is ex
ceedingly fragile and brittle; were it exposed to a red heat,
the operation would absolutely miscarry.             The   arsenic,     by
disengaging itself too rapidly, would reduce it to scales,
which would no longer have any adhesion.                It may readily
be conceived, that        this accident must have occurred to me
more than once.        I  have, however, been able to avoid          it by
enclosing the pieces of platina which I had moulded in a
box of plate-iron, filled with sand and pounded charcoal.                I
then exposed them for more than a month to a sire graduated
from the heat      of boiling water      to that   which   fuses silver.
Platina   in this  state   no longer resembles     a metal  :  it might
rather be taken for a metallic calx.             The particles which
                                                             

compose it are very close; but they have only a                       very    feebse
adhesion, like that of an earthen vessel dried in                      the   shade.
It   is then that the platina must be exposed              to    the most vio
lent fire; and when the metal has undergone                    that operation
it   resumes   its natural     state,   becomes       fonorons,        malleable,
and the strongest heat          gives it always new         degrees of im
provement*
    A little time after   I  had read this memoir,          the learned Dr.
Ingenhouz       begged me to unite into a mass                for him        about
two ounces of platina, which              he had carefully          purified by
means of the nitro-muriatic           acid.      I was   obliged to enc/ose
in   a very thin leaf    of platina all    the   fragments of this metal,
which      were too scattered       and too minute         to  be subje&cd
separately    to   the action      of  the    fire    and  of the stamper;
but, when thus united,            I  gave them the         highest degree of
heat possible       to be   produced from charcoal excited by                      a
pair of bellows; and        I  soon obtained, by striking           them with
the stamper,      a  ductile and malleable mass.              After     the   suc
cess    of this experiment,       I  employed       myself in    purifying       in
the fire, and in a crucible,           platina in grains, by means r,f
nitre and fandifer, which must be afterwards washed                       in   the
nitric acid   ; and by striking ata white heat those grains con
tained in the laminae         of platina, I procured at           a   small ex
pense considerable       masses of malleable platina.               This pro
cess   will render    unnecessary     hereafter     the use   of   the oxyd     of
arsenic, unless the workman              wishes      to obtain, by casting*,
large crucibles or muffles of platina.
    I was the first who treated platina in               a  large mass      to   a
manner truly useful to the arts : and though I have paid a
great deal of attention to this labour, assisted by the informs*
tion of the learned Isuuierdo            and the mctallurgic talents of
Daumy junior,         I have   employed my chief care in improv
ing the mixture of platina with tin and the oxyd of arsenic,
for the construction of large specula for telescopes, and, abore
 all, for the specula of sextants and other instruments for                  de
                                                                     termining

tfcrmining the longitude at sea.             In the latter labour I have
been well seconded by Carrochez and other artists who
 worked under my direction.
     Being fully satisfied with the trials, of which I have given
an account in the preceding memoir, I was desirous of con
 structing a telescope like that of Herschel.             For this purpose,
 I  engaged in the year 1790 a friend of the arts and sciences,
 the unfortunate Trudaine            junior, to procure from Herschel
 a good seven-feet telescope.          The superiority ofthe      telescopes
 made by that able astronomer            depends much more than ge
 nerally believed on the Newtonian construction which he has
 adopted.       The Gregorian       telescopes are by no means to be
 compared to the former.              An     appearance    of convenience
  made them however to be commonly                  adopted, though that
  tonstruslion      presents great     difficulties  to be surmounted in
  the complete execution of it.             But as it is always necessary
  in the  use   of telescopes, the magnifying powers of which are
  considerable,     to adapt a magnifier that embraces a wide field»
  in order to find readily       in the heavens the star to be ob
  served, it may easily be perceived            that it is a matter    of in
  difference whether the telescope employed for that purpose
  be of the Gregorian or Newtonian construction ; because in
  that case a direct or lateral view of the object is absolutely
  indifferent.      The  lateral   fight is indeed much more conve
  nient when the Newtonian telescope is well disposed on its
   stand.    Herschel has adopted for hi* telescopes a construc
  tion still more ancient and simple ; and though it approaches
   near to    the origin    of the art, it is no less useful when used
  for large    instruments.      I  have admired the effects         of it in
   his telescope of twenty feet       ; and    I should have been enabled
   to form   a   better judgment         of it in that of forty feet, bift
   there then still remained sonic improvement to be made                   in
   the latter, which      is unique in the annals         of                 It

   is certain that    a small  inclination given to a concave mirror
   of a long focus does not sensibly disfigure the image formed
   in its focus.      This small inclination is sufficient to permit
   the observer to look through          a strong   magnifier attheimaffe
                                                                             of

    of the star, without intercepting, by           the head,   the rays which
    proceed from      it.
        In the beginning of        the year 179T,      Trudaine entrusted to
   me the telescope which he had procured                at London.           Astro
   nomy is indebted to Herfchel for the noblest discoveries                        of
   this century.        The   name     of that   observer  will be transmitted
   to the most distant ages.             He    has augmented       our planetary
   system,      and enriched      it with a new planet,            accompanied
   with    several satellites.     In    167 1,  Dominic Caflini, observing
  the moon with an          excellent telescope of Campani, remarked
   in the    obscure part    of her,    some small whitish      nebulæ.        This
  interesting phenomenon did not escape the telescopes                     of Her
  fchel;      and after the year 1784,            that able astronomer an
  nounced,        that he had     seen a    burning volcano       in the   middle
  of the     spot called    Arijlarcbus.        We find in    the   Memoirs of
  the Academy of Sciences for the year 1706 the following re
  markable passage of De la Hire : "The small spot of Arif-
  tarchus is so brilliant, that some have believed it to be a
  volcano."
      Are    these small whitish nebulæ bodies luminous               of them
  selves, or do they enjoy only a borrowed light                ?   Such    is the
  question which       I  proposed to resolve, by assiduously observing
  these small nebulæ, both           with Herschel's      telescope,  and that
 which      I  caused to be constructed          of platina in the course 0/
 the year 1791, on the model              of that of the above astronomer.
 Being deprived,         since    September 1792, of the use            of   that
 instrument*, the construction of which                  had cost me great

that no one even so much as thinks of realizing it. 'Though the art of

     This     telescope      of   seven feet, which                 I   consider as superior
to thatof Herschei of the                      same length,             enabled       me, during
the time I had the use of                      it,   to be convinced that the spot
Aristarchus,          if   not   a   volcano,        is   at least      a   body luminous of
itself.    The grounds on which                  I      found ray opinion are agree*
able to the principles explained                           by   Bouguer in his Treatise
on the Gradation                  of Light       ;    for those spots of the moon
which          reflect most strongly the direct light                           of the     sun did
not exhibit to me in the shade the same appearances                                        as   Aris-
tarchus, whatever efforts                  I     made         to augment the intensity
of   that feeble light            which         arises from the reflected                   rays of
the earth.            Besides,       it   is   easy to conceive that                 a   very lively
fire, concentrated in the hollow of                             a   crater,      cannot disse
minate the light                 which emanates from                     it :   in that parti-
i.'ular cai'e, like        a   reverberator,            it   cannot be          seen     but under
certain circumstances.                     It    is   remarked          then, that        it    is    in
the months of Pluviose, Ventose and Germinal                                              that this
volcano         is   most apparent.
     When        I   undertook        a   journey to London,                    by   order of Go
vernment, for the benefit                      of the        sciences,   I      employed my
self in    a    particular manner in the improvement of flint glass:
and  I     was       convinced that the propereft and simplest meant
for rendering flint glass fit for constructing large achromatic
telescopes consist in removing the threads by means of                                                a
glass-cutter's wheel. When these faults are removed, the
glass     is   to be     kneaded          in an       oven      and      under       a   muffle, in
such      a   manner       as to give      it    almost the form and size                      of    the
object-glass           required       to be made.               This        process       is    amply
describedin my work entitled Recueil                                     de Memeires           Jur    la

     It   was    in this collection              that   I     said that       Euler had becu
the first who thought of correcting the aberrations of re-

              using substances of different refractive pow

ler's object-glass, with water and glass like that which New
ton had imagined, to render the aberration of sphericity ai
Httle   as   possible ; but this object-glass did not succeed,                           on
account of the proportion since known between the refrac
tion and dispersion of common glass and water.                                This     pro
portion is by the diasporameter                 as    155 to 133         in     regard to
refraction, and       as 100 to 67      in    regard to dispersion.                     But
the strong curvatures which              must be given             to destroy the
aberration of refrangibility            would occasion                a very strong
aberration of sphericity.            Thus, what might be                  gained         on
one hand would be            infallibly lost on the other.                     This     \va»
sufficient to make Euler's project miscarry, and to confirm
the assertion of Newton, which tended to destroy all hope of
being able       to    obtain achromatism in glass.                      Since         that
epoch the first knowledge of the strong dispersion of glass in
the composition of which there is much lead, and which in
England is known under the name of                      Jlint glass,            has been
ascribed to    John Dollond.          This appellation however                        is not
that best suited to         this kind of glass. But what is of                        most
importance       lo be known          here      is,   that   the      more lead,         or

that Dollond presented achromatic glasses, composed of flint
and crown glass.    He fays in his paper printed in the Philo
sophical Transactions, that he found means to destroy with
great ease the aberrations          of refrangibility        ;   but he         confessed
that he was stopped           by   an object more difficult to                   be    sur
mounted, that of annihilating at the same time the aberration
of sphericity.        Itwas thought, and         is   still believed          in Francs,
that John Dollond was the inventor of achromatic                              telescope*:
but we know that, some years after, Dollond's patent was                                at
tacked, on the ground that he was not really the inventor*.

 i lie subject which appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine for October
  1790, and Which, we have been informed by                Mr,    Hamsden,      contaiuj a
 ttue statement     of  the f.ictsi
      " The    inventor was Chester More Hall, Esq. ofMorc Hall, in Essex,
 who about l"Jf),       as  appears by bis papers,          considering the different
 humours of the eye, imagined            they were placed so as to correct the          dif
 ferent rcfrangibility ot light.         He then conceived, that if         he  could find
 substances having such properties           as he supposed these       humours might
 possess, he should be enabled to constiuct an object-glass                    that would
show objects colourless.          After     many    e.\peiiment«,      he had the good
 fortune to find these properties         in two different sorts ofglass;           and by-
forming lenses nude with such glass, and making them disperse the rays
of light in contrary directions, he succeeded. About 1 733 he completed
several     achromatic     object    glasses i though he did not give them that
 name) which bore an aperture            of more  than--'} inches, though         the focal
length did not exceed iO inches ; one of which is now in the possession
of tile Rev. Mr. Smith, of Charlotte-street                  Ratlibone-place. This
glass hai been examined         byseveral gentlemen ofeminence and scientific
abilities,    and found to possess the properties         of the   present achromatic
glasses*
     **
        Mr. Hall   used to employ       woiking opticians to grind his lenses          ; at
the same time        he furn. sited them with the          radii  of the surfaces,      not
only to correct the different refrangibility of rays, but also the aberra
tion arising from the sphnical figures of lenses.                Old Mr. Bass, who at
that time lived in Biidewcll Precinct,           was    one   of these woiking opti
cians, from whom        Mr. Hall's invention       seems to have been obtained.
     "  In the trial at Wcstminstcr-hallabout          thepatent formating achro
matic telescopes,       Mr. Hail     was allowed    to be the    inventor;      but  Loid
Mausrield observed, that        " it   was not the petson who locked up his in
vention     in his scrutoire that ought to profit by a patent for such in
vention, but he who brought it forth for the benefit of the public.''
This,     pei haps, might be said with some degree of justice,               as  Mr. Hall
was a gentleman       of property,      and   did not look to any pecuniary ad
vantage from his discovery          ; and consequently)       it is very probable that
be might not have an intention to make it generally                     known at that
time.
     " That Mr.     Ayscough, optician on Ludgate-hill,              was in possession
of one of Mr. Hall's       achromatic      telescopes    in 1754,    is a fact   which at
this time will not be disputed."

                     of hardening and                      tempering       Steel.
C_jN looking            over the paper                 I    sent for the last Number of
the Philosophical Magazine (see p. 92),                                    I   see    that    I    omitted
mentioning an experiment                          or two connected with the                            sub
ject, which I meant                   to have introduced into                        it.
   As steel is always                 found more compact and strong bodied
when hardened               with       a    low heat,             and as that effect is                    best
obtained the colder the water is which is employed in hard-
ening       it,   provided the water                  is   clean,     a   circumstance which
sliould always be attended                        to,|it appeared               probable,           that     if
water was cooled down to the freezing point, or even                                                lower,
which       it    may be, and retain                  its fluidity,        by    being kept            in    a
state   of    perfect        rest,         the effect might                be     heightened.               I
caused  large heap of snow to be collected together                                                    at
            a                                                                                                a
time when the thermometer stood at 22° of Fahrenheit,                                                     and
making       a     deep hollaw in the middle,                         I        seta glass of clean
water in the bottom                    of   the hollow,               and covered            the whole
with    a   board to prevent the air from disturbing                                         or    causing
any motion           in     the water.            I    heated some pieces                    of    steel    in
the breech end              of   a    gun barrel to               a   low red heat;                and      by
means       of    an assistant             to take ofl' the            board at the instant                '
arrived with the heated barrel and its contents,                                           I      quickly
                                                                                                            a'l
dropped       the    piece-; into the water                   ;    which having                   stood
the preceding night                   in   the situation above described,                           must,
though still fluid, liavc been cooled                                  down to the                 tempe
rature of the surrounding snow, which was still found                                                to     be
32°.    Upon taking                   them out,        I     found the pieces hard                     but
brittle, having the appearance                         of     steel       that had been             over
heated.
  Being disappointed                   in    what  I        had expected,         I        intended        to
repeat the experiment with                        a   still lower heat           ;    but an       altera
tion in the         state    of      the    air   prevented            me from prosecuting
                                                                                                           in
the experiment at that time,                           and having since succeeded
                                                                                                  making

making     use   of quicksilver instead of water, I have never re
sumed the     experiment.         As methods are now well known
by which       water may       be cooled       below the freezing point,
even   by the fire-side, and            at an     easy expense,       one  who
has time mav        perhaps think the experiment worth repeat
ing  : it might     cast   some light upon the subject            of hardening
steel, and lead to some useful results.
    The  dish   I employ for tempering is very simple (A fig. 3,
Plate IV.) and may be of any size, with a proportioned
handle.      It is made of plate-iron, with an edge turned up
on every    side a   sufficient height to hold tallow or oil enough
to cover the piece? to be tempered.                 The   corners    are nipped
together, and then folded up against the fides, as represented
in the figure ; by which means they are prevented from let
ting out the oil.
    The other pan or        dish B, turned       up on three sides only, is
used to   lay pieces intended to be hardened                  :  a cover is    of
advantage      where     the pieces are intended to come out clean
and bright,      as it more     perfectly defends them from the air,
and of course prevents         oxidation from taking place.             By this
instrument the work,           though ever        so small   or slender,    may
be brought out        of   the sire    and dropped      into the water wish
very little   loss of heat.        It ought to be made ot stronger
plate  iron   than   is  necessary     for the other pan, and the cor
ners cut out      so   that the     sides   may bend        up    more   square.
They    need not be folded as in the other, not being intended
 to hold any liquid substance.               Such articles      as small  drills,
 pendulum and other small springs need not be dropped into
water, but only made to          pass    througk the air by tossing them
out and letting them fall to the ground,                   which will make
them hard enough for most purposes.
    Small drills may be hardened by holding their points in the
 flame  of a candle,     and, when sufficiently hot, suddenly pluck
 ing them oat:           the- air will harden them;             and they may
 then be tempered,          by taking     a little of the tallow upon their
 point, and then         passing them         through'   the flame at about
                                        N   %                               half

 lSo                          On the Floating Bricks
 half   an inch above the point,               and      holding them there             till
 the tallow begins to smoke.                   This method, known to all
 watchmakers,          may be        of  use to   other artists,        and therefore
 not unworthy of the notice I have taken of it.
 XlII.    Account of         M. Fabbroni's               Discovery       of a ^Ietboc
            to imitate the floating Bricks               of the Ancients'.
 1    LINY       mentions two cities in                    Spain,      Massilua       and
 Calento, in which               a  kind of bricks were made that would
 float in water.          It   is certain    that Pliny does not here              speak
 of hollow bricks        ;    for  these  would have had too little strength
 for building.         lie     must then mean             solid bricks,      but com
 posed    of  a substance        sufficiently porous and light to float in.
 water.      These bricks, according                 to I'osidonius,       were made
 of a kind of argillaceous earth, which                   was employed        to clean
 silver plate.       As this       earth could not be our tripoli,            which is
much       too heavy to float in             water,      M. Fabbroni thought
 that it might be that earth called commonly lac lun, fossil
 meal, mineral agaric, aud guhr                   :   this earth is abundant in
Tuscany, and is there actually employed for cleaning plate.
     Guhr is liquid, and the lac lun<e approaches near lo the
 mineral and calcareous agaric.                   The      fossil  meal, according
to    M. Fabbroni,         is a mixt       earth which exhales             an argilla
ceous odour, and             throws out        a  light whitish smoke when
sprinkled with water.                It does not effervesce with acids              ;  is
infusible in the fire, in which it loses an eighth part of its
weight, though it becomes scarcely diminished in bulk                             ; and
according to the analysis made by                     M. Fabbroni,          consists   of
the following component                  parts  :   siliceous      earth 55,      mag-

                          of the Ancients.                               l8l
nefia 15,   water 14, argil 12,      lime 3, iron         1.   With this
earth, which is found near Casieldelpiano in the territories
of Sienna, M. Fabbroni     composed bricks which, either baked
or unbaked, floated in water.          The    baked were in nothing
different from the unbaked, but in               the sonorous       quality
which they acquired.       These bricks refill         water excedingly
well, and unite perfectly    with lime     :   they     are subject to no
alteration either by heat or cold ; and about            a  twentieth part
of argil   may    be added with advantage            lo their composi
tion,   without    depriving them os the property of floating.
 M. Fabbroni     tried their resistance,      and found it very        little
inferior to that of common bricks        ;   but it is much greater in
proportion to their lightness. One of these bricks, seven
inches in length, four and a half in breadth, and one inch
eight lines in thickness, weighed only 14$ ounces; whereas
a common brick, weighed live pounds 6$ ounces.
   Fosiil meal is abundant in Tuscany.           The method of mak
ing  these bricks differs little from that      of common bricks             :
one man may       make about a hundred            of    them     in a day.
They may be of very important benefit               in the construction
of reverberating furnaces;       as they are such bad conductors
of heat,   that  a  person may bring one           half of     them   to    a
red heat,  while the other is held       in the hand.           They may
be   employed also for      buildings that require to be light;
for constructing      cooking   places     on board stiips ; and also
floating batteries, the parapets of which, it made of these
bricks, would be proof against red hot bullets ; and lastly,
for constructing     powder magazines.             The     turrets which
were raised on the ships     of the ancients, adds           M. Fabbroni,
were perhaps    formed of such bricks        ; aud perhaps they were
employed in the celebrated        ship  sent by      Iliero   to Ptolemy,
and which carried so many buildings, consisting               of porticoes,
baths, halls, &c. ornamented            with     jasper and agates ar

x ROM          the   researches     of   chemists   respecting     the matter
of heat,       the different states       in which it    is found,     and the
various ways in which             it affects   bodies, it is well        known
that charcoal is one of the weakest conductors                   of it.     This
observation       has given     rife   to the idea     of forming      furnaces
with    a  double wall, in order that the intermediate space mav
 be filled with charcoal ; and lately a very happy application
has been made           of this property to      vessels  destined   for form
ing    and preserving       warm infusions *.
    I,  however, do not know that any one has endeavoured                       to
fix, at    least   by comparative experiments, the limits of this
kind of insulation         f. They have       remained     so vague     that the
ablest chemists        have not thought proper to pay any attention
to them in judging of the result of their operations                       ; and
thus the celebrated          Klaproth,     in a series   of experiments        on
the alteration which stones experience                in the strongest       sire,
seems to think that the heat was almost equal for those con
tained in crucibles           of porcelain       and   those enclosed on all
fides    by charcoal.         It is in      a crucible     of charcoal       that
chemists       attempt the reduction of the oxyds of tungsten,
titanium and uranium, though it is well known that what
is fought is a degree of heat sufficient for their fusion, and
that every means possible are sought for, in other respects, to
 expose them to a greater heat.
    These reflections induced me to think that it might                     be of
 some     importance to give         a  more exact      standard   of   this iu
     It has been also               and certainly would be found to aniww
                          proposed,
in practice,    to surround bodits, intended     to be kept cool, with charcoal
 ice-houses above giound for instance.            Edit.

  sulating effect of charcoal.            The experiments which I made
  on this subject are as follows :  Having taken from the fame
  box,    two of Wcdgcwood's                pyrometrical      pieces     perfectly
  similar,    I   put one,        which     I (hall call  A, into      a crucible
 filled with pure          siliceous    sand,   well dried.      The crucible
 was eight decimetres               in   height, and      six   decimetres in
 diameter at the top.             The    pieee  of  clay was placed in the
  middle, and        the   cover was luted on.          The other         piece    B
 was placed in        a covered      crucible of the like size, but silled
 with charcoal         dust     which     had been previously exposed to
  a   red heat.       The two crucibles were placed close to each
 other on the       grate of a large fusing furnace, and exposed to
 the action of the heat for about three quarters of an hour.
 When      the crucibles had cooled, the piece              A  was taken from
 the    sand, and applied to Wedgewood's                 pyrometrical scale         :
 it had experienced         a  contraction of 89 degrees.             The piece
 B, when        taken    from the charcoal, stood at 60-25 degrees.
 It    had assumed a grayish          tint,   but without any appearance
 of incrustation.         It    thence    results that the transmission           of
 heat though          and is to that of heat through charcoal                     as
3 to a *.
     The more       tne difference was striking, the more              it was   ne
 cessary for      me to employ precautions,              that I might not be
 deceived by foreign circumstances.                 It  was possible that the

                                      accuracy usually displayed by     Guy tow.
 It leads to a conclusion, that the result would have been the same had
the piece* been con'inued in the furnace for three hours,           three days, or
three    weeks,   instead    of  nbout three quarters   of an hour, which      is an
unwarrantable inference.          This experiment only      proves,   and that is a
matter of some consequence,         what might lave been fairly inferred from
the known properties oschitrcoal, that to        brin; bodies surrounded wish
that substance to the same degree        of heat with  others surrounded with
better conductors, a longer time must 6c employed.            The not attending
to this circumstance it the cause why chemists, able ones too, often fad
in difHcult reductions      where charcoal is necessarily     put round the ore
to take up the oxygen.         Fbit.

pyrometrical piece might have some fault either in its com
position or fabrication, which might change its disposition
to contact equally and proportionably to the                    heat.     To     ob
viate these doubts, the two pieces                A   and B were shut up in
one crucible filled      with    sand   ;  so  that they were distant from
each other only about seven or eight                   millimetres,       and     the
crucible was exposed for half an hour to the most violent heat
of   a three-blast wind furnace.               When      the  crucible     cooled,
it  was    found     so   much vitrified that there              was    a    fissure
in one of        its fides ; but       the sand had not been deranged
within it.
    The piece A       applied to the        pyrometrical scale gave 1635
degrees;     it weighed no more than 1*491 grammes; and its
specific gravity was 2"232.
    The  piece   B   gave by the pyrometer 160 degrees ;               it  weigh
 ed 1*53 grammes;            audits       specific gravity was 2 '346.              It
 had loft almost entirely the gray tint it had assumed                      in the
 charcoal, and        distinguished itself only by a black vitreous
 point,   produced        visibly by the accession of some foreign
 matter.
    I  did not expect,         I  confess, so complete a success in this
 process.     The      small     difference     of    3   degrees    is nothing
 when we consider that the piece first shut up in the charcoal,
 and which       stood at 60,        was.ilill    susceptible   of being       con
 tracted a hundred degrees more.                  It  is known, besides, that
 it is physically impossible          that two bodies placed in the fame
 crucible, in contact with the fame matter, should be                      exactly
 in   the same condition to receive              the heat,     especially when
 the wind is conducted in three                   directions necessarily        un
 equal.     A   proof of this is furnished us by the vitrified               fusion
 being more advanced on one of the                  sides  of the crucible*.

 heat would not have removed it.           Edit.

  We may           therefore        conclude          from these experiments*,
that at the       fame heat a body                 enclosed     in charcoal does not
receive      but about two- thirds of ihc               heat    of    a   body surrounded
by quartzeous sand            ;    that the reduction           of metal?, which                 do
not melt but        at a heat        of     130 degrees, cannot be effected in
charcoal      ;   that pyrometrical                 pieces    do not enable                 us    to
judge with correctness of the heat communicated, but in
 so far as they are in contact with substances similar to those
which        surround      the bodies subjected to                it,      or with bodies
equally conductors           ;      lastly,        that with these alterations we
may make an advantageous                       use    of this instrument.

 the library and manuscripts of                      Micheli, his tutor, who died
 in   1737, with an intention                  of publi filing        a    complete collec

corn, threw them            into water, and         saw that    the particles
which contained germs fell to the bottom.                    He   sowed these
particles, and obtained             as   good   plants  as  from the whole
grains,       many of them even produced               a greater number       of
stalks.      According       to Fabbroni's        experiments, the         germ
consist* entirely of the gelatinous or animal part,                  called by
some     the gluten       or colla.        In his opinion,       the   fermen
tation necessary in the manufacturing of starch, is for the
purpose of bringing the animal part to a state of corruption,
that it may be then separated with the greater case.                     Hence
arises    the   unsupportable         and    certainly unhealthful       stench
which       proceeds     from      a   starch   manufactory.         He aSui
therefore,     if it  be not possible to separate she gelatinous part
of  the feeds by mechanical means,                without     using   water as
he did, by which the            labour would       be accelerated       and the
stench in part prevented.              The   separated part might then be
ground,       and    employed wilh gthcr meal for baking bread.
The germ, in         regard to weight, forms only the sixth part              of
the grain.        Dr. Molinelli       shows,    by experiments, that it is
better     to warm      olives in the fun,       than to suffer them,        ac
cording to the old           method,       to ferment.     Olives which       in
 1789 had been frost-bitten,             yielded, however, by the above
method, good oil.

  the latter be thrown into the water, it moves                    itself for     some

     Professor     Schumacher at Copenhagen made experiments
with tractors of         brass and iron on ten patients in Frederick's
hospital     at Copenhagen.         He   tried also tractors       of ebony     and
ivory,     which      are said to have        cured     a  pain in the knee         ;
with     others    of  silver and zinc   ;  and some      of copper     and lead.
By the two last, pains in the knee, arm, and face are                      said to
have been mitigated.             According        to   M. Klingberg's       expe
riments, this remedy was of             use   in malum ifcbiatlcum          ;   and
                                                                       according

 according to those of        M.    Stessens, in tnalum isebiaticum           and
  megrim.       According      to M. Bang, the pains in sonic cases
  were increased, and inothers allayed. According                toM. Blech,
 the tractors were      of  use  in bemicrania      and gouty pains in the
  head ; and, according to           M. Hahn, in rheumatic pains in
 both shoulders.         The principal document in this collection
 appears to be a       letter of professor Ahilgaard, in whose opi
 nion Perkins's tractors will never acquire much value in me
dicine,     aud scarcely even have the           merit of being       a   pallia
 tive  ;  but, in  a  physical point of view,        be thinks they deserve
  the attention os physicians, and particularly              of physiologists.
 Mankind,       he fays, hitherto have paid too little attention to
 the influence which          electricity has on the human body;
otherwise thev        would know that the effects produced                   on it
 bv our beds is no matter          of indifference.      If the feather beds
 and hair mattresses,         &c.   are r*rfectly     dry, the person who
 sleeps on them is       in  an insulated     state ;  but the contrary is
 the cafe    if they arc moist.        He   three times removed a pain
 in the knee, by sticking the tractors, one on each fide of the
 knee, so deep through the stockings that the points touched
 the (kin.      He removed      a  rheumatic pain in the head from               a
 lady by the fame          means.      M. Kasn,       by   the tractors, re
lieved, in others, gouty pains          of the head, and megrim            ;  and
 in himself,     a rheumatic pain of the back, which, according
o  his sensations,      was like   a constriction in thecellular tissue.
 M. Hcrholdt, from         his experiments, considers the effect          of the
tractors    as  indefinite and relative      as   thai of other remedies.
He, however, saw relief given bv them in the                     strangury     in
a case of syphilis. M. Bang also, at Soroc, freed                a  man from
.1  violent gouty pain in the thigh by drawing                    the tractors
200     times    over   the   affected   part.     \f.   Jacobfcn      likewise
found benefit derived from these tractors several times in the
common hospital at Copenhagen.                  M. Todc      tried them also
in rheumatic pains, tooth-ache,              inflammation of the eves,
and observed that they neither did good nor harm.

     This edition, which      has been anxiously looked for by the
 medical world for some time, made               its    appearance   a feu-
 days ago.       It contains many interesting        recent communica
 tions respecting the Diabetes, and the additional trials of the
 new remedies in the Lues.          The observations introduced in
 the first edition on several       diseases   apparently arising from
 stomach     affection, and including the application of the new
 doctrines of chemistry,      as well  as  the deO"r

    reduce the size, and consequently the price.                   They     are still,
    however,     as  the    Preface   informs us,        to   be considered          a
    equally interesting, and will continue to be prosecuted.
       The   experiments      of Mr. Cruicksliank,-an               accurate      and
   ingenious chemist, on the difference                 between       the sugar of
   milk    and that   of diabetic urine,      and on urine and sugar, art
   highly interesting. While they in some measure unfold the
   peculiar nature of each, they also assist in the general expla
   nation of diabetes,        as   well as what relates to the urine of
   patients   labouring under other diseases.
       The  results  of  the trials with the new remedies              in the    Iucj
  venerea (which        have been substituted          for mercury,         and    are
   believed    to operate     by introducing oxygen into the                system)
  completely establish         their efficacy in the secondary as well
  as   in the   primary     states   of  the   disease.      The oxygenated
  remedies have          also    been   found     efficacious in hepaiic
  affections, (one of them attended with dropsy,) and in some
  cases   of remittent fever, the character of which was such a
  would otherwise have demanded the exhibition os calomel.
      It will not   be easy for the opposers         of   the new medicine*
 to get over       the   mass     of evidence     brought forward in this              .
 work in their favour.              To   us   there     does not appear anv
 way     of trying    the power      of  these    medicines       so fairly   as in
 a   military hospital, where the patients cannot                  deceive those
 who prescribe        for them, but are forced,               if   necessary,     to
 comply with the directions given them.                     To    fid   cut a pa
 tient here and       there    from among         a    number of out-door
patients, who, let the faculty prescribe what they please, will
only do what they themselves               like ;   and    to    bring    forward
cafes that have failed,         under such circumstances,                in being
cured by the oxygenated             medicines,      is  of all   modes     of pro
ceeding the most uncandid, and must tend even to                          impress
the public with an idea that a failure is wijbedfor,                       merely
to defend a system.

disease   cures      itself.   Our opponents may take which side
they choose; for, on either supposition,                mercury must be

     These two interesting publications having avowedly the
 fame humane and beneficial object in view, namely, the
 rooting out of        a disease which has swept away an immensely
 greater number          of victims from the world       than the amount
 of all that    have been destroyed by the plague or pestilence,
 there can be no impropriety in joining them together in this
 short notice ; for, short it must be,         as all we can aim at, or
 hope for, is to excite the curiosity of such of our readers
  as have not seen them, that they             may examine the facts
  brought forward, and by this means be led to yield their in
  dividual assistance iu the prosecution of an object of            so much
  importance.
      Opinions are not agreed as to the origin of this disease in
  cows ; some supposing that they get it by infection from
  men milking them, who have                 been    previously    applying
  dressings    to the heels of horses affected with the grease;
  while others, with more probability, consider it as b<;itig in
  the first instance compounded in the animal economy of the
  cow; alter which,           it may  be conveyed      to any number       (in
  au obvious way by the hands of the milkers,                  as the feat  of
   the disease is in the breast and tcjt>, which are covered with
  eruptions similar to the small-pox).            Jiut   its origin is  of  no
  importance  its application
                   :                      to the benefit     of mankind      is
   what demands the greatest attention.

     It      is a singular fact,       that    it   has been      long    known         by
country farmers and others, that this disease,                        which in          se
veral         counties prevails at particular               seasons      among         the
cows, and is of ca communicated to the hands                          of the     milk
ers,      exempts       such   as   have      been so infected           from being
infected with the          small-pox.  It          is still more singular, that
though they knew this fact, and also that no cow                  or human
being had ever            been known to die            of the cow pox, they
never thought of having recourse to                   a   voluntary infection of
this kind,         to free themselves and families from                  the   possibi
lity of being          infected     with the variolous poison, which                     so
often proves mortal even when given by inoculation.
     These       publications contain a great body of evidence,                         all
tending to prove          that persons who have undergone the                      spe
cific fever and local disease occasioned by the cow-pox, com
municated either by accident to the hands when                                 milking
them, or by inoculation (for this has been already tried by
the ingenious authors), are thereby rendered unsusceptible of
the small-pox j and that matter from such                      patients may            be
employed           with the like effects, no difference
                                                being observ
able in the effects of the matter generated successively in the
first, second, third, fourth, or fifth human creature.
     Pits from the fmall-pox are         deformity that no one can
                                               a
certainly          guard against even by inoculation.  In the cow
pox no such consequences                take place ; for, though accom
panied with fever, the pustules arc local, and the place may
be chosen.
     According                        (but this is not quite
                       to some observations,
certain,) the fame person may repeatedly have the cow-pox.
If     so,   practitioners may avail themselves                of this     mean        of
exciting an innocent fever as              a   remedy     of various     disorders;
it   being     a   truth, that fevers are occasionally efficacious              reme

  posure   to the small-pox        infection is unavoidable, and the
 consequence      of infection      at the time dangerous (as in preg
  nancy),    inoculation with the former might, by its quicker
  action, produce that change in the system which would in
 sure the least deadly      of the two      maladies.
     To urge to such inquiries as may afford a sufficient num
 ber of facts, from which to draw all the uses that may be
 derived from a prosecution of this subject, seems to be the aim
 of the authors ; and no sagacity is required to perdict, fays
 Dr. Pearson, that, should the practice of inoculating for the
 cow-pox      ever become very        general      amongst young persons
 (which     we   hope   will  be the cafe), the variolous             infection
 must be extinguished ; and,           of  consequence,       that loathsome
 and destructive      disease, the small-pox,            be known only        by
 name.      And this    benefit   will accrue, without           even the allay
of the introduction of a       new disease     ;  it being plain, from the
nature of the cow-pox           poison, that        (the other being once
 rooted   out) it will be easy to avoid and prevent its dissemi
 nation  as    there must be at least a real contact with it to
 cause infection.

  In   the   month of December of the                 last year,       Dr. Schroler
of Lilicuthal     transmitted        to the Royal Society at Gottingen
several   astronomical observations,                the       most     important of
which were the following             :
  Dr. Schroter        observed at different times,                    and     with the
greatest certainty,    in   Jupiter's four        satellites, even in both ths
                                      O   3                                   smallest,

smallest, the first and the seuod, dark spots               of an atmospheric
nature, transitory and subjected to                 accidental changes. The**
howerer fully convinced him, that all these satellites each
during the time         of its   synod ical revolution revolves              around its
own axis    : the cafe is the fame             with the satellites       of Saturn-
The         of the latter cannot indeed be sera like those of the
        spots
satellites of Jupiter; but in all the five, particularly the first,
second, third and fifth, Dr. S. saw similar and very di£iccr
variations of light, at a considerable      number of periods,
which give him reason to suppose the existence of spots of
the like kind. They are not regular, as in the cafe of our
moon, but accidental variable modifications                           ; sometimes
subject to irregular changes, which, however, by their usual,
often very long,          periodical duration,          mark out certain re
gions Exposed to common atmospheric modifications, similar,
for example, to the tract of the monsoons on our earth.
The     most important result,          however, is, that Saturn's satel
lites revolve round their axes during the time of                      a     fynodical
revolution ; a circumstance which                   M. Lichtenberg             conjec
tures in respect to all the            secondary      planets.       Observations
tending to confirm this supposition will be published by Dr.
Schroter in the second and third part of his Collections
towards     the newest astronomical discoveries.

   Professor      Wcideman          at Brunswick           transmitted        lately    to
the Royal Academy                of Sciences    a paper on       the more exqui
site sensibility    of certain       parts of animals,          from which             the
following       is an extract in the author's own words                  :
   "  Many animals have a most exquisite sensibility at the
 tipof the muzzle, and particularly those which have these
parts lonr.  This delicate sensibility                is
                                        principally produced
by  the end of the rurvut infraorbUalu, in conjunction with
some fibres        of   the      optical nerves,       especially     the middle
branches, which run across the majjsettr in an oblique direc
tion.    The     nervus infraor bitalls        is   strongest   in   those animals

which      have        long muzzles,              or muzzles covered with long
whiskers.          The muzzles of animals                     are moved in particular
by   three delicate              muscles ; and, besides these, several folds
of the     cutaneous         muscle         lie at the      side    of    the   snout,    and
the branches of the optic                       nerves      proceed       in particular to
these      muscles.              I    however     found in          a    hedge-hog some
fibres     of    the      optic nerve proceed to the root sbulbusj of a
bristle.        For    the most part, however, these roots                      of   the long
whiskers are connected with the numerous and proportion-
ably strong branches of the turvus infraorbilalis, which pro
ceed to them in the form of a bundle, and in general trans
mit two          fibres     to       the root    of   each bristle,       which they em-
brace on both sides.                     This    appearance         I found exceedingly
pretty in the head of                   a   hire newly killed.             In animals not
provided with             these       whiskers, the nerve proceeds only to the
glandulous skiivof the nose, and which may be very distinctly
observed in swine.     The whiskers serve as the vehicle of a
finer sensation, in order to forewarn animals in certain
circumstances of the near approach of danger; for the flighted
touching of the summits of these bristles excites in them a
 very strong sensation.                     Cats, and other animals which hunt
 for their prey in the night-time,                            extend       the skin      of    the
 whiskers, which enables them to ascertain the nature,                                        and
 even      the    hardness            or softness,       of   the       bodies which          they
 approach."

  cated to them a green colour.        The  slag also acquired the same
' when     the latter was fused with       charcoal powder, pounded
  glass, borax, or its acid. As it dissolved, however, so easily in
  fluxing salts, he found it difficult to fuse it by this method
  to a metallic button, till it was first precipitated            by zinc
  from the fluid flag       ;  and it then gave a button     of  a leaden
  gray colour, which, when melted with borax, communi
  cated to it a green colour.            These characters sufficiently
   distinguish it from molybdena, which Bindheim supposed
                                                                         it

   assumes the properties      of an acid, and with the last, that when
  burnt on charcoal by the blowpipe it emits            a like smell.
      The other     series   of experiments    were   made with the so-
   called aurum problematicum, from which, after              it had been
   well mixed with finely-pounded grains of quartz, the metal
   was extracted by frequent boiling in nitro-muriatic acid, and
   then precipitated     by potash.     The  deposit being boiled     with
   caustic ley,   what the latter dissolved was again precipitated
   by an acid.      What      was then obtained melted very easily by
   the blowpipe upon charcoal, without any remarkable smell,
   but surrounded with a beautiful blue and green flame, into
   an almost t'm-white, hard, very brittle button, the whole
   surface   of which      had a granulated appearance ; and when
   longer exposed to ihe heat it dissipated in flame and smoke.
    It did not dissolve entirely in pure nitric acid, but in the
   nitro-muriatic.      What     was precipitated from both exhibited
   the fame phenomena by the blowpipe            as the  former metallic
   button.     It is not precipitated      by zinc and iron only,      but
   also by copper.       From     these properties it appears to differ
   from all the metals         hitherto known.       Professor   Klaprolh
   has given it the name        of Tellurium.

    The experiment of the reduction of lead by sulphur                  hav
ing    been announced by          Wiegleb, a German chemist, as
 favourable to    Stahl's theory of phlogiston, Citizen Guyton
 showed     that this experiment is not conclusive,           if   an appa
ratus be used that permits the operator to keep an account
of all the aeriform fluids.          The    fame chemist     made experi
 ments on the nature           of the succinic acid    and the products
from its decomposition. From his experiments he is inclined
 to astlgn to that fossil a vegetable origin,         which agrees with
the observations        of mineralogists. Citizen Guyton also
hud before     the class the products of his experiments on uri
nary concretions,         which,     as Scheele   announced, manifest
the presence of a peculiar acid formed in            these   concretions.

    The fame chemist showed that the difference between the
acetous     and the acetic        acid consists in the proportions of
carbon, which is the radical         ; and that the acetous      acid con
 tains much more than the acetic.

     For   a long time naturalists       have been sensible      of the      ne
  cessity  of having     a new    method of classing birds; and they
  wished that this method, by being suited, on account of its
  precision, to the great quantity of known                 species,    should
  render the characters       of  them easy to be distinguished,             and
  be    at  the same time applicable to other species not                     yet
  discovered.      This     has been      executed    by    Cit.  Lacepede.

  opinion,     naturalists ought to      compose methodical tablet of

      Analysts divide the problems which they wifli to resolve
   into two classes, one of which includes those which can

   quantity combined, throughout             all the arithmetical      opera

tions,    with itself, and with the known quantities                  : these   are
called determinate         problems.        The indeterminate          are those,
the solutions      of which   depends on an equation where there are
found two or more unknown quantities, susceptible                           os all
the values        which the analyst may assign               to them,      so  that
the unknown quantities               remain indeterminate,             at least  in
certain     limits.       The   processes     are    very   different   in    these
two sorts     of problems,       and hence arise two kinds           of analysis.
Among        those    questions which cannot be solved but by the
indeterminate         analysis,     are some respecting          the nature       of
numbers;         questions   of   a   delicate nature and difficult to be
treated,     which       require intense        thought and exceedingly
delicate    and     varied   resources of mind, but which, at the
fame time,         excite the curiosity        more, and        become        more
engaging.          Cit. Legendre published, in the Transactions of
tKe Academy of Sciences for J 785, a memoir upon this
subject.        In the last quarter he has made public new
results respecting        his further researches in this branch of the
analytic art,        under     the    title of Essai sur la Tbeorie dts
 Nombres.         This modest title promises much less than the
work affords.          It is a complete      treatise  of every thing known
on the theory        of numbers, or        even  of indeterminate       analysis.
But    these   theories would be much             less useful   if they wanted
the demonstrations and new theorems                       discovered      by Cit.
Legendre.
    A new work on determinate                   analysis    engages,     at    this
moment, also the attention of analysts.                    Cit. Lagrange        has
published       a  work on the resolution of numerical equation*.
He    gives   th'13  name to equations         where, with the unknown
quantity, there          are only numbers which               retain their nu
merical value.         In the  last analysis every      determined problem
may      be reduced to expressions           of this kind.       It  is of   great
importance,         therefore,     to have methods        given for resolving
 them ; and we might            even be inclined          to   believe    that it
would be sufficient for mathematicians to consine themselves
to   researches for discovering these methods.                     But   geome
                                                                           trician

  be gone through but fimple arithmetical operations to de
  termine the unknown part of an equation, whatever may be
  the abfolute values of the known quantities which enter into
  its composition.       Hitherto   we had none      of  thefe formulae
  beyond the fourth degree.          It was neceffary then to recur
  to means for refolving individually numerical equations,
  and to bring out, one by one,          the values   of  the unknown
  quantity.     Newton gave a method for this purpofe ; butit is
  only approximative, even when there exift exa& values of
  what is fought for, and in certain cafes it gives nothing.
     In 1767 Cit. Lagrange, whofe name is here naturally
  coupled with that of the Englifh geometer, gave a new
 method, exempt from the inconveniences of that of Newton.
 Analyfis    was then  in  a more advanced (late, and the author
 took advantage of thofe degrees of perfection which he had
 himfclf given    to the   analytic art.     The queftion then is to
 keep the number fought between            two determined     fractions,
 which go on decreafing, one          of which is     greater    and the
 other lets than that number,          however fmall the fractions
 may be    ; and   thus,   by exhaufting      a fractional difference,
 we arrive at exaft values     of  the unknown quantity,         if there
 are any poffible, or at lean we approach fufHciently near             it.
 Thefe firft refearches   of Cit. Lagrange     are but a fmall part    of
the volume juft published.           Thofe     which   form     this laft
 work will add a new degree         to the efteem and gratitude        to
which     he   has  been   long entitled by his numerous and
learned labours.

 thefe phenomena with great care,                   becaufe they can deduce
 from them, with Efficient precifion,                   the errors in the lunar
 tables.       The    Connoijfance       des Temps,       An. VI. announced
 an occultation of Mars vifible at Paris.                     The diftance        be
 tween Montauban and Paris                    was   fufficiently great       for the
 Moon       to appear    in   the latter a little higher than          Mars, and
 confequently         not to produce an occultation                of the .latter.
 This obfervation gave Cit. Due an opportunity of examining
  with attention the difk of Mars; and he obferved, in the
 auftral part, a fpot of a very fenfible diameter, round and
 white,      a colour very apparent on a planet the appearance
 of which is        redciifh.     According to fome other obfervatioas
 which he        made afterwards, Cit. Due efiimates that this fpot

     A   paper was read in the fitting            of Meffidor      75,    in which
 Cit. Delambre             gave     an    account of the operations for
 meafuring the firft bafe from              Melun     to Lieufaint,      extending
 in length        11808*5      metres.      A   fecond     bafe   has   juft   been
 meafured         on the high       road from       Perpignan to Narbonne.
The length was found               to be   ii7oa-6      metres.      Ilarely have
 bafes of fuch a length            been meafured, and ftill          more rarely
has it been found poffible to place them on ground fo fmooth
 and fo level.          But however regular             the    roads chofen for
thefe operations may have been, there occurred                          in them     a
 bending        almoft      imperceptible        to   the   fight, and        which
 rendered      it neceffary to break the two bafes.               In   tfyis man
ner,     inftead     of meafuring      a  ftraight line for each bafe,           two
were       meafured,       forming     an angle       of   8o°   of  the ancient
divifion.        The    excefs    of  the    broken line over the ftraight
line to Melun did not exceed 27 centimetres, and not more
than 6 at Perpignan.               The new     bafe was meafured with the
fame rules        of platina which       ferved at    Melun. The difficulty

ment till the 19th of Tbermidor.                   It wasbo'xever finished
on the first complementary day. The weather was, art.
 times,  so    tempestuous,         that it rendered       the observation*
more tedious.        One day, in particular, it blowed with such
violence that it displaced the' roles aud carried them away,
together with their supporters, notwithstanding their weight
and a considerable           friction.    The     observers    continued      to
struggle against this obstacle,           but at length were obliged to
yield, and even to begin again during calmer weather the
labours of that day, which amounted to 240 metres.                            At
length the labour being repeated, with every possible care,
and under the most favourable circumstances, the first:
measurement        was     found to be correct within a millimetre
of 240 metres.        This astonishing conformity              may    serve   to
give an idea os the precision which may be hoped for                      from
rules, when employed under favourable circumstances.                         At
the moment when           C. Delambre wrote           these result- ,  he was
preparing to return to Paris with Cit. Mechain. Nothing
therefore remains but some calculations to be made for de

of the Roman and municipal colonies,                         'she colonies
sounded       by the Romans were called Roman,                  Italian,   or

like political inequality was remarked between the munic:pia,

most     favoured      of the    municipia was T.isculum, the in
habitants       of which obtained all the rights of Roman
citizens.       Cit. Bouchaud has written, on the fame subject,
three other memoirs,            to explain     the   different systems of

    In  a  memoir on the        state  of the French Marine, at the
beginning of the 14th           century, Cit. Legrand described the
naval battle      of  1304 between       the French and the Flemings,
a very particular account          of which    he fonnd in a history,      in
verse, entitled,      La Brancbe aux royaux          Vignages,    written in
 1306 by      William Guiart.          This  small   work, consisting of
fifteen or sixteen verses, one of the oldest now extant on the
 history of the French navy, gives a very accurate description
os    the naval tactics and manuvres of that period.                    Cit.
 Legrand has employed it to make known the different kinds
 of  vessels   of which    squadrons     were then composed,         and the
 manner of fitting         them     out either for attack       or defence.
 From this memoir it          results that, until Francis       I, the kings
 of France       had no regular navy ; and          that, in their naval
 wars, they were accustomed              to purchase or hire privateer.-,
 ready equipped        and manned, or merchant (hips, which they
 manned themselves           and furnimed        with warlike machines.

      Cit. Bernardin        Saint-Pierre      traced     out, in a fragment

  dreading above all his innocence, come and promise him his

 For    a moment they suppose him overcome, because they see

  their father."      These dialogues, in which the character of
 the personages is scrupulously           preserved    ; where Lycon speaks
 as a sophist, Anytus         as a superstitious    man, and Melitus         as a
 politician, form the first act of         a  drama, which Saint-Pierre
 proposes to end with the death             of Socrates.
               LITERATURE AND THE PINE ARTS.
     Cit. Dupuits      read a second memoir on the I'elasgi, a na
 tion of whom scarcely any thing more is known                       than the
 name,      and whose antiquity goes beyond               the fabulous ages.
 The author       places the origin      of these   people in Egypt ; from
 which      he endeavours         to  mow that the Pelasgi spread into
 Libya     as far  as   the   Atlantic ocean,        and   afterwards    passed
into Peloponnesus,          the Archipelago        and Asia.      These con

   Cit. Langles              has already        contested       with the Europeans
the invention of             the compass,         of   paper,       and    of printing,      in
order to assign them to the Orientals.                               In     a new memoir
on gunpowder he deprives the German monk, Berthcld
Schwartz, of the fatal honour of that terrible invention, and
asserts      that it was conveyed                 to us from            the    Arabs.        He
assures      us,   that they made           use   of    it,   in    690,      at the siege    of
Mecca     ;    and      he    adds,    that the Arabs derived                   it   from the
Indians, among whom                    it   was known in the remotest anti
quity,       since their sacred books (the Vedam) forbid the use
of   it   in. war.   Cit. Langles   of opinion, that knowledge
                                             is                                a
of     these different inventions might have come to us                                     from
the East on the return                of the      crusaders.         There      is   an inter
val, however, of two centuries between the last crusade and
the first typographical attempts of Guttemberg in the city 0/
Strasbourg about the year 1440. Gunpowder was known
earlier in Europe than printing                    ;    but    it   does not appear thai
it     was    employed there              in war before the batde of Creci,
where the English                had six pieces             of cannon.             If the   con
jectures of Citizen Langles                       arc well founded, the Euro
peans,        at present,    only carry back to the East knowledge
which         we     formerly borrowed from that quarter. Thus
 every thing changes on the face                       of     the globe;        the arts     are
 lost in one nation to be revived                      in another       ;     nations them
 selves are effaced            and    disappear; and vast accumulations of
 water covered            formerly those countries which we inhabit at
 present.          All this     proves,      that the small globe upon which
 we reside         is   very old  ;    and that to live             a     century or two        is
 nothing.            We      have scarcely time to commence our studies.

    Cit. Cailhava, always occupied with the comic art,                         com
municated        extracts    from some ancient            Spanish       pieces of
Calderon de la Barca, entitled he Purgatoire de St. Patrice,
Le Diable     et le  Saint,    &c;     and he observes,        that the    drama
tic authors, who bring               upon the stage         in   so agreeable        j
manner ghosts, devils, and monks, have not the merit of
 the invention, and only carry us back to those coarse farces
which disgraced the infancy of the modern                      theatres.        Ctt
 Cailhava     calls the attention of government                  to that      noble
dramatic art, which might and ought to exercise a powerful
influence over the opinions             and   manners        of   civilized      na
 tions.    The ancients had particular magistrates appointed
 for the  purpose of keeping a watchful eye over the theatres.
The archons         and the ædiles were, in all           probability,        more
 difficult in their choice of pieces than the directors of                    those
 spectacles     at present.       Dramatic      authors did not labour            in
 haste for     pitiful    wages.       Sophocles and        Menander          wen
 crowned in the assemblies             of  the   people,     at  the    Olympic
 games, and before the eyes of all Greece.                      Between good
 taste and good morals there            is  more analogy than is gene
 rally believed.      There     is a  certain exquisite sense      of propriety
 which    arises from a happy disposition,           cultivated by a       liberal
 education    ;   and   it is of importance that this fense (hoaU
 never be suffered to become            weak,    and    that all our institu
 tions, our usages, and above all our theatres, should                   tend to
 strengthen     it.

    This    learned    Society held its first meeting for the        season
on   Thursday the 8th        of November.
    An abstract of a paper (read at a former meeting) entitled
*' Experiments to determine the
                                             Density of the Earth, by
Henry Cavendish, Esq. F. R. S.             and  A. S."   was read to the
meeting.         These experiments,        which    are   extremely in
genious and interesting,           are   detailed    at full length in
Part   II.   of   the Transactions     for   the present     year.    They
were projected        by the late Rev. John Michel!, F. R. S. but
he did not live to carry them into effect.           After his death the
apparatus came to the Rev.          F.  J. II.  Wollallon, Jacksonian
Professor     at Cambridge,      who transferred      them    to  Mr. Ca
vendish.        The  apparatus contrived for making sensible the
attraction of small quantities of matter, and which has been
improved by Mr. C. is very simple : it consists of a wooden
arm   6 feet     long, suspended by the middle in an horizontal
position by a slender wire 40 inches long ; to each extremity
is hung a leaden ball about 2 inches in diameter; and the
whole is enclosed in a wooden case to defeiid it from the
wind.
    As no      more force is required      to turn this balance      on its
centre, than is neceflary       io twist the slender suspending wire,
the   smallest      degree   of attraction of     a leaden      weight or
weights,      a few (eight) inches in diameter, brought near to
 the small suspended ball or balls         of the balance,    will  be suf
ficient to move it sensibly aside.
    To determine from          hence the     density  of  the    earth, all
that    is   neceflary   is lo ascertain    what force     is required    to
draw the arm aside through a given space, and then to have
recourse to calculation.

  a 14                       Hoy al Society    0/ Londn/t.
      To   prevent any disturbance           from currents that might be
  produced      within the box that contained the balance, by even
  the difference       of   temperature     that might        be occasioned     by
  heat being communicated by the bodies                   of the experimenters
  to one fide of it more than another, it was supported in the
  middle of a close room ; the operators, from adjoining apart
  ments,      viewed      the operation through           holes in the wall by
  means of telescopes;            and the apparatus         had   a strong  light
  thrown upon its two ends (an opening being left at each end
  of the box for the purpose) by means of two lamps, also in
  the adjoining apartments, the rays from which were                        like
  wise made to pass through holes formed in the wall.
     The two      large balls were suspended           from a beam near the
  ceiling,    which could be moved in an horizontal direction,
 by means       of  a string and pulley,        so as to be    brought near to
 the small balls of the balance, or made to recede again with-
 out requiring any person to be in the room.
     From this description jt will               be easily seen that, on the
two large balls being brought near to the two small ones, but
on opposite sides of each that their forces may not counteract
 each other, the small suspending wire               of   the balance must be
 twisted by the movements               of the    arms, occasioned        by at
traction, which            carries  the small towards the large           balls ;
and that the wire endeavouring to untwist itself                     will again
in its turn carry the small             balls away from the large ones.
Vibrations are thus occasioned, which would continue along
time     before     the small       balls would     settle  between     the first
point of     rest and the large        balls :   but it is not necessary       to,
wait     for this    ;  an ivory scale at each end of the balance
enables      the    experimenters, by means of their telescopes,
to fee    the two extreme divisions to which the small balls
move in their vibrations,             and   thus to determine          the mid
dle    point.      The time       necessary for each vibration is also
noticed.
    It  would be impossible          in  a  short notice to do justice         to
                                                                            Mr.

 Mr. Cavendifli's ingenious experiments,          and the calculations
  founded on them.        Those who feel themselves interested in
 them will have recourse to the original account.               We shall
 only mention the result.          By a mean of the experiments the
 density   of  the earth  comes out 5*48 times greater          than that
 of water.
     By the experiments made by Dr. Mafkelyne on the at
 traction of the hill Schchallicn, the density of the earth was
 computed to be only 4' times that of water.
     A paper* by Mr. Home was also read, containing an ac
 count of some experiments made in order to ascertain                  the
 cause    of  the light seen    in the eyes of cats and some other
 animals in the dark. After enumerating the opinions of other
 philosophers, he proceeds to (how, that when the light was
 perfectly excluded from the room in which the cat was
 placed, the eyes were never observed to shine; whence he
concludes that the eye merely collects the light diffused
through the room.         He then relates some observations on
the structure     of the  optic nerve.       Having   dissected the eve
of   a cat just killed, he was surprised at finding the retina
transparent.       This induced him to repeat the experiment
not only on cats,      but also on horses; and always with the
fame     result,  if the retina was examined immediately after
death.      But if this examination         was delayed an      hour    or
two, it was opake and whitish, as described by anatomists.
The optic     nerve, from the retina       to the brain, seemed to be
composed      of bundles of     fibres not parallel to each        other,
but alternately interwoven           and   separated,   the   interstices
silled with a transparent      fluid,   so  that a transverse section
taken    near the brain was nearly a circle containing             about
40 opakc round spots ; near the eye about 200 of these
spots, and in the middle about a mean between                       these
numbers.        These observations     were made with a microscope
magnifying about 23 times.

    At  their second meeting, on the 15th, a paper              by tiae
 Rev.  Mr. V ince on an usual atmospherical refraction « ats
read.  One day last summer, directing his telescope to tbe
sea, he obserred part ot the mast of a cutter (the hull bein»
below the horizon),        and above it an inverted image        of the
cutter, above which appeared a direct image of the same ;
these two images were joined at tbeir hulls ; but the point
of the  mast  of  the inverted image appeared to be as far       above
tbe top of the real mast as this last was above         the horizon.
These images appeared and disappeared very suddenly, some
thing like the beams of the aurora borealis, beginning a
little  above   the   real  object, and darting      upwards. The
learned   author, after supposing these appearances to be occa
sioned   by atmospheric strata os different densities,         recom
mends it to philosophers to investigate           this  subject ; and
suggests the utility of stationing men provided with telescopes
at certain places on the coast ; as by this means he thinks
vessels  and   other objects might be sometimes             discovered
long before they would otherwise become visible.
    On  the 22d a paper, by the         Abbe Mann, was read, the
substance   of which     w as to (how, that after having travelled
several times over Germany            he found very few remains       of
volcanos.     There     was very little interesting matter in this
paper, which concluded with an account           of some remarkable
bail-storms,     in which fronts, or pieces us ice, from half        aa>
 inch diameter to eight pounds weight, had fallen.

                ASTRONOMY AND GEOGBAPHT.
    The astronomer Beauchamp, well known by his travels in
 the cast, and formerly grand vicar of Babylon, has rendered
 a considerable    service  to geography     by his new map of the
 Black Sea ; the exact position of which he has determined
 from astronomical observations.           In'the year 1781 this ac

and Gella.               In   the year        1795          he was appointed        consul     at
Mascate in Arabia, by the French republic ; and set out
from Paris on the 9th of June, with some excellent instru
ments and            a   chronometer by Berthoud,                      which    he received
from General Calon, director of the geographical depot :
but on account of the danger to which French vessels were
then exposed, in the Mediterranean, he did not arrive at
Corfu till the 25th of June 1796 ; and in the end of October
reached        Constantinople.                In   the course      of his   voyage through
the Grecian Archipelago,                       he determined the position              of Pa-

mined the geographical position of twenty-six places                                    j and
by these means rectified                       the uncertain extent from west to
east   of     the Lepantine gulf.                  By   the chronometer he found the
 longitude of      to be 39° 41' 15" ; and that of Corinth
                         Patras
400 48' 15% consequently their difference of longitude i° 7';
At Constantinople Citizen Aubert-Dubayet was obliged (
 negotiate       a   long time with the Porte before he could obtain
 permission for Cit. Beaucham to explore the coasts of the
 Black Sea.  For the greater security, he hoped to obtain a
 kirlan-kicbe,            that     is,   a   small vessel belonging to the Captain
 Pacha    ;     but after          a   great deal           of trouble   he could procure
 only   a     sirman.         In   the year        1   780 the Turks ventured          to per

  men of considerable            intelligence,     viz.  the  Vixier       Haiti     Pa
  cha, who established a school for artillery                 and exsgrneerrag,
  and caused the best French works on these sabjects to be

  a great many astronomical and nautical                     instruments, tod
  who caused Cit. de Lalande's abridgment                    of his aJtroooanr
  to be translated into the Turkish language, but                   who     was    also
 decapitated       in October        1787.      Cit. Beauchamp, however,
 was more fortunate, as he arrived on the 26th                    of Jane        1797
 at Trebisonde       ;   and, without any impediment,               was cnabJed
 to determine the exact position of a great many points of
 the Black Sea. He found the latitude of Sinope to be 41' s ,
 instead    of 41,     as  it is laid down even in the best             maps;       fo
 that the very uncertain breadth of this sea, between Cape
 Karadze and Cape Indge, which was reckoned to be 6i
 French leagues, appears to be no more that thirty-seven
 leagues.       The longitude of Trebisonde he found (0 *
 570 16' 15*.          According to a Turkish map of the Black
 Sea, printed at Constantinople in the year of the Hegira 1 137*
 lhat is 1724 of the Christian æra, there is an error of half »
 degree of longitude in the position of this city ; and in the
 map of the Ruffian             empire, published in 1776 by Trescot
 and Schmid, this error extends to a degree and a half. The
 calculation. of the Jesuit P. deBezc                is totally false, and      too
                                                                                 of
great by      7* degrees. We may, therefore, form some idea
the state    of geography in Turkey, and of the important fer-
age   of forty-eight.     The   latter is better known under the name       ofl-f-
brun, and who for some time held the office of minister for foreign af
fair*.    His first occupation, however, was that ofan astronomer; frr
he assisted Cassini    If],  and  IV.  in the Observatory   at Paris till the rev
1778, and instructed in astronomy his brother Achilles,              who died at
Constantinople in 1717, at the age of twenty-eight.

         CONVERSION OP IRON INTO CAST STEEL.
     A   new method of preparing cast                    steel has been            lately an»
nounced in France by Cit. Clouet.                       His     process is as follows          :
Take     small pieces   of iron, and place them in layers in a cru
cible with a       mixture of the carbonate of lime.    Six parts of
the carbonate       of lime,        that is chalk, marble, limestone, and
in general all calcareous substances, and fix parts of the earth
of pounded Hessian crucibles must be employed for 20 parts
of iron.       This mixture          must be so disposed that, aster fusion,
Ihe iron may be completely covered by                               it,   so as to be    kept
from coming into contact with the atmosphere.                                      The mix
ture Is then to be gradually heated,                      and at last exposed to            a
 heat capable      of mcliing iron.              Is   the fire be well kept up, an
hour will generally be found sufficient to convert two pounds
of iron into       excellent       and exceedingly hard steel capable                      of
 being welded, an advantage not                     possessed       by    steel   procured in
 the common manner.

   A  NEW PROCESS         FOR FORMING           THE UNGUKNTUM
                           HVDRARGVRI.
    As   the process   of combining         mercury   with hog's     lard
is well known       to be tedious, and to require a considerable
time, the following method of shortening it has been an
nounced by Gottling in his Taschen-Bucbfur ScbeidkvnftU*
for the year 1798.        This process, fays he, can be speedily
performed by the addition of a very small quantity of the
flowers of sulphur.        For a mixture of two ounces of hog'»
 lard  and six drachms      of quicksilver, it will be necessary to
employ only      six  grains of the flowers of sulphur, and the
process   will be completed in a few           minutes.    I do not s«,
 adds  M. Gottling,     that so small a quantity      of the flowers of
sulphur can hurt the          effect    of  the mixture,    and am     of
 opinion that this prescription may be of considerable            use in
 pharmacy.

praise, to which the numerous services he has rendered and
still continues to render to science                        so justly   entitle him ; nor
will it any         way diminish            his acknowledged merit, should it
 be    sliown that the opinion he has delivered on Mr. Cart-
 wright's invention is founded on erroneous-principles. Mr.
 N.    has mistaken the             construction of the piston, described
 another,           and then endeavoured                to show that triangles                ivill
 not   fit   a cylinder, nor a wafer occupy the diameter of a                                 mill
 stone. These are not his words                     :   but they are the fair infer
 ence from his mode                 of      expression,        as   we (hall      fee       imme
 diately.          But     first   we       shall briefly state how the piston                      is
 really conllructed.               Two       metal rings are ground, by meant
 well known to good mechanics, into the cylinder,                                     so as
                                                                                              toft

 so    well that no steam can               pass between         them and the cylinder:
 their upper and under              sides are also          ground perfectly flat, and,

    though      not absolutely    necessary,      for the greater       security
    two     other rings are fitted to the inside of these.               On the
    npper rings is placed      a plate   of metal,    also ground perfectly
    flat,   and  of such a diameter as almost to           fit the cylinder      :
    a similar flat plate is placed below the under ones               ; and the
    two plates     with the rings between            are   attached     to each
    other by means of the piston rod that             passes through them.
    It is plain then,    that supposing     neither    the outside rings nor
    the cylinder to be able to wear one another, such a piston
    would remain steam-tight         :  but  as constant    friction must in
    evitably tend to widen the cylinder and diminish the dia
    meter of the rings, the piston after some time would                   cease
    to sit,  if a contrivance    had not been       fallen upon to remedy
    the evil.     The rings   are each    of them cut into       three pieces    j
   and, in cutting them,        such a portion       of  the metal is taken
   awayas to leave room to introduce, between              twoof the     pieces,
   a spring in the form      of the letter  V,   the open end       of which is
   placed outwards, almost close lo the circumference ; by                which
   means the two pieces against which the two fides               of the  spring
.  act, are pressed, in thedireflion     ofthe circumference,       against the
   endsof the third piece;      so that the three pieces are       thus kept   so
   uniformly in contact with the cylinder, that the longer the ma
   chine is worked the better the rings must fit.          To   prevent steam
   from pasfingthrough the cuts in the rings, the solid parts of the
   upper rings are made to fall upon the divisions and springs
   of the under ones. This is the method contrived by Mr.
   Cartwright for making his piston fit ; which will be clearly
   understood by looking at Plate I. Vol. I. of this Magazine.
   If he   had left it to  " a very    moderate     portion of mechanical
   knowledge to suggest the manner in which the pieces                   might
   be made to recede outwards, by means              of springs," it might
   perhaps have been proposed to make such springs act from
  the centre on the circumference           :  in that   cafe,    the presturo
  of the different     parts  of  each    ring could never have been
  made uniform,        and the machine would soon               have worked
  itself into inequalities, instead of working itself more true.
                                                                               If

                         for   Steam   Engluts.                       jjj
     If the piston was made       of  a larger or less diameter than
the cylinder, and this difference         was endeavoured       to be ac
commodated by means of springs, then                Mr. NYs objections
to this part would be well founded            :  in the former cafe the
pieces    of  the rings would      only touch the cylinder at their
extremities, and iu the latter only in their middle  6 point*
only would be in contact. But if we suppose the piston rings
of a larger diameter [how came Mr. N. to think of such an
absurdity?]     let   us at once suppose their diameter equal to
that of the earth each portion then would not differ sen
sibly from a straight line.        This however       is only faying, that
if Mr.     Cartwright attempt to make           a triangle fit a cylinder
by means       of  springs,  he  will fail  :   so he    would also if he
should     with half an inch endeavour          to sill a mile.    Mr. C.
does     not propose making any other figure or dimension fit
his cylinder but its own       ;  and has devised a mean by which
 it must, when once fitted, continue so.
     Mr. Nicholson is still more unfortunate in his            second ob
jection.
              " When,"      says  he,  " a great     pressure,   such, for
 example, as the reaction of a column of too feet                of water,
 comes to be exerted upon the           face    of this apparatus,     the
 plates or pieces    of  these rings may be imagined to be con
 fined in a vice.      The   pressure  of such a column      will amount
 to more than 40 pounds upon every square inch.                   Whence
  we may conclude,        either that they would          not move at all
  [outward, he means, against the cylinder], or that the force
 of the springs must be such as greatly to load the work with
  friction."    If such a reaction could possibly take place            in
 Mr. Cartwrighi's       steam engine as would at one and the fame
  time lay a force equal to 40 pounds per square inch upon both
fides of the pi/ion, it would be indeed in a vice; but not such
  a one as would cause friction from the action of the springs;
  for tbis vice would keep the piston at          rest  it would neither
  ascend nor descend.        But every one acquainted with mecha
  nics must known, that, to make a well- constructed steam en
                                                                      gine

 gine work, the pressure must at! only on            one  side of the piston
 at a time !
    In Mr. C.'s engine,        the piston is not intended to adapt it
 self to  inequalities   in the cylinder ;       all inequalities   are first
 removed.        In the working,       the piston ascends in vacua,       by
 the momentum communicated to the fly-wheel ; therefore
 at  that time there is       no pressure on either the upper or under
fide of   the piston, and the springs are in full action, pressing,
 lightly   and uniformly,      the whole circumference of the rings
against the cylinder.         When       the piston     reaches the top    of
 the cylinder it raises the steam valve ;            and the    steam then
entering acts only         on   the   upper surface of the piston, and
forces it to descend     j  but, condensation having taken place
below the piston, the whole under space is a vacuum, more
or   less  perfect, and therefore          there    can    be  no reacting
power to perform the office of the vice !
    Whether this contrivance will answer                   for pumps and
other hydraulic        apparatus,      is not the present inquiry.         It
will   be time enough to give an           opinion on that point when
 we  see  what mode of construction may be                used in  such an
application of the invention.                                         A. T.

L   Account as a remarkable fiery Meteor           seen   in Gajcony    on
   the  24th    of July 1790;         by  M. Baudin,        Professor of
   Philosophy at Pau.            With   some   Observations     on Fire-
   Balls and Shooting- Stars, by Professor               Chladni        at
   Wittenburgh.        From Magazin fur das           Neueste     aus der
   Physik, by ProfessorVoiGT.              Vol.  XI.
.AbOUT           half     an   hour after    ten o'clock     on Sunday
evening,    July  514,    179-j    as  I  was walking in the court of
the castle   of Mormcs, along with M. de Carrits Barbotan,
the atmosphere     being perfectly calm and serene, and not a
cloud to be seen, we found ourselves surrounded, all of a
sudden, by    a  whitish clear light, which obscured that of the
moon, though the latter shone with great lustre, as it wanted
only thirty hoursof being at the full. On looking upwards              wfe
observed,   almost in our zenith, a fire-ball      of a larger diameter
than the moon.           It  had    behind it a tail,    the   length   of
which    seemed to be equal to about five or fix              times the
diameter of the body         :  at the place where it was connected
with the body it had about the fame breadth, and decreased
gradually till it ended        in  a point.     The ball   and    the tail
were  of  a pale  white colour;        but the point  of the latter   was

3l6                     Account of a remarkable
almost, as red as blood.       The direction of this meteor, which
 proceeded with great velocity, was from south to north.
    Scarcely had we looked at it for two seconds when                      it
divided itself into several portions of considerable size, which
 we saw fall in different directions, and almost with the same
appearance      as the   bursting of a bomb.            All these different
fragments became extinguished in the air, and some of
 them, in falling, assumed that blood-red colour which I had
observed   in   the point    of  the tail.     It  is not improbable that
all th«   reft   may have      assumed the fame colour ; but           I re
 marked only those which proceeded                in  a direction towards
Mormes, and which were particularly exposed to my view.
    About   three,    or perhaps      two minutes and a half after,         I
 am not certain      which,     as  I   was   not reflecting upon what
might   be the consequences,           and   therefore    did not look at
my watch,        we heard     a dreadful clap of thunder,         or rather
explosion    as   if several large      pieces    of ordnance    had been
fired  off  together.       The    concussion      of the  atmosphere     by
this shock     was   so   great that we all thought an earthquakr
had taken place.         The windows shook in their frames, and
some   of them, which probably             were laid-to and not closely
shut, were thrown open.            We     were informed next day, that
in some of the houses at Houga,              a small town about       half a
mile distant from Mormes, the kitchen utensils were thrown
from the shelves,       so  that the people         concluded there had
been an earthquake.           But as no movement was observed in
 the ground      below our feet,        I am inclined to     think that all
 these effects were produced merely by the violent concussion
 of the atmosphere.
    We   proceeded     into the garden, while the noise still con
 tinued, and appeared to be in         a  perpendicular direction above
us. Some time after, when it had ceased, we heard                  a hollow
noise, which seemed to roll along the chain               of the Pyrenees
in  echoes,    for the     distance of fifteen miles.         It continued
about sour minutes,         becoming gradually more remote,             and
always weaker;        and at the fame time we perceived            a strong
 smell of sulphur.
                                                                     While

                       Jiery Meteor       seen in Gascony.                              227
     While   we were endeavouring to point out to some persons
present' the         place    where the meteor had divided itself,                       we
observed     a    small      whitish cloud, which arose perhaps from
the vapour       of   it,   and   which   concealed from us the three stars
of    the great bear lying in the middle                of   those forming               the
semicircle.          With      some difficulty,        however,          we    could at
last distinguish these stars again behind the thin cloud.
There arose, at the same time,    fresh gentle breeze.
                                              a
     From    the      time that elapsed between the bursting of the'
ball and the explosion               which       fullowed,   I        was inclined to
think that       the meteor was at the height                of, at least, seven
or eight miles, and that    fell four miles to the north of
                                       it
Mormes.   The latter part of my conjecture was soon con
firmed, by an account which we received,                          that   a    great ma
ny stones had fallen from the atmosphere                         at    Juliac,     and    in
the neighbourhood             of Barbotan.           One of these places lies
at the distance        of    about four miles to the north               of Mormes,
and    the other at about the               distance   of    five to       the     north-
north-west.
     M.   de Carrits         Barbotan,       who was at Juliac two days
after, confirmed to us the truth of this circumstance                              ;    and
it          from the accounts of several intelligent persons,
     appeared
highly worthy of credit, that the meteor burst at         little                   a
distance from Juliac,  and  that the stones  which   fell were
found lying in an almost circular space, about two miles in
diameter. They were of various sizes.        have not heard  I
of any houses being damaged, though some of the stones fell
in courts    anil gardens.           In     the neighbouring             woods some
branches were found broken and torn                         by   the falling       of   the
stones,     which      as     they descended made            a    strong      whistling
noise that many persons heard.                   I   was told also            by   people
of respectability, that            as the meteor       proceeded in its course
they heard       a   rustling noise and snapping, like that of elec
trical sparks; which              appears    to me very natural,                 thouch
these were heard- neither            by   myself nor     M.       de    C. Barbotan.
                                            Q.   2                                  Some

Sa8                     Account     of a  remarkable
    Some stones were       seen to   fall, which, when found, weighed
IS   or 20 pounds, and which             had   funk into the earth from
two to three feet.       I   was    told also that some            were found
which      weighed 50 pounds. M. de C. Barbotan procured
one weighing 18 pounds, which he transmitted to the Aca
demy of Sciences at Paris.            I  examined       a  small stone which
was brought to me, and found it very heavy in proportion to
its size  :  it was black on the outside         ;  of    a grayish colour in
the inside, and interspersed with            a number of small shining
metallic     particles.    On striking it with           a piece   of  steel,    it
produced a few small dark red sparks, not very lively. A
mineralogist, to whom a like piece of stone from the fame
meteor was shown at Paris, described                 it  as   a  kind of    gray
stag  mixed with calcareous          spar,   the surface       of which    exhi
bited vitrified,    blackish calx of iron.              I   was told also that
some stones were found totally vitrified.
    This    meteor   was    seen at   Bayonne,        Auch, Pau,       Tarbe«,
and even at Bourdeaux           and Thoulouse.             I  learned   that in
the last-mentioned place         it excited no great attention;          which
is not surprising,      when we consider the great distance.                   It
appeared there only somewhat brighter than those sliootine
itais which are seen from time to time j and after it                     burst.
there was heard a hollow report almost like a distant clap of
thunder.
    Had it been accurately observed at Auch and Pau whit
stars were obscured by the vapour that arose from the bursting
of  the meteor, the real height          of it might        have been thence
determined with precision.
    Such,     says Professor    Chladni, is        the    account given       by
Baudid of this meteor; the phenomena of which he                       endea-
 ? ours  to explain from accumulations in the upper para                      o<

    According     to all the observations       hitherto made with         *">'
 accuracy on fire-balls,       the height at which              they were urll
 perceived was always very considerable;                  and   by conrpanng
                                                                            the

   the angles under which they were seen from different points,
   often 19 German miles, and even more                 ;   their velocity, for
   the most part, several miles in a second             ;   and their size al
   ways very great, often a quarter           of a mile and even more in
   diameter.       They     were all seen to fall mostly         in an oblique
  direction   :  not one of them ever proceeded                upwards.      All
   of them   have appeared under the form              of a globular mass,
  sometimes      a  little extended     in length and highly luminous ;
  having behind it          a tail, which,    according to every appear
  ance, was composed           of  flames and smoke.       AU    os them burst
  after they    were seen to move          through a large space, some
  times over several districts, with an explosion which shook
  every thing around.          In  every instance where there has been
  an opportunity        of observing    the fragments that fell after they
  burst,  and which         sometimes     have funk to the depth         of  se
  veral feet into the earth,         they   were found to consist      of sco-
  rious  masses    which contained iron in         a metallic or calcined
  state, pure, or else mixed with different kinds                of  earth and
 sulphur.       All    the ancient      and  modern accounts, written
 partly by naturalists         and partly by others, are so essentially
 similar, that the one seems to be only               a    repetition of the
 other.    This conformity in accounts,            the authors       of which
 knew nothing of those given by others, and who could have
 no interest      in fabricating similar tales, can            scarcely   have
 arisen from accident or fiction, and gives to the related facts,
 however inexplicable many of them may seem, every degree
 of credibility.        In my    essay  on the mass of iron found by
 Professor  Pallas in Siberia, and others of the like kind, and
several natural phenomena therewith connected *,                       I  have
collected the principal observations             made     on sire-balls and
the falling  of ferruginous        scoriotis masses observed at the same
time, and have given a kind of explanation, which, how
ever romantic it may seem, yet agrees better,                in my opinion,
with the facts hitherto observed than any other, and is con-
Irary to no law of nature hitherto known.                   Some critics, as

330                        Account of a remarkable
well     as          ridiculed my singular hypothesis, or
               others,    have
condemned it altogether ; but no one has yet confuted my
principles, or given any other explanation that corresponds
so well with facts.   On the other hand, I could mention
several naturalists, who, as                 1   know from their own mouths,
agree with me in the essential parts of my explanation, did
I not consider it improper to bring them thus forward to
public notice without their express permission.                                     The    strong
est    objection made              to my assertions            is,   that       such      a     mass,
from such         prodigious height, would not sink to the depth
                  a
of   a   few feet, but to the centre of the earth. This assertion,
however, contradicts itself; because such                           a     mass      is   not solid,
as may be concluded from the variation                               of   its form         so   often
remarked, and the increase of its size till                         it    at length bursts          ;
but consists of soft and elastic fluids, which, probably being
expanded          by   the heat, extend to          a   monstrous globular form                     ;
is    then supported          by   the    atmosphere,           and        loses the greater
part of its gravity.    To this may be added, that soft tough                       a
mass,     which besides falls in very oblique direction, would
                                             a
not in general sink   far into the earth
                                so                                  as    a   solid mass that
falls     perpendicular direction.
         in   a
      The     above-described
                    meteor seems,    every point of »iew,      in
to confirm my method of explanation as much as        had                                if   it
absolutely        taken place for that purpose.                     This much,                at any

of the atmosphere,                 as   it   can hardly be supposed that such
gross substances could float                     or be dissolved in             so   rarefied air
at   a   height of 20 German miles,                     so   as to be         collected and to
unite into monstrous masses.                         As we          are acquainted               with
no power which             is   able to force such large bodies to                          so   con

not be admitted, it is much to be .wished            that some other
person  might      give an explanation consistent with         the ob
served facts   j and that more attention than has hitherto been
bestowed,     were    paid to the observation      of fire-balls    and
shooting   stars % as  for example, that observed on the 8th of
March    1796    in Lusatia,   and in some parts of Saxony and
Brandenburg.
   Shooting stars are perhaps       meteors   of  the fame nature     a$
those telescopic     sparks  of light observed by Mr. Schroier,
and may be different       from fire-balls only in this, that they
move at a much        greater distance   from our earth, and that
they do not fall, but only occasion a transient         luminous ap
pearance    in their   passage  through the upper regions of the
atmosphere.
   I shall here mention an idea" which does not proceed from
myself, but from a very intelligent astronomer, that moot
ing stars might be employed to determine the difference of
two meridians.       Two or more     astronomers,    residing   at some
distance from each other, might agree to make observations
on mooting stars, which appear almost at all times, when the
weather is clear, in some part of the heavens, not with in
struments,     but merely with the naked eye ; and to remark,
not only the time of their appearance,          but also their appa
rent course   ;   and from the difference    of  the times    of feeing
these shooting stars, the difference of the meridians of the
places might be determined ; and from the difference of their
apparent   courses, their real height and real course might be
discovered.

II.   Account of a singular In/lance cf Atmospheric RtsraBivn.
    In a Letter from William Latham, Esq. F.R.S. and
    AS.    to the    Rev.    Henet Whitfifld, D.D. F.R.S.
    and A- S.        From    the    Philosophical   Transactions of the
    Royal Society of Loudon, 1798.
       DEAR SIE,                                  Hasting!,' Angus! I, 1797.
On        Wednesday        July   26,    about five o'clock in the after
noon, while       I  was sitting in my      dining-room       at this place,
which U      situated     upon the Parade, close to the sea-shore,
nearly fronting         the   south,    my attention wa»         excited  by
a number of people            running     down to the sea-fide.         Upon
inquiring the         reason,     I wai    informed     that   the   coast of
France      was   plainly to be distinguished by the naked eye.
I immediately        went down to the shore, and was surprised to
 find that, even without the assistance of           a telescope,     I could
 Tery    plainly    see the   cliffs on the opposite coast ;      which,    at
 the nearest part, are between 40 and. 50 miles distant,                  and
 are not to be discerned,           from that low situation, by the aid
 of  the best glasses. They appeared to be only a few miles oss,
 and    seemed to extend         for some leagues along the coast.            I
  pursued    my walk along the shore eastward,                  close to the
  water's edge, conversing with the sailors and fishermen upon
  the subject.       They, at first, could not be persuaded of the
  reality   of  the appearance         ; but they   soon became so tho
  roughly    convinced, by the cliffs gradually appearing more
  elevated, and approaching nearer, as it were, that they
  pointed out and named              to me the different places      they had
  been accustomed         to visit ; such as the Bay, the       Old Head cr
  Man,     the   Windmill,        &c. at Boulogne;        St. Vallery,     and
   other places on the coast of Picardy; which they afterwards
   confirmed when they viewed them through their telesc pc«.
   Their   observations      were, that the places appeared as near as
   if they  were sailing, at a small distance, into the harbours.
                                                                       Having

         Singular            Instance         of Atmospheric RefraBion.                            333
  Having indulged my curiosity upon                                the shore for near an
hour, during which the cliffs appeared to be at some times
more bright and near, at others more faint and a greater
distance, but never out                     of fight,     I   went upon the eastern cliff
or hill, which is of                  a very considerable          height, when a most
beautiful     scene presented itself to my view ; for                                I   could at
once    see   Dengcness *, Dover cliffs, and the French coast,
all along from Calais, Boulogne, &c. to St. Vallery                                      ;   and, as
some   of thefisliermen affirmed,                         as far to the         westward even
as Dieppe.             By        the telescope, the French fisliing-boats were
plainly to be seen                    at anchor      5    and    the different colours               of
the land upon the                       heights, together           with the buildings,
were perfectly discernible.  This curious phenomenon con
tinued in the highest splendour till past 8 o'clock, (although
a black cloud totally obscured the face of the sun for some
time,} when it gradually vanished.
   Now, Sir,           as    I was         assured, from every inquiry             I could         pos
sibly make, that                 so    remarkable an instance os atmospherical
refraction had never been witnessed by the oldest inhabitant
of Hastings, nor by any of                          the       numerous visitors              (it   hap
pened to be the day                     of   the great annual          fair, called Rock-
fair, which always attracts multitudes from the neighbour
ing places),   thought an account of
                   I                       however trifling,         it,
would be gratifying to you.
   The       day was extremely  hot (68° at 10 A. M. 760 at                                              5
P. M.).       I   had no barometer with me, but suppose the
mercury        must have been high, as that and the three pre
ceding days were remarkably fine and clear.                                        To        the best
of my recollection                    it   was high water at Hastings about two
o'clock P. M. Not                      a   breath   of wind       was stirring the whole
     The   cape   of land         called Dengcness,  which extends nearly two miles
 into the sea, and          is   about sixteen miles distant from Hastings,     right
                                                                                             in

 vessels which were sailing tetween the two place*                         .-   they were likewise

   Jl HE      covering      season     of   the dshiggetai     falls towards the
 middle or end of August                  ;  and about this period Messer-
 schmidt observed            in a   female, which he dissected,           a foetus
 not larger       than    a   mouse.         They cast their young in the
 spring, and generally have one foal at a time. When the
 young attain to the age of three, they are equal in size
to the old ones, and are sit for procreation, as I was as
 sured by the inhabitants               of  those countries, who often had
an opportunity          of killing      and examining these animals.
     The    males when they fight bite each other, like the com
mon wild horses.              The     dshiggetai     fights also with its heels,
as    was observed         in   a    foal    which     had   been    caught, and
which,      a  few years before my arrival in Dauuria, was kept
there by one of the Cossacks ; but it continued alive only a
short time.          The hair of the dshiggetai in winter is almost
of    a pale Isabella        yellow colour, about an inch and              a  half
long ; a little rough on the back, as was the cafe in the foal
of a wild     horse, which        I  have already described , and equally
soft and tender.         Skins covered with winter hair of this kind
I have     found among the Tungufians.                      The female, how
ever, which        I  procured in Dauuria, at the end of the month

                      or DJbiggetai         of Middle Asm.                       235
of May,      had at that period lost almost                all its winter hair,
though      the     Tungufian        horses     still  retained   theirs.     _ The
summer hair of this female                 was uncommonly          smooth and
pretty   ;  and    I  never    found it much longer on the skins                   of
animals shot far later in the season.                   The colour      easily be
comes paler ; and on the stuffed hide                   of the female, which         I
have described,         and which      is preserved in the cabinet of na
tural history at Petersburg!), the summer hair, partly by the
preparation the hide has gone through, and partly by the
effects   of  the fun, has         been    totally bleached to          a dull   Isa
bella colour, which appears                lighter than the common win
ter hair.
    The    above      female     was about three          years   old, and was
shot on the 26th          of May O. S.        1772, in the neighbourhood
of Tarcinoor,          in   the    country of the Tungusians.              As the
spring heats had then commenced with great violence in
those districts, the animal, at Kulussutai, where it was kept
 for me, had already begun to putrefy on the 28th, and ex
 posed me to a very disagreeable piece                 of labour,   especially     in
a   barren region,         where     I was obliged to dissect it without
any assistance.          The    figure (Plate      V.)   done from a drawing
 made before the dissection,             is so accurate, that       I   was never
 better satisfied       with any representation           of  an animal.         The
 dshiggetai cannot, therefore, be any longer considered among
 the doubtful animals, and its description is as follows                    :
    In  size and figure it has a great resemblance                 to a middle-
 sized   mule    ;   but it excels the mule in the beauty and deli
 cacy of its make.           The head is larger than that of the horse,
 and more compressed             at the sides ; the forehead          is perfectly
 flat, and runs downwards with a small angle towards the
 muzzle.     The     sides   of the   head are also flat, especially where
 the broad part       of the jaw-bones lie,           and where the head has
 the greatest thickness.            On the other hand, the throat,                be
 tween the broad parts           of  the  jaw-bones, is hollow.
    The lips, particularly the upper one,                 are thick and flabby;
 thinly covered wilh hair, and black on                   the edges, which are
                                                                                besct

   2$6              Description          of the Equus Hemionus
  beset with     stiff gray bristles,         crooked and bent downwards.
  The corners of         the mouth            are    covered with     soft    hair c^
  the   inside ; and        the inner        side    of   the  cheeks     is covered
  with fine blackish glands. The number of the teeth amounts
  to   thirty-four; so that this animal has two ress than the
  horse. The fore-teeth are fix ; the sour middlemost of which,
  in  the above-mentioned               female, had not yet been changed ;
  they were     of   a   conical form marked with                 a small    furrow   j
 and the fide ones were obliquely blunted, and pressed towarda
 those in the middle.              The situation of the fore-teeth is the
 fame as those       of    the     horse,     standing      perpendicular in the
  upper, and obliquely             in the under jaw.            I found the eye-
 teeth neither      in this female, nor in the skull of a stallion,
 which      had been shot a little before,                and brought to me by
 the Tungusians ; but               I observed in the upper jaw               of   the
 former, at a mean distance between                      the sore and   jaw    teeth,
 a trace as   of  a socket       for a tooth.          The jaw-teeth       were like
 those   of the horse     ;    but on each        side above, as    well   as below,
there were only three fully grown, beyond                       which    the fourth
was just beginning to appear.                    I found a fifth in the before-
mentioned skull concealed within the socket.                         Of the latter,
Mcsserschmidt, speaking of the skull of a stallion, makes no
mention.       In   the palate        I  counted seventeen broad wrinkles,
of which,     those before were flatter, and those behind higher
and broader.
     The nostrils,     as in the         horse,     are wide, blackish on the
inside and edges ; but under the nostril,                     on each side of the
cartilage, there        is an excrescence             like  a large  round wart,
which     is to be found neither in the horse nor the ass.                       The
muzzle is interspersed with long blackish bristles, the longest
of which, about two inches in length, are found on the
tinder lip, and on the outside of the noilrils.
    The    eyes are    of     a moderate        size, and, with their longest
diameter, stand in the head obliquely.                        The   edge*     of  the
eyelids and a triangular               spot at the       corner of the eye        are
bald end blackisli          ;   and the upper eyelid only is furnished
                                                                                 with

  with  a row     of black   eyelashes,        seven lines in length,      which
  are at a little distance from the              edge   of the  eyelid, and      do
  not reach entirely to the corners.                 Below the foremost       cor
  ner, however, of the eye, in the neighbourhood of the cs
jugalis, there are several scattered black hairs, two of which,
 more than two inches in length, lie entirely flat.                       In    the
  corner of the eye lies         a   thick white fold of skin, which is
 capable of being         extended,        seven    lines in breath,     as far as
  the iris,   and in the middle           of its edge has a blackish moon-
 formed spot.         The white of the          eye,   next to the transparent
 cornea, is brownish           ;    the iris is      darkish   gray, and,     as  it
 were, radiated with folds;              the pupil is elongated, so that its
  longest diameter runs through                the corner    of  the   eye, and,
 like the eye itself,      stands obliquely.
     The   ears are much larger than those                of the horse, though
 much more in proportion to the size than those of the                        al's ;
  sharp-pointed,       erect,     internally of the colour of the body             ;
 but the inside,       at the top,       and a stripe     on the edges down
  wards, are brownish black.                On    the inside they are covered
 with curled whitish hair, which                  rises up from the circum
 ference.      Three raised stripes run along the inside of the ear
 lengthwise, which are thinly covered with hair of the like
 kind projecting from each other.
     The neck      is smaller and rounder than that               of   the horse,
 and even than that         of    those called stag- necked.         The mane
 proceeds from the back part               of  the skull to the stioulders,      of
 an equal height, and is as              soft and as upright as        in young
foals.      It is  of a blackish colour with yellowish gray points,
 and about three         quarters of an inch in length.               Instead of
 the   tuft before, the whole space between the cars and the
 orbits of the eyes is thick            set  with soft hair of the same co
 lour as the mane,            and     at most        one   inch   three lines    in
 length.
     The body      is pretty     long, more compressed            on the     side«
 than in the horse, contracted towards the lower part of the
breast, particularly before,           into    a conical form, and strongly
                                                                           built.

 238               Description of the Equus Hcmionut
 built.     The rump is pretty straight and somewhat sharp, as
  in the  ass.    As the body was swelled up, the spine was be
 come bent into the form            of  a bow.
     The   animal stands high on its limbs,            which are delicate,
 though      its muscles      are strong ;     but the shoulders,      thighs
 and    legs are somewhat meagre,             like those of flight-formed
 mules.       The forelegs, on       the inside, have a longish,       round,
 bald, blackish scar,         covered    with   a tender, somewhat hard
 and brittle skin, which, at sometimes of the year, may per
 haps be covered by a corneous substance.                  In the common
 ass  this scar is more of a round form.             It  was in length    two
 inches     seven   lines,    and in breadth one inch six lines.           On
 the hind legs no traces         of  such a scar were to be seen.        The
 lower part of the leg is perfectly smooth, ornamented be
 hind with      a considerable     tuft of short hair    :  on the fore-fide
 inwards there         is a black spot,     and outwards a faint mark
 near the before-mentioned              tuft.     On   the    hind feet there
 are two small faint spots above it.             The  hoofs are very hard,
 dry, of a black colour,          small, and almost like a        half cone;
 roundish above,         and very hollow on the sole.           The  edges  of
 all the hoofs exhibited traces         of cracks which        had grown up
 again.
    The tail      was almost      like that of a cow        ;  the  trunk   is
thin, moderately long, perfectly round, quite bald from the
rump to the middle          ;  but the other part is covered with fliort
bristles of the fame colour            as the sides   of   the body.     It is
bushy at the end,          where it forms a black tuft, about nine
inches in length.
    I  found the winter hair on the skin already mentioned to
be two inches long, tolerably              thick,  as soft as    camel hair,
and of an isabella gray colour outwardly, but of a pale iron-
gray towards the roots.             The summer hair on the female,
which     I  have described,      was scarcely thi*e quarters       of aline
in length, here and there disposed into circular arrangements
{vortices)     and fhadings,~and on the back never turned for
wards as     in the zebra. A shading of the hair runs length
                                                                         wise

                       or   DJbiggelai of ^fiddle Asia.                         239
wise    along the face,            and two others above           the eye*.     The
vortices      I  observed     first on each side         of  the   mane immedi
ately behind the           ears.       There    were      two also above each
other under the neck             ;   two on the sides of the neck opposite
the shoulders ; a larger one on each                    joint of    the shoulder ;
another large one on each                side of the   breast behind the shoul
ders, and also a cruciform shading                 of   the hair.    Several more
of  these hair vortices          could be observed on different parts of
the body.
    The colour of        the muzzle is whitish ; the reft              of the body
inclines a little more to yellow ; the neck is of                     a fallow co
lour ; the rump from the back to the sides of an ochre yel
 low;    the sides fallow,          and the limbs paler.           The hind     part
of  the fore legs, and the inner part              of    the hind legs, together
with    the     lower part of the             rump and the hinder edge of
the thigh, are whitish.                 Where    the mane ceases, there be-
gines a blackish brown stripe,                  which runs along the ridge
of   the     back to the bushy part of the tail.                    The    udder   it
blackish and perfectly bald, with two strong short teats. The
measurement          of    the principal         parts     of this animal is      as
follows    :   The length from            the skull between        the ears to the
root of the tail 5 feet          1    inch 3 lines ; length of the head x
foot 8 inches 6 lines          ;    height of the animal at the shoulders
before 3 feet 9 inches 9 lines ; height behind 4 feet 3 inches
6 lines ; length of the ears 7 inches 2 lines ; length of the
tail without the brush at the end                    1   foot 4 inches 1 line ;
length of the brush            8    inches 2 lines.          The weight of the
whole animal amounted to 560 pounds apothecary's weight.
   Every think considered, the dshiggetai is distinguished par
ticularly by the head,               which     has    a mean       proportion be
tween that        of the horse and the ass ; and, in that respect, as
well   as  by the cars and the tail, it approaches                   very   near to
the   zebra.        In the     rest     of  the body       and   the thighs    it is
more like the        ass ;   and      in the limbs it has        a greater simila
rity to the        mule and the horse.              The tail is more naked
than that of the ass, and                nearly like that of the cow.            Its
                                                                             colour

 colour and hair vortices are peculiar to itself.                     The strip*
 on the back, however, is like that of the female onager,                    and
 of many horses, without any cross stripes. The tail                          ex
 cepted,     it has, in general,          the greatest likeness to the    mule.
 But, from the           above circumstances,           it clearly appears   that
 the dshiggctai is an animal of a distinct genns, and as
 much peculiar to Asia as the zebra and quagga axe to
 Africa ; whereas the ass, and perhaps the horse, in a wild
 state,    belong        to   both     these     quarters    of   the  world   in
 common.

 J. HE       urine      is a fluid       separated from      the blood by the
 kidneys,       containing        several neutral salts, with more or        led
animal extractive matter.                 The    relative proportions   of these
substances        are    found to vary        so  much in the fame person,
both     in health        and disease, that       it is extremely difficult to
six on what may be considered                      as a standard for healthy
urine.      The      specific gravity      of this fluid   reaches from 1005
to I033, that of distilled water being 1000                   :  by exposure to
the air it soon Tuns into the putrefactive state, accompanied
with the production of much                      ammonia,      although   when
first   voided      it always contains an excess of phosphoric acid,
and reddens litmus : in consequence of this excess, it hole*
in solution more or              less  phofphat of lime, which may be
readily thrown down by               a  fixed alkali, or even pure ammo
nia.     By evaporation,              36 oz.      yield a residuum varying
from    I oz.    to    1{ :  this consists of the muriats of potash and
soda, the phosphats            of  soda, lime, and ammonia, the phos
phoric and lithic acids, with animal extractive matter.
Their relative proportions in a healthy state may be nearly
as  follows    :                   .   .

    The neutral       salts, when purified by crystallization, are ge
nerally     very    fusible; but this circumstance varies                   much,
according to the greater or less proportion                of phosphoric salts,
more particularly the phosphat of ammonia, on which their
fusibility in     a great measure depends : instead              of melting,     this*
 saline matter sometimes             decrepitates    when suddenly healed,
owing      to an excess      of  the muriatic salts:         of these last it may
 be observed, that the muriat             of  potash is in general the most
 prevalent, and is easily distinguished             from the muriat of soda,
 by its crystallizing         in    some degree by cooling,            and by its
 affording cream of tartar on the addition of acid of tartar.
      In recent urine the ammonial salts bear a very small pro
  portion    } but when it has become                stale or    putrid, they are
 much more abundant.                   The    phosphat       of. ammonia is the
  principal,      although we have likewise met with the muriat
  of ammonia.
      (A.) The lithic        acid and phosphat          of lime      are generally
  deposited, at least in a great measure, after the urine has be
  come cold and        stood    for some time     :   the quantity      of  the first
  varies exceedingly, but that of the last we have sound,                           for
   the most part,       nearly the fame, the proportion being about
  I   grain to   2  ounces. These substances may be easily distin
  guished, by dissolving them in twice their weight of nitrous
  acid, diluted with a little water, and evaporating to dryness ;
   the dry mass when hot             will assume a beautiful deep rose or
   crimson colour, when the lithic acid is present,                        but will
   continue white         if  heated     even to redness,          or have only a
   flight greenish tinge when there is nothing hut phosphat of
   lime. Their relative proportions may be ascertained by ex
   posing the mixed mass for some time to a red heat iu a                         cru-

evaporate,     leaving the pliosphat        in a pure state.
   The quantity of extractive matter is more variable than
that of any other substance  hysterical or crude urine (as it
has been called) containing hardly any, while that of con
coction abounds with it. This matter yields, by distillation,
water containing the carbonat of ammonia ; this ca/bonat
in  a concrete    state ;   a foetid  empyreumatic oil       ;  a little phos
phorus ; and lastly, a residuum              of animal     coal   difficult la
incinerate    :  in short,     nothing more than the usual products
from animal substances.             If to 1 oz. of this extract be added
1 oz. of the concentrated nitrous acid, diluted with an equal
quantity of water,        a  violent effervescence, accompanied with
heat and the disengagement              of nitrous  gas,    will  take place:
when the action has ceased, and the liquor becomes cold, a
number of shining scales, or crystals, resembling the acid of
borax, will be deposited, which, when well dried on blotting-
paper, will be found to weigh from 5 to 7 dr. or sometimes
more, the proportion varying according to the quality of
the extract and the method             of conducting     the process.     The
figure   of  these scales appears to be that           of flat rhomboid? ;
they have a smooth            greasy feel when pressed          between    the
fingers;    are soluble      in much greater quantity in hoi than
cold water, and also in some degree in alcohol : although re
peatedly washed with this fluid, and dried on blotting-paper,
they still retain acid properties, and strongly redden the syrup
of violets;     they are readily taken         up by the sulphuric and
muriatic     acids    without     commotion      ; but with the nitrous
acid they produce a kind           of  effervescence,   and form very so
luble neutral salts, whose properties have not been sufficiently
examined. Their solution in water does not precipitate lime-
water, nor the muriats of lime or barytes, nor the nitrats of
silver or mercury, in any sensible degree, nor has it any effect
upon the sulphas of iron or acetite of lead ; they do not,
therefore,    contain phosphoric or oxalic acid            :   when thrown
upon a red hot iron, they melt and CTaporate                         in white

   by no means difficult to incinerate            ;   but, when exposed         to
   an intense heat,       they burn with a reddish flame and              a kind
   bf detonation     somewhat       similar to nitrat of ammonia.
      From   these experiments it would appear that this substance
  is an animal acid hitherto unknown,                  and whose basis exists
  in this extractive matter.
      We    shall   now briefly mention the effects produced                   by
  certain reagents on the urine, when in                a  healthy state, and
  likewise when altered            by some morbid        dispositions    of  the
  body.
      Pure ammonia and the fixed alkalies, dropped into healthy
  recent urine, produce a slight cloud, which, on examination,
  will   be found to consist principally            of   phosphat    of lime ;
  about   2  gr. may be     obtained in this way from 4 oz. of urine.
  Lime-water likewise throws down                   a  precipitate which       is
  much more copious, for reasons that must be obvious.
      Nitrous acid,      added to healthy urine,            produces   a slight
 effervescence,      and    gives it more or less       of  a reddish colour,
  but produces no precipitation.             In some diseases,       however,
 particularly general dropsy or anasarca,               this reagent,     when
 dropped into the urine, produces           a milkiness, and in some in
 stances a coagulation,          similar to what wotfld take place             if
 added to the scrum        of   the blood.    When bile        is mixed with
 this fluid,  as  in jaundice, the acid renders it green           :  a similar
 effect is produced       by the muriatic,      and also      in some degree
 by the sulphuric acid         ;  for this purpose,      however, the mu
 riatic is to be preferred.
     The principle of tan, dr infusion of oak-bark, detects ani-                  ,
mal mucilage or jelly, and the quantity of coagulum thrown
down      will in     general     bear   a  certain proportion          to the
extractive matter.          Four oz. of       healthy urine afforded          in
this way    a precipitate of about 4 gr.*

     The   corrosive        niuriat os mercury is                 a very useful     reagent,
as it has no immediate effect upon recent healthy urine ;                                    but
in   every cafe    of   increased action               of   vessels,     more particularly
of the inflammable kind,                       a greater     or   less   milkiness,      and a
whitish precipitate, is instantly produced                          ;    it likewise in some
degree coagulates                dropsical       urine.  Effects somewhat                 simi
lar, although not               so   striking, are produced              by alum.
     The muriat of           barytes detects the phosphoric salts.                         Four
oz. of healthy urine yield with this reagent a precipitate
of 13 gr. equivalent to about 24 or 25 gr. of microcosmic
salt,    consisting         of       such a mixture         of    the phosphats       of    soda
and      ammonia      as are           usually met with in the urine.                      This
substance will therefore                 fliow when these salts are deficient,

effect, but is not so certain, as any little excess of acid might
prevent the separation of the phosphat of iron.
   The nitrats of mercury and silver are decomposed by the
phosphoric and muriatic salts, and likewise, in some                                  degTee,
by the extractive matter ; they can, therefore, be but ot
little   use as reagents.
     The   acetite    of        lead is decomposed                by the muriatic            and
 phosphoric salts           :    with     the last it forms an insoluble preci
pitate j but the rmiriat                 of    lead may be dissolved by             18     or 20
times its weight     of hot water.   This circumstance affords a
ready method      of determining their relative proportions ; for,
if we    precipitate a given quantity of urine by this substance,
dry the precipitate, and                        then    digest      it in     20 time*        iu

of muriat of         lead.   Four oz. of healthy urine treated thii                    iii

                                                            ;                                  in
 distilled water,           7    gr. were taken             up,    the remaining 24 gr.
 were found to be phosphat of lead, equivalent to                                   23 or 24
 gr. of microcosmic                    salt,     as   was     determined        directly          by
 experiment.

     Tt  must     be observed,        that the urine employed          in ihese
'rials should be recent, and not kept for any length of time,
as it is well known that ammonia is soon produced, which
would      render the results           extremely     uncertain.        It  was
thought       proper to give the         quantity    of precipitate thrown
down by the principal               reagents,    when added to healthy
 urine ;     for by this means we shall be better enabled to de
 tect any remarkable deviation from the healthy standard.
The quantity of four            ounces    was conceived       to be the most
 convenient,      as   in many cafes we might not be able to pro
 cure more, and         a less   quantity     could only afford uncertain
 results.
     Upon     the whole,      therefore, we would observe,            that the
 proportion      of extractive matter may, in some measure, be
 determined by an infusion of oak bark, or rather galls ; the
 quantity of phosphoric salts by the muriat of barytes, or
 acetite   of  lead ; that    of   the   muriatic salts by the latter sub
 stance ; the proportion          of   phosphat   of lime    by pure ammo
  nia, or any of the alkalies, and the lithic acid by the pro
  cess already    described.       (See   A.)
     In morbid      states  of the urine,    the coagulable part     of the   se

  oxalic acid, and from which, may                      in a great measure             be
  determined by the appearance of the precipitate : if this
  has the resemblance           of flocks, and subsides slowly, the phos
  phoric acid is the precipitant ; but if it has                 a  powdery form,
  and subsides quickly, it mull be produced                        by oxalic acid.
 To this     mode we know it may be objected, that all animal
 substances      yield     more or      less oxalic acid      :  but this is by no
 means true to the extent               generally supposed          ;  for there are
 several    animal substances,              and    the    extractive       matter of
 healthy urine is one,             from which we have never been able
 to procure any sensible quantity               of this acid.         Of   the differ
 ent parts     of   the blood, the coagulating lymph                      is the only
 one which yields it           in any remarkable proportion                 ;   and we
    "Two    drachms     of very   sweet extract from diabetic urine were taken,
 and treated at the same time with an equal quantity             of nitrous    acid, and
 undcrexactly similar circumstances.           Thcliquorin this case, when pro
 perly evaporated, deposited a        quantity of very transparent crystals, but
 no white powder: these, when properly dried on blotting-paper, weighed
 40 gr. and, on the addition of Cdr. of hot distilled water, were entirely
 dissolved.  The same experiment          was repeated     with the sweet extractive
 matter from the urine        of two   other patients ; the oxalic acid was pro
 cured, but not the least trace ossaciholactic acid.
    " Ilalfan   ounce of honey was treated with 3 oz.           of nitrous  acid in the
 usual manner,     and it yielded about 2 dr.       of pure oxalic acid,    but noiac-
cholactic.    Honey therefore differs essentially from the sugar of milk-;
and, indeed, from most of its obvious properties would appear to be
merely    a modification     of common sugar.
    *'
       In the course of these experiments          I found that 2 dr.    of pretty dry
and sweet diabetic extract yielded, with 1-! dr. of the nitrous acid, from
40 to 60 grains    of crystallized oxalic acid,        being nearly the proportion
which may     be procured      from an equal quantity of common sugar,              if we
make allowance       for the water and saline substances.           Upon the whole,
therefore,   it would appear that this extractive          matter does not contain
the basis   of the saccholactic       acid  a circumstance       which sufficiently
distinguishes   it  firm   the saccharine     part   of  the milk    of animals   ; and
seems to show      tlut  it is nothing more than vegetable sugar,            if we  may
be allowed the expression,        mixed     with a greater or less proportion of
animal mucilage."        C.

believe that the coagulable part          of  the serum, when perfectly
pure, does not afford         it at all.    We     shall   only further re
mark,      that the method by fermentation,                 so  much relied
upon by some, is by no means correct.
    From what has been delivered                it must be evident, that
an attentive       examination of the urine may lead to useful
conclusions in several diseases.
    In   dropsy, the general disease may readily be distinguished
from that depending on morbid viscera, by attending to the
effects produced on this fluid by nitrous acid and the cor
rosive muriat        of mercury.       In   three     cafes which we have
lately met with, the urine coagulated               not only on the addi
tion of nitrous acid, but likewise by heat ; and, in one of
them, which proved fatal in six weeks, the urine appeared
to differ but little from the serum of the blood,                  so remark
able was the coagulation produced by heat and acids.                     This
 coagulable     stat©> however, must not be confounded with that
 produced      by cantharides      5  for we have        seen   some cases   of
 violent strangury from this cause, where the urine had the
 appearance of hydatids *.
     In   the dropsy     proceeding from         diseased    liver and other
 morbid viscera,       the   urine does not coagulate           either by ni
 trous acid or heat        :  it is usually      small   in quantity, high
 coloured, and deposits, after standing,            a considerable    quantity
 of pink-coloured        sediment.     This peculiar sediment we con
 sider as, in some measure,         characteristic of diseased or rather
 scirrhous liver.       On examination we found that it consisted
  of  a  phosplut of lime, some animal matter, to which its red
  colour was probably owing, and a little lithic acid : this last,
  however, was in very small quantity.
      In inflammatory          affections,     particularly     those   of  the  ¦
  chest    and acute     rheumatism, the urine, during the active
   state  of the disease, always affords an immediate precipitate
   with the corrosive        muriat of mercury or alum, and sonic-

                          Experiments on Urine.                            249
times with the nitrous acid          :  when the    disease  takes a favour
able turn,        this effect will in   a  great measure cease, and the
lateritious sediment make its appearance.
     In    fevers,   particularly   such as are accompanied with a
strong action        of vessels, similar phenomena may be observ
ed    j but in this       cafe the lateritious sediment,        which never
fails to make its appearance at the crisis or abatement                 of  the
disease, is much          more remarkable and            constant ; and the
 nitrous acid, when added to the urine before the deposition
 takes place, gives it       a pretty deep red tinge.
      In gout, too, the termination of             the paroxysms      is most
 perfectly indicated by a copious              lateritious sediment ; and
 when this suddenly disappears,                and the urine at the       fame
 time affords        a precipitate with        the muriat of mercury, a
 fresh attack or relapse         may be expected.           We    have gene
 rally found this sediment             to be composed         of lithic acid,
  phosphat of lime, and some peculiar animal matter but
  little soluble      in water   : it has by some been supposed to
  consist entirely       of lithic acid; but this for          the most part
  constitutes      the smallest part.
       In jaundice,     a very small    quantity of bile may be detected
  in    the urine by the nitrous or muriatic acids, but more par
  ticularly      the latter.   When,       therefore,    the urine   ceases   to
   become green on the addition             of  these acids,    we may infer
   that the obstruction to its         passage   into the duodenum is re
   moved, and that, consequently,              the yellowness     of the   (kin,
   Sec.   will  soon disappear.
       The    spasmodic affections that take place in many nervous
   complaints are immediately indicated by the urine, which
   upon the approach of these will most generally be found
   transparent, large in quantity, and abounding in saline, but
   containing hardly any extractive, matter. Similar appear
    ances have been observed to precede delirium in fevers. This
    state   may be discovered by infusion of oak bark, with which
    it will hardly give any precipitate,          and by the acetite    of lead,
    which will produce a very copious             one.

     In scurvy,       and some other putrid diseases, as they           have
 been galled, we make no doubt the appearances                 and proper
 ties  of this fluid      are sufficiently   remarkable, and we would
 recommend it to be examined by those who may have op
 portunities.
    Can internal ulceration           and suppuration     be detected     inr
 this way    ?    In   some diseases   of  the abdomen,     accompanied
 with tumefaction, the urine has been met                with of    a white
 colour,   as   if mixed    with pus   ; and   in a few instances,    when
this change has taken place, the enlargement has suddenly
subsided.    Was this colour owing           to pus? and,   if so, was the
pus taken up by the absorbents,             or was it carried off by the
kidneys, in consequence            of  some direct morbid communi
cation   ?     In     children    subject   to worms,     the   urine    has
likewise been observed            to have at times a white          colour ;
and this has been supposed to proceed                 somehow     from the
chyle.      This peculiar       appearance      is not to be confounded
with what        takes place in local affections      of the kidneys and
bladder, where it also occurs, but is sufficiently understood.
We     have     had no opportunity         of examining this kind of
urine,   and cannot, therefore, give any satisfactory              account
of it.
    We   have thrown out these imperfect hints, merely with a
view to induce others            to pay some attention to a subject
which    has    of   late been much neglected,        but which, in our
opinion, is capable of affording great assistance in the inves
tigation and cure of many diseases.

J.T   has been asserted         of many animals, both warm and cold
blooded, and         particularly of different snakes, poisonous as
well   as harmless,          in the old      t  and new world       J,   that even
when at some distance from other animals, especially those
which serve them as food, they have such                   a fascinating power
over them, that they are forced to approach them just                        in the
same manner as            if  attracted    by them.
    The    rattle- snake has         been particularly celebrated           on ac
count of this property, which has been denominated its fas
cinating power;            and naturalists       have endeavoured       to explain
it on the following principles.                Many    suppose that the small
birds,     squirrels, &c. which have been seen to fall from the
branches of trees, as it were spontaneously, into the mouth
of the rattle-snake,           must have been previously bitten by the
snake ; and that, weakened                by the activity os the poison, they
were incapable either             of flying away or of remaining longer
on the tree. Some suppose that the rattle-snake, under cer

ways of accounting for this phenomenon                                    Dr.      Barton main
the following objections                  :   In regard          to the      first, the common
symptoms              after the bile        of   the rattle-snake              are very         dirsereat
from those which                    have been            remarked            in small            animals
supposed to have                  been    fascinated.            Besides,           this    pretended
fascination can be destroyed,                         and       the    animal           saved,      if   the
snake        be immediately killed                  near       it;     and     in the       last place,
this    so       called fascinating power                is    ascribed to          many        serpents
that are not poisonous, as for example the                                 cJuber corstriSv.
   He       endeavours            to weaken the second mode                        of explanation
 by    remarking, that many observers have                              seen    nothing of            thit
mephitic evaporation                  of    the rattle-snake;                that small             bird*,
when enclosed                in   a   box     with the animal,                     have remains
lively and well             ;   and      that the       rattle-snake often lies                  whole
days under bushes and trees, while thrushes and fly -catchers
nestle       in      them without any danger*.

certain circumstances,       as appears,  have the power          of drawing
towards them         small animals,      merely by fixing their eyes
ftedfastly on them.        In  regard to the ratl'.e-snake, this effect
is produced by the rattle in its tail, the hissing noise os which
makes squirrels, Sec. whether through curiosity, mistake, or
terror,    seem   to approach the animal as it were                spontane
ously.      At any   rate,  I know from     the information          of intel
ligent eye-witnesses,       that it is  a common stratagem of the
young       savages   in America       to conceal themselves           in  the
bushes,     where they imitate the hissing noise of the rattle
snake,     and by these means attract squirrels,             which   they are
then enabled to catch."
     Dr. Barton's objections         to this passage        are as follow?    :
 " I. This     fascinating power is by no means peculiar to the
rattle-snake."       This   is literally what   I  said myself,      with the
addition, that the effect is produced by the rattle. This lazy
animal, when lying on the ground, might certainly employ
that singular organ for enticing animals, as well as the ce
rastes employs its horns for the fame purpose, at least ac
cording to common report.
     3. The author says he has been           assured      by some persons
that    " the rattle-snake, during the time         of its    supposed fasci
nation,      does not    employ its rattle."        It    is very probable
that the cafe here may be altered by circumstances.                       Dr.
Barton, however, was told the contrary                 by other persons.
A Mohigan          Indian    informed     him     that the       rattle-snake
fascinates squirrels     and birds by means        of  its rattle;     and by
its noise can bring down animals from trees.                       An inter
preter, who enabled him to carry on a conversation with a
Choktaw Indian, told him the same thing                 ;    and the experi
 ments of M. Vosmaer are well known.
     3. In regard lo the stratagem. of the savages, Dr. Bar
 ton knows nothing of it j and others, of whom he made
 inquiry, were equally ignorant on the subject. He is there-
    re inclined to believe that I have been imposed on, or that
   lis story perhaps has taken its rife from the following cir
                                                                 cumstance    :

      254                   On the fascinating Pozver
     cumstance     :  The young Indians              place   a reed crosswise id
     their mouth, and by a tremulous motion                    of the  lips imitate
     the cry   of young birds, by which            means they entice the           o!d
     ones,   so  that they can then easily               flioot them.        Id   this
     manner the butcher           bird     (lanifs exaibitor), concealed in
    the thickest bushes, imitates the cries of young birds, and
    thus often catches the old ones, who approach deceived by
    the similarity     of the sound."
        As far  as  I  know, Dr. Mead, about fifty years ago, when
    controverting the idea that Providence had furnished the
    rattle-snake with its rattle to give warning to travellers, was
   the first who asserted that it serves the animal to terrify
   squirrels    and small birds, which are then so flupifiedbvthe
   fight of an enemy         so  terrible to them, that they at length
   drop down and become its prey, and that this is whit the
   Indians call fascination.          He himself        observed,    that when      a
   hawk was perched on a tree in a garden, the small bird»ia
   the    neighbourhood, were            so   stupified    that they      fluttered
   about within       a small circle, but were not in a condition                  to
  escape from       the   claws of the ravenous             animal.      This    ac
  cords perfectly with what Dr. Barton fays himself, ia
  general, that nature has taught different animals what kind
  of animals their       enemies    are,     and that     if small  animals      are
  attracted    by the rattle-snake it may be owing to fear.                       In
  regard to the pretended effect             of the noife occasioned        by the
  rattle, nothing can agree better than what                  Dr. Barton        fart
  himself in regard to the stratagem of the young Indians                      with
 a reed    in their mouth.
      I shall here observe, that        I  obtained my information            from
 Major Gardner, who, with his family, resided many years
 in East Florida.         He is a very intelligent naturalist, an ac
 curate observer,        and    certainly would be very fat from               im
posing upon me.
     Dr. Barton,      after endeavouring by the              above   objections
to refute the before-mentioned three methods                     of accounting
for the fascinating power          of  the ratllc-snake, gives himself a
                                                                          fourth

                                     of thi       "Rattlt-snakc.                               255
fourth method           :   the sum os which               is,   that those birds          which
under certain circumstances, as has been asserted, flutter
into the mouth of the animal, are in general those which
nestle on the ground,                in   buslies,     or on low trees, aud which
having     eggs or young                    in their       nests,       expose      their lives
through      love      for their brood                on     the        approach         of this
dangerous        enemy.
  With this method of explaining                            the phenomenon               I    have
been acquainted since 1785, from the before-mentioned Essay
of Michae'lis, who, among many ways of solving                                    the problem,
gives the following              :
   "   Others       believe          that
                                            it
                                            is       owing merely to the care of
the    old ones         for their young,                 which          throw themselves
between         the latter       and their enemies,                   and    by   these means
become     prey to them.
           a              One of my friends, Mr. David
Colden, at Flushing, an amateur of natural history, and son
of Governor Colden,                   whose service              to    science      is   so   well
known,      assured         me       that he had           several          times   seen      birds
fascinated        by   snakes, but always sound                        the nest     of   the bird
either    with                    in the neighbourhood,
                      eggs or young ones
which made the spectators give up the idea of fascination.
But Mr. Michae'lis adds,   know some instances where no
                                            I
nest could be           in the neighbourhood,                         and  where, though
the snake was           at first at        a     great distance         from the bird,           it
nevertheless        fell towards           it."
 I  would however add another mode of explanation from
DY. Barton's work itself, where he assures us that the result
of his inquiries, whether                   the rattle-snake creeps up trees or
not,     induces him             to believe        the latter to be the cafe.                  He
had an opportunity               of   feeing        many of them, but               he always
observed them on                the ground.            They never move,                  like the
most     part    of    the      other serpents,             in    a    spiral manner, but

COUNT Leopold                          von BERCkTOtB, well known by
his zeal for promoting every thing that                            can tend to public
utility, when at Hamburgh,                     in   the month       of July     last,       pre
sented, among other works, to the society for improving the
arts,    a small      treatise,       written by himself, on the cure and
prevention of the plague*.                          The    society,      in compliance
with the benevolent                wish      of the author, has published the
following extract from                 it,   which on account of its general
importance           to mankind,             and particularly to            Britain,        as   a
commercial nation, we hope our readers                               will thank         us for
laying before them.
   In the      preface,      Count von Berchtold                   pays    a    handsome
compliment to the humanity of                        Mr. Baldwin,            the English
consul, who during                a    long residence in the Turkish empire
made very accurate               observations        on the nature      of the plague,
and      endeavoured         to       discover      some       efficacious means of
guarding        against          that dreadful        and      destructive         scourge.
After long labour            he at length found that this effect may be
produced        by   olive oil.         Persons infected           by   the plague, and
given over           by    the    physicians,         were        perfectly      cured           by

  rubbing      their bodies       over with      warrii oil ; and others not
  yet infected were           preserved      from it by the same means.
  Experiments        were     made, by        Mr. Baldwin's         desire, in the
  hospital of St.         Anthony         at   Smyrna ; and          P.   Luigi di
 Pavia*, chaplain to the hospital, who for twenty- seven
 years has been of so mucb service during periods when this
 disease prevailed, asserts that of all the remedies he ever em
 ployed, olive oil has been the most effectual.                   The following
 information,        in   regard      to the manner        of employing this
 remedy     and    preventive,         was   communicated to Count von
 Berchtold by the above             P. Luigi.
     This excellent cure for the plague consists in rubbing
 olive oil, with the strongest friction, into the whole body of
 the infected person.             When       the body is thus rubbed, the
 pores being opened           imbibe the oil, and          a profuse      perspira
tion takes place,         by which the poisonous infection is again
 thrown out.        This operation must            be performed       the first day
 of   the infection ; and         if only    a weak perspiration ensues,           it
 must be repeated         till it  is observed that every particle           of in
fection is removed,            and that the whole body of the patient
is covered with        a profuse       sweat.     Neither     the patient's shirt
nor bed-clothes must be changed                     till the perspiration        has
     Mr. Howard, in his work on Lazarettos, page 32, says : " Fra. Luigi
de I'avia, prior of the hospital of San Antonio of Smyrna, is a native of
Padua, of the order of RecolcU. He built and established an hospital
about twenty-seven       years since,    and has applied the whole of the pen
sion he receives from his family to its benevolent          purposes.    Patients of
all ranks are admitted without         a fee ; and what is   contributed by those
of  the better  tort h  added   to  the  common stock. He does not pretend to
any skill in medicine, but tries every plausible          experiment vrith unre-
mitted attention, and frequently         performs the most menial offices him
self. Having been infected himself with the plague, be made a vow to at
tend one person at least,     if he  recovered.   His success has induced him to
dedicate the remainder       of his life to that service.  He   has lately adopted
                                       f
the oiled shirt with friction, and mini it a remedy        of more frequent avail
than many others.      He compute?, with the strictest veracity, that of his
patients nearly two thirds have escaped death."             Edit.
    Vol. II.                               S                              entirely

 258                         Xezr Method          to care
 entirely     ceased.     The operation            must    be performed in            i
  rery close apartment ; and at every season of the year there
 must be kept        in it  a sire-pan, over         which      sugar and juniper
 must be thrown,          from time to time, that the vapour which
 thence      arises may promote the perspiration.                      The     whole
  body    of  the patient, the eyes          akne    excepted,        must in this
  manner be anointed, or rather rubbed over with the                         greatest
  care.
     In   the space os     a  year     I  remarked      that this operation, if
 not employed         too late, was attended with the most wonder
 ful effect.      If it be delayed         till  the nervous system           of   the
 patient is attacked         by the disease        and the blood corrupted,
 aster which a decomposition                of it follows,       the remedy is of
 no avail, and the patient must fall a victim.                     The   operation,
 therefore, must be performed as soon as the smallest symptom
 of infection is remarked. In cafes where perspiration was
 flow,   I have   endeavoured        to promote it by making the patient
 drink tea of elder flowers without sugar, from which                         I have
 seen the happiest       effects.
    To    the   above rules Count            von Berchtold           adds   the fol
 lowing remarks         by way of illustration          :   i. The operation of
 rubbing in the oil must be performed                  by means of        a sponge,
and    so  speedily as not to last more than about three minutes,
 a.  The interval       between      the first and the second rubbing,               if
 a second be necessary,         must be determined              by circumstances,
as the recond must not be performed                   till the first perspiration
is over,     and this    will   depend on the constitution              of   the pa
tient      If any   sweat remains upon the (kin, it must be wiped
off with a warm cloth before the second rubbing takes place.
This strong friction with oil may be continued, for several
days successively,        until   a   favourable change           is remarked in
the disease     ; after which the rubbing may be performed in a
more      gentle   manner.        The quantity of oil               requisite   each
time cannot be determined with accuracy                       ;  but, in eenera!,
a pound      may be sufficient.          The    purest and freshest       oil is  the
best  for this operation        :   it must not be hot, but only luke
                                                                             warm.

 Warm.       The      breast and privities must be rubbed softly.                  In
 a cold climate such as ours, those parts only into which the
 oil is rubbed must be exposed naked. The other parts must
 be covered with warm clothing.                      In this manner        each part
 of  the body must be rubbed with                  oil in succession, as quickly
 as possible,      and    be then instantly covered.                If   the patient
 has boils or buboes, they must he rubbed over gently with
 the oil    till   they can be brought              to suppurate      by means of
 emollient       plasters.       The      persons who attend       the patients    to
 rub in the oil must take the precaution to rub themselves
 over in the like manner, before they engage                    in  the operation.
 They     must,      if possible,      avoid the breath      of  the patient, and
 not be under any apprehensions                   of catching    the infection.
     P. Luigi     then fays       :   In order   to prevent the patients        from
 losing their strength,             I  prescribed     for them, during soup or
 five days, soup made of vermicelli boiled in vinegar without
salt.    I  gave them six or seven times a day a small                      spoonful
of   preserved      sour cherries ;          preserved not with honey, but
with sugar,       as the   former might have occasioned                a  diarrha.
When convinced            that the patients were getting better,              I usu
ally gave them the fifth morning a cup of good Mocha coffee,
with a piece of toasted biscuit (biscotio) prepared with sugar,
and    I doubled       the latter according to the strength                 and im
provement        of my    patients.
    At dinner       and    supper       I  allowed them      for   15  or so days
nothing but rice or vermicelli boiled in water.                          After that
period, I increased            the quantity        of  bread   in proportion to
their appetite.          In     summer        they   had   soup made of smali
pompions,         and   of  herbs       in winter, without any other addi
tion than a little oil of almond.-. I gave them also, according
to their condition,           either some oranges or           a very     ripe pear,
boiled   if in winter,      and as much toasted bread as might enable
them to digest their food easily and leave them some appetite
remaining.          Aster the thirtieth or thirty-fifth day I allowed
them morning            and evening soup made from a fowl or neck
of lamb;      but    I  did not allow them flesh till aster the fortieth

breaking-out of pestilential boils.                                     After the fortieth             day        I
allowed them to              eat    boiled          as       well       as   roasted      veal,       and        to
drink moderately             of wine            ;       but        I recommended                to them        to
abstain from fish, salted provisions, pork,                                    four fruits,           and, in
general, every thing that either by quantity                                         or   qualitymight
occasion     indigestion.
   This     regimen        has been the result                           of observations             made in
tbe course        of twenty-seven                   years,              during   which           I   have at
tended      patients       attacked             by the              plague.          It   has been          ap
proved by the ablest physicians ; and long                                            experience            has
shown that it is the               bestcalculated to guard against the                                    dan
gerous consequences                 of this horrid disease.
   According            to the accounts                      of Mr. Baldwin, among                          the
thousands         who died of the plague in Upper and Lower                                           Egypt*
there     was      not one           person                 who         had    been       employed           in
carrying oil j from which                           I       concluded that oil must                   also be
a preservative           against          it.           I    therefore        put in      practice         thi»

horrid    disease    by anointing herself with oil.           The    same year
two persons attacked by the plague remained                    several days in
the fame house with              the numerous family          of M. Natale
Pezer,     a Ragusan ;      but the family employed             oil,  as  above
mentioned, and were perfectly free from infection.
   In   a word,       this wonderful preservative has so much re
putation at Smyrna, that almost all the inhabitants, though
perfectly found, when the unfortunate infection makes its
ap[>carance,       immediately secure themselves against it by                re
peated rubbing with oil.
   When this operation               is used as a preventive,         it is not
necessary that it mould be performed in the fame manner as
on those infected.          As it    is not done for the purpose         of pro*
moting perspiration,             but merely to prevent          the infection
from penetrating through the pores, it is not requisite that it
should be performed           with the fame speed as when for curing
the disorder;        nor is it necessary to abstain fiom flefli and to
use soups ;      but it will be proper to use only fowls or veal for
ten or twelves days boiled or roasted, without any addition or
seasoning (condiments).              In   the last place,   it will be neces
sary to      guard     against    fat and indigestible food, and such
liquors    as  might put       in  motion or inflame the mass of the
blood.
   Careful      and     repeated    rubbing of the whole body with
oil prevents        the breaking out of new boils, which often
take    place     after the oil has been first used.         The oil    must be
applied    as soon as possible after the          infection has been com
municated       :  if omitted for four or        five days,   it will be of no
effect.      Diarrha in this         disease is a symptom      of death,    and
difficult to be cured        ;   but the editor adds, in         a   note, that
Father Luigi, by the            use of oil,    was enabled    to recover four
persons who had been already attacked by it.                       The abun
dant perspiration produced by the oil not only prevents new
buboes     from breaking out, but in               a few  dM^,r'ng»        thole

Ur.    George Pearson, an English chemist, well known by
his very useful labours, and particularly his ingenious expe
riments on the decomposition of the carbonic acid, in his
 Experiments  and Observations tending tojhoiu the Compo
sition and Properties of Urinary Ctncretions, inserted in the
 Philosophical Transactions for 1798, endeavours to prove
that the calculi of the human bladder are composed of a
particular matter hitherto not well known to chemists;
which Scheelc, according to his opinion, neglected to study,
and which he calls the uric oxyd.  As this conclusion tends
 to overturn completely the discovery                         of   the illustrious Swede,
 confirmed             by Bergman, respecting                 the acid         of   the human
 urinary calculus, and the result of very numerous experi
 ments which I since made on that animal concretion, (a re
 sult which served to confirm in many points the first data                                   of
 Scheele, according to which the expression of lithic acid had
 been adopted in the new nomenclature,)                                I thought it my duty
 to examine                with particular care the long dissertation of Dr.
 Pearson.              I    was besides induced to do to by the lively inter
 estwhich it is pretty generally known I take in every thing
 that regards the analysis of animal substances; and the more
 so at present,                   on account     of   the researches respecting           urine
 on which              I    and    Cit. Vauquelin          have been for several years
 employed.                  Instead    of finding         ourselves anticipated on this
 subject          by this able English chemist,                    1   was not a little asto
 nistied to discover                in his   dissertation     a great         number of asser-

have accurately comprehended the labours                              of    Scheele,            and
that he seems to have                   overlooked        the   researches              which         I
published on the fame subject, though he quotes me in re
gard to some facts, but only as one of those who may be
considered            as almost    a stranger to the object                which            he bad
in view.          It    also    appears to me, that              the experiments                   be
made, instead of contradicting the facts observed by Scheele
and myself, and the consequences I have thence deduced m
regard to the nature               of urinary concretions, are                   rather eil-
culated to confirm them.
    What          I    mean to establish in this memoir requires,                                    18,
That   I    should give an exact account                  of Dr. Pearson's experi

served       by   Scheele       and Bergman        ;    and that       1       add to         them
those which       I     observed myself:           and,    3d, That        I      draw         from
this comparison those inductions which                               form the               princi

masterly dissertation             of    the Swedish chemist,               we          shall find

  acid   sublimate obtained by Scheele by treating the urinary
  calculi by fire, was taken for the fame as the precipitate of
  their solution in fixed alkali by an acid, since the French
  chemists,     in announcing            that a portion of the lithic acid
  was sublimated without decomposition, proposed the process
  of sublimation to obtain              the lithic   acid;  and since     I have
  particularly described          the    decomposition of the greater part
  of this acid     by fire, when        I  announced its property of being
  convertible into the Prusiic acid.              But  I (hall now proceed to
  detail the experiments, as             I shall have occasion several times
  to (how that Dr. Pearson has been singularly misled in re
  gard to our     lithic acid.
     [Cit. Fourcroy then            gives     a pretty full account      of Dr.
  Pearson's    experiments, which it would be useless to repeat
 here, as we have already in the last two numbers of the pre
 sent work laid the paper             at   full length before our readers.
 On Dr.     Pearson's     expression (Phil. Mag. vol. ii. p. 130),

 *' tain the acid sublimate            of Scheele, or lithic acid of         the
 ' new system       of chemistry,"          the French chemist makes the
 following     remark      :
                               "I   must observe that these words prove
 that Dr. Pearson did not understand very clearly the results
 of Scheele      and   of     the French chemists ; for neither the one
 nor    the   other     have ever considered          as real  lithic  acid  the
 product sublimated             by fire from the urinary calculus,           but
only    the matter      of   the whole calculus precipitated         in crystals
 from the boiling water with which it has been treated, or from
its solution in fixed caustic alkali by an acid.                I must remark
here also,     that Scheele in his dissertation           has accurately dis
tinguished this sublimated             portion from the real acid of the
urinary calculus not treated by fire; that he has compared
it  to the volatile acid salt         of amber     ; and  that Cit. Vauque-
lin, in an article which he furnished for Deschamp's Traki
de la LUbolomie, vol. iftp. 133, &c. took great care to point
out that the sublimated            produce of the calculus of the blad
                                                                            der

abridgment of Dr. Pearson's          paper as follows    :
                                                            "I   thought

experiments     and results, in order that it might be more easy
to compare     what he has done with the researches of Scheele
and those made by myself.          By giving     a similar abridgment
of  the latter also, it may be then seen whether           Dr. Pearson
has made useful additions to the discoveries which preceded
his labour, and whether the conclusions which he thinks
himself authorized to deduce from his experiments                  can be
found in them."         Cit. Fourcroy    then proceeds as follows           :]
AJlort    Account of the Researches of Schecle and Hcrgmant
                    and of those made by myself.
   When     the illustrious Scheele read in 1776, to the Academy
of Stockholm, his examination of thebezoar, or               stone   of the
human bladder, no one then had an accurate                    idea   of the
nature of this concretion, though Margraf has already ob
served,   that it was not formed of an absorbing earth,             as   a as
pretty generally believed       before   him, and     as   has been re
peated so often since      in many works on medicine.             Scheele
observes in the     beginning of his dissertation, that           he exa
mined several calculi, smooth, rough, or angular;                  that he
found them       possess the   fame    nature and properties:           it is
therefore    the   history  of  the genus     that he meant       to give,
His memoir is divided into         ten sections.     To   ascertain pro
perly the value of his labour,         I must here make the reader
follow him through these sections.
   I. The    sulphuric acid diluted produces         no effect on the
calculus;    but concentrated      by distillation it dissolves it    :   the
solution distilled to dryness leaves a black coal, giving off
sulphureous acid fumes.
   II.  The muriatic acid, diluted or concentrated,                 has no
effect ever by ebullition on the urinary calculus.
                                                            III.    Weak

    III.  Weak nitric         acid attacks it cold       : with the assistance
of  heat there is produced             an effervescence       and red vapour;
the calculus is entirely dissolved,                and carbonic acid     is dis
engaged.         This solution        is acid, even when saturated         with
the    calculus      :  it gives a beautiful red colour to the skin in
half   an hour ;        when evaporated it becomes of a blood red ;
a drop    of   acid then added          destroys the      colour; it  does   not
precipitate the mari.it          of barytes nor metallic solutions,        even
with     the    addition of an alkali          ;   the latter   makes   it turn
yellow    ;   a superabundance           of alkali    gives it by digestion     a
rose   colour,      as  well  as the    property of precipitating       fulphat   .
of iron black, fulphat of copper green, nitrat of silver gray,
the superoxygenated               nitrat of mercury and solutions of
zinc and lead          white.     The fame nitric solution of the calcu
lus of the bladder gives, with lime water, a white precipitate,
which dissolves without effervescence in the nitric and muri
atic acids without destroying their acidity.                   The oxalic acid
added to the nitric solution gives no precipitation.
    IV.    Potash       united to the carbonic acid does not dissolve
the urinary         calculus, either hot or cold ; but              a  perfectly
caustic     ley     of  the   fame     alkali, without       any  trace   of  the
carbonic acid, dissolves it even cold. This solution is yellow,
of a sweetish taste ; it is precipitated by all the acids, even
the carbonic ; it does not render lime water turbid ; it de
composes        and precipitates        metallic solutions, those of iron
brown, of copper gray, of silver black, of zinc, mercury and
lead white : it exhales an odour of ammonia.
    V. Lime         water dissolves       the calculus by digestion ; aco
 parts almost are necessary             to  take up one ; it then loses its
 (harp taste     ;'  this solution is precipitated in part by acids.
    VI.   Pure water dissolves entirely the stone of the human
bladder     ;  but it is necessary to boil, for some time, 360 parts
 with one part of the calculus reduced to powder to effect a
 solution.      This solution, being             then    complete, reddens a
 tincture of turnsole ; does not                  render lime water tubid ;
                                                                             and
                                                                                    r

  and on cooling deposits         almost    every  thing it contains            in
  small crystals.
     VII.  Seventy-two parts (grains) of this calculus,                distilled
 in a small glass retort over an open fire urged ib as to                 bring
 the  vessel  to a red heat,       produced water      of ammonia           ljjte
 hartshorn, and a brown sublimate without oil                   :  there      re
 mained      twelve parts or        J  of a black charry substance,
 wliich preserved     its  colour   on   red hot iron in the open air.
 The brown sublimate, weighing              28 parts, grew      white by a
 second    sublimation    ;  it was destitute of smell, even             when
 moistened     by an alkali ; its taste was acid         ; it dissolved in
 water by ebullition ; alcohol dissolved it             also, but in less
 quantity than water : it did not precipitate lime water,                  and
 resembled    the succinic acid.
    From the facts in these seven sections, Scheele concludes
 that the urinary calculus does not contain either sulphuric
 acid   or lime   ; but that it is composed of a concrete arid,
 oily, volatile, mixed with a little gelatinous matter, which
 acquires new properties and changes its nature by the nitric
 acid.
    VIII.    He   fays he found a little      of this  acid   in all urine,
even in that     of children.       This liquor    evaporated      to  , J, of
its weight (14 pounds reduced to 2 ounces) deposits a subtle
powder similar to the calculus, which adheres to the vessel,
and which the caustic          alkali dissolves very easily.         The   de
posit from the urine       of patients labouring under            fevers ex
hibited the fame nature ; it is formed in close             vessels   as well
as  in  those that are open ; it          is redissolved by means of
heat,   and its precipitation is owing only to the cooling of
the urine.
    IX. All    urines thus contain         phosphat    of lime,       kept in
solution by an excess of the phosphoric acid ; which is the
reason    that it reddens blue paper, and deposits a white
powder by means of ammonia.                 Urine  gives   of it yy9 of its
weight.      This precipitate       dissolved   in   the   nitric acid is
                                 3                                  rendered

              Dr.   Pearson's  Experiments on Calculi.               26*9
rcnJered tubid by the addition of the sulphuric acid, which
forms with it      a  sulphat of lime; the supernatant          liquor,
when evaporated, leaves the phosphoric acid after separating
the nitric acid by evaporation.         The urine of diseased per
sons is more acid, and contains more phosphat          of lime, than
that of healthy persons.
   X. It    results from all these     facts, fays Scheele in con
cluding    his dissertation,  that urine,     independently of the
substances already known,        viz.  the muriats  of polasti,    soda,
and ammonia, the phosphat          of  soda and ammonia,      and     an
oily  extractive    matter, contains     a concrete acid, hitherto
unknown,       (which forms the urinary calculus,) and phos
phat of lime.
    I have mentioned with accuracy, and without omitting a
single experiment, the labour       of Scheele,  because it appeared
to me necessary to do so, in order to establish          an  easy   and
precise comparison       between    his experiments and those of
Dr. Pearson.
   The   discovery   of Scheele, communicated       to the Academy
of Stockholm,      was confirmed by Bergman,        who   gave under
the title of an addition,     a memoir     containing    his own ex
periments on the stone of the human bladder, with which
he was occupied       at the fame time as his pupil and friend ;
and it may be readily perceived what must be the weight of
the assent of that celebrated man, who first introduced into
the description of chemical phenomena, and the reasoning
on them, the purity, precision, and method of the geome
tricians.     In announcing that his experiments conducted
him   to the farm- conclusion, viz. that the urinary concretion
was composed chiefly       of a  particular acid j he says he found
some differences,     which, though he ascribes them to those of
substances which       they had both examined, were, however,
found in all those which        he treated.     It is of importance
that  I  should relate here the differences      observed   by Berg
man, because they may          serve to  explain those which were
observed     by Dr. Pearson      himself, and which      led  him      to
                                                                   draw

  ijo                 Fourcroy's Examination         of
  draw   a conclusion contrary to that of the illustrious Swedish
  chemists   whom he combats in his memoir.
     1. Bergman     never    succeeded     so  far as  to dissolve    com
  pletely urinary concretions in distilled water, or in the           nitric
  acid ; but at the fame time the greater part          was dissolved      in
  the latter, especially when precautions were taken to            employ
  an excess  of the   solvent, fragments        of calculus instead        of
 powder,     a vessel sufficiently small      to permit the      insoluble
 matter to be collected      ; and by keeping the matters at a heat
  near that of boiling        water, there was separated a white
  spongy   matter, on which water, alcohol, acids, and am
 monia had no action       ;  dividing itself into very minute par
 ticles by ebullition,    though still insoluble ; giving by sire a
 coal difficult to be incinerated, and of which the ashes were
 insoluble in the nitric acid.          He   never had enough      of this
 substance   lo enable him       to become better      acquainted with
 its nature.
     2. Though the nitric solution of the calculus is not pre
 cipitated by the oxalic acid, Bergman thinks that lime may
 be found in it in union with some matter that prevents it from
 being precipitated     ; and he finds a proof      of this in  the asties
 of burnt urinary calculus, which exhibited the fame pheno
 mena as lime in his experiments. The nitric solution of cal
 culus evaporated to dryness, and burnt or calcined to white
 ness, gave him also traces        of lime.     The concentrated       sul
phuric acid thrown into this solution when evaporated,                 ex
hibited likewise small crystals of the sulphat of lime.              This
earth rarely exceeds rv'v      in   the urinary calculus.
    3. The concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves the calculus
with effervescence by the means of heat ; it becomes of a
blackish brown colour:         a  little water added to    ihii  solution
makes it immediately coaguhtte           ;  a great deal  of this liquid
redissolves   the whole coagulum,           and  forms a solution of a
yellowish brown colour.            The muriatic     acid has no action
on the urinary calculus, and deprives it of no part of its
Time.
                                                           4. Bergman

              Dr.    Pearson's. Experiments on     Calculi.          27 1
    4. Bergman frequently mentions the red colour assumed
by the nitric solution of the urinary calculus when sponta
neously evaporated in the air, or by the action of fire; even
when it does not contain an excess of free nitric acid : he
observes that this colour disappears        by the addition    of  acids
and alkalies ; that it becomes black by the action           of a strong
fire ; that the calculus thus dissolved and evaporated is after
wards soluble in all acids       ; that by employing the     nitric acid
too much concentrated, the calculus is wholly reduced into
froth  ;  that the sudden swelling-up of the solution when ra
pidly heated is considerable, and the foam of a bright red ;
that alkalies do not separate the calculus from the nitric acid,
but unite with it       as they do when two acids are presented to
them ; that the red mass obtained by evaporation of the ni
tric solution is very different from the concrete acid of the
calculus in its colour, its deliquescence,           the rose-coloured
 tint which     the smallest quantity   of it communicates     to water,
 its solubility, and its loss of colour by the muriatic acid, the
spots    which it     leaves on the skin, on bones, glass,        paper,
 especially   by the aid of time and heat.        He  ascribes these re
 markable effects to the alteration produced         in the native acid
 of the urinary calculus by         the nitric acid, rather than to a
precipitation with the latter.
    5. Bergman, in mentioning that he made many other ex
 periments on the stone of the bladder, takes care to point out
 that they prove nothing more or any way different from
 what Scheele has said in his excellent memoir.                  All  re
 searches,    fays he at the end     of his addition, for   the purpose
 of discovering     a remedy    for this disease, ought to be founded
 on  a  perfect knowledge of the properties of the calculus. He
 observes    that    alkalies are the only     truly active   remedies,
 the efficacy of which has been acknowledged by medical
 experience,      in concert with chemical researches.         He con*
 eludes his note by announcing           that he hoped to be able to
  determine more accurately whether all calculi          of the bladder
  were really    of the  fame nature.     But during the eight year3
                                                                  which

 VIII.   Observations         on the   Garden Spider, and the Method it
     employs to     conJlruS its Web.           By an anonymous Author.
     From the Journal de Physique, Vendemiaire,                   An. VII.
  AHOUGH             the natural history of insects be not the par
 ticular object      of my      studies,    I never neglect any facts, re
lating     to   that science, with which accident may make me
acquainted.         In the month of Germinal               last   I had before
my windows            some stirubs in ports       :  and one day,      when it
 was very      warm,      I  removed      them from the fun, and placed
them on the floor of my chamber.                       Casting my eyes on
them about an hour after,               I was  not a little   surprised to fee
a pretty, small, vertical spider's            web,    which    extended   from
one shrub to another.              It  was not above two inches in dia
meter; but the concentric circles and radii were exceedingly
numerous.          Nothing could          be more elegant ;      and the cen
tre   of it was quietly occupied             by. a small spider,    not larger
than the head of a pin.             I  was certain that   th'13  web had not
existed an hour before, as             I had removed     my pots one after
the other     ;  and    I   could not conceive how           so  much work,
that must have required            so  many journeys,       could have been
completed        so soon j but what increased my astonistiment
not a little was, that each pot was placed in a small vessel
filled with water. Supposing then that the spider had gone
from     the one shrub to the other to six its threads,                it must
have been obliged to cross the water, which appeared to me
improbable, as the animal was not of the aquatic kind.
    I  then recollected a similar fact, which            I had observed     the
                                                                           year

                    Observations          on the      Garden Spider.                         273
year before in company with some of my friends, and which
had appeared to us equally wonderful. We were walking
in             of a country-seat, much neglected, for several'
     the gardens
years, where we saw an alley of horse beeches, the branches
of which left a passage of scarcely five or six feet, barred up,
as it were, by a multitude                 of spiders'        webs in a vertical po
sition.        As   we began to inquire how                      the spiders had been
able to convey        their threads from one                   side   of    the alley to the
other through         so   many leaves and branches, one of the com
pany said that the threads, in all probability, had been floated
to the other side by the wind, and that they had been caught
and retained by the opposite branches.                          The problem               seemed
thus resolved, and the conversation                         turned upon some other
subject.         The fact, however, which                    had taken place in my
chamber, where the air was in a                          of perfect tranquillity,
                                                      state
clearly convinced me that the                      threads of these insects had
not been transported              by the wind          ;   and that they must have
some direct method             of conveying them from                           one    place to
another.
     I   was     then induced to suppose that these spiders                                 were
themselves acquainted               with    some method               of projecting their
threads,       from the point where they are stationed, to another
at which they wish           10   arrive.        In    consequence              of this   idea,   I
resolved to make some experiments.                            I removed, by means             of
a feather, the small spider from the middle of its web; and
to be sure that no floating thread adhered to   moved                            it,  I
another feather several times around that on which the
spider was placed.         I   then gave     it   gentle shake, which made
                                                   a
the insect descend          seven or        eight inches, extending its legs
and spinning.         It    then remained stationary                       in   a   horizontal
situation, having all its legs folded up on its belly, where
                                                                                              by it
had applied its thread          ;    so   that   it   seemed to be suspended
the middle of its body.              I       saw      it   from time to time make
half     a   turn, very speedily, sometimes to the right and some
times to the left, and this movement was perfectly sponta
neous    ;    for there was no agitation in the air or the feather,

  374             Observations       on the Garden Spider.
  which   I  had fixed to the back         of a  chair.    After being sus
  pended in this manner         half an hour,     the  small spider made 2
 sudden spring towards my breast, raising itself              rapidly by     an
  oblique line, which          made      an angle of 40 or 500 with the
 perpendicular.         I  repeated this experiment several times:
 and   I always   observed that the spider, aster having remained
 a few moments suspended, constantly rose in an                  oblique di
 rection, in order to reach some neighbouring object.
    My attention being diverted by something else, I did not
 then carry my observations             any further; but in the month
 of Thermidor      last, having found under my shrubs one            of tbeie
 spiders, about the size        of    a grain   of hemp-feed, I resumed
 my former experiments           ;   and,  being furnished with a mag
 nifying   glass,   1 attentively examined        every thing that passed
at the moment when             the spider was      in suspension.      It wax-
 not long before      I  saw,   very distinctly,     a pretty large   thread
issue in a jet from its anus, and rife diagonally, making                with
 the thread of suspension an angle of about 450. This thread
 was lengthened about seven or eight inches, at least, per
second.     When       the thread reached a neighbouring              body it
remained there attached            ;   and the insect then making half
a   turn,    darted out another on the                opposite    side,   and
proceeded     thus alternately five or six times.          The spider then
mounted with rapidity, aud traversed these different threads,
Which became stretched horizontally,                 by  I know not what
operation, though at first they would have formed an angle
of 900, the summit of which was occupied by the suspended
animal.      Soon afler      I saw a multitude      of other   threads esta
blished between these principal ones; and the work was car
ried on with so much rapidity, that it was impossible for                 ot
to follow it minutely.            The net work seemed as if formed
by magic ; but no doubt remained to me respecting the
principal fact, which is the emission of the large transversal
threads, an operation not performed by chance, but design,
and which      might       be compared      perhaps    to the extension     of
the long tentacula        of certain marine animals.
                                                                           Ai

                         Observations             on the       Garden Spider.                                  275
.    As        the threads,              when they             issue   from the body of the
animal, ascend always obliquely, it appears to me that this
is produced by the effect of                          a   double impulse.                      On        the one
part the insect forces them out horizontally,                                                  and       on    the
other their own specific lightness makes them mount                                                       verti
cally, from which there results an oblique direction.                                                         This
specific        lightness           is owing,         in my opinion, to                    a    kind of        ve
sicle,     sliaped   like a very elongated Prince Rupert's drop,
which          is at the end of the thread at the moment of its
emission.              This        vesicle, the substance               of which               seems to be
exceedingly thin, is perhaps silled with some fluid, light, and
at the same time viscous,                             which       possesses the             double pro
perty     of making                 the    thread ascend, and                   of cementing it                 to
the bodies which it touches.
     In   a    word,        I    have no doubt that the garden spider directs
at   pleasure, and                 towards     a      determined point, those threads
which it throws out ; for                         I       remarked, in the                  alley above-
mentioned, that all the webs were vertical and                                                 at   right an
gles      to     it,   which could not                    be considered              as    the        effect    of
chance.       hope, therefore, that entomologists will pursue
                 I
these observations, in order to discover,  poflible,    what               if                         by
sense     the spider judges either                        of the       distance or the position
of   the bodies to                 which     it    directs its threads.                    I         observed
that the situation in which                           it   was when           it   emitted           them did
not allow        it    to fee the          place          to which            they    were           directed.
Besides,       I   have some reason to doubt that the eyes                                          of    spiders
are actually the organs                     of vision.          I      l»ave often             presented to
these insects different bodies,                           by   which they were in no man
ner frightened,                   though exceedingly near to them, and they
must certainly have seen them, had they been endowed with
the faculty            of       sight.   I   have even cut              off some of their claws
without          their           perceiving the sciffars                       and        yet       it   is   well
                                                                       so ;
known that the mistrust of spiders                               is           great, that,               as soon
as   they have the least perception                              of    a      strange       object, they
betake themselves                    to flight.            On      the other hand,                   if       their
web be agitated in the slightest manner, as                                          it   would be             by   a

 fly,  they are seen to run out that moment,              and never       retire
 back until     they    have    assured   themselves,    by   feeling,      Uui
 they have been deceived.             An animal endowed with               figtt
 would not commit such errors. Besides, the curious                 history of
 their amours     ;  the different manuvres          they practise      before
 they touch each        other ; their fear and mistrust when                the)'
 first approach, and their precipitate flight,          all announce        that
they are very uncertain in regard to the object presented                      t»
 them : it is only by means of feeling that they arc ablt                      to
discover that they have not to do with an enemy.
     My doubt     on this head is not confined merely to               spiders,
but extends to all white-blooded              animals,    the    crustacean
excepted.      It  is probable that the antennæ and other                tenta-
cula perform, in infects and worms, the office of the                   organ*
of sight. That multitude of eyes assigned        to flies, butterflies,&c-
in my opinion, is by no means agreeable to the progress of oa-
ture, which never forms any thing superfluous.                      But what
could be .more       useless than that profusion        of  organs of        tn«
fame     fense, especially     in beings which, by the          shortne&of
their life,   are the least exposed to the loss         of  these organs        ;
while     the  largest animals,       destined to exist for a century
have received only a double organ             of fight, which        is so  ne
cessary to them      ? This would      be an absurdity     which     we can
not suppose to exist.
    I  shall  here add, in regard to the garden spider, that                  as
Nature is infinitely wise, fhecould not intrust to chance                 thetf
most essential means        of  existence.     Had   she  made     the fabn-
cation of their web to depend on            a breath  of wind,     that war
not take place,       she would have exposed them to the dang*'
of perishing.       It  was necessary,      therefore, that     she    fbouW
                                                                             w
put under their disposition direct means ; and this seem»
be actually the case. But we must generalise this conse
quence,     and conclude, that when any mean is indispensably
necessary for the preservation          of  a species   of living     beings
Nature always places this mean in their own power.                        She
has rendered     it precarious      at no lime   ; and it never depenw
                                                                        upon

from two well-informed                 naturalists, that it was commonly
believed that the garden spider merely suffered its threads to
float in the wind by chance,                     I   thought it might be of some
utility   to publish the result            of my          observations.
IX.   On the System         of Forces.            By      J.    C.   Delametherie.
          From Journal de Physique, Brumaire,                              An VII.
Geometricians,                         accustomed               to precise mathematical
demonstration, cannot reconcile themselves to the difficulties
which occur in the explanations given by physics to the                                     dif
ferent phenomena of nature.                          They        prefer the method               of
the great       Newton, which              is,   to calculate the effects whatever
may be the            causes; and hence has been introduced the
system     of   forces,   which        seems to gain ground                    in   a   singular
manner.          Kant      is    one of the first who announced                           it     in
Germany.             He   distinguishes          two kinds of physics, the dyna
mic and atomist.           He calls        atomist physics that                which    teaches
that the        primitive       parts of matter are composed                        of   atoms
or indivisible parts, and which endeavours                               to explain all the
phenomena of nature                   by   the action or impulse of different
fluids.      The      second,      which         he calls dynamic                physics,    ap
pears to him preferable.                   It    supposes matter to be composed
 of moleculæ always divisible.                            This matter       is   actuated        by
 two forces      :   ist. the attractive; and, 2d. the repulsive.                           The
 atomists       consider fluids as composed                     of   small solid moleculae.
 Kant     does not admit these solid moleculae.                          Fluids, according
 to   him,      are such originally,                 so   that we cannot conceive                 a
 part of   a    fluid which       is   not fluid. These two forces, accord
 ing to Kant, produce several other forces, viz. 3d, the calo
 ric force, which         is    the principle         of    heat and      of   all the pheno
 mena ascribed to fire            ;    4th, the luminous                  force, which            is
 the principle of light and                 all the phenomena depending on
it;   5th, the electric force, which                       is   the cause      of all   the phe-
                                            T        3                                  nomcua

  *78                    On the Sjs!em of Porce*.
  nomena ascribed        to electricity ; 6th,      the magnetic fore*,
  which produces all the phenomena ascribed lo magnetism.
  Consequently all the phenomena of heat, light, electricity,
  magnetism, accordingto him, are modifications of ibe attrac
 tive and repulsive force      of the   first parts  of matter, and there
 exists neither caloric fluid, luminous fluid, electric            fluid, nor
 magnetic fluid. This system has            numerous partisans in Ger
 many, and it has even been extended still further.                7th.  The
 galvanic force.        Humboldt     supposes that the phenomena            of
 galvanism       may be explained      by   a particular force, which be
 calls the galvanic.        Humboldt         however    always speaks of a
 galvanic fluid,     as several os Kant's pupils speak of the calexic
 fluid, the luminous fluid, the electric fluid, and the magnetic
 fluid.     But   these are mere denominations, which express             the
 unknown causes of the phenomena of heal, light, electridtv,
magnetism        and galvanism. 8th.       The vital force, vita prefria.
 Blumenbach, to express the          phenomena of vitality, supposes
 a  particular force, which he calls vita propria.              9th.   Sistu
ftrmattvus.         The   fame   learned man, to express the         forma
 tion of organized bodies,        supposes a particular force,        which
 he calls nijusformativus.         This amounts        to the fame as   that
 called by other philosophers         the plastic force.
      B. rthez believes also, that we ought to consider all the
 vital (unctions in man and animals, as produced by pecu
 liar forces and directed according to the primordial laws                 of
 a vital principle.        "I  think    I   have   found, adds he, that
 there exists in ihc living muscles a force           of    the fixed situa
 tion of     the   molcculæ and of their fibres           (tending to rest)
 different from the forces of contraction and dilatation (tend
 ing to motion), the existence of which has not been before
 so   much     as suspected.    The    forces  of  the vital principle are
 inherent in each part of the body which they animate, and
 exercise     there  the movements peculiar to that             part.   The
 sound method of philosophising in each natural science                  ad

      As this         expression,        occult causes,         which modern philoso
phy has had             so   much difficulty to hanifli, is inconsistent with
the         generally adopted                ideas,   I   shall here offer some reflec
tions on that subject, as well as on Kant's system of forces.
Iu my opinion, the manner of cultivating natural philoso
phy ought to be considered under several points of view.
I    fit.   Some confine themselves to                    a   description of the objects
and phenomena that occur.                             The zoologist describes ani
mals,         their manner of living,                   and of reproducing their
species.           The botanist              docs the fame          in regard       to       plants.
The mineralogist in the like manner describes minerals and
their external qualities. The physical geographer describes
the surface of the earth    and the astrouomer the celestial
                                              ;
bodies,          their movements, &c.                      ad. Others go still further.
The anatomist                  explores       the internal parts     of animals and
vegetables,            and describes their structure                 ;   and      the    chemist
analyzes them,               as   well as minerals, to discover the principles
of which                  3d. The geometrician calculates
                   they are formed.

of the        causes      by   which they may be produced                    ;    and he fur
nishes the mechanist with calculations for constructing and
directing his machines.                       4th.    In      the last place, others en
deavour to discover the causes of all the phenomena exhibited
 by     these bodies, as well as to explain the mechanism                                of their
different movements.                         This    is   the science    of physics.            But
it   has      so   often Jed men into error, that true philosophers are
exceedingly difficult                   in   regard to the explanations                 it   gives.
This has induced them to have recourse to the system of
forces, by which they express                         a    fact, the effects of which
they calculate               without attempting to trace them                           to    their
causes       :   as   they cannot, for example, yet explain the pheno
mena of vitality, they express them                            by   the words     vital
                                                                                             forct^
whatever may be their cause.                    The vital force, then,                   is    (hat
which         produces       the       phenomena of vitality; but we                     a.re   ig

 cienis, for exampl?, not being acquainted with the weight
 of the atmosphere, could not explain why water did not rise
 in   a       pump but to         a   certain height.           They    said it was the
 effect        of       an occult cause ; that is to fay,              of   a cause with
 which          they were unacquainted,                 which was concealed                 from
 them, occulta.
      In      the like manner we ought only to understand by the
 word force the cause                 of a general fact, whether this                cause be
 known or not.                  This    is the acceptation           in which        the word
was understood                 by Newton.             He   observed       that all      bodies
had a tendency               towards each other, and he called the                       cause
of    this general phenomenon attractive                        force, or attraction.
He      observed also, that in certain circumstances they repelld
each          other;      and he called the cause            of this second           general
phenomenon repulsive                    force, or repulsion.              This       mode      of
expression may be applied to all the grand phenomena of na
ture, and we may use the word force in the following                                   differ

employ that term to express the cause                   of  a general     pheno

    The   geometer    calculates the effects of those forces which
he employs,      as   he does algebraic signs instead                of numbers
to simplify his operations           ;   but   if   he wishes      afterwards    to
obtain results,     he must give to these signs their real values.
In   the like manner,         if  he wishes        to have     a physical   result,
he must assign a value to the word force which he employs.
The philosopher endeavours to discover the causes of these
forces ; but he is      so   often deceived,         and gives     so many false
explanations,     that   we     are always      inclined     to  consider   as bad
those   which    he assigns.        We       must not,      however, fall into
the opposite excess,         and ascribe to the word force an accep
tation which       it ought not            to have.       Let    us imitate the
wisdom     of Newton       :
                               " All   bodies, fays he, have a tendency
towards each other;           that tendency I call attraction, attrac
tive force ; but it may be the effect                of  an impulsion,       or of
some other cause which              is unknown to us."               He   fays the
fame thing     of   repulsive      force.      Let    us apply this to all the
forces before mentioned.              The sonorous force, for example,
has certainly as its cause some agitation in the sonorous body,
and the atmospheric air by which it is surrounded.                         This is
a certain fact, though we cannot yet explain all the pheno
 mena exhibited by sonorous bodies.                    The    cafe is the fame
 with   the luminous,        electric, magnetic, caloric, and galvanic
 forces.    The phenomena of heat, light, electricity, magnet
 ism, galvanism, have as causes the movements of particular
 fluids ; and, though we are not yet able to determine the na
 ture of all the movements of            these   fluids, we know that their
 action is in the inverse ratio of the squares of the distances.
    Reil   has shown that the nisus format 'tvus                of Blumenbach
 ought to be considered,            as    I  have     said, as a real force      of
 crystallization.      In     general    the formation         of  organised   bo
 dies,   their increment, their nutrition,                is nothing but this
 force of crystallization.            It    has formed all minerals;            the
 globe itself,   and the whole universe.                 It is also the consoli
                                                                            dating

The     force     of crystallization is     consequently      a force   which
acts   in   the most general        manner in nature;        that is to fay,
among existing beings.               Attraction     itself is the effect      of
the action of the gravific fluid, and repulsion               is the effect   of
the repulsive        fluid or caloric.       The philosopher acknow
ledges     that he is yet ignorant of the manner in which all
these fluids act        :  he is only acquainted        with   some   of their
law?.
   This      acceptation      of the word force leaves every possible
latitude to the          calculations of geometry (which form the
physico-mathematical sciences), and does not violate the
principles of sound philosophy. The expression occult causes,
explained in this manner, can give no offence.                          But if
people should persist to consider force as a quality indepen
dent of the action of all matter, fluid or not fluid,                       this
would be         a mere metaphysical       abstraction,
X.                        on the Satellites of the Georgium Planet,
      Observations
    and the two innermost Satellites of Saturn.                By Dr.    J.  H.
    Schroter, F. R. S.&c.                 From Neuere Beytrage zur          Er-
    weiterung der Sternkunde.               1798.
I WAS           prevented    by various speculations,, during the hours
of   observation,       from directing the thirteen or twenty-seven
feet reflectors to the Georgium Sidus              till the 19th    of Febru«
ary i/97> when about eight o'clock in the evening looked             I
at it through the thirteen feet reflector, with a magnifying
 power of almost aoo.              It appeared very plainly as a planet
of mensurable diameter, having a pale white light; and in
 a little time, when the eye became accustomed                  to the instru
 ment, several very small            stars were    perceptible around it.
 Two of      these, being the nearest, in a and b (Plate           VI, fig.  i),
were     a    little clearer,    though it was        with some difficulty
they could be distinguished.                The   largest,   a,   was to the
                                                                       north

            and  the  two innermoj! Satellites      of Saturn.          383
north-west,     distant about seven or eight apparent           diameters
of  the planet;      but b, which was at a much less distance,
was less   perceptible. They were both too faint for measure
ment.      M. Harding distinguished them plainly also; and
both our delineations exactly corresponded.               As    the planet
at an inconsiderable elevation had irradiation,               and   at the
fame    time a large apparent diameter, it was possible, ac
cording to the distance assigned by Dr. Herschel, that they
might     be the satellites ; and        we considered    them     as  such
because they had a satellite-like appearance.
   The weather being          serene,    we   were  able to observe the
Georgium planet next evening, the 20th,                at eight o'clock,
through the same reflector          with magnifying powers of 180
and 288.     It was very evident that we both distinguished,           with
full certainty,    the same two luminous points, which we had
seen before, at nearly the same distance and in almost the
same relative positions ; so that, from their perfectly similar
appearance,     we had      reason to conclude they must            be the
fame stars.      They had their situation        in  c and     d, in such
a manner that c, the most remote, preceded the planet                 in the
direction of its equatorial motion without preceptible decli
nation.
   As Uranus,        being then retrograde,       had   within twenty-
four hours moved         2' 40* towards      the west,   as   was    visible
from the neighbouring             stars,  the two which we observed,
had they not been         satellites,    must have been seen two mi
nutes towards       the   east.    This   was not the cafe; but as on
the evening before, they were again visible in c and d, with
the like relative position ; which fully convinced us that they
were satellites.
   At eight o'clock      the following evening we found the fame
luminous points, with the thirteen feet reflector and a mag
nifying power of 288, at the like distance and in the former
relative position, but more towards the south in            e  and f;   and
it appeared to our conviction, that the second larger satellite,
 which the evening before preceded the planet westwards,                  in
                                                                         the

     384 Observations on the Satellites            of the Georgium        "Planet,
     the direction of its equatorial movement, now formed with
     it an evident      angle, and at the fame time had proceeded
     southwards the like distance.                Besides      the satellite      three
     telescopic   fixed stars were distinguishable in             «,  $, 7, (fig. a.)
        About    ten o'clock we continued our observations                  with the
     twenty-seven feet reflector, and            M. Harding, besides        the small
     stars which had now           moved      a little    from their place, ob
     served two more        in   J and   t (fig. 3.)      In  the strong     light of
     this telescope the second larger satellite, now moved               to e, which
     from its distance,       colour, and degree of light, we perceived
     to be the same observed on the 19th and the 20th, distin
    guished itself clearly from the other small stars, and even
    from the first satellite,         though its light was very weak.                At
     the fame time we observed               the direction       os its equatorial
    motion      towards           so   that both the satellites,       according to
    the proportion of the periods of their revolution,                    seemed to
    have     moved      southwards.          By this circumstance,            and    as
    it  was impossible       that with a reflector having           so much light
    we should not, in serene weather,               see   both the satellites,      we
    were more confirmed            in our opinion.
        As  the weather was unfavourable                I   could not repeat my
    observations     till the 36th of February,           at 4.2 minutes past 10,
    when, with the thirteen               feet reflector and a magnifier             of
    288,    I  distinguished two faint luminous                   points in quite
    another position, viz. one in^ (fig. 1.), which I took to be
    the second or larger satellite, and another in A, which con                I
    sidered   as    the   first.     Both    these points corresponded            with
    Herschel's periods;          so that we could        form no other conclu
    sion   than that, with this excellent reflector, we had seen
    both the satellites.
        How    far the power        of this reflector       extends    will particu
    larly appear      from the following           observations       on the     satel
    lites of Saturn.         We      had    often observed,       with this instru
    ment, during clear moon-shine,                  the five old satellites,       and
    the variation of their light             j but I     never    believed    that it

utmost certainty, that this was the cafe.
    I. On   the 17th of February 1797, after having surveyed
with it every thing remarkable in regard to Saturn, M.
Harding observed, about h.       7      23 m. true time, at a, (fig. 4.)
a difficult to be distinguished faint luminous              point, which
he was inclined to consider as the sixth satellite.              I   distin
guished it also;       and   both our      delineations of its position
coincided     so far, that it was seen, according to its proportional
distance    from the ring, in the orbit            of the sixth   satellite.
Its light, on account of its very small size, was so weak that
it was not always distinguishable, but only now and then
by intervals.
    II.  About    eleven    o'clock,   the fame evening, our observa
tions were continued ; and though it was difficult to find this
point again, it was at length discovered by us both.                 About
lib.     34m.      it  appeared     to have    moved    the considerable
segment      from a to 6,      in the orbit      of the sixth      satellite.
This was sufficient       to convince us that we had observed that
satellite with the thirteen feet reflector and a magnifying
power of 288 ; for in both points its distance from the ring,
according to the proportion            of  the ellipse,  amounted, like
that of the sixth satellite,       to only $    of  the diameter     of the
ring.   2d.    Saturn was retrograde, and, according to calcula
tion,    receded     westward     3-3 seconds, in four hours, from
7 h. 23 m. to 11         h. 24m. Had it been a fixed star, it
must have appeared about 11             h. 24 m. nearly 3*3 seconds
further from a towards the            east, instead of having moved
westwards to b.         It could, therefore,       be no fixed star, but a
satellite.     3d.  If  the segment a,        b,  which it   appeared to
have passed over, be reduced to the orbit of the sixth satel
lite, the point in the course of four hours had not completely

     III.   On        the 20th         of February,            in the evening,                 as tbe
weather was favourable, we directed                                the twenty-seven               feet
reflector to Saturn,                          M. Harding
                                       signified that he ob
                                       and
served, very clearly, a small luminous point, near the ring,
which from             its distance and                appearance         he thought           might
be one      of the        satellites.         I   saw it also       myself very             distinctly
and with perfect                  certainty.            Each delineated               its    position
separately        :       and     both       delineations corresponded                       exactly-
About        10 h. 44 m. true time, he saw                         it,   not   as exhibited          by
the front view, but according to its true position at
                                                                                            c,    tbe

orbit of the sixth satellite                  ;    and       the   calculation           afterwards
made, proved that                 it   actually was the sixth satellite, observed
in   a      andon the evening of the 17th with the thirteen

a western         distance from              b    be   projected,    will be sound to
                                                                         it

satellite   ;     but  I        at length discovered               it,   and, as    I    believed,
with perfect certainty. At

to the before made observations,                         must stand somewhat                  » the

often      distinguished            delicate         points better than myself,                    to
direct his attention towards that part, he                             assured    me that he
saw very clearly, not only a point in                            f,    but also a second
pale luminous point                    in    e,    the position and distance            of both
which points            he delineated               very     accurately,        as   they were
seen      with    a   front view, about                n
                                  h. 34 m. true time; and
that aty was found to be in the orbit of the first, and that at
e    in   the orbit      of   the      second inner satellite.              It    was not          till
the       next day that            I   discovered       my error occasioned by the
front view ; and               I   found, to our great satisfaction, that the
luminous point,               seen at         t in    the orbit    of     the second inner
satellite,       was actually the sixth or second inner satellite                             :   for,
as it was seen by a front view                         in     e, it must have been seen
by tbe common mode of observation                                towards         the east at d.
Through mistake,                    we by           no means          suspected       the     sixth
satellite in e ; and, therefore,                      the observation        was proved to
be so much the more correct when calculation showed that
the sixth satellite had actually been,                           according to the front
view, in that position, or,                         according to the        usual       mode of
observation, in d.     From 10 h. 44 m. on the evening

                              11
there had elapsed 34 hours 50 minutes, in which time this
satellite, according to its period of 32 h. 53 m. 9 sec. had
 pissed over $           of its period +               »'s,    and, consequently,                 must
 have stood           in d; which             corresponds       perfectly with the point
seen in      «   by the front view.
     I (hall     here take occasion to remark, that the                       pie luminous

    myself had a transient                   glance, may          really have          been       that
    satellite ; for it had often happened                     before, that, besides seeing
    the five old satellites,             1   imagined that        I saw   in proportionally
    near, small, pale luminous points, the two inner, the sixth

      VI. At    34 m. February 27th, when we were again
                7   h.
 employed in observing with the thirteen feet reflector, M.
 Harding       assured me that he saw,               with perfect certainty,                      2
 very      faint luminous       point at i, where             I   had     seen   it    also a
 little before, but not with          so   much certainty.                According            to
 his delineation, it stood in the orbit                     of the sixth         satellite :
 and it was found afterwards               by comparison that this lumi
 nous point was actually that satellite                :   for, from       1 z   h. 34       m.
 on the evening Feb. 21st, till 7 h. 34 m. on the evening of
 the 27th, five days ao hours had elapsed, which divided by
the period of its revolution gives 4*25 revolutions ;                             so     thit
the satellite must have stood in i, about {of itt orbit                           further
from d towards the west, where it actually was according                                     to
accurate observation.
     These six observations,             made      in the course of           ten days,
during which the satellite was always seen in those points in
which, according to Dr. Hersehel's determination, it ought
to be found, clearly show not only that we distinguished                                 tht
sixth satellite with the thirteen feet reflector, but that                              the
period assigned by Herschel has been determined with great
accuracy. Two observations,    however, made later appear
to me to be worthy of notice.
   VII. On the evening of the 6th of March, when                                 Saturn
was distant only from           i£   to    i}2   degree from the illuminated
half of     the moon,    I   discovered          the four outer satellites            with
the thirteen feet reflector and             a     magnifying        power of          a88.
On account of        some measurement               which   I     had Jong       wished
to make under such circumstances,                  I   applied      to the    reflector
  magnifying power of 53     and                           certain that with ths
a                                    a
                                     ;
                                                   it
                                                   is
power, almost double to the former,                    at    so   small   a   distance
from the moon,           I   saw much better, though the light w**
considerably        weakened   ;   for, at the first view,            I       not only
clearly discovered the first satellite              in its    western      digreffi011
                                                                                      and

             and the two innermost Satellites of Saturn.                    ao8
and periodical change          of light towards       faintncss ; but     I  law
also to the north-east,         at the distance from the ring           of ^of
its diameter, a very small fixed star, which was                  only half a*
perceptible     as the pale first satellite     was during its periodical
increase    of light.
   M. Harding soon         after found not only this fixed star with
all the five old satellites, but observed also, on the western side
nearer the ring,       a still paler, more delicate          luminous point,
the situation     of which       he mowed       only in general.         I  suc
ceeded     in discovering it also      ; and    both our delineations          of
its position being compared, proved»that we had both seen it
very accurately in the same point, and in the orbit of the
sixth satellite.      Even    if  we had not immediately calculated
the place of this satellite,      we must, from the proportional de
crease   of its light and the foregoing           observations,     have con
sidered it as the sixth.        About    8 h.   i  a m. true time, it stood
in   i;  and   it afterwards       appeared       that we had not erred ;
for  M. Harding, having continued                 the    observation alone,
found about 10 h.          30 m. that it had proceeded eastwards
to /. As Saturn at that time moved daily about two. mi
nutes towards the east, the luminous point                     k, had it been
a fixed star,     must    have    been distant from Saturn about 10
seconds     westward.       This circumstance,             that it not only
had    accompanied Saturn eastwards,                 but had moved in its
orbit,   a   perceptible     portion of      a   circle,    proved    with full
certainty that it was the sixth satellite,               and this was after
wards confirmed by calculation             ; for from       7  h.   23 m. true
time, in the evening,           Feb. 17th,       when it was first      seen   by
M. Harding,        to 8 h. 12 m. on the 6th            of March,       17   days
o hours 49 minutes          had    elapsed,    during which the satellite
 had completed 12*43 fynodical revolutions of                  1  day  8 hours
53 minutes 9 seconds.                 It must therefore           have   moved
about ^',5, or almost          the   half of its orbit from         a towards
the west;     and this exactly agrees with the position               where we
both saw it in k.        The arc which it          had moved over from k
to /  corresponds     also, because the satellite tu a h. 18 m. from
   Vol. Is.                               U                                  8h,

8 h.       i*tn.    to 10 h. 30 m.                  must     have moved towards the
east     about -^th          of iti orbit, which                  corresponds       with      the
arc      H.
     It is    also worthy          of remark,        that we distinguished this               sa
tellite with        a   thirteen feet reflector during                     serene weather,
by moonlight,            and only           at the distance           of i{     degree from
the moon         ; and the          circumstance that, in the course of                       se
venteen days,           we found it eight times exactly in those posi
tions where,            according to             Herschel's period, it ought to
stand,        confirms        in    the    completest         manner the accuracy of
that period.
     Observations which confirm what others have discovered
with large          telescopes            contain indeed             nothing      new    ;    but
they arc, however, still valuable not only to the observer, but
to       many amateurs,             who often wist) to                try whether            they

Saturn, are, in all probability,                      subject to      a   variation of their

 in    the lame proportion.                 The author            relates several    inllanres
                                                                                              that

that occurred to him in the course of his practice, one of
which     is as follows     : Being called to attend          a  woman, at
the point     of  death,    who was quite worn out by           a  consump
tive disorder, with which            she had     been   afflicted for three
years, in compliance with the earnest desire              of her husband,
who requested him to give her some medicine, he composed
one of a portion of syrup diluted with water in which a few
sticks   of phosphorus        had    been    kept.    Next    day the wo
man found herself much better.                She was revived for      a few
days ; and did not die        till about    a fortnight after.
    3.  He himself,       as he  acknowledges, was         so imprudent     as
to take two or three grains of solid phosphorus combined
only with     treacle,    and experienced       the most dreadful symp
toms.      At   first  he felt a burning heat in the whole region
of the   stomach.        That organ       seemed to be filled with gas
which    escaped by the mouth.             Being dreadfully tormented,
he tried to vomit, but in vain, and                found relief only by
drinking cold water from time              to time.     His   uneasy sensa*
tions were at length allayed           ;  but next morning he seemed
to be endowed         with an astonishing      muscular force, and to be
urged with       an almost     irresistible   impulse   to try its energy.
The    effect  of this medicine        at length ceased,       adds the au
thor, h la suite d'un priapisme violent.
    3. In many cafes the author employed, and still employs,
phosphorus internally, with great benefit, to restore and re
vive young persons exhausted               by excesses.     He   divides the
phosphorus into very small particles, by shaking it in a glass
silled with boiling water. He continues to strike the bottle,
plunging it into cold water, and thus obtains                a  kind of pre
cipitate of phosphorus, exceedingly fine, which he bruises
slowly with a little oil and sugar, or afterwards                employs    as
liquid electuary, by diluting the whole in the yolk of an egg.
By   means of this medicine he has effected astonishing cures,
and restored the strength           of his patients in         a very   short
time.                                                                         

      5. Pelletier told him, that having left, through negli
    gence, some phosphorus in a copper baton, that metal was
    pxydated, and remained suspended in the water.                                          Having
    thoughtlessly thrown out the water in a small court                                   in which
    ducks were kept, these animal* drank of                                    it,    and all died.

    divisibility       of phosphorus.

    some pills, in the composition of which there was not more
    than quarter of grain of phosphorus, and having had oc
            a                  a
    casion afterwards to open the body, he found all the internal
    parts luminous         ;     and even the hands              of the person who had
    performed the operation, though washed and well dried, re
    tained   a       phosphoric splendour for              a   long time after.
       7. The phosphoric acid, employed as lemonade, has been
    serviceable to the author in the cure of  great number of            a
    diseases.

    oxyd as       a    terrible poison.            He was not                able     to reduce     it,
    but     by   fixed alkali and the glass               of phosphorus.

  I^OR      the discovery     of the oxygenated muriatic acid, its
 effects on colouring matter, and its inestimable advantages,
 the arts    are indebted    to the justly-celebrated        Scheele.      M.
 Berthollet lost no time in applying the properties of this cu
 rious and highly interesting substance to the most important
 practical    uses.   His experiments       on bleaching with the oxy
 genated     muriatic acid proved completely successful, and he
 did not delay       to communicate         his valuable labours to the
 public.      The    new method of bleaching was quickly and
 successfully    introduced    into the manufactures of Manchester,
  Glasgow, Rouen, Valenciennes,               and Courtray      ;  and it has
 since    been    generally adopted        in   Great Britain,       Ireland,
 France,     and Germany.          The   advantages      which result from
  this method, which          accelerates     the process      of whitening
 cottons, linens, paper, &c. to            a really   surprising   degree, in
 every season     of the   year,   can be   jualy    appreciated    by com
  mercial people only, who experience             its beneficial effects in

  394               On the Process of Bleaching with
   many ways, but particularly in the quick circulation of their
   capitals.
      Great difficulties, for      a  time, impeded its progress, arising
  chiefly from prejudice and the ignorance of bleachers in che
   mical processes.         These    obstacles      were, however, soon            re
  moved, by Mr. Watt             at Glassgow,         and by     Mr. Henry       and
  Mr. Cooper       at Manchester.          Another difficulty presented it
  self, which had nearly proved fatal to the success of the ope
  ration.      This  was the want        of    a  proper apparatus,         not for
  making the acid and combining it with water, for this had
  been supplied in a very ingenious manner by                     Mr. Walt       and
  M.    Berthollet    *
                         j but for      the    purpose      of immersing         and
  bleaching      goods in the liquor.            The volatility of this acid
  and its suffocating vapours            prevented       its application in the
  way commonly used in dye-houses.                        Large cisterns were
 therefore constructed, in which pieces of stuff were (^ratified ;
  and the liquor        being poured         on them,        the cisterns       were
 closed with lids.        But this    method      was soon found to be de
  fective, as the liquor could not be equally diffused                        :  the
    *M.   Bcrthollet's apparatus, however, is two complex for the use of a
 manufactory     ; Mr. Watt's is better ; but a range of four, five, or six
 hogshead,    or rum-puncheons, connected          with one another, in the man
 ner of W'oulfc's distilling apparatus,     is preferable  to either of them. Agi
tators, on   M.  Berthollet's  principle, may beapplied. The retort or ma
 trass should be   of lead, standing in a water-bath ; its neck should be of
 sufficient length to condense the common muriatic acid, which always
enmes ovei , and it should form an inclination towards the body           of the re.
tort,  so that lhc condensed acid may return into it.        1 beg leave to observe
here, that I always found the liquor to be strongest when the distillation
was carried on very slowly.        I have also found, that the strength        of the
liquor is much increased by diluting the vitriolic acid more than is usually
 done.     The following proportions      afforded the strongest      liquor  :
                            Three parts manganese.
                            Eight parts common salt.
                             Six parts oil of vitriol.
                            Twelve parts water.
The proportion of       niangauesc   is subject to variation       according to its
quality.
                                                                             pieces

                    the oxygtnattd muriatic            Acid.                  295
pieces were, therefore, only partially bleached, being                     white
in some parts and more or less coloured in others. Various
other contrivances were tried without success, till it was dis
covered that an addition            of alkali     to the liquor deprived     it of
its suffocating     effects, without destroying its bleaching pow
ers.     The   process    began then to be carried on in open ves
sels,   and has been continued in this manner to the present
period.      The bleacher         is now able to work his pieces in the
liquor, and to expose every part of them to its action, with
 out inconvenience.          This     advantage is unquestionably great ;
 but it is diminished by the heavy                    expense     of  the  alkali,
 which is entirely lost.           It  is moreover to be feared, that the
 alkali which is added to the liquor, though it does not destroy
 its power    of bleaching,        may diminish        it;   because a solution
 of   the oxygenated      muriat of potash,           which differs     from the
 alkaline     bleaching liquor in nothing but in the proportion
 ot alkali,   will nut bleach        at all.     This   is a well known fact,
 from      which we might infer, that the oxygenated                     muriatic
 acid will lose its power of destroying the colouring matter of
  vegetable substances, in proportion as it becomes neutralized
  by an alkali.      But     as we stiould        not content ourselves with
 inferences however plausible,               when the truth may be           esta
  blished by experiment         ;    and as     I thought     the matter    of suf
  ficient importance,      1  made the following experiments on the
  subject.
      I  beg   leave to premise,           that in all these experiments           I
  made use      of  one   and       the same acid, which            was kept in a
  bottle with    a  ground-glass stopper, and secured from the in
  fluence of light.       The manner in which I made the experi
  ments was        simply    this.       I   weighed, first of all, a bottle
  filled with     the colouring substance which                  I  meant to em
   ploy  :  I then weighed, in             a  large and perfectly colourless
   bottle, half an ounce of the acid, to which                    I  immediately,
   but very gradually,         added      of   the colouring substance con
   tained in the former bottle, till the acid              ceased   to destroy any
   more of its colour.        The bottle with          the colouring substance
                                          V4                                    was

      observed in all the experiments.
          Experiment          I. To half an ounce of oxygenated muriatic
     acid, I added a solution of indigo in acetous acid', drop br
     drop, till the oxygenated acid ceased to destroy any more co
     lour.        It destroyed the colour of 160 grains of the acetite of
     indigo.
         EvperimentW.            A repetition of Experiment 1. The colour
    °f      '65 grains of acetite of indigo was destroyed in this

    The colour of          160 grains   of the acetite was destroyed.
         Ecperiment IV. To half an ounce of the oxygenated mu
    riatic       acid, were added      8   drops     of   pure potash   in a liquid
   state.         This quantity of alkali was about sufficient to deprive
   the acid of its noxious odour. This mixture destroyed the
   colour of 150 grains of the acetite of indigo.
        Experiment         V. A repetition of Experiment iv. The co
   lour of 145 grains of the acetite was destroyed.
        Experiment VI. To half an ounce of the oxygenated mu
   riatic acid, 10 drops of the fame alkali were added.                      It de
  stroyed the colour            of 125 grains of the acetite of indigo.
        Experiment VII. A mixture of half an ounce of the oxy
  genated acid, and 15 drops of the alkali, destroyed the co
  lour of 120 grains of the acetite of indigo.
        Though I          had taken the precaution            of avoiding  the sul
  phuric         acid,   for the reason       stated    in the foregoing note,       I
  was not quite satisfied with               these     experiments, on account
        It   has been usual to estimate the       stiength of the oxygenated   mu
 riatic arid by      a solution of indigo in sulphuric acid. This method was in
admissible in these exj-criments on theromparativestiength of the ble«ch-
ing liquor, with and without alkali            ;  because the sulphuric acid would
lave decomposed the muriatof potash, and thereby produced                    errors.
J therefore        added to a solution  of indigo, in sulphuric acid, after it had

 which        I   employed        a    decoction of cochineal in water, instead

   Experiment VIII. To half an ounce of the oxygenated
 muriatic acid, a decoction of cochineal was added till the
 acid ceased           to act on its colour.                   It    destroyed the colour               of
 39° gra'ns of            the decoction.
      Experiment          IX. A         repetition of Experiment                        vuj.       The
 colour of 385 grains of the decoction was destroyed in this
 experiment.
      Experiment          X. To half an ounce of                        the acid, 6 drops               of
 the liquid alkali were                     added.        This mixture                destroyed        the
 colour of        3 15   grains of the decoction.
    Experiment            XI. Eight               drops      of     the alkali         were       mixed
 with half an ounce of the acid.                           This mixture               destroyed the
 colour of 305 grains                 of the decoction.
   On      a comparative view                  of    the results       of   these     experiments,
 it will appear,           addition of potasli to the bleaching
                           that       an
liquor impairs its strength considerably. This diminution of
power, and the expense of potasli,                                  are a serious          loss   in an
extensive manufacture.                        It would,         therefore,           be desirable to
have     an       apparatus        for the        use   of     the pure oxygenated                 mu
riatic acid simply dissolved in water, which                                      is at once the
cheapest          and    best     vehicle for it.                   This    apparatus       must be
simple     in its construction,                     and    obtainable at               a   moderate
expense;          it must confiue the liquor in such                             a    manner      as   to
prevent the escape              of the          muriatic acid gas, which
                                            oxygenated                                                       
is not only        a    loss of power, but also an inconvenience to the
workmen and dangerous                         to their         health ; and            it must,        at
the fame          time, be        so    contrived, that every part of the stuff

             DKSCRIPTION             OF    THE APPARATUS.
    Fig. i. (Plate VII.)        is a section of the apparatus.            It  coo-
fists of an oblong deal         cistern    A  B  C D, made         water-tight.
 A  rib,  E E, of   ash  or beech wood, U firmly fixed to the                 mid
dle   of the bottom      CD,      being mortised into the ends of               th<
cittern.      Th"; rib    is provided      with holes, at      FF, in which
two perpendicular axes are to turn.                 The     lid, AB, ha> a
rim,   GG.     which finks and fits into the cistern.               Two     tubw,
 H H,     are fixed into the      lid, their   centres   being perpendicu
larly over the centres        of   the    sockets,   F F, when the lid i*
 upon the cistern.         At I,    is a tube by which        the liquor     is in
 troduced     into the apparatus.            As il    is necessary       that   Al
 space   within   the rim,    GG,      be  air-tight,   its joints of the      lid,
 nd the   joints of    the tubes, mult be very close            j  and, if ne
 cessary, secured with pitch.            Two perpendicular          axes,     KL,
 made    of ash  or beech wood,          pass  through the tubes, rJ H,
 and rest in the sockets,        F F.      A  piece  of strong     canvas, M,
 is sewed very tight round           the   axis  K, one end of            it pro
jecting from the axis.              The other      axis is provided with          a
 similar piece    of canvas.        N,   are pieces    of cloth    rolled    upon
 the axis   L.    Two plain pulleys, O O,            are fixed to the us?,
 in  order   to prevent      the    cloth from slipping down. 'The
 shafts are turned by a moveable handle,                P.    Q,   a moveaWe
 pulley, round which          passes the    cord, R.       This cord,      which
 is fastened on the opposite fide of the lid (fee fig. 1), **>°
 passes over the small pulley S, produces                 friction by mean*
 of  the weight    T.     By   the spigot and fauffet        V, the    liquor is
 let oss, when exhausted.
     Fig.  2.  A  plan of the apparatus, with the lid taken                 o*T.
         THE MANNER OF USING THE APPARATUS.
    The dimensions of this             apparatus    are calculated        for uV
            of bleaching     twelve or fifteen pieces        of }  calicoes, of
purpose
any other stuffs of equal breadth and substance.                    When tbt
joods are ready for bleaching, the axis, L, is placed
                                                                             00 a

                     tie oxygenated muriatic        Acid.                  299
frame in a horizontal position, and one of the pieces,                       N,
being fastened to the canvas,          M, by    means     of wooden      skew
ers, in the manner represented          in fig. 1, it is rolled upon the
axis by turning it with the handle,           P.     This operation       must
be performed by two persons j the one turning the axis and
the other directing the piece,          which must be rolled on very
                             ¦
tight and      very even.      When     the first piece      is on the axis,
the next piece        is fastened to the end      of it by      skewers,   and
wound on in the fame manner as the first.                   The    fame me
thod is pursued till all the pieces are wound upon the axis.
The   end   of  the last piece is then fastened to the canvas            of the
axis  K.    Both      axes are afterwards placed           into the cistern,
with their ends in the sockets          F F, and     the lid is put on the
cistern   by pasting the axes through the tubes                  H H. The
handle P is put upon the empty axis, and               the pulley Q upon
the axis on which the cloth is rolled, and              the cord     R, with
the weight       T,  is put round it and over the pulley S.                The
use  of the  friction, produced       by this weight,         is to make the
cloth wind tight upon the other axis.                But    as   the effect   of
the weight will increase as one cylinder               increases     and    the
other ltlsens, I recommend that three or four weights be
suspended on the cord, which may be taken off gradually, as
the person who works the machine may lind                     it convenient.
As   the   weights hang on open hooks, which are fastened to
the cord, it will be little or no trouble to put them on and
 to remove them.
    Things being       thus disposed,    the bleaching liquor is to be
transferred     from the    vessels  in which it has been prepared
into the apparatus, by         a  moveable    tube pasting through the
tube   I,  and descending        to the bottom      of  the cistern-      This
tube being connected           with the    vessels,   by means      of  leaden
or wooden pipes         provided with       cocks, hardly any vapours
will  escape   in  the transfer.      When     the apparatus is silled up
to the line a, the moveable tube is to be withdrawn,                  and the
tube   I closed.     As   the liquor rises above the edge          of the rim
 Ci, and above the tubes         H H,   it is evident that no evapora
                                                                           tion

 300                   On the Process          of Bleaching with
tion can          take place,         except      where the rim does not apply
 closely to the sides         of     the box ;     which will, however, form *
very trifling surface          if the
                      carpenter's work be decently done.
The cloth is now to be wound from the axis L upon the
axis     K, by turning this ;               and    when this is accomplished,
the handle P and pulley                 Q   are to be changed, and the cloth
is to be wound back upon the axis                             L.     This operation is,
of course,        to be repeated as often as necessary.                      It    is plain,
that by this process of winding the cloth from one axis upon
the other, every part of it is exposed, in the most complete
manner, to the action of the liquor in which it is immersed.
It will      be necessary to turn, at first, very              bristly, not only be
cause the liquor is then the strongest,                       but also because it re
quires a number of revolutions,                        when the axis is bare,               to
move a certain length of cloth in a given time, though this
may be performed by a single                      revolution        when     the    axis    is
filled.Experience must teach how long the goods are to be
worked ~r nor can any rule be given respecting the quantity
and strength        of the liquor, in order              to bleach a certain num
ber     of   pieces.     An intelligent workman will                       soon attain a
sufficient knowledge            of    these points.            It   is hardly neceffary
to observe, that,           if the    liquor should retain any strength after
a set   of pieces      are bleached         with   it, it   may again be employed
for another set.
     With     a   few alterations, this apparatus might be made ap
plicable to the bleaching of yarn.         If, for instance, the pulley
O    were removed from the end                    of   the axis      K,   and fixed im
mediately under the tube                    H;    if    it   were perforated        in    all
directions, and tapes or strings passed through the holes,
fkains of yarn might be tied to these tapes underneath the
pulley,      so   as to hang down towards the bottom                        of   the box.
The     apparatus being afterwards filled with bleaching liquor,
and the axis turned, the motion would cause every thread to
be acted upon          by   the liquor.           Several axes might               thus be
turned in the fame box, and being connected                           with each other
by   pulleys, they might all be worked                         by   one person      at the
                                                                                     same

                       the oxygenated muriatic        Acid.                  goi
same      t"ime ; and      as all would turn the fame way and with
the fame speed, the slcains could not possibly entangle each
other.
    In order     to show the usefulness        of this   apparatus still more
clearly,     I request the Society to attend to the following state
ment of the expense of a given quantity of bleaching liquor,
with and without alkali, but of equal               strength.
                              WITH ALKALI*.

    But it appears by the foregoing experiments,
that the liquor loses strength by an addition of
alkali.       The   value   of this  loss, which on an ave
rage amounts to           15  per  cent,   must be added to
the expense              -                  -         -                     83

    It  appears from this         calculation,     that   a   certain quantity
of   the liquor,     for the   use  of my apparatus,          costs only al. 5s.
but that the fame quantity of the alk.tl ine liquor costs 3I.3s.3d-
which is 40 per cent, more than the other. The aggregate
of so    considerable      a saving   must form a large sum          in the   ex
tensive manufactures           of this country.

    to  that practised        in tbe Ancient Venetian Scboof.                 By
     Mr. Timothy            Sheldrake". From Transaction! of
    the Society      for the Encouragement of Arts,               Vol. X.V2.
     1798.
  J. HE     method of painting             practised    in the Venetian
 School,    I conceive     to have been as follows :
    The    cloth was primed with            colours in distemper,         of    a
  brownish hue, such         as  would properly enter into the darkest
 parts  of the picture.        The    most transparent      colours are the
 properest.      I  believe umber was most generally used,            broken
 with   red, yellow, or blue,         according to the tint intended to
 be produced, and        diluted with chalk or whiting         to the proper
 degree   of  strength.      Upon     the ground so prepared        the sub
ject   was correctly drawn with umber, pure, or mixed                    with
 lake,   blue,     or black; and, with          the fame     colours,   those
 shadows that were darker than the ground were then painted
in.
    The   artist then      painted    the lights with pure      wbiie, in     a
 solid body, where the          light  was brightest, or where the full
 effect  of colour    was to be produced        j and, where the demi-
 tints were afterwards to be, scumbling it thinner by degrees
till it united with the shadows.
    In this manner        the chiaro-oscuro        was   finished as   much
as possible, and the local colour          of every object in the picture
glazed over it.          All the colours        used in this part      of the
work were ground              in oil, which      was absorbed       into tbe
 ground, the picture remaining slat, something like a picture
in water colours or crayons ; it was then varnished, till
saturated     with varnish,       and the full  of  every colour brought
out   : the   picture was then complete.

    Upon      the most superficial            view of this           process,            it will be
evident that          a   picture painted by it           it,   as to all visible               pro
perties,    a   varnish       picture; tor the small quantity                            of oil that
had been used, sunk                 into the ground, and never could rile
again to be hurtful            ;    while the varnish, being laid on aster
the colours, gave them all the brilliancy and durability they
could derive from that vehicle,                     without being liable to the
objections that arc made to painting                      in    varnish, supposing                 it
to be used in the same manner as oil                      is    inpainting with oil.
It   is   true that this mode            of painting      is    itself liable to some
objections       :    these  I     have endeavoured             to obviate, aud (hall
therefore        mention hereafter.             Here    it   may be observed that,
as any varnish             may be used,        itii     to this circumstance we
must attribute the different degrees                    of durability                in    pictures
of the Venetian School.                I     have seen some that would resist
the most powerful               solvents,     while others were destroyed                          by
the weakest        ;      though     all    possessed    the apparent                    properties
that distinguish the Venetian pictures from all others.
     As   I   do not pretend to degrade painting to the rank                                     of   a
mechanical art, that may be infallibly practised     receipt,                       by    a

system      of   the Venetian School,               which      I     have seen varioufly

    I     once    asleed    Sir Joshua Reynold*,             by    »h-t circumstance*

   colouring was to be produced         ? He replied, An unity         of light
  and an unity of shadow should           pervade the whole.           He    ex
  plained to me the        difficulty of reducing      the various     colours
  of all the objects that may be included in             a  picture, and rbe
  various modifications of those colours to the simple,               harmo
  nious   state he described,     and illustrated    what he had said by
  this simile.    "   A picture,     to possess harmony       of colouring,
  should look    as if  it was painted        with one colour        (suppose
  umber and white),         and, when the chiaro-oscuro was com
  plete, the colour of each object should be glazed over                 it."
      This  observation,    from such authority, was impressed            with
  peculiar force on my mind ; and if I can retrace its opera
  tions on a subject which has so long engaged my attention,
  I should   say Sir Joshua's    observation     was the clue that     guided
  me through all my experiments, and,                I  hope, will     enable
 me to prove, that the beautiful and simple practice               which be
 suggested as a simile, was literally the practice            of that school
 upon whose works his ideas            of colouring    were founded.        At
 the fame time      I  may observe,       that the fact seems to have
 eluded his observation,         or he would not have used it as a
 comparison to simplify his description           of  a practice   which be
 thought both difficult and complex.
     In  the   Newtonian       doctrine    of light    and colours,     it is
 believed     that all colours are inherent in light, and are
 rendered visible by the action of various bodies, which re
flect particular rays, and absorb the rest.              Without disput
ing the truth of this doctrine, it is to be observed,                 that a
painter must consider        the objects he represents as being ana
logous to the materials he          uses to represent      them ; and,     in
this riew of the subject, colour is to be considered               as a pro
perty    inherent in bodies,       which is rendered visible by the
contact of light,      a   colourless, or at least a mono-coloured
substance,     and shadow the mere privation           of light.
    A   picture may represent either        a group of figures, or     other
objects, in    a room, or any objects in the open air           : whatever
the situation    may be, it represents certain objects in a given
                                                                      space,

space, possessing            individually their peculiar colours, and ge
nerally exposed to the operations of light.                                     The quantity of
light each can receive must depend                                  upon its form, and its
position       respecting              that part whence the light                        comes; for,
in proportion            as   other parts recede from the light, the shadow
becomes           visible     :       but   shadow       is    nothing but privation of
light,     and privation of colour,                      in proportion               as the      light is
diminished.              Some attention to these circumstances                                      will,
perhaps, enable us to demonstrate                              the truth         of Sir Joshua's
position.
     If   a globe        of one colour                be exposed in a painter's room,
properly darkened, that part which is nearest the light will
partake of its colour; the next part will show the true colour
of   the object ; that which first recedes from the light                                        will    be
a little obscured,                    the next    a   little more, and              so    on progres
sively,    till    that part which is furthest                      from the light will lose
it» colour, and appear equally dark with the shadiest part                                               of
the       room.       Now              we know this globe                 is    of    one uniform
colour     ;   the variations we fee in different parts                                  of it   are only
deceptions, occasioned                       by the       accession            of light in          some
parts, and the privation                     of it in others.
     What         is true         of this       one object and its parts, would be
equally true   of any number of objects, whatever their co
lours or relative situations might be : if they were plaeed
tagether          in the fame room, each would                            possess        its own in
dividual colour, each would partake                                of the      general      light, in
proportion to its situation, and of the general                                          darkness in
proportion          as   it recedes from the light.                             All this may            be
easily     conceived              ;    but the        difficulty,        and     in the ordinary
modes of painting                      a serious      one it       is,   is    to represent         such
objects with the appearance                              of truth,            and     preserve          the
harmony            necessary            to constitute         a    whole.           The Venetian,
painters       however,                by   whatever means               they     obtained their
knowledge, discovered                       a   method        so   simple,      that perhaps no
other can produce such brilliant effects,                                      and undoubtedly
n    ¦ with    facility and certainty at all comparable with theirs.

the Venetian n ethod of painting, I have s.iid nothing of the
nianner of producinj tlnse demi-tints which condoce fo
much to the brilliancy of a picture, which are so difficult W
execute, and in which he most frequently fails.                                Those tints
ire, in the ordinary modes of painting, produced bv the
mixture of black, gray, blue, or brown (according to the
judgment of the artist), with the local colours of the ob -
jects. It is these tints which, from their being made with
such colours,            it isdifficult      to get clear, and which never are
so clear in any other as in the Venetian,                            and in some          0/ the
Flemish pictures, which are painted upon analogous                                       princi
ples.      The fact            is,   that those painters produced             all such      tints
without the admixture of any colour to represent them, rod
by   method
      a         like that so                  by
                             which they are producers in
nature, that this circumstance alone                            ensures        a   degree     at
brightness to their colours, and of harmony to their ibadow?,
that    it   iB   perhaps impossible           to produce,       in      an equal degree,
by any other mode of painting.

        is   a                                 I    have not skill          in     physic* to
be able to account for, though                       by   numerous experiment}               I
have ascertained               beyond contradiction,            that     if upon any de
gree      of brown,         between        the deepest and           the lightest        brown
yellow,          we paint pure white, in                 gradations, from the foitd
body to the              lightest       tint that can be laid on,              all tbt linti
letxvcen          the    s<:tid      ivbitt and    the ground        will     appear to t*
gray,        intense in proportion to the depth osthe ground, and
the thinness            of the white laid upon it.              But in every cafe all
the     tints laid upon one ground will                       harmonize with each
other, and form one connected chain                            (if   1   may   use   the ex
pression),         which will perfectly unite the highest light with
the darkest shade.

 nature      : but in every other method of painting, these demi-
 tints      are produced by mixing some dusky colour with the
 local colours and the light.                             The comparison of                  these me
 thods      will       afford a demonstrative                        reason why the Venetian
 must be brighter than any other mode                                        of painting.
    Having stiown, as near to a demonstration as the nature of
 the subject will perhaps admit, why those parts of a Venetian
 picture that are connected                         with light and colours are brighter
 than the corresponding parts of any other pictures, it remains
 to explain the cause os similar superiority in the darker parts
 of   the fame pictures.
      It   has been said, with much confidence, that as white re
 presents        light,          so    black is the representative                      of   darkness.
But though this may                         be true in          physics,        it certainly is not
so    in painting           :        for the painter's art is to represent objects as
they appear, in point of colour, to be, not as they really are.
Thus, if I know                      an object is perfectly black, and am to re
present          it    as       it   appears to be at the distance                    of fifty      feet,
black from the pallet will not produce a good imitation                                                of
it,      because           the interposition of fifty feet of the atmosphere
will       cause      it   to appear          of    a    colour different from                  what   it
really      is
            ;         and vice versa            if      we go into       a    cavern,   a    cellar, or
a    room,       so   darkened             that the colour             of no object      can be dis
tinctly seen,               and       if we there hold any solid black substance
near to the eye,                     the difference           will   be visible       at once   j    the
black object will be immediately distinguished,                                        by   its solidity
and colour,             from the surrounding space,                             and    such remote
objects as may be obscurely visible through it.                                          These ob

 truism), that shadows                      are nothing real;            they only        seem to
 exist     in   the absence          of light,       and give to objects an ill-defined
 appearance,            distinct from, though in some                       instances          miaed
 with,         light    and colours             in   different degrees           :    but      as tbe
 painter must represent this appearance  something nti,ht           by
 chooses the colours most analogous, viz. browns, and the
most transparent               of their       class, to represent this                transparent,
 but imperfectly defined appearance                            in   nature.
      It   has been supposed that the Venetian painters had                                      some
peculiarly rich and transparent brown colour, which                                            is   seen
to pervade all the works of that school  the effect              ;                       of    which
no modern artist has been able to imitate, and which                                            there
fore      is   supposed        to have          been lost.       It   is   not   very     probable
that      a    colour    so    common,             as to     pervade       the works            of   the
worst as well as              of   the best artists          of that school,             should       be
 so   unaccountably lost                    and,   as the effect       attributed         to   it   may
                                    by ;
be easily produced                         the mode     of painting      I   have       described,
it   is   not unreasonable                 to conclude that this much-lamented
colour has never existed.
     It   is   well known that chalk, and other earths of                                 tbe [ame
kind,          lose, when          wetted,         much       of their      whiteness,               ami
become           semi-transparent:                 it   is   equally certain,                  that    if
umber or other earths are mixed with chalk, and                                          saturated
with       varnish       after      they are laid in the cloth, they                           in    like
manner become diaphanous,                             and are infinitely more bril
liant than the fame colours can                            he when mixed with white
lead      anJ oil.        This       seems,        on good grounds, to ban                       been
the basis of the Venetian method                           of painting, and             all its       pe
culiar effects       ;    at       least   ifI     may draw any conclusion                          from
the       numerous experiments                     I    have    made.         But       if     arufu,
whose uWnts             will     enable       them to repeat those experiment*

                                                                                                lauj

                                    after the Venetian School.                               309
         I   may now be permitted to say, it is difficult,                    if    not im*
    possible, to conceive               a theory     more simple,        more beautiful,
    or more true, than that of Sir Joshua Reynolds.                                It   is cer
    tainly        impossible         to form    a    practice more simple, or more
    conformable to that theory, than the one I have described,
    as    will    be evident on recapitulating the particulars.
         The      artist,     hating determined what                  hue should    pervad*
    his picture, formed his ground with that colour prepared in
    distemper: upon this the subject was drawn, and the darker
    shades painted             in with transparent           colours, which funk into
    the      ground      :    with pure white he then painted                  in all the
    lights and demi-tints, and, lastly, glazed in the colours, each
    in its place. Upon applying the varnish, the darker shades
    were,       body, incorporated with the ground ; and thus,
                 as to
    though different in colour, appeared thinner and more trans
    parent than any colours                         could be when laid            upon       any
    ground        :   the full effect      of every colour       was brought out, and
    the picture was complete.
         Whoever has been accustomed to paint, or to mark the
    progress      of painting in the common way, and will reflect on
    the      practice of the method I have described, by artists who
    had been brought up to                    it,   must fee that such artists would
    paint with         a     degree of facility, expedition, and certainty,                    as
    to effect,        that could never be equalled                in the ordinary way
    of painting          in   oil   :   besides,    it   will be evident that an artist
    would uot only paint                  a   picture himself with more facility,
    but,     if  he had occasion,             could employ    number of subordi
                                                                a
    nate      artists       upon large works, and put those works out                          of
    hand with more uniformity,                       as to   merit and effect, than            if
    he were to employ                   such assistants      in similar works           if   they
    were to be painted                  m the common way.
     I       am sensible how little attention                 will,    and perhaps ought
-   to be paid to observations                 on painting,     if    made   by   those who
    are not professionally                artists   :    for practical men acquire               a
    kind      of knowledge              that can never be obtained           in    any other
    ay      ;    but at the fame              time they contract prejudices                 that

often prevent them           from fully investigating       any novelty in
practice that may be offered to their notice.                  The   specula
tive man, on the contrary, who investigates the properties of
matter, unshackled by practical perjudices, and with ideas
purely chemical or philosophical,                  will  be more likely to
ascertain all the facts relative to any theory that may become
the object of inquiry.            In this way   I  hope  I  have proceeded
in this investigation.           I have endeavoured       to consider      pic
tures   as masses     of matter,      possessing the properties, but        dif
fering from each other in degree of brilliancy,                transparency,
 and duration.         I  have endeavoured       to ascertain the causes      of
 this difference, with what          success the  Society will determine,
and with        what utility must be hereafter ascertained by the
practice      of   those for whose       use   the investigation was        in
 tended.
    I ought, perhaps, here to take leave of the subject; but
 as I have been induced to submit to the Society's notice an
 attempt     at  painting,     it may be expected that I should give
 an account       of (he manner in which the pictures I have sent
 were painted.
    I have already        mentioned, that there arc some difficulties
 in the method of painting I have described,               as being that      of
 the old artists, and which would form objections                of consider
able force to the practice           of it by artists who are well ac
 quainted with the usual           modi s of painting : these difficulties
 are, first, the ground absorbs          theoilfrom     the colours so fast,
 that they are not       so manageable      as in oil-painting    ; secondly,
 the effect     of the picture is not seen till the finishing varnish
 is laid    on;    and     thirdly,    as the effect is not seen       till I he
 picture is siuislied, it will sometimes disappoint the artist,
 aud in that case it will be difficult, if at all practicable, to
 alter it.
    As   I  believe the process      I have described in the beginning
 of this   paper is similar to that       of Miss Provis,    the artists who
 are acquainted with            her recipe can ascertain        whether my
 conjectures on tbis.subject arc right or not.                I    am certain
                                                                              at

                                    after       the Venetian            School.                                  3   1 it
ot       least   that        these      difficulties               occurred in my attempts
to       paint, and             to obviate             them         I        adopted       the       following
process.
     I    prepared the ground in distemper,                                       and painted         the dark
parts       in the way I have described                                  ;    I    then varnished                the
ground with the copal oil-varnish, till it was fully saturated,
and by this means the full effect of that part of the picture
was seen         :    upon this             I   painted the lighter parts with white,
using much                 of    the vehicle where the colour was                                    thin,       and
little in the solid parts, leaving the white in them dead                                                    :       by
tins means             I    understood            the effect        of my chiaro-ofeuro,                         as     I
saw the effect               of     the demi-tints                 nearly          as   well    as    when the
picture was finished.
      Upon           this       I   glazed         the    colours in the way                            I    have
described            in the beginning                    of this             paper,      and finished the
picture.         I    often found (probably from want                                    of practice) that
the effect was different from what                                  I intended,            as the effect of
the colours, added to that                          of   the chiaro-ofeuro,                     produced an
essential alteration in the whole                              :    as       I    took care in general
that the defect did not arise from too much white,                                                      I   added
more where it was deficient, and glazed fresh colours over                                                            it,
which united perfectly with what had been done before, and
did not give the appearance                               of   a     mended              picture.           If       the
defect was from too much white,                                     I         glazed      on     it   a     colour
similar to that of the ground, painted with fresh white upon
that, and glazed the proper colours over it. In this way                                                             I
found       I    could alter the picture, but not                                        so    well   as    in the
former cafe.

                 I                                 necessary, increase the effect                           of       the
picture,         by    painting on the principal mass or                                   masses         of light
with the local colours, only mixed with white                                             ;     as    this prac
tice brought those parts more forward,    making them ap                           by
pear solid, and thus contrasting them with the transparency
 of      the rest     of        the picture.             In this way              I     found   I     could          use
 the colours tempered                           with copal varnish without difficulty                                  ;

XIV.     Some Account      of the Travels of the two French Natu-
    ralijls  Bruguiere        and Olivier.            From La Decade
    Philosophiquc, No.      VII.  1798.
In the year       1793, during the ministry of Roland, Citizens
Bruguiere and Olivier, the first known by a work upon (hells
and researches respecting        microscopic animals, and the               se
cond by a history of infects, were sent at the expense                       of
government to the eastern parts         of Asia.     They were to tra
verse the Archipelago,       Greece, Turkey, Persia, &c. for the
purpose     of making   discoveries  in natural history, and of col
lecting facts and observations      respecting     that science.       Their
mission     extended    to the arts aud the sciences            in  general ;
and they were instructed to procure every information                     they
could in regard       to the agriculture and political economy               of
the countries through which they might travel.                    Soon after
their departure, however, by the unsettled           state  of   the French
government, they were left destitute of its assistance ; but
their love for natural history supported them under this mis
fortune.      They continued their juurney, made valuable col
lections while traversing deserts aud mountains,                 studied the
manners of the people, and endeavoured as far as lay in their
power to gratify the wishes of naturalists,            and   of   those fond
of   the arts and sciences.       After  five years labour they were
at length on their return home, and had               happily arrived at
Ancona, when C. Bruguiere             was snatched        by death       from

  Cit. Bruguiere,         after having escaped the dangers                       of the   sea,
and being almost recovered from his fatigue, fell  at An-                        ill
cona on the very day of our arrival and    had the misfor
                                                        ;      I
tune to lose    a     friend,    the companion              of my travels, on the
eleventh day      of his illness.
 I    can hardly find words to express with what painful sen
sation I     was affected        by   this unexpected          death.
   Cit. Bruguiere had             kept       his health during the course of
our travels through the islands                   of the Archipelago,             and even
in Egypt,       because the principal part                  of them      had been per
formed at      sea,    and      because   I       alone undertook all that part                       ,
which       required a greater degree of fatigue                       ;   but when we
quitted the coasts              of Syria to           penetrate        further into the
country,       and when we joined                 a   caravan, which rendered                it
necessary for us to travel              thirty or forty days successively
without resting,          C.     Bruguiere's health became     deranged,     so
that several months repose at the court                            of      Persia was not
sufficient to reestablish              it.        After staying, however,                   six
 months at Bagdad,               Bruguiere         found himself in          a    condition
 to traverse     the     desert;       and though the season                 was already
 very hot, our journey was exceedingly pleasant,                              on account
 of   the    precaution which                he   took to travel            in    a    kind of
 carriage.      As for me,         I         continued        to ride on horseback,
 because    I   could readily dismount in order to collect plants,
 feeds,     and other objects, and could again soon rejoin the
 caravan;       to     lose fight      of which          was often attended                with
 danger.
      Fatigue, however, was not the only cause of the continual
 illness of Bruguiere while in Persia.                      The want of wine con
 tributed greatly towards               it    on many occasions,              especially         as
 the water in general             is   brackish, and          of   a   purgative quality.
 The      chemists      will    easily give an explanation                 of this circum
  stance, when       I   have communicated to them the curious ob
 servations    I       have made on that subject.                  I       held out better
                                                                                           than

 than Bruguiere,       because     I was    younger, more habituated to
 bodily exercise, and accustomed              to drink water.
    We    spent some time on the unhealthful                 coast   of Syria,
 waiting for    a vessel to   convey us to Europe.            We     even tra
 versed the island     of Cyprus without any accident, during               the
 most dangerous season          of  the year,     and arrived     at the coast
 of Caramania, with an intention of traversing Asia Minor.
 As the English and Algerines infested the Levant seas, we
 had with us effects too valuable to be exposed to danger.
 This   voyage was less fatal to Bruguiere,            aud   will  be highly
 valuable to botanists ; for, besides various kinds                  of  feeds,
 they will   fee the    fruit of the wild plum, which               we found
 very common in Iconium,               as far as the environs       of Mount
 Olympus.        This    tree does not differ from the cultivated.
Its fruit,   a little larger than the Damascus plum,                is yellow
ish, with a greater or less tinge of red.              It is tartisli, some
what sour when not fully ripe, but in other respects perfectly
similar to our small white plums.
   During     the forced stay,      which      we were    in some measure
obliged to make at Constantinople, to arrange our scattered col
lection, and to wait for        a safe  conveyance, Bruguiere recover
ed,  if not his former     looks, at   least a  pretty good  state  of health.
Our     voyage    to Athens,       and afterwards to Corfu across the
isthmus    of Corinth,       and as far as Ancona,         was very agree*,
able, because we had for fellow-travellers men of intelligence.
   I  accompanied the collection            as far as Milan, from which
I  dispatched    it to Paris.      It will no doubt       be superfluous     to
enumerate to you the very valuable objects which                       I  have

XV. On a New Musical Instrument                            invented by         Dr. Chlad-
  ni ; with some Experiments on                           the Vibrations            of   Sonorous
  Hedits.                                                             ,
IN      the month of February last, Dr. Chladni of Witten
berg, well known by his various publications on philosophi
cal subjects, and particularly his experiments on found, per
formed before              a numerous             assembly at Vienna,                    on a new
instrument he has invented, and to which he gives the name
of Eupbon. This instrument has nothing in common with
the Harmonica but the glass.                         It    consists       of forty-one im-
moveable            parallel cylinders of glass, of equal length and
thickness.            Its construction, tone, and the method of play
ing    it,   are      totally different from those of the                         Harmonica.
At    the same same Dr. Chladni made several curious experi
ments on the vibrations                      of    sonorous bodies,                 by   which   he
stiowed        that       sand or saw-dust,            strewed        over these bodies
while vibrating, forms different regular figures, according to
circumstances.                As   it   may afford satisfaction to our philoso
phical       readers to know                the manner         in which          these    expert
ments may be partly repeated,                        we shall subjoin the follow
ing sliort account:                     Take   a     square     piece       of   glass,     pretty
thin,    such as that used for windows,                            about four or five
inches over,              or even more.              Smooth        it     at the edges on         a
grinding-stone            :   strew     a   little saw-dust over its surface,
                                                       and
lay hold of    gently with the thumb and fore-finger of the
                    it
left-hand, supposing that you lay hold of       the middle.               it   by
With the right-hand rub                       a   violin bow softly against one of
the edges of the glass, drawing                           it   either up or down, in              a
direction almost perpendicular to                          its surface,          and      you   will
then     see   a     tremulous movement and the whole dust leap
about.         If    the bow   exactly in the middle of one of the
                                   is
fides, the dust will arrange                      itself almost in the direction of
the two diagonals, dividing                        the square into               four isosceles
triangles.           If   the bow be applied at                a   quarter only of the

range itself    in  such a manner as to be          found in     the two     dia
meters    of  the square, dividing it into four equal squares.                 At
other times,        if   the   bow deviates a     little, it forms      a sigort
like   a  double C, when the two letters                 are joined     back to
back.      If  the square be held by the two extremities of tf*
diameter, opposite to that against which the bow is sppM.
the dust will form         a  kind of oval, one      of the axes of wbicb
will be the fame diameter. If the glass be of a circular i-
gure and be held by the middle, the dust will arrange itself*
such a manner as to form the fix radii               of a regular htiagoo-

  X HE       second   part   of this work contains          the   following
papers   :  I. Melanderhjelm's continuation of             the History      of
Physical Astronomy.            The author      here   mentions       the at
tempts of the Academy of Paris, in 1730,                     to revive    the
system    of Descartes in opposition      to Newton's system          of gra
vitation,    and particularly      what John Bernouilli          says  in his
New Thoughts on the System of Descartes,                 and the manner
of deducing from it        the orbits and aphelia         of   the planets,
together with the objections which he makes                    to Newton.
D'Alembert       showed,    in his Treatise on the Equilibrium and
Movement of Fluids, the faults committed by Bernouilli,
and proved that, according to        Bernoulli's    system, all the parts
of  such a vortex must complete          the revolution     of their orbits
at the fame time ; and that the planets,           if ihcy    moved round
the fun in such vortices, must            describe   their orbits in the
fame    period ; which,       however, is contrary to nature.              As
Bernouilli     himself found that the        velocity of      such vortices
did not agree with Kepler's rules,           founded     on observation,
lie  endeavoured      to explain this difference, but fell into the
fame errors as before. His new hypothesis also, for explain
ing the motion of the aphelia, was not agreeable to nature ;
and    Bouguer      as  well    as   D'Alembert        showed      that   the
elliptic orbits of the planets could not agree with Descartes's
system    of vortices,   and that this system could not serve to
explain their motion. -II. Experiments with Pietra Fongaia
 (lapis fungi/erj, and Observations on its Nature, by F. A.
 Gadd.      This  species  of earth, found     near Rome, Naples and
Florence, was first discovered by Ferber.              Near Naples it is
found in the chalk-hills, like         a  white stalactites intermixed
                                                                         with

  with  a great many fine roots          of shrubs ; and near         Floms;
  there is  a speciesof it consisting oshardened turf,        which is        <
  up near volcanoes.         The author made experiments with a
  piece procured    from Italy, and found that 100 part* coot ax a
  from 45 to 46 siliceous earth, 33 argillaceous earth, 7 calca
  reous earth, and 00 calx of iron, with some white raagnrfa
 and vegetable alkali.       It is well known, that when this fria
  ble species  of stone is preserved in cellars and moistened             with
 water, it produces abundance of eatable mushroom*,                    which,
  in Italy, are highly esteemed and brought to the first table*.
  The author considers it more beneficial to cultivate morel*
  instead of these in Sweden, and gives an account of the me
 thod.  III. On the     Art of hardening Copper, by PJ. Hjelm.
  Copper,     without   doubt, was earlier known and employed
 than iron    ; and some    ancient weapons of great hardness hare
 given rife to researches in regard to the art of hardening                  it.
 The attempts, however,           to harden it in the fame manner             a*
 steel, all miscarried, and the art was considered as soft.             It was
 then tried whether this object could not be accomplished by
 mixing it with other metals.             Monnet believed that arsenic
 had   been used    by the ancients for this purpose           ;   Geoffrey,
iron; Mongez        and  Dize, tin.       The   last opinion is     strength
 ened by the experiments            of M. Hjelm, who having accu
 rately examined the blade          of a dagger discovered in the earth,
found that it consisted of 83s copper and 16 J tin. Of a like
mixture of both metals he made blades for knives, which in
hardness approached       very near to the former.  IV.           New and

 some parts he has not sufficiently explained                                his    calculations.
 He    has also employed               fluxions sometimes                with long           converg

 author continued the experiments made by Gadolin                                             on this
subject, and found in 100 parts 47 of a peculiar earth, dif   £
ferent from all the other kinds of earth hitherto known,
and to which he gives the name                              of Ytter earth, Yttrica.             The

 Wcstring,      M.D.      Sixth continuation.             Of these   lichens, fit
 for the purposes of dyeing, there arc eleven or twelve kinds, a
greatmany of which grow in Sweden,                    so that large    quantities
of   them might be collected every year.               They afford excellent
nourishment to goats. In forte places they are employed as
 fluffing for chairs and fophas, in the room of horse hair, &c.
such, for example, as the hub. cb.dybciformis, barbatus and
plicatus.      Some kinds, such         as  theL.    barbatus     and plicatus,
are used by the common people as medicine in the hooping-
cough, hemorrhages, jaundice, &c for which the L. birtus
is also used. The author was at great pains to examine
 these different species, and made upwards                of two hundred      ex

 convey whole ideas           ;  or by several successive signals, which,
 by presenting letters and words,                answer    the same purpose.
 The    first kind     of   signals were employed        in the earliest pe
 riods, and some os them were suited to the ear                   as  well  as to
 the eye.       For  the eye the ancients employed           fires and smoke,
 torches, flags, and, in modern times, sky-rockets have been
  used.     For     the  ear they      employed drums and trumpets               ;
 aud, since the invention of gunpowder,                 the. siring  of cannon
  has been applied         to the like use.     But even all      these   are in
  capable of expressing what could be communicated by spee«h
  and  writing;       and to accomplish that object,by signs capable

 of  expressing      all the possible variations and combinations of
the letters     of  the alphabet, forms, in a proper fense, the true
telegraphic art. Even the signals at sea, as they extend only
to particular circumstances, are, when compared to signals
by letters, only a kind           of hieroglyphics.
    The proper telegraphic art, however, was not unknown
to  the ancients.          The Greeks and the Romans, for signals,
made       use   of   pots   silled with lighted twigs and straw,          over
which       they poured       oil;    and    these  being placed in certain
rows, expressed certain letters,                according to the order in
which      each row was lighted,             l'olybius mentions    a  method
in which        the   letters   of the alphabet were divided into five
rows    ;  and by means         of a  certain number of torches, raised
on the right and left, the number of the row, and the letter
in  the row, could be expressed.               The Jhganograpbia       trilbe-
miana of a bonedictinc monk,                in the 15th century, seems to
have been something of the same kind ; but the first experi
ment, after the manner of the Greeks, is described by                     Kir-
 chcrin     his  Art magna Inch        el ttmbne, under the title    of Cry p-
tngamia catoptr'ua.            It was however, imperfect,         and could,
be employed only at a L-cuain distance.                 Schott in his Tecb-
nica c«rio/rt' proposes, from an anonymous author, to erect
 posts upon an eminence, so as to be distinguished through a
 telescope, and on which proper signals could                be elevated as
 might be necessary.             Kessler,  in his Concealed Arts, advises
 characters      lo be cut out on the bottom of         a cask, so as  to ap
pear luminous;           and   H   ok proposes certain figures, the form
of which could         be easily changed, to be suspended on a wood
en frame.          Gautkey       recommends tubes some thousand fa
 thoms in length         ;  Guyat,      tables with the letters cut out      in
them     ; and Paulian, in his Dicl'.onnaire dc           Phyjipu,    a trans
parent figure consisting           of one perpendicular and three hori
 zontal stripes forming ten compartments, each of which, by
 removing boards from behind, can be rendered visible or
 invisible.      The inventions of Linguct, Bergstrasser, Chappe,
 Burja, Bockman, and Achard, were all much on the fame

 plan.     After    this historical introduction, the author describes
 the properties of       a good  telegraph.       These are  :   ist, perfec
 tion in regard to the combination of the characters and the
 property of the signs       ;  art, perfection in regard to easiness        of
 movement and use.             These properties, the author fays,           are
united in that of Chappe.              His    telegraph  consists   of   three
arms, the inclination of which towards each other, towards
the perpendicular post, and towards the horizon,                   give cer
tain positions that represent the old Runic letters, or the oldest
alphabets, and by their combinations 356 positions or parti
cular figns are possible.         In September 1794,, the author be
gan to make experiments in Sweden, before he was ac
quainted with a complete description of the French tele
graph    ; and he     contrived various forms, some like the French
and some entirely different,           till  he at length   fell upon that
which     he here describes,       the combination      and    use of which
are    attended      with great      advantages.      A  description of      it
 without the figures would require too much time.                  It, is pro
 perly a fort of lattice with ten apertures in three vertical
 rows, which can be opened aail shut by means of boards*,
 and which are capable of forming TC24 combinations or dis
  tinct  signals.      These, in order to be easily distinguished and
 repeated      are expressed by figures arranged in tables sub--
joined     to the work ; so that, with these 1024 signs, it is pos
 sible   to   represent     209715s     variations of the figures.          For
 signals     in   the   night-lime     a  lamp is applied behind each
 hole, and covered or uncovered             as may   be necessary.

instant were occupied                by    the reading          of   a    paper on Vision,
by     Dr. Wilson, of which                 we find        it   impossible to give any

     At    the meeting on the 20th,                a   paper was read containing
experiments on vegetation                  in pure water,                by   Dr. Crell.        He
planted the feeds            of sunflowers in      some ferruginous sand which
he had several years employed for sand heats, and which, he
therefore        fays, could contain no carbon.                           The sure          water
was that with which his place                     of   residehec              is   supplied      by
pipes.        The      pot    in    which the feeds were planted was put
into his library, which,                being but seldom opened, be con
cludes,      could thereforecontain no carbonic acid gas (fixed
air).      Four of the feeds grew and flowered: the feeds of
one     of which        were again reared          in      the fame manner                 in   the
following year.              The question put              by   Dr. Crell          is

   The Society of Natural History at Bourdeaux has formed
itself into a Society of the Sciences, Belles-Lettres and Arts ;
and, like the National Institute, is divided into three                             classes      :
1   sl,   Mathematical             and physical sciences             ;   2d,    Moral and
political sciences            ;   3d, Literature and the fine arts.
     The Society of Natural History                       at   Paris, has given itself a
new organization.                      In future    it   will    assemble only once           a
month          ;   but   it   has chosen        ah administration who              will   meet
once every fortnight. This administration consists of six com
missioners, Jufsieu, Lamarck, Hauy, Fourcroy,Desfontaineand

been appointed treasurer, and Cit. Cuvier secretary.      The?
rest of the Society   divided into two sections

of the     present state      of chemistry in Germany, being an ex
tract    of    a letter   from Dr. Girtanner to Van Moni, dated
Gottingen, Sept. 5, 1796, published this year, in one                        of the
German Journals, with some observations                       by Van Mons.
    "  The      system of chemistry in Germany has undergone a
revolution.         The      existence    of phlogistou is no longer de
fended,       but by   Can      (a man of distinguished talents, though
obstinate), Westiumb, Gmelin                     and Crell.       The   three last
have     declared      eternal war against           the anti-phlogistic       doc
trine.       Their    enthusiasm      even proceeds         so  far that,    if  we
still lived in the age         of martyrdom, they would not                hesitate
to suffer themselves to be burnt, in order to prove the exist*
ence    of phlogiston in their bodies.                 Trommsdorf,       who has
embraced        the new doctrine,          still adheres,    however, in some
small      points to the old.          Gottling       defends    his new hypo
thesis.     Among our youngchemifts, Scherer of Jena promises
great     things.      He is a zealous follower of the French che
mistry,       a good    experimenter, and           possessed  of   great know
ledge    :   there   is nothing       but the res angusta           domi    which
prevents       him from labouring and making new discoveries.
Professor      Mayer     at   Erlangen is      a  man of great talents, who
to natural philosophy and chemistry unites a profound know
ledge    of   the mathematics like Monge at l'ari3.                  Hermbiiadt
does every        thing he can for the advancement- of the new
doctrine.         The   above is a faint sketch          of the present state    of
chemistry in Germany.
   " As my occupations              have not permitted me to continue
my experiments on phosphorus and alkalies,                      I  am  unwilling
to communicate              to you those        I have made,      until  I  repeat
them     :   I will, however,        venture       to assure   you, that phos
phorus is a compound               of azot       and   hydrogen.       All phos
phorus contains more or               less   carbon    ; but, ia my opinion,
that principle does not enter into its composition.
    "   I   have proved that phosphorus may shine in azotic gas
and carbonic          acid gas by means           of  the   water which       these
                                                                             gases

 gases    contains, and which the phosphorus decomposes ;                 as  is
 proved by the phosphorated           hydrogen gas obtained in these
 experiments.       I explain by    this the experiments of Gottling.
 I     wait    with   patience    for the memoir you have an
 nounced, and in which you have proved that I was deceived
 in regard to the muriatic radical. I shall repeat the experi
 ments;       and whatever be the result,        shall render homage         lo
 truth."
     The following observations on          the above letter have been
published by Van Mons :
                                   " This   letter might induce people-
 to believe that the four chemists,        of whom Girtanner speaks,
 still  profess the   principles of the theory of Slahl.            On this
subject      I  ought to undeceive        those who        have been     pre
vented by the         war from being fully acquainted               with the
progress     of the new chemistry in Germany.             Thatcountry has
ceased to have among its chemical writers                  any    partizan  of
the unqualified system of phlogiston, since           I convinced themof
the presence os oxygen in the oxyd of red mercury.                      They
have all adopted the new doctrine withoutrestriction,                 or with
restrictions of very little consequence.               Crell, Westrnmb,
Wiegleb, Trommfdorf, Gmelin, Richter, Leonardi, &c. in
endeavouring to unite the new theory with the existence
of phlogiston in combustible           bedies, all admit       it in general
and all its consequences.          They wish only to        save themselves
from the appearance of          a complete    defeat.      Those who still
adhere to the preservation         of  that  agent,      consider it as the
basis of light,     or  as  dormant light.       This basis, abundantly
contained in inflammable substances, when it meets and
combines itself with caloric, constitutes luminous fire; which
explains why combustible substances                require a certain de
gree    of  heat before they are inflamed.         This    system, and the
applications of it which follow,         are the only points in        which
they diffej- from us      : in all the other explanations they agree
perfectly with our principles.           We     shall   fee   how little in
fluence     these theories   modified will have over the future pro
gress    of found chemistry in Germany.
                                                                    "  Gren,

according to the principles of the French system.                    In his
Manual of Chemistry, printed two years ago,                  he gave the
theory of oxygen along with that of phlogiston.                He did    al
most     the fame     thing, the     preceding year,      in the second
 edition of The Grounds of Natural Philosophy.                    A    third
 edition of that work is now printing, in which he will give
 an account of the phenomena of that science                according to
 the pure system of Lavoisier.          .His Journal of Natural Phi
 losophy, of which       eleven volumes have appeared,         has always
 admitted indiscriminately articles for and against both theo
 ries.     That Gren     should   so  long doubt, can astonish those
 only who are ignorant, that to think for oneself gives birth to
 scepticism    and diversity    of opinions.
     "   Gmelin    is exclusively   employed, as we may fay, with
  historical and technical chemistry.          In the second edition of
 his Manual of Chemistry,           as applied  to the  Arts, whieh        he
  has just finished,    he gives the little theory required      in such a
  work     according lo the old principles ; but in addressing
  himself to beginners, ought he not to speak in language that
  is known and suited to their comprehension? His Introduc
  tion to General Chemistry gives an account of the state and
   progress   of the science in both theories.
     "   Westi umh gives alfomany articles of technical chemistry,
   which he treats of with a knowledge and discernment which
   denote a chemist well versed in the practical part of his art.
   His writings on pharmacy evidently            show that they are the
   work of a man who has          seen   much and reflected well on an
   art where a great deal still remains to be done.                 In bcih
   these kinds    of labour   he prefers facts to reasoning.

             EARTHQUAKE IN SOUTH AMERICA.
   A   letter,    dated   Quito, February 30,         1797,    contains the
following       particulars respecting this dreadful catastrophe,
some account of which has already appeared in different
gazettes:
   "    History affords no example           of  a  devastation    like that
which     lately took place in the provinces of Taninga,                 Am-
bato, Riobamba, Alaosi,            part  of Chimbo      and   Quito. Not
a house has been left standing:             every thing ia levelled       with
the ground.         We      are assured, that      the volcano     of Maas
made a most dreadful eruption, and split in two parts,                  which
separated      from each other.          An earthquake, which took
place at the same time, shook the mountains with such vio
lence that they were dastied against each other, and threw
up sometimes          stones    with clouds of dust, and sometimes
streams    of burning lava, .or water.          The mountain Ygualata
in  falling  threw out a      stream   of lava  which    rolled alonsi with
fiery waves, and whioh in its course totally destroyed Capalpi,
San Andreas,          Ouaofto,     Emlyies,     Guanando,       and several
other places.        The mountain Moya              almost   dissolved    into
water, and swept away Pchle and the celebrated                   plantation
of St. I   dephonso,       where a thousand persons perished. The
mountain Euero fell on the village of the samename, without
leaving    a single witness     of this melancholy      catastrophe.      The
mountain        Yatagui     fell upon Masoro, and          opened      such  a
dreadful    gulph, that every thing, houses, churches, and in
habitants, all but two persons,             were    swallowed up by it.
This    place    was     converted   into a bituminous        lake, which
                                                                     emitted

so great, that all the gold and silver of America will hardly
be     sufficient to       repair the              devastation.           The number of
those who have lost their lives cannot                             be    ascertained     ;    but
it   must be very considerable.              The provinces of Riobamba,
&c.     have suffered most         :    in the last many died of hunger,
and even os thirst,          as   all the water was corrupted.                        In other
districts the        shocks still continue               ;    and the lakes throw up
flames.         At Sambagna             and        Timba new rivers               have       burst
forth     at different places."
            SINGULAR              MAGNETIC                    PHENOMENON.
     In   the     Reicbs.nzeiger,              a   German periodical work, No.
CCXXII.          for 1797, it is said, that                  a certain person        having an
artificial magnet suspended from the wall os his study with a
piece     of iron adhering         to    it,   remarked, for several years, that
the flics in the room, though they frequently placed them
selves on other iron articles, never settled on the artificial
magnet     ;     and even that          if    any    of      these insects        approached
 it,   they in   a   moment again removed                          from   it     to some dis
 tance.      "   It   is   worth the           trouble,"          fays    Professor      Voigt,
 who repeats the fame circumstance                           in   his Journal,       " to make
 further     observation! on this phenomenon                              ;   and,     were      it
 confirmed, ta magnetise iron might be employed to preserve
it  from being dirtied      flics.      by

       Dr. Van Marum              has    discovered               a   very simple method,
 proved         by   repeated experiments, of preserving                          the air pure
 in large halls, theatres,              hospitals,            ice.      The   apparatus         for
 this purpose        is   nothing but         a     common lamp, made accord
 ing to Argand's construction, suspended from the                                    roosofthe
 hall and kept burning under                   a    funnel, the tube of which rises
 above the roof without,                 and        is   furnished        with   a   ventilator.
 For his        first experiment he                filed his large laboratory with
                                                                                               th5

        A    letter from         Dr. B. Lynde Oliver, of the state os
     Massachusetts            in North America, to a medical gentleman
     in this country, who               has favoured            us with    a    perusal of         it,

     acceptable     to practitioners          :

  common marine salt, and diluted with thrice                                   its quantity      of
 hot water, in dysentery.                      Dr. Perkins          had the merit           of   in
 troducing this composition in that particular                                 disease.     From
 the trials   I     have made           of    the efficacy       of this   medicine, Urn

 almost inclined to believe that                      it   will supersede        the      of
 other remedies.           I       have seen patients apparently                  snatched       by
it    from the jaws            of death.       I     generally join        a     little lauda-
 nuni with          it,   but first abate the violence of the                     disease

 few doses      of the mixture. Oftentimes the                        first dose       has gi«n
a    favourable      turn to the disease."
      The following           is   a   copy    of Dr. Perkins's         notice         published
on this subject           :
       A    useful Treatment or the Dysentery and Scarlattu
                                   J                              ,
                       Anginofa or Canker Wajb.
      IN    the course        of   an extensive practice for about                   five vast
past,   I    have met with the most pleasing success                               in   treating
the dysentery and scarlatina                        anginofa;       and as these           com
plaints frequently extend their baneful ravages,                               I   takeplu-
sure    in   communicating               to     the    public       a   simple         remedy)
which,       when judiciously used,                 has seldom failed of            removing
those diseases.
  Saturate any quantity of the best vinegar with common
marine salt to one large table- spoonful of this solution, n*
                ;
four times the quantity of boiling water                        j   let the patient         take
of   this preparation, as hot as               it   can be swallowed,            one spoon

fill   once in half a minute until the whole is drank               :   this for
an adult.       The quantity may be varied according to the age,
size, and constitution       of  the patient.      If necessary,   repeat the
dose     once in fix or eight hours.            Considerable evacuations
I    conceive     to be not only         unnecessary,    but injurious,        as
they    serve to   debilitate and prolong the disease.
     A   tea  of plantain, or some olher cooling, simple drink,
may be useful, and          isa    thirst for cyder be discovered,       it may
be gratified.
      Carefully avoid keeping this preparation in            vessels partak
ing of the qualities of lead*,            as the poison produced        by that
means may prove dangerous.
     The success of the remedy depends much on preparing and
giving the dose,        as above directed.       The simplicity of this
treatment renders it the more valuable,               as all persons have it
in their power to avail themselves of its use.  I have found
it useful in agues, diarrhas, and the yellow fever.
         DISTANCE         OF COMETS FROM THE EARTH.
      Mr. Proserpin, who in          the years 1775 and 1785 published
 in the Transactions of           the Swedish Academy of Sciences,
 papers on the least distance           of  comets from the earth,            has
published, in the        XVIIili Vol.        Part  I. of the fame work,         a
 continuation of that subject, in which he gives a calculation
 of all those that have appeared since 1785. He enumerates
 the     different    comets    observed     by   Saron,    Mechain,        Von
  Zach,      Maftelyne and Rode, and marks their least distance
 from the earth in an annexed table.                  It appears from this
  paper, that     none   of   these eleven     comets can approach          very
  near to the earth.        That, *ven, which          passes  at     the   least
  distance,    cannot approach           nearer to it then about thirteen
  times the distance      of    the    moon from the earth        ;     and the
  two next,     when nearest to us, are twenty or twenty-six
  times as far     from the earth.         Besides   these, three only can

      This caution ought to   be r.\ tended to tome other metals also.     Edit.

 ijINCE       I  wrote my last       essay  on this subject*,     several
new circumstances have been made known, which seem still
farther to confirm my theory.            One of the most interesting
phenomena       of this     kind was the fliower of stones near
Sienna, on the 16th of June 1794, of which an account has
been given in the works        of  several Italian and other philoso-
sophers; and in        a  paper, by      Mr. Zolner,      in the Berlin
 Monatfcbrift for September           1796.    About    seven o'clock   in
 the evening of that day there        appeared,  at the above place, a
 longisli, round, dark cloud, totally insulated, which by its
 singular appearance       excited    fear as well as attention, and
 was observed, at    the.  lame time, at various places lying at         a
 considerable   distance from each other.        All of   a sudden there

  an ell in the earth. One of them pierced the brim of a
  boy's hat and singed the felt        :  others, which fell upon trees,
  left traces of their ignition       on the leave?.         Some of     con
  siderable size, which fell in a pond, splashed the water act u>
  a considerable   distance,    and made      it  even begin   to boil. The
  government found means to drain the pond                in order to  get at
  the stones,   which     were     purchased      at a dear   rate bv some
  English travellers then in that part           of the country ; and on
  this account many attempted to make such stones artirjciaDv,
 so that people in purchasing these curiosities were frequently
  in danger of being      cheated.
     It was at first believed that this phenomenon tnigfct have
 had some connection with the eruption of Vesirvius, which
 took place the day before; but the Italian naturalists all now
 affrec that this opinion is entirely void          of foundation,    as the
 stones   which fell from      the   atmosphere       had no similarity to
 the volcanic substances thrown up by Vesuvius,                  and  as  the
 place    where   they fell was       above     200 miles     distant from
 that mountain.         A    stone   of this kind, which was sub
jected to examination, was inwardly of an                 ash grey colour;
 and had a dull earthy fracture mixed              with shining metallic
 particles which resembled pyrites.              In other specimens there
were found octocdral crystals,           which were sound to be mag
 netic iron.     The colour on        the outside was a greyish      black,
 and the wrinkled surface betrayed marks of fusion.
     This  substance,   in all probability, was of the fame nature
 as  that which fell, with      a dreadful    explosion,   from a fire-ball
 (Mis) in Gascony on the 24th of July 1790,                  as mentioned
 in the Decade Pbilofofbique of February the 29th, 1796,
and as many others of the like kind quoted in my treatise on
the iron mass found by Professor Pallas, and on similar bodies.
Since that period two new circumstances of this nature have
been made known.            In the Englisli journals there is        an ac-
                                                                      count

                       Observations     on Fire-Bails.                    339
count of      a stone  weighing fifty-six pounds, which fell from
the     atmosphere     with    a  loud report at Wold           Newton in
Yorksliire, on      the 13th day      of December        1795.   As it funk
only eighteen, or according              to others twenty-one        inches
into the earth, it       is to be conjectured         that the ground was
extremely hard, or that the stone did riot fall in a solid body,
but in a soft liquid mass. It was still warm to the touch
when found       ;  seemed externally      of  a  black colour, and in the
inside exhibited shining particles and traces of sulphureous
vapours.        In  the   Gentleman's Magazine,             for September
1796,      there is an account       of  some     stones   which fell near
Petreswood, in the county of WestmcatH in Ireland,                    in the
year     1779, accompanied           by a violent        clap of thunder.
These stones,        which    had no likeness to any         of the known
foflils   in that neighbourhood,           weighed only        3^  ounces;
they were almost like free Hone,           of    a whitish brown colour,
 and in the inside were interspersed with silvery white, shining
 specks.     They were still warm when taken up, and after
 they fell the whole neighbourhood was silled with sulphure
 ous vapour.       In  a work published at          London in    1796,    en
 titled, Remarks concerning Stones aid to have fallen from
 the Clouds, by Edward           King, with which I         am acquainted
only     by  the Englilh      Reviews,     an    account is given of the
 above    phenomenon, and of several others               of the like kind.
 Interesting observations         by Mr. Bottiger of the accounts
 given in ancient      authors of stones said to have fallen from
 the heavens,      may be found in the Genna^ Monatfcbrtft for
 August 1796, where the author shews that Anaxagoras ex
 plained this phenomenon              in the     fame    manner   as I   have
 done.      The   cafe with this conjectural theory          of mine   is the
  fame as   with the theory of comets, which by Seneca were
  considered as regular planetary bodies*; but by others
  afterwards   as terrestrial    meteors, till more accurate       observa
  tion shewed that Seneca was right.

    The only     instance   of  a soft, frothy mass        being fouud ci
the place where         a  fire-ball    fell is  that which occurred in
Lufatia; and the neighbouring districts, on the 8th               of March
1796;      and   of which     an   account was given,         in particular
by Mr.        Von    Gersdorf    and    Mr.     Bauer,   in    the Lusauan
Monatfcbrift for April and May 1 796. The fallen mass ap
peared to be onlv a part which had been broke off, or which
had, in some measure, dropped from one of these fire-ball*.
It  is much to be lamented that the apparent course                  of this
body,     as  far as cquld be dune by the eye,           was   not observed
with     sonic accuracy, as has been the cafe with others              men
tioned in my Treatise upon Iron Masses, &c. that by calcu
lating their parallax their real path might be discovered.
Its velocity mud have been as great as that of many other
fire-balls, w hich have moved at the rate of several German
miles per second,         a*>d  equal to the velocity        of the planet*
in their     courses.    This lire-ball, as was the case with that
observed      on the    a;d of July 1762, and with others, was
first visible at a considerable       height above the horizon        in the
form of a shining point; moved                 along in   a  somewhat ser
pentine direction,        and    increased     suddenly   to a considerable
size:     the   duration    of  the   whole phenomenon was about
two seconds.
    It  is much to be wished that some one              could give a more
accurate      account of the fire-ball which, as           I have been   in
formed, sell      a feu- years ago     in the   sea near Genoa, and oc
casioned a strong ebullition         in   the water.
    I  consider it as not superfluous        to give here a short   account
of  some more instances           of stones and masses       of iron which
have fallen from the atmosphere,             as  mentioned in my Essav,
because some,        on account of my apparent paradoxical me
thod of explaining          these phenomena,         may have been pre
vented from reading that work ; and to take some notice                    of
the circumstances attending them, which, on account                        of
their great conformity,         cannot be denied.          A  very remark
                                                                        able

able instance,         which is related                 by    Mt. Stiitz, took          place at
fix o'clock .in the evening on the 26th of May 1751, in the
district of Agram in Sclavonia.   This fire-ball, which burst
asunder       into two parts, that had the fonn of chains of sire
twilled together (and, according to all appearance,                                were liquid
masses),       seemed      accompanied with smoke, and fell with                                       a
dreadful explosion and such force that it (hook the earth, in
to which it sunk to the depth of three fathoms.     One part
weighed        71 and      the    other 16 pounds.                      The larger, which
               of iron, and exhibits on its surface the

evident marks of tire, is now to be seen in the Imperial                                         col
lection of natural curiosities at Vienna, together with an at
testation      respecting it from the Consistory of the Bisliopric
of Agram, who examined                       several eye -witnesses              that had seen
it,and which Mr. Stiitz                      has    inserted        in his paper.                The
fame naturalist quotes also two other instances.                                  One       is   of    a
stone,       which, according            to the account given, fell                      with          a
violent explosion          in    the distficl       of Eichltadt,           and was         so   hot
that   it    could not be touched till                  it   had been cooled         in snow           :
this stone consists of siliceous earth and ferruginous particles,
and     is   covered with        a   crust     of native iron.              The other            is    a
(hining iron ore described                   by    Born      *,   interspersed     in   a   greert
matrix having          a   scoriaceous            surface,        and   which,      as we are
assured,   fdl from        the heavens during                  a   thunder-storm, on the
3d    of July 1753.
      In the History of           the Academy                of Sciences for         1769, we
find very remarkable accounts of three                                  masses     which fell
from the clouds during                  a    thunder-storm.                These accounts
were     transmitted,       to    the    Academy               by   their correspondents
from Maine, Artois, and Cotantin,                                 three places lying             at    a
very great distance              from each              other.       The fame circum
stances were remarked to have taken place in regard to these
three        masses.    They         were      all hot when              first   found   ;       they
were     of the   fame composition, as they contained sulphur and
iron, and were covered with                   a    hard crust of that metal. They

in the      course    of its somewhat                serpentine        course, as is usual,
may have made several explosions.                           Ancient authors, such as
Pliny, Plutarch           and        Livy      relate various          instances          of stones
that fell from the heavens, which are commonly                                           considered
as fabulous;          but which, on account of the number                                     of new
observations of the like kind, may be considered                                       as real phe
nomena of nature.                    Avicenna         mentions         a   sulphureous kind
of    stone    which          fell    from the atmosphere                         at   Cordova in
Spain *.        It    is related in Spangenberg's Chronicon                                Saxora-
eum, that two large stones fell at Magdeburg,                                           in the year
998, with loud explosions                      like thunder.               Cardan         relates   -f,
that in the year 1510 several large stones fell from the
heavens, which were mostly of a ferruginous colour, ex
ceedingly hard, and, when found, (till exhaled a sulphureous
vapour.       We      arc assured by             Julius Scaliger             J,    that he him
self had in his possession                   a piece     of iron which fell from the
atmosphere         in Savoy.         Muschenbroek § and various other
writers mention           a    blackish stone of 300 pounds weight ex
hibiting      traces     of fire, which              fell at Ensishcim                 in Alsace in
1493     or 1493,        anQt        which was said to be preserved                           in the
church of that place.                     of the year 1766 1
                                         In     the summer
stone fell from the clouds at Alboreto, in the duchy of Mo-
dena, which is briefly mentioned by Vassalli in his Phyfico-
meteorological Letters                 ||,    and    on which Troili has written                    a
treatise.      In the Breslau collection respecting natural history
four instances are quoted of stones having dropped from the
heavens.        Five    stones, as large as              a   man's head, exceedingrr
heavy, of      a     rusty iron        colour, and having                  a     strong smell       of
sulphur, fell from the heavens with explosions and                                        a   dread

the 26th of               July        1581,   between the hours of one and two
in   the afternoon, a stone 39 pounds in weight,                                      of   a   blue and
brownish colour,                      and which       struck        sire   with steel, fell from
the clouds in Thuringia, with an explosion                                      which shook the
earth, and accompanied by the appearance                                         of    a small       light
cloud, that could have been nothing                                        but a fire-ball,            the
heavens         at      that time being in other respects serene.                                    This
stone, which funk                       to a considerable            depth       in the ground,
made the earth                   fly   up to twice the height of                 a   man, and was
so   hot that no person could touch it.                                     We      arc told that       it
was carried to Dresden.                        On     the 6th         of March         1636, while
the heavens were perfectly serene,                               a   large      (lone fell with         a
loud crash between Sagan and the village of Dubrow in Si
lesia.       It    had internally the appearance                           of   a   mineral, could
be easily rubbed to powder, was covered on the outside                                               with
a   crust, and seemed as                      if   burnt    by sire.            On     the     16th     of
March         1698,        a      black stone fell from the atmosphere                               with
various explosions, and was transmitted with an account                                                 of

the fire-ball, mentioned in the Philosophical Transactions                            *,
fell in Jamaica, in the year 1700. In that spot there were
found several holes in the earth, which were so deep, that the
poles with    which they         were examined did not reach                     to the
bottom of them.             A   sulphureous vapor was perceived                  in the
neighbourhood,            and    the grafs around the holes appeared
scorched.
  When all       these data,       which       correspond          so   well with each
other, are compared with the observations made on other
fire-balls, where no opportunity occurred of getting posses
sion of the fallen masses, the following conclusions may be
drawn     :
  I. That      the accounts given of scoriaceous                         masses, which
contained iron,   earth, sulphur, &c. having fallen from the
heavens  with violent explosions, are not fictions, but true re
lations of real natural phenomena actually observed at va
rious times.
   II.    That fire-balls       and the falling              of   such masses are the
fame meteor.
   Respecting the question, whence fire-balls and such fallen
masses proceed, opinions are very different.                            Most people be
lieve that they are owing to accumulations                                in the atmo
sphere.       But   even when        it   is allowed that a great many fo
reign substances are dissolved in the atmosphere,                           the quantity
of them, especially in regions at the distance of eighty
miles or more, from which such fire-balls are seen to fall
in the form of        a luminous       point, is too small to admit of our
supposing     such large masses to be formed                       of it.    Should   the
solid particles,which may perhaps be dissolved in the atmo
sphere, precipitate themselves, it would be rather in the form
of a fine powder. I consider      therefore, with Anaxagoras,

our    earth   must     fall down.         That material         bodies      actually

accumulated luminous               sparks    which Dr. Schroter              saw pass
over the field of his telescope,             as    also by the shooting stars
which      pass   by our earth, probably at             a greater     distance and
with      greater velocity than to allow their being attracted                            by
it,   and made to fall to its surface,             and to    which, fire-balls on

minous point, have            a   perfect resemblance. There are many
reasons for inducing us to believe that shooting stars cannot
be mere electric          phenomena without              the presence of some
coarser substances.

of these phenomena, many                  facts    of this kind      have been de

II.     Hijlorical Remarks relative to the Manufactures of Iron
       and Steel in Great Britain.   By Mr. David Mushet,
       of the Clyde Iron Works. Communicated by the Author.
It        is uncertain at what period the manufacture of iron
                                  'It
commenced in Britain.                   is probable that the working                of
the iron       mines      of Cornwall by the Phnicians,                       would
introduce into the country a class of men (killed in all the
then known            metallic ores;        capable  of appreciating their
true value, by converting               the     riches of an unexplored
country,       either to their own immediate wants,                       or to the
conveniencies of the unskilful inhabitants.                        The invasion of
England by the Danes, and their consequent establishment,
would, most likely, add to the farmer stock of knowledge in
the art of mining and fusing ores. Large heaps of scoria
arc to this day met with in many places in England, with so
great an accumulation of soil as to grow trees                           of   a large
size    *j    these heaps are called Danes cinders, and are                    in our
times smelted to advantage for the production of crude iron.
From whatever period the iron trade may date its origin ;
certain it      is,   that towards the end of the 16th and early in
the 17th centuries we find              it   had attained         a   pitch of mag
nitude almost incredible, at            a   time       so   hostile to the peaceable
views and           industry of   the manufacturer.                Hence we find,
that cannon and mortars, of various calibres and construe-,
tions, were fabricated from cast-iron at some of the English
works     ;   and     that this species of manufacture                 was in con
siderable      request on the continent.                The calibre of the gun
was in thole clays, and within these forty years, formed                          by a

     Hitherto, cast and malleable iron were obtained from ores

 for each ton of iron, and reckoning 8 cwt. charcoal to each

 an average nearly 1875 pounds avoirdupoise, we find that
                                              was necessary to produce

       Mr. Dudley also informs us, that at the fame period there
  were reckoned 500 forges and iron mills
                                                          for refining the

year's supply at that period = 10,732,000 cubical feet *.
     Let     the waste       of   the   refining       furnace in those days be
reckoned equal to 50 per cent. 112,500 tons of pig iron must
have then been used to fabricate 75,000 tons of bars, and a
reversion        of 67,500 tons          cast into cannon,              mortars, wares,
&e. or exported in a raw                 state as     pig iron or ship ballast.
     However much the above quantities may be exaggerated,
as   I am      inclined to think they are, yet they seem to prove that,
at the commencement of the last century, the iron business
had obtained an eminent rank among the manufactures of
the country.              The   progress       of agriculture and the increase
of population under               the  reign of the peaceable James had at
length taught the husbandman and the proprietor the value
of cultivated          fields.     The great consumption of wood for the
navyand ironworks had greatly exhausted the principal forests
 of supply        :  tracts of country became cleared, and in propor
 tion     as   the spirit of cultivation increased, the annual quan
 tity of fuel for the manufacturing of iron diminished.
     Pit-coal        had    been     long known            before     this period, and
 wrought          at Newcastle         prior to the year 1272.                 Annually
 Yast quantities          of it   were exported          to   Holland, and the Low

iron alone amounts to 2S,o62,ooo              cubical sect.      Let  an acre of ground    be
supposed to afford 2coo cubical feet of timber, then it will be found                    that
141O3 1 acres        of land were annually          swept to suppry the iron manufac
turers.       Admitting that wood fully replaces its cubical                contents   in iS
years, then 251,558          acres   of land would have been required to furnilh
the     necessary     consumption of timber, without in the end diminishing
the supply.          Besides iron works, smiths' and nailors' sires, manufactories             "
of every fort were carried          on by means      of wood ; even at a time when pit

  in making coak pig iron, though only at the sparing rate of
   3 tons per week. By this time many of the iron works were
   at a stand     for want of wood ; the consequence             was, an ad
   vance on the price       of iron    :   this therefore   rendered it a lu
   crative business to those manufacturers whose supply os wood
   was still undiminiihed,        and, of course, made them hostile td
   any innovation whereby the present price osiron was likely tv
   meet with      a reduction.
        This period of prejudice        so   unfavourable to innovation irt
   the iron business, was followed by one more general, and
   more calamitous for the nation.                Amidst the distraction oc
    casioned    by civil war, neither innovation           nor improvement
    could be expected.          Patents however were granted to some
    during the commonwealth for the exclusive manufacture of
    iron in the new way       ; in one of which it was believed Crom
    well was a partner:          these    partly shared    the   same fate as
    did their predecessors, and none succeeded in establistiing a
    manufactory cither ot extent or of certainty.                  In 1663 we
     liud Dudley applying         for his last patent, and setting forth,
   that at one time he was capable                of producing    7 tons coak
     pig iron weekly, with an improved furnace 27 feet square,
     and bellows which one man could work for an hour without
     being much tired.
         It was not   till impelled by necessity, by the rapid* decline
     of  the annual growth of timber, that pit-coal became an ob
    ject    of  universal   estimation.        When    the improvements on
                                                                     machinery

   350               Hijlorical  Remarks    relative   to
  machinery had attained a pitch of certainty, and                 experience
  had    taught the mechanic          the   manifold      advantages     to be
  derived from the steam-engine,             men   of industry and       enter
  prise began       to  think of extending the manufactures of the
^country     in iron with pit-coal.         Small furnaces supplied with
  air from leathern bellows, blown by oxen, horse, or                  human
  labour, became exploded, and an increase                of size tookpla,
  together with an increase        of the column of blast necessary to
  excite combustion.         But  as it seldom happened, that            to the
  advantage       of having pit-coal,     ores, and limestone         concen
  trated   in one    spot, water also was added,       it became     necessary
 to form a substitute.          For this   purpose,     the   steam-engine,
 that superhuman invention, was applied.                   Rude    and unpo
 lished no doubt were its earlv designs            and execution         rapid
 however have been its improvements                ; and at      the   present
 time, by many"it is believed          to have    arrived at     the highest
 possible pitch of human perfection.
     With the improvements in machinery the                    advancement
 in the practice of manufacturing coak pig iron kept pee;
and it is now a certain truth, that with pit-coal in our time
we produce a quality         of pig iron   superior   for every    purpose ot
the    arts   (bar iron making excepted) to that at any time
made with charcoal of wood, and in the following increiled

     By  these statements           it may be    seen   that all along there
 has been preserved an analogy between                  the value      of  the re
 spective states     of the metal.          We cannot, however,             be but
 astonished      at the mighty advance on iron              within    the last six
 years, nearly and in some cases              more than equal to the adj
 Vance    of  a period    of   1
                                 70 years before.
     Let it   be taken for granted, that the manufacture                   of En
 gland, Scotland         and     Ireland at the beginning of the 17th
 century amounted           in   crude   iron to 180,000 tons.

     In Britain     at present the total produce         in pig iron      does not
 exceed      100,000 tons;           and reckoning on an average that
 33 cwt. of crude         iron     produces 1 ton of bars, and that the
 manufacture of          malleable      iron amounts to 35,000 tons per
  annum,
                                                                            57750

    The   extenfive   manufacturers      of this country
have for many years pad demanded             an additional
fupply of foreign bar iron.        This has been chiefly
 received   from Ruflia    and    Sweden, and the an
nual quantity may be averaged             for the laft 20
years at 70000 tons, at     18 /. per ton,          -        £.1,260,000
    This may     be taken as the annual amount        of   one
raw material, the chief part of which becomes
more valuable in an uncommon ratio, by fubfe-
quent labour.

exclufive of the additional value ftamped upon iron in the now
extenfive   operations of flitting it into rod iron for nails, roll
ing it into hoops, and converting it into fteel.                   In thefe
manipulations value is gained        as follows    :  Rod iron 3/. 10s.
per ton.     Hoops 7/. Bliftered fteel 7/. 109/. Tilted fteel

fteel according to the fizc       of the bars    30/.    to  45/. per ton.
Some of thefe operations are attended with             a wafte    of metal,
though not nearly in the proportion of making bar iron from
pig iron. The manufacturer of fteel alfo buys his iron at
                                                                        the

the    rate         of   21   cwt.     1    qr. 20 Ib. to each ton, or 130 lb. instead
of   112 lb. for each hundred weight.
     It       is    uncertain whether the quality of steel, fabricated
from English iron                     at the above early period, was                         in any way
comparable with what we now make from foreign iron                                                   ;    or
whether the artists were supplied with this                                     state    of   the metal
from Spain and the Low Countries.                                       The   latter     is most pro

(their bulbs being above 4 inches in diameter) having                                         ex

most rapid motion,                  running swiftly in two                  opposite direc

this point,        a     certain quantity             of    heat was     made       to pass
through a given quantity of pure water ; and, noting the
time employed, the experiment was repeated with water
mixed with             some      sine substance,            as eider-down,          which,
without altering                its chemical       properties, or impairing                  its
fluidity,     could only serve to obstruct and embarrass                           the mo

should heat be transported                  and    carried in this manner, and
not   pass freely through             it.
  The body which received the heat, and which served at
the same time to measure the quantity of it communicated,
was a very large thermometer                      cf (Plate     IX. Jig. I.),       with a
cylindrical bulb           c made           of thin copper, spherical               at the
ends, i#84 inches in diameter, 4*99 long, of 132099 cubic
inches capacity, and measuring externally 28-834 square
inches : it weighed 1846 gr. and could contain 3344 gr. of
w ater at the temperature                   of 55°.        To this bulb    was affixed
a glass tube       ef    (represented         in the plate as broken off at                 f)
24 inches long and ,* of an inch in diameter, by means of
a cork fitted into a neck of copper 1 inch long, belonging
to the bulb.           This thermometer, silled with linseed oil and
graduated, was fixed in the axis        of a hollow cylinder                          (-¦   b   is

and    2*3435       inches diameter within, with                   a    spherical       bot
tom, weighing 2261 gr.                      The bulb of the thermometer                     was
made to occupy the lower part                      of this cylinder       by   means            of
4   pins of wood          ,'5   of   an inch      in diameter      and   \    of   an inch
long, one       of them           fastened      to the bottom, the other three
round the inside           of     the cylinder at equal distances,                  in very
small sockets made                to receive       them.       (These     pins may be

       The bulb of the thermometer being surrounded by water,
 er by any other            liquid, or mixture, the conducting power of
 which          was to    be ascertained, a cylinder of cork b something
less* in diameter than the brass cylinder, about half an
 inch long, having a hole in its centre in which the tube of
 the thermometer passed freely, was thrust down into the
 brass cylinder nearly to the surface of the substance it con
 tained, and made to              rest    on three projecting brass points fixed
 to the neck of the copper bulb. The upper part of the tube
 was then filled with eider-down and closed with a cork stop
 per       g,   the tube    of   the thermometer,           which        passes    through a
 sit   hole in the middle of this stopper, projecting upwards.
The         scale from the point           of freezing      to that      of boiling water
is on that part            of the tube which          rises above the stopper, and
 is divided according to that                 of Fahrenheit.
       The thermometer being                  fixed    in the         tube   as above      de
scribed, surrounded              by the substance the conducting power os
which was to be ascertained,                       the instrument was placed in
thawing ice, and kept there                    till the thermometer fell to 320.
 It    was then taken
                    out and instantly plunged into boiling
 water, and the conducting power of the substance under ex
periment was eltimated by the time required to make the
heat pas) through it into the thermometer; the time being
carefully noted when the liquid in the thermometer arrived
at 400, and also when                    it came      to every 20th degree             above
it.
       A    number of experiments were made                      w    ith this instrument,
all of which tended to prove that the passage of heat through
water is much impeded, by mixing other substances with                                      it,

    The    starch was       boiled with the water with which it was
mixed,     as was also the          eider-down  the latter to free it from
 air, which     adheres to it         with    great obstinacy.
    As Count Rumsord supposes, and justly, that there is a
 possibility of error when the results are determined by the
 extreme points freezing and boiling, owing to the slowness
 of the  process when the instrument approaches the medium
 of the  temperature        in which it        is placed, he thinks they may
 be got more accurately by taking the times occupied in heaU
 ing from     8o° to 160.           They were       as follows      :

chanical means, and without forming any combination with
it whatever, merely obstruct its internal motions, it appear*
to the ingenious author, and we believe it will not be denied,
that this proves, that heat is propagated in water in ean/t-
quence     of   its internal motions               ; or, that it is transported or
carried by the particles of                     thai,liquid, and that it dots not
spread     and expand             in    it,   as in metals and              other conductors
of   heat, as has generally been imagined.
     The   success         of    these experiments encouraged the author
to plan and execute others                      still more decisive             and extremely
interesting.           It   has    been generally believed                     that water can
not be heated          in   contact with ice               :   reflecting on the subject,
he perceived           that either this must be                  a   mistake, or bis ideas
respecting       the    manner in which heat                       is   propagated in Out
fluid, erroneous. On the                      supposition       that water       is   not   a   con
ductor of heat, according                     to the common acceptation                     of that
term, or that heat cannot                       pass    in that fluid,           except wb.en
carried     by   its particles,          which, being put in motion                         by the
change     it    occasions             in their     specific       gravity,      transports           it
from place to place,              it    did not appear how ice,                  if,   instead of
being permitted to swim on water,                                it   were confined at the
bottom of        it,   or any where below the surface, could affect the
temperature of the superincumbent water, or prevent                                                  it*

height of           ^   of an inch          was then poured into the                       jar    to pre
vent its breaking                 by   the sudden application of boiling water
with which              it   was next filled.                  To    protect the ice while the
hot water was pouring in,                         a   circular piece of paper was pre
viously laid on its surface, which was afterwards                                            gently re
moved          by   means         of   a    string fastened to one fide of it.                            The

     But the ice was melted, though slowly, at the                 bottom ot
the hot water,        which     the author       accounts for     in a satis
factory manner without needing to abandon his hypothesis.
Fresli water presents an exception to the general law of con
densation by cold : it condenses in cooling till it comes to
40°, but on cooling it lower it expands, and continues to
expand till it freezes and after it has become ice*.                   Waltr
in contact with melting            ice is always at the temperature          of
 320,    and   therefore    specifically lighter       than that     which is
 8 degrees     warmer,      or at     140"  :    the latter   will therefore
descend, being heavier, and by its greater beat melt a                portion
of   the ice, be cooled, and then give place to the defcendiOij
currents of warmer water which succeed it.                    It appears   too
from the experiments which followed,                   that a considerable
portion of      the ice    that was melted, was melted             in  conse
 quence of     the motions into which the water was               thrown en
being poured into the jar.
     The experiments on which              the author builds       his retain
 were conducted in            the   following      ma/iner: 43*87 cubtc
inches, or      1 lb.  11 [ oz. Troy of water was put into the jar
efcd,fg.       3, which was placed in an earthen bowl and sur
 rounded with       a freezing mixture composed of ice and com
mon     sea salt,   by which       means      the   water in the     jar  was
 frozen into one compact mass adhering to its bottom and
 fides.   The jar was     then removed         from the freezing mixture,
 and placed in a mixture          of pounded        ice and water for 4 h.
 that the cake of ice might be brought to the temperature of
 3a", when the surface of the ice, ed, was covered to the
 height of 0478 of an inch with ice cold water before pour
 ing in the       boiling   water.      Instead     of  a piece  of  paper aj

hot water was pouring in, which was done through a long
wooden tube, stopt with a cork at the lower end, but per
forated with a number       of   small holes    in the    sides, immedi
ately above the cork, to make the water issue horizontally,
and not impinge        with    force   against     the bottom      of the
wooden dish, which         of course    floated    as   the water rose ;
which tended to     lessen  the motions      in  the liquid.      The  dish
was then carefully removed           from the surface of the water
    The experiments were varied by sometimes leaving the                    
upper part of the jar surrounded by the atmosphere, at other
times by covering the part occupied by the hot water with
cotton, and, at others, by keeping the jar plunged to its
brim in melting ice and water.
    The mean quantity of        ice melted by         hot water in 3c/,
 when the jar was kept plunged to its brim in melting ice
 and water, was 399^ grains ; when surrounded by air at the
 temperature    of 41 -, 456 gr. j when surrounded by air at the
 temperature of 6i°, 558 i gr. ; when covered up by a thick
 and warm covering of cotton, 690! gr.
    When the experiments were similar, the mean results of
 those which were made with water at different temperatures
 were as follows1*
    In the experiments in which          the part    of  the  jar occupied
 by the water was exposed uncovered            to the air at the tempe

 in 30 minutes was 558 j gr. ; with water at the tempera

       From    these results           the ingenious             author concludes, and
 certainly his experiments justify the conclusion, that boiling-
 hot water is not capable of melting more ice, when Jlanding
 on its surface,            than an equal quantity of water at the tem
 perature         of   410, or when only 9 degrees above freezing                               a
 fact which proves that water is a perfect non-conductor of
 heat, and that heat is propagated                          in it only in consequence
  of the motions which the heat                             occasions in the insulated
  and solitary particles of that fluid, by altering their specific
  gravities. He here observes, in a note, that the insight

  which this discovery gives us in regard to the nature of the
  mechanical process which takes place in chemical solutions,
 is too evident to require illustration.
   The author having frequently observed, when freezing
 water in one of his jars into a cake of ice, by'placing the
jar in a freezing mixture, that the water in the axis of the
jar, which was latest in freezing, being compressed by the
 expansion of the ice round                         it,
                                was always forced upwards,
 and     formed        a   pointed projection of ice in the form of
                                                                                                  by a

 the ice by means                 of   the hook       d   and the wire          e,   fastened to-
 the ceiling of the room, being heated                                 to 210°       in boiling
 water, was immersed                   in    the oil.      so    deep that the middle of
 the slat surface           of the lower            end     of the hot iron was only

been melted, but it was no way affected                  by the vicinity of
the hot iron.        The intention in making            the sheath     project
T*c   below the      cylinder was        to prevent internal motions         in
the oil, the particles of which, by becoming specifically
lighter by being in contact with the iron cylinder,                      would
otherwise have slid from under it and ascended.
     A  similar experiment was tried with mercury poured to the
height of 1 inch over the ice, instead of the 3 inches of oil,
and the result was exactly the fame               ;  though the ice at the
time could not bear a singer to touch it (by putting it down
 through the mercury), however expeditiouily removed, with
out a portion being dissolved,             and   which instantly       became
visible on the bright surface           of  the mercury.
     From his experiments the author seems inclined to doubt
 the existence of that peculiar kind of attraction of predilec
 tion which has been called chemical affinity, and to attri
 bute the equal distribution of the particles of any body in its
 menstruum to the internal motions                  among the particles of
 the fluid occasioned        by accidental changes of temperature,
 produced by the union           of the two ; or to a great difference
 in the specific gravity of the menstruum in its natural state,
 and that of the fame fluid after it has been changed to a
 saturated solution.        The following experiment           serves to sup
 port the author's opinion          :
     A    cylindrical    glass  jar was      placed    within   a  larger one
 which      stood  in   a  shallow earthen dish, nearly silled with
  pounded ice and water.             Ice cold fresh water, lightly tinged
  of  a  red colour with turnsol, was poured into the small jar
 to the height      of 2  inches   ;   and then, by means        of  a  funnel,
 which      ended in a long and narrow tube, put down through
  that water and resting on the bottom of the jar, an equal
  quantity of the strongest brine that could be made with fca-
  sult was poured      in,   so  gently that, without         disturbing the
  fresh water,     the brine took        the lower station,      the coloured
  water reposing above it without             the   smallest appearance       of

  ice cold olive oil was gently poured on the surface                           of the
  tinged water to the height of an inch above it. In a tem

  least disposition to mix            during 4 days.         At the end of that

   IV.   Experiments and Observations                  on the    Nature    of Sugar,

      Diabetes Mellitus.              Second    Edition. 1798.
   SlJGAR          has      been       supposed     to   be   a   substance      inter
   mediate between            the vegetable         mucilages and acids, con
   taining    more oxygen than the former, but                        less   than the
   latter.   With      a  view to ascertain this and              some other facts
   relative to these substances,                 Mr. Cruickshank           made      the
   following    experiments          :
      Two ounces of          refined sugar were exposed             in  a retort to a
   heat gradually increased             till the bottom became          red hot,      8^-
   dr. of pyromucous acid came over, which required 150 gr.
   of a solution of potasti to saturate it : this liquor contained
   mixed    w ith it   a little empyreumatic oil           : the charry residuum
   iu  the retort weighed 5 dr. Therefore the gas                    which     escaped
                                                                                 must

                       on the Nature   of Sugar,                   365
must have weighed 2{ dr. :       some   of it being examined, was
found to consist of carbonic acid gas and hydro-carbonat.
    Two ounces of gum arabic treated in the fame manner
yielded 7 dr. 40 gr. pyromucous acid containing a little more
empyreumatic oil, and required only n8gr. of the fame so
lution of potasti to saturate it    ; 3 dr. 45 gr. residuum ; 5 dr.
of gas consisting like the former of hydro-carbonat and car
bonic acid gas.
    As   sugar yields more acid    than gum in the proportion of
                as oxygen is the universal acidifying principle
 150 to 118
 and as the acid from both is die fame, viz. the pyromu
cous, sugar must, therefore, contain the greatest proportion
of oxygen     ; for the carbonic acid and hydro-carbonat were
not produced in any quantity till near the end of the opera
tion, and therefore were probably formed by the decompo
sition of the water.
     To   observe   the changes and      decompositions that take
place    during the process of malting, which          somehow    con
 verts vegetable     mucilage and secular into sugar,      the follow
 ing experiments were made       :
     Barley soaked in water for 24 hours was introduced in a
 wine glass into a jar containing common air, inverted over
water and kept in a temperature between 603 and 700. In 5
 days it began to grow, and in 4 weeks the flioots were half
 an inch long.       At the end  of   10 weeks vegetation     was still
 going on, and the air in the jar had somewhat diminished               :
 the barley was very sweet, and nearly malted.            The air was
 found to consist of azotic and carbonic acid gas, in the pro
 portion of 20    lo 6, the whole of the oxygen being either        ab
 sorbed or united to carbon.
     Barley soaked for 48 hours introduced       as  in the last expe
 riment into a jar containing oxygen gas,          inverted over wa
  ter to which sulphuric acid had been added,          began   to grow
 at the   end of 3 days.     In 10 days the water     had risen in the
jar, the    gas being diministied about one third.          The barley
 smelledlike malt, and was sweet. The gas was found to con-
                                                                     fist
                                                                          s

   366               Experiments and Observations
   fist of 64 parts carbonic acid, 32 azote and 4 oxygen ; from
  which it would appear that the oxygen employed had con
  tained originally about 20 per cent, of azotic gas.
       The fame experiment was repeated over mercury.               In 3
  days the barley began to grow.           At the   end  of 10 days the
  gas,    which continued of the original bulk, was found to con
  sist  of carbonic acid gas, containing ^th of its bulk of oxy
  gen gas.      The barley was partly converted into malt.
      Another experiment with common air was made at the
  fame time : the barley did not begin to grow till the end of
  the 4th, and at the end of the 10th day had made much              less
  progress than that     in the oxygen. The air had increased a
 little, and was found to consist of carbonic acid and azotic
 gas, in the proportion of 1 to 2, and a very small quantity of
 oxygen. The barley tasted sweet.
      Soaked barley was introduced into a jar         filled with and
 inverted over mercury.         At the   end  of 12 days a very consi
 derable quantity of gas, found to be carbonic acid, was pro
 duced ; but no vegetation had taken place, nor any other sen
 sible change in the barley.
      Another portion of the     fame soaked barley, exposed to ni
 trous gas over water, at the end of 10 days had undergone no
 apparent change. The gas, which was diminislied a little,
 contained about -Jth of its bulk of carbonic acid gas : the
 remainder was pure nitrous gas, as was manifest from the
 diminution      it underwent when mixed with pure air.             The
nitrous      gas   which   disappeared    must   have   been  absorbed
either by the barley or the water           : the carbonic acid gas
which was produced is accounted for by the last experiment.
     Two other portions     were exposed, the one to hydrogenous
and the other to azotic gas.           In  14 days   no vegetation in
cither.      Both the  gases  had increased about jth in bulk, and
contained each from, 'd to ^th of carbonic acid, the remain
der being the original gases not sensibly changed. The bar
ley in the hydrogen tasted musty no sweetness.
     It  is manifest from these experiments that oxygen is abso
                                                                 lutely

lutely necessary for the conversion             of vegetable mucilage and
fecula into sugar.           In    no instance      was      saccharine      matter
formed where this was not present.                  Mr. C. thinks that the
oxygen is chiefly absorbed              by the barley, though part may
also go to the formation           of   the carbonic acid          ;    for carbonic
acid was formed in considerable quantity without                            the pre
sence   of oxygen     gas,    which      he conceives must proceed from
the decomposition of the water, its oxygen uniting with the
carbonaceous principle of the barley, while its hydrogen is
fixed, which may be necessary to the formation of the                            sac
charine principle.           He infers, therefore, that            vegetable mu
cilage is converted      into sugar, by being deprived of part of
its carbon, while at the fame time it unites with a greater
proportion of oxygen, and probably also with hydrogen from
the decomposition of the water.                 Thus then both from             ana
lysis and synthesis it appears            that sugar contains more oxy
gen than gum or mucilage;                 and it should follow, that suorar
deprived of its oxygen must                lose its sweetness            and form a
kind of gum.         To accomplish this           was the object          of the fol
lowing experiments :
  Some syrup was introduced into                   ajar filled with          and in
verted over mercury           :   to this was admitted zn equal quan
tity of the phosphuret of lime             :   a considerable          production of
phosphoric gas almost immediately took place, and the mer
cury descended in the jar.               At the   end   of   8 days the syrup,
instead   of   a sweet, had a bitter astringent taste.                    When    fil
tered, alcohol produced  copious white precipitate in flakes,
                                  a
resembling mucilage separated from water     the same sub     by
stance.
  To refined        sugar dissolved       in alcohol phosphuret of lime
was added      :   no gas was disengaged, nor any action produced.
The mixture         was allowed to remain in an open                     vial till the
alcohol had evaporated            ;   distilled water was added,              but no
disengagement        of gas took place, the phosphuret having                   been
decomposed         and converted        principally into phosphat of lime.
The mixture being            filtered and the clear liquor evaporated,
                                                                                there

368                   Experiments and Observations
there remained a substance, extremely tenacious, which had
much     the   appearance         of gum arabic: its      taste was bitter
with   a slight degree         of  sweetness ; when squeezed between
the teeth it had exactly the feel of gum, but more tenacious ;
it was not soluble          in alcohol,   at least in any quantity ; and
burned on red hot iron like gum, leaving a bulky and insipid
charcoal.  That this conversion of the saccharine principle
into a gum was effected by the abstraction of oxygen, is
highly probable from            the nature   of the substance employed ;
for there are few substances which have a stronger affinity for
oxygen than phosphurct of lime.
    Solutions of sugar were mixed with different sulphurets,
and agitated with nitrous gas in close vessels. The sulphu
rets, especially that of potash, destroyed the saccharine taste;
but owing to the solubility of the different products, the na
ture of the change could not be accurately ascertained.                The
action of the nitrous gas was more doubtful.
    To be satisfied how far the effects produced in the former
experiments might             be owing to the abstraction       of oxygen,
Mr. C.      added to       solutions of sugar in water both lime and
pure potasli, and boiled the mixtures.               The lime combined
 with and gave to the sugar a bitter astringent taste; but it
was still sweet     :  alcohol put to the filtered solution produced
a precipitate in white flakes, similar to that in the experi
 ment with the phosphuret, and which appeared to be a com
bination of sugar with lime.             Vitriolic acid likewise precipi
tated the lime        in    the form   of  selenite, and  in a great mea
 sure restored the natural taste.           Some of the filtered solution
 being evaporated          by a  gentle heat, there remained a semi-
 transparent substance, much more tenacious than the thickest
 syrup, but    less   so    than that produced by the phosphuret         of
 lime  :  it had    a   rough bitter taste, with a certain degree        of
 sweetness.      The     potasli   likewise appeared     to combine   with
 the sugar,     the    sweet taste being more        completely destroyed
 than by the lime        :   but on the addition of sulphuric acid sul-
 phat of potash was formed             ; and this being precipitated     by
                                                                   alcohol,

    alcohol, the sweetness was completely restored.                    When       al
    cohol was added to       a solution of sugar and pure potash, after
   it had been     boiled to the consistence of            a  syrup, no union
   took place   :  though agitated, the alcohol still swam pure on
   the top  which       seems to prove          that a new compound is
   formed by these substances,             insoluble in this fluid, though
   both are completely        so  in   a separate state.
       Having   converted     sugar into a species       of gum, by abstract-
,  ing a portion of its oxygen, several experiments were made
   to change    gum, by adding oxygen, into a kind                  of sugar, but
   without success.       The gum went rapidly into the acid state,
  especially   when exposed to the action of the oxygenated mu
   riatic acid gas.      From      the failure    of  these trials,    it was sus
   pected that mucilages were not              so simple as    had been gene
   rally supposed    :  to throw some        light on this       subject the fol
  lowing comparative experiments were made                     :
      An ounce of      powdered       gum arabic was exposed to heat in
  a coated glass retort,        as    in  the first two experiments,            only
  here    the pneumato-chemical apparatus was adapted                          the
  heat was gradually applied as before *.                    The charry         resi
  duum burned          very slowly ; but when            exposed to a strong
  heat in an open crucible, it left a whitish powder, which was
  found to be lime and a small proportion of calcareous                       phos-
  phat. The pyromucous acid being supersaturated with lime,
  a strong smell of ammonia was instantly perceived j and a
  piece of paper dipped in muriatic acid being held over the
  vessel, copious white          fumes were immediately produced 
  azote therefore      forms     a   constituent part of the gum.               The
  gas collected    in   the   pneumatic apparatus Was carbonic acid
  mixed with that species of hydrocarbonat which is obtained
  by heat from moistened            charcoal.       Two   ouhee measures           of
  the gas, well freed from carbonic acid, were mixed with                         ij
  of  very pure oxygen gas, and fired, by the electric spark,                     in

were reduced to              I   measure, which was all absorbed by lime
water,       admitted for the purpose,                   except   a small       particle
which was found from the nitrous test to be pure air.                            From
many experiments Mr. Cruickskank found that                            12 measures
of oxygen           gas, united with carbon, produce 10                 of carbonic
acid gas.         Hence it follows, that the quantity of oxygen gas
necessary to the formation                   of carbonic acid     gas must      in this
cafe have been           i*i      measures or a little better;         the remain
ing     *4 therefore         were consumed           in the production      of water,
and would be sufficient to saturate '8 of hydrogen, equal in
weight to 048 of a gr. nearly.  Now 1 oz. measure of car
bonic acid gas weighs "864 of a gr. and this contains -24 of
pure charcoal ; hence the quantity of charcoal to hydrogen
in this inflammable                gas must be as -24 to -048,          or 5 to 1.
But one      measure         of   pure hydrocarbonat,        such as   may be ob
tained from the decomposition of camphor,                             by making its
vapour       pass    through           a red hot earthen tube, or from the
distillation of animal                           &c. requires 2 of
                                       substances,     opium,
pure air to         saturate       it,
                               and the quantity of carbonic acid
amounts to          1*45, which makes the proportion of carbon to
hydrogen as 12 or                 13 to

                                          :    hence    these gases    differ    mate
rially, and ought not to be confounded. Indeed the differ
ence between them       manifest from the manner in which
                                  is
they burn when mixed with common air, and brought into
contact with            an ignited body pure hydrocarbonat burns
                                                 :
slowly with         a   perfectly white flame, and never detonates 
on the contrary, the compound inflammable gas, just men
tioned, burns rapidly with reddish blue flame and more or
                                             a
less    of   a   detonation.           It   was necessary to mention        this      cir
cumstance, as much                     confusion might       be produced         by   ap
plying the fame name to substances considerably different.
It    remarkable that ether, decomposed
       is                                      heat, affords      by
pure hydrocarbonat, while alcohol yields the mixed  species.
  An ounce of gum tragacanth treated in the fame manner

                       an the Nature     ef Sugar.                  371
 as the gum arabic, gave the fame kinds          of products ; but the
 quantity of ammonia difengaged from the pyromucous acid
 by fuperfaturating it with lime was confiderably greater than
 from that afforded by the gum arabic.
    Having thus     difcovered   lime in both of thefe gums, re
 agents were employed to fee         if in this way that earth could
 be detected.    Sulphuric acid was dropped into a folution of
gum arabic:      after   Handing for fome hours a number of
 needle-like   cryftals were depofited: thefe being feparated
 were re-diflblved in diftilled water j the oxalat of ammonia
 was then added, and a copious precipitation of oxalat of lime
immediately took place.
    From thefe experiments it is manifeft that gums confift
of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, azot and lime.
    The pyromucous acid, obtained from fugar by the fame
procefs    of diftillation   which     had   been   employed on the
gums, being fuperfaturated         with lime, no ammonia could
be perceived fugar therefore         does not contain azot: nei
ther does it contain lime      ;  for the charcoal, which was of a
beautiful black colour, burned out completely when expofed
to a ftrong red heat.
    Sugar of milk being diftilled in the fame manner, and the
produces   treated   in  the way already defcribed, was found to
contain lime in the charry refiduum         ;  and, contrary to what
might have been expected,          the quantity of ammonia difen
gaged from     the pyromucous acid obtained from it was fo
fmall that it could hardly be detected         It therefore  contains
hardly any azot.
   Experiments were next made to afcertain the quantity of
oxalic bafis or radical contained in each of thefe fubftances.
   One ounce of fugar was added to 6 oz. of concentrated
nitrous acid diluted with an equal bulk of water : when the

drops which refused to crystallize.
    One ounce of gum arabic was treated in the fame man
ner ; the last crystals obtained were mixed with an insoluble
white powder, which was separated by the addition of dis
tilled water, and was found to be oxalat of lime             One ounce
of gum tragacanth was also subjected to the same process.
    The crystals obtained from sugar of milk by the same pro
cess were mixed with a white powder, which, being but
little soluble in water, was readily separated, and appeared to
be the saccholactic acid of Scheclc. (See Phil. Mag. Vol. II.
p. 346.)
    Honey     treated  in the   fame manner exhibited no signs         of
saccholactic acid.
    The Table subjoined         to the present    article will stiew at
one view the different products resulting from destructive
distillation,    with    their relative proportions ; and       likewise
those obtained by the nitrous acid.
    From     these   experiments     it appears    that sugar    consists
merely of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen ; that gum differe
from sugar, not only in containing a less proportion of
 oxygen, but, also, by its combination with lime and azot;
and that the sugar of milk differs from both, as it contains
the radical of the saccholactic acid  in other respects, how
ever,    it approaches very nearly to the nature of vegetable
 sugar.     Does the milk of carnivorous and graminivorous
 animals yield the fame proportion of this acid, and is this
 sugar itself always     of the  fame nature   ?
     From* the well known facts respecting vinous fermenta
 tion,   there is now reason to suppose that no substances but
 those   which    consist simply   of carbon, hydrogen      and oxygen
 are susceptible    of it ; and that an union with a fourth changes
 the nature of the compound          so much as to render this pro
 cess   impracticable.       To  a solution  of   sugar  digested   with
                                                                    fresh

solution of sugar alone the same quantity of yeast was added:
the last began to ferment in 12 hours, and in     few days ran              a
into       the    acetous state  the other two did not ferment                            :    the
temperature of the room during the experiments was from
650 to 75°.
      A     solution of the sugar of milk, to which    proper quan         a
tity of       yeast was  added, began  to ferment  in four days  at                            :
the       end     of    16, when the process               had        ceased,       it   had    the
smell        of  but rather more of the flavour of apples,
                   cyder,

the oxvd of lead    formed   sweet saline mass composed of

      In    the attempts to convert gum into sugar                             by   combining
oxygen with             it,   as before         stated,   it   ran into the acid state.
To     feeany thing like fermentation preceded this state, or
             if                                                                                    if
this effect could be produced                        by
                                   mere exposure to the air,
without           the   addition of some substance containing                               much
oxygen,       nitrous or oxvgenated muriatic acids,
                  as the                             solu                                 a
tion of gum arabic was mixed with yeast as in the last ex
periments, but no fermentation was perceivable at the end
of    26 days.          It    appears       that the azot and               lime combined
with        the carbon in gum prevents                     the vinous,          and        conse
quently           the   acetous         fermentation.   Similar experiments
were made upon                a   strong   decoction of beef, with, and with
out veast, but no fermentation followed.                              Indeed    it       has been
so    generally admitted                 that    vegetable          and   animal mucila
ges, when pure, are not susceptible                            of    the vinous          fermen
tation, that, had not               a   contrary opinion been lately advanced,
these experiments upon them would                               have been conceived
unnecessary.

Klein,     very much employed.                  Respecting this kind                of   fol
der, the experiments of Professor Gmelin give the following
result : one part of bismuth, 2 parts of tin, and i part of
lead, melt in boiling water.                   According to Klein, the tin
men employ for soldering, a mixture of I part of bismuth,
24 parts       of tin,     and 4 parts         of  lead.      Eight      parts      of bis
muth, 3 of tin and 5 of lead, gave a metal exceedingly like
tin in its colour and brightness, but very brittle ; in water
beginning         to boil,      it became not only soft, but was                     com
pletely fused. This imitation, however, may be better ao-
compliihed by the mixture of Professor Lichtenberg, which
consists    of 5    parts   of bismuth,        3  of tin    and 2     of    lead.     Thi*
metal is very like the former, though not                         so   brittle    ;  but it
seemed to melt in hot water even before it came to boil.

   J. H E      Baltic is     a real     mediterranean         sea,    and not a lake,
 as   M.  de Busson endeavours               to sliew, in his general work on
 natural history.           It   is every     where surrounded             by the land,
 except where it is connected                  with     the    North      Sea by three
  narrow passages, the Sound *, and the large and                            lesser   Belt,
                                                                                        Al
    * The    passage   through the Sound is now of less importance since the
construction of the Holstein          canal, which   joins the Baltic to the Gcmun
Ocean.      The    idea of this      junction   was conceived under           Frederic  IV.
Duke of Schlcfwig         Holstein, but was not undertaken           till the Ruffian »o-
vernment agreed to co-operate in promoting its success.                  It  was begun in
the spring of the year 1777, and was carried on by contractors, who en-
 gaged,    for  a   certain yearly sum, to complete           a certain     portion   of it.
This    canal, the whole length of which, from Kieler-Ford to Rcndstmrc,
 is equal to 10,650 poles, of sixteen feet each, proceeds on a level with the
 Baltic to the first lock at Holtenach,        where   it  rises  eight feet fix inches.
 It  then proceeds to the second         lock at Knop, 745 poles distant from          Kit-
 ler-Ford, which has       a rife  of eight feet six inches, and then conumuo to
                                                                                       ecu

                                  on the    Baltic    Sea.                          377
At        Pillau    and Memel it communicates                with two     large lakes,
  the        Frisch Haffand Curisch Haff; which, however,                           both
  contain         fresh water.      The former, according             to the account
  of      some writers,       was    occasioned      by    a  violent wind,       which
  prevailed in           the year 1190,        and, continuing for more than
  twelve years,          drove up so much sand from the bottom                   of   the
   sea that the present tongue of land was raised; and the
  gulph, which now forms the Haff, separated from the
   Baltic.         But this opinion is the more to be doubted, as the
  near      S uensdorf,  where the third lock it situated, having a rise of the sanjo
  height.        Here the upper    canal begins, and proceeds for the distance           of
   3413 poles, between Schwartenbec and Wittenbec, to the fourth lock                    at
   the Upper Eyder near Schinkcl. This upper canal, which serves as a                   re
   servoir,    has an influx of water from the neighbouring          lakes sufficient for
   the purposes of navigation, and is twenty-five feet fix inches higher than
   the level of the Baltic.      At the fourth lock the canal falls seven feet sour
   inches two lines ; proceeds 143S poles in the Eyder to the fifth lock at Ked.
   tlcrhnlr.cn, where there is also a fall of the fame        height ; and having con
    tinued by Secstede to Steinwarp,        1901 poles, little more art is employed,
    heciusc the Eyder between that place and Rcndfburg has almost naturally
    the sufficient depth and breadth.         A   sixth lock is constructed at Rends-
    burg, as the tide slows up there in the Eyder, and makes with the ebb a
    difference of one foot seven       inches.     The   breadth of this canal, at the
     bottom, is fifty-four feet, and, at the surface of the water, ninety feet.           It
     is nine sect deep, and navigable for ships of from 15010 160 tons burthen.
     The locks, therefore, between the gates, are 100 sect in length and 2 7 feet
     in breadth.     Along the banks there     is a path ten feet broad, and another     of
     twelve sect, for the horses which are employed to draw the vessels.             The
      number of vessels which passed through this           canal in 1797 amounted to
      110;, of which 1393 were laden with merchandize and the rest in ballast.
      Ofthc former 41 were Danish vessels bound to foreign ports; and 119 bound
      from foreign countries to Danish or other northern ports ; 539 were from
      the Baltic ;   170 from  the North Sea ; and 78 were bound to or coming
      from   Altona.    Among the foreign ships were 24 English,              21   Dutch,
      430  from East Fricfland, 191 from the duchy of Oldenburg,              9 from   Je-
      vern,   89 from   Popcnbourg,    9 from Bremen,       8 from  Hamburgh,      6 from
      Lubcc,    44 from    Hanoverian    ports,   81   from    Mecklenburg,      81  from
       Swedish    Pomerania,   106   from Prussia,      11 from Courland and Russia

     Curisch Haff is of the fame nature                                    with     the Frisch           Haff,
  and yet no one refers its origin to                          any tempestuous wind «'
  the like kind.                It    is,    on the       other hand, certain that great
  changes have taken place                       in regard to the strait                           by   which
 the Baltic        is   connected             with this lake. At first                       it   was situ

 Lochstedt stands,                            at that time

 but in the year 13 n, or according to other accounts 1395,
 itwas entirely choaked up with sand by an uncommonly
 violent storm          of wind which prevailed in                                       the months           of
 August and           September and this account

 ble, as the valley between                             the   Haff and           the     sea still shews
 evident traces            of    the course               of the water,             while the find
 hills,     raised towards                  the     shore,      are   a    further proof           of   thst
 natural revolution.                      An opening was                    consequently          formed
 opposite to the castle                   of Balga, between the                      villages Faglee
 and Schineergrubc,                    which             was fifteen ells in depth                 ;    but

coasts      of other countries                :     and       this    is   said to be oofer**8*

                               on the    Baltic       Sea.                             37 a
above all, at the time when the first snow appears,                                and in
the beginning of the spring.
     In the next place,          the    water      of the Baltic is            less saline
than that of other           seas ;    the cause         of which, in all proba
bility, is     to be ascribed to the great                number of rivers that
fall into it.         For this   reason its gravity is likewise less, and
vessels cannot fail          in it with the              fame         velocity as in the
North     Sea.        For the    fame        reason      also    it is more liable       to
corruption.           The number of                the    streams        which empty
themselves        into this      sea    amount, according to Busson, to
forty;    and     among these the              Oder, the Weichsel,               &c.   are
the most considerable.   Notwithstanding the great quantity
of water supplied by these rivers, the Baltic does not sensibly
increase.        Its principal efflux, towards the North                       Sea, is the
Sound     ;    though English navigators have found there, at Ihe
depth of four or five fathoms, a sunken current,                               running in
a   contrary direction to that at the surface.
     The Baltic is not        subject to a regular ebbing and flowing,
as it is surrounded by land,                 and     is united with the North
Sea only by the Sound and the two Belts:                              this circumstance
has given occasion to its being called the inactive sea (mare
figrum). During a long continuance of the west wind its
natural efflux is prevented,             and a great deal               of water   forced
into it from the North Sea;                     so    that      .it   then rises on the
coasts   a    little above its usual level.              This connection,           how
ever,    with the German               ocean    is    sometimes          the   cause that
the ebbing and            flowing       of the latter, though weak, co
operates       with   the Baltic,       sothat traces of their effects may
be sometimes          perceived.
     We       are assured by history that this sea has been some
times totally frozen during severe cold.                          This    was    the   case
in   the year 1333, at which time people could travel                              on the
ice from Lubec to Prussia and Denmark                            ;     and on this ac
count huts were erected in different places for the accommo
dation of travellers. A like phenomenon occurred in 1399
and 1533      j   and   in   1423 people could walk and ride over
                                                                  the

sea   in  a straight line from Konigfberg to             Lubec.     Six    yean
after this     sea was     every   where covered          with ice,     in fudj
a manner that journeys           of   the   like kind were undertaken
not only from Prussia to Holstein,              but also from       Mecklen
burg to Denmark; and this was done                  likewise in 1459.          la
the strong frost of the year 1709, the ice extended so far on
the     Baltic, from      the   Prussian     coast,    that people     on    the
highest steeples on the shore could not see where it ended ;
and this no doubt was the cafe during the cold of the year
j 740,     which   exceeded the former some degrees.
     The   depth    of  the   Baltic,    in  most places,      never exceed*
 fifty fathoms.       In  some few places       of  the   Gulph of Bothnia
no bottom indeed is to be found ; but in others, quite near,
the depth is not more than fifty fathoms.
     In  regard to the decrease      of water in     the   Baltic, much has
been      said for and      against it ; but nothing         certain can be
determined on this point.             Mr. Otto      is  of opinion   that the
 contradictions,       apparent    on the first       view of the     subject,
might be reconciled by attending to the times. The period
of the decrease of water in this sea, of which the still ex
isting remains of marine productions are incontrovertible
 proofs, belongs to the most remote ages.                    Since the time
when the Baltic was confined within its present boundaries,
 the decrease and increase of its water are merely apparent;
 as it may have        happened,       from various causes,        that   land
 may have been gained in one quarter and lost in another.
Xarge rivers, which flow with great rapidity, may, fcr
 example, have carried with them into the                 sea a great deal os

Mv           view in commencing               my labours on this         subject
was      not only to establish         the facts      announced by Scheele,
but also to pursue much farther the examination of urinary
calculi ; and to add to it that of all the animal concretions
I    could procure.         This plan will       be found      partly executed
in     the details    I  have     published.       1.  On   the intestinal cal
culus of the horse, which              I found to be a triple salt, formed
of    2 parts   of phosphat of        magnesia     and    1 part of the phos-
 phat of ammonia.                2.   On    a renal    calculus of the fame
animal,       in which       I  discovered     3 parts     of the carbonat of
lime and       1  part of the phosphat of lime, without any matter
analogous to that in the human calculus.                      3. On a calculus
of a cat, which gave me 3 parts of the carbonat of lime and
 1 part of the phosphat of lime.                   4. On the tartar of the
 teeth, which       I   found     t©  be pure phosphat        of lime.     5. On
 the calculus of the human                   reins, the nature of which          I
 determined to be perfectly similar to that of the calculus of
 the     bladder.      In the examination of several concretions,
  different from those of the urinary calculus, I was prior to
 Dr. Pearson by more than ten years, and my labours had
  been published five years when he communicated his to the
  Royal Society of London              ;   yet he has not quoted my         work,
  though he has done nothing but repeated and confirmed my
  experiments.
       With     regard    to   the human        urinary calculus,      I had ex
  amined a sufficient number to be                     able to trace out the
  general      characters which          I  thought     it necessary to add to
                                                                             those

this illustrious chemist,                   as   a    solid acid crystallised              in    lamim,
insipid, giving        faint red tinge to blue colours, soluble
                           a                                                                                 in
 caustic      alkalies and in the nitric acid, assuming with tit
latter   a    beautiful red colour, decomposable                                 by   fire,      yielding
a   great deal        of   the carbonic acid and little oil                          ;    the weakest
of all the acids; containing lime and alkaline                                              phofphau

properties           established          by     the analysis      of       a    great      number           ot

which by      exposure   to the air soon deposits both carbonat of
lime and the lithic acid separate from each other, proves
that the atmospheric carbonic              acid     decomposes       the cal

furnishes more than       a half of  the crystallised lithiat       of potasli.
 10. This precipitation of        the  lithic   acid     from the alkaline
solution by the acetous         acid, given       as   a good      process for
procuring this animal acid pure.             1 1 . The solubility of the
calculus sometimes entire, sometimes in powder, in the
oxygenated       muriatic   acid, which       at first     afforded    me the
hope   of a  lithontriptic  ;  but which being destroyed by other
successive experiments presented          only a singular fact worthy
of being further      investigated.      12.   The action of the            fire
and distillation in a retort upon the calculus               of   the human
bladder, using      a quantity five times         greater than that em
ployed by     Dr.  Pearson,   and which gave me as products near
a quarter    of  a sublimated     lamellated      acid, still analogous to
the  lithic acid ; some drops only of water and thick oil,
fixed, containing a little prufiiat of ammonia ; T concrete
carbonat of ammonia, a bulk of more than six kilogrammes
of water in      gas,  T  of which     were     carbonic acid;         a coal
weighing a little more than a quarter of the calculus, and
which yielded only ,' of its weight of ashes, without any
sensible trace    of lime.
   All  these facts, which     I  was obliged to concentrate           here in.
 some manner in order to render           them more striking, served
to confirm the first results      of Scheele       and Bergmann ; and
enabled    me to add several observations             which had escaped
them.      I  had concluded with them that the human urinary
calculus, whether that of the reins or that of the bladder,
 contained a matter different from all                other animal sub
                                                                       stance,

   stance,   not found     in any other humours       of the human
   body, nor in any of those of the bodies of the different
  animals now known ; a weak concrete acid, almost insolu
  ble,  th<5 principal solvents of which were the caustic     alkalies;
  that   this particular acid very little hydrogenated and oxy
  genated, but much charged with carbon and azot, was an
  immediate production of the reins and of the diuresis, or
  of the formation of urine ; that it was sometimes joined
  with   some parts     of  the phosphats  of lime, of  soda,    and of
  ammonia, with a colouring animal matter ; but that these
  different substances, foreign to the lithic acid, seemed to be
  only accessories, variable in their proportions, which might
  not have been found there at all, and which did not seem to
  constitute   the particular essence  of it.
     I  may add to this notice of my labours, which       are already
 pretty old, that the experiments I have had occasion to
 make for ten years past on this animal matter, either foe
 some particular       purpose   or in the course of     my annual
 lectures, by confirming me more           and  more in my former
 ideas,    agreeing with those of Scheele and Bergmann, have
 only taught me that some human urinary calculi contain
 phosphat of lime, insoluble in water and in pure alkalies,
 and    the alteration   which the lithic acid experiences by the
 action of the nitric acid when boiled in the latteran altera
 tion during which there is disengaged          carbonic   acid   gas,
 azotic gas, and the prussic acid gas ; so that the calculuus
 matter appears to me really to change its nature during this
 action of the nitric acid.       But all this ought not to change
any thing of my opinions in regard to the particular cha
 racter and acid properties        of the   peculiar matter of the
human urinary calculus.
     C. Fourcroy then      asks, whether the labours  of Dr.    Pear
son have given different results, and     of such a nature as should
induce the French chemists          to give   up their former ideas
respecting     the nature    of the peculiar matter  of the human
urinary calculus j or whether his experiments        are sufficitmth/

                Dr.     Pearson's            Experiments            on     Calculi.               385
tonclusive to induce them to admit its non-acidity, and con
sider it as an oxyd          ?    He     insists that Dr. Pearson has not cor
rectly comprehended                     of the Swedish or
                                       the labours either
French chemists ; that he has improperly believed that they
gave the name          of lithic         acid to the sublimate                  of   the calculus
obtained by fire, whereas they gave  cither to the entire           it,
calculus as   comes from the reins or the bladder, when
                  it
wholly formed of that substance, or, to this matter obtained
 by   cooling   a   solution        of    it    in water,           or     by   precipitating       it
from an alkaline solution                     by    the acetous acid            ;    and that the
pretended       oxyd    is       really Scheele's              acid, at first called              the
bezoardic, and since, in the new nomenclature, the lithic
acid.
     Dr.   Pearson gives          a     larger proportion                 of insoluble matter
than his predecessors,                  stating      it   at almost          Jd   of    the mixed
calculi which          he employed              ;   but Fourcroy opposes to this
what Dr. Pearson                 says    in another place,                  "    that    he found
some calculi contain even

proportion of matter soluble in alkalies                                  than that of which

the calculus in pure soda, was also seen                              by    Scheele, and ob

perceive here the separation                    of our        lit'.iiat    of   potash from its
saturated    solution    ;       and    I     may remark,                 that this     is   what   I
have pointed out         in      my researches,                by   faying that the lirhiat
of   potash easily separates in crystals from its concentrated                                    and
saturated solution.              This     soapy deposit             of Dr.       Pearson     is   ne
vertheless soluble        in water, and precipitated                            by   acids with

3 86                       Fourcrojr's              Examination of
of   potash and the separation                          of   the    lithic acid.    According
to the author, this solution was not rendered                                    turbid by the
carbonic acid.             I   had made exactly the fame observation.
  The precipitate formed in the alkaline solution of the cal
culus by the sulphuric acid is of principal importance to my
investigation, since it is this precipitate which forms the real
difference between us, and to which our whole attention
should be directed.                      It   is really our              lithic acid which Dr.
Pearson       will not acknowledge                           as an acid, and       in which       he
thinks he has found a sufficient                              number of characters,              dif
ferent from what               I   had assigned to                 it,   to induce him to con
sider   it   as   a   peculiar animal matter,andto name                            it   the   uric or
ouric oxyd. Insipidity, the quality of being inodorous, insolu

insolubility in alkaline carbonates, non-precipitation                                     of soap,
but precipitation of alkaline sulphurets, solubility in the ni
tric acid, and the red pink colour which its nitric solution
assumes when evaporated these are all the                                       results      of the
experiments of           Dr.        Pearson, none              of which,       except the      non-
coloration of turnsole,                   differ        from what Scheele and myself
have given        ;    but this difference can have arisen only from
the manner of performing the experiment, or from Dr. Pear
son having made                his on some matter foreign to the lithic
acid.        The      sliadc   of    the colour os the nitric                   solution which
Scheele announced to be of                          a    beautiful red or blood red. Dr.
Pearson says was           a       pink       red   ;   and    it to this tint, which be

lation of this matter which           I   obtained from a quantity at
least fix times as large as that which he employed.
    In what    regards the acid and crystalline sublimate obtained
in the distillation, except        the     apparatus    of a bent tube des
tined to separate the products,          I  can fee nothing      new ; only
here the author gave himself needless trouble                  to search   for
our lithic acid in this manner, since,             as  I have already said,
it was not this product of the sublimation and decomposition
by   sire that  I distinguished    by the name of the lithic acid in
our nomenclature.
    The   attempts    made by    Dr.    Pearson to acidify his supposed
oxyd by the nitric        acid and      the oxygenated        muriatic acid
could not possibly succeed       :  like those who preceded him, he
found that the calculus was changed               into carbonic acid and
 ammonia.
    Respecting the portions of the calculi not soluble in alkali,
and which, Dr. Pearson          asserts,   exhibited to him all the pro
 perties   of  phosphat   of lime, I       shall observe,    that if by this
 fact he seems      to deviate   more from those who went before
 him, it   was only from two calculi, mixed in equal parts, that
 he obtained such a result,          and     that   the very variable     dif
 ference    of  the    proportion of the         substances     soluble   and
 insoluble in the 300 urinary concretions,                  which    he fays
 he examined comparatively, can furnish no opposition                       to
 the result of Scheele in regard to the matter called litbic
 acid.
     As to    the product    of  the numerous experiments which
 Dr.    Pearson tried ori more than 300 human urinary calculi,
 which he compared with each other, I find no other differ
 ence between what he announces and what was announced
 by his predecessors, but the variety of the nature which these
 experiments (hewed to him between these concretions a va
 riety which, however, always stiews the greatest proportion
  in the kind of matter called by him the ouric oxyd. It is in
 this result that Dr. Pearson deviates most from Scheele, who
 asserted   that all the calculi of the human bladder resembled
                                   Cc%                                   each

 ever add to this             fact, which forms one                 of the new points of
 the dissertation            of Dr.     Pearson,       that of the discovery of" his
 ouric oxyd in arthritic concretions.                       But it may be readify
 perceived,         that     this difference          between our author and the
 chemists         whom he seems to combat no way affects the                                   in
 timate nature of the real calculous substance,                                and it is     only
 on the latter that it is of importance to fix the opinions                                       of
 philosophers.
      The     question        between        us is now reduced                 to   this simple
 point: Ought              the properties        of   the matter which constitutes
 the urinary calculus to induce                   us to consider it as a                  peculiar
 acid, or only           as an   animal oxyd           ?
      It
       is sufficiently agreed, that ever)' substance more or fefi
soluble in water, thatturns some blue colours red, that, above
all,    is susceptible of uniting             strongly and readily with alkalies,
 and       of forming with them               crystullisablc        compounds, in such
a manner that                their peculiar attractive               power for each of
 these salisiable bases, as well as their affinities, compared to
that       of other well known               acids,    may be estimated,              ought to
be ranked among                the number             of   acids.     Thus          the   nicuh.
called tiingjlcn, molybdena, and chrome, saturated with                                     oxv-
gen by complete    combustion, have naturally assumed a placr
in the class of and next to the moll powerful and longest
known acids.     It is thus in particular that the matter con
tained in the gall-nut                which blackens iron             ;   that which co
lours it blue, and which is furnished by the decomposition of
animal substances, have received the character of acid bo
dies, and the names               of   the   gallic acid       and    frujfic acid.            It
is,    in sliort,        from the fame           considerations            that our        littit
acid has been placed in the fame class or referred to the fame
genus.       It    has not indeed any sour taste, and                     is   very little so
luble in water; but              it   reddens turnsole         paper when
                                                                                     it

 it precipitates   the   sulplnircs; and we must not forget that
 Scheele   represents it as the weakest       of all   acids.    Why then
 should  Dr.   Pearson, without any new facts respecting its cha
 racters, wish to include it among the oxyds              ?  Are   the latter
even taken in the class      of   ternary or quaternary oxyds, vege
 table or animal, soluble like it in alkalies ; and do they satu
rate them    ?  Is this owing        to its little    solubility   ?   But the
saccharine     oxyd is very soluble in water without saturating
alkalies.    Is it not manifest, on the contrary, that it wants
one   of the principal characters      of these complex oxyds, among
which the French pneumatic chemistry                 classes a great     num
 ber ol organic compounds           ?  Does it not reject this acidifi
cation,   so easy  in other oxyds of the fame kind, that change
so  rapidly into the oxalic or acetous acids by the action of
the nitric and oxygenated         muriatic acids,      as  Dr.  Pearson has
so  carefully confirmed      ?   How    came he not to perceive,           that
this difference    between     it and the other vegetable or animal
oxyds    required    from chemists       that   they sliould     place     it in
another class of bodies; and that, too much oxygenated,                      no
doubt, to pals to a new state of aciditv, being already itself
as much so as the nature of its composition would admit, it
could not but lose its combination by the strong action                  of the
oxygenating compounds, and pals,              as was really the cafe, to
the last term    of animal decomposition,           the state   of   a  double
binary compound        ; the   carbonic acid and ammonia               ?  I am
even astonished that      Dr.   Pearson, in analysing this body           with
                                                                                  '
that spirit of investigation which he employed, was not more
inclined than other chemists to preserve the acid character
to this compound, and that he was not averse to compare                        it
with oxyds, since he sound in it           so many characters opposite
lo those of the known oxyds.               If we   indeed take from th«
compound oxvds contained in organic bodies that character,
so  striking, of becoming acid by         a greater    proportion of oxy
gen, we (hall at once efface every thing clear and precise
which this denomination presents to the mind, and substi
tute at once darkness for light.

 390             Fourcrnj's Examination of             Dr. Pear/on.
     All   that  Dr.  Pearson has done gives more strength still u>
 the well sounded opinion which has caused this body to                          be
 classed    among the acids.           It differs particularly from the         ox-
 yds by its     unalterability, its imputrescibility, its solubility in
 alkalies, its resistance to acidification             ; and    it would    be de
 ranging to no purpose the results and opinions of modem
 chemistry to place it in that class of compounds with which
 it in reality has no relation.              I  stiall then continue with all
 the French        chemists      to consider      human urinary calculi          a*
 containing,       most    frequently, and, sometimes, altogether, a
 Weak acid, the characters of which were well determined
 before     Dr.   Pearson, and even confirmed by his researches.
     I  stiall add one important observation,              that  of all the acids
 it is that which crystallises the soonest, and whose molccu.'a-
 perhaps       are most altered      ;   which assumes with the greatest
 cafe the concrete and sparry form, under which, as his seen
 in regular calculi and in compact strata, it almost eludes the
 action of the most powerful re-agents                      and solvents; and
 it is to this last property, the most terrible and afflicting for
 humanity, that what is called the stone in the bladder must
 without doubt         resist   the action      of all   the   known solvents,
 and has hitherto given no hopes                of  the discovery    of a  lithon-
  triptic.
      In  the present     state    of chemistry       the particular matter      of
 human urinary calculi appears only as a combination, where
 abundance of carbon and azot united to a small quantity of
  hydrogen are inclined to a flight acidification by the fixed
  oxygen which they contain.                  The proportion even of these
  primitive materials has not yet been determined. After hav
  ing examined the labours of Dr. Pearson, I must agree with
  him, that the name litbic acid given to this annual concre
  tion, and which has been borrowed from the medical term
  lithiafis, deserves that reproach of impropriety which he be
  stows on it.       I am of opinion that we might adopt with ad
  vantage that      of onric acid, since this body has not yet                 bevn
  found but      in the urine of mau; and that even if suture                 expe-

says he found the fame acid in arthritic concretions, this de
nomination         would still be very proper, either because the
constant seat      of this acid     is the human      urine, or because it
is always more abundant there than in articulations attacked
by the gout ; or, in the last place, because it appears, in
some measure, in sits of that disease, to be driven and carried
from its usual channel towards the extremities of the bones,
the articular membranes             of which it irritates.
VIII.      On  the  Invention of    the   Eupbon, and other acoujlic      Dis
     coveries ofC. F. F. Chladni, Doctor of Philosophy and
     Law, fellow of the Royal Society of Gottingen, corre
    sponding Member of           the   Imperial Academy of Sciences at
     Peterjburgb,      &c.
 iVlANY           persons who interested         themselves     in favour of
 Dr. Chladni        and    his inventions having expressed a wish of
 becoming acquainted with the history of them, the Doctor
drew up a short paper on that subject, which he transmitted
 to one    of   the German        Journals*,    and from which we have
extracted       the   following     particulars.    The author first ob
serves, that the invention           of   the euphon and        all his other
 acoustic discoveries       were not the effects      of chance, but        the
 fruit of long     and continued reflection.          The rather confined
 education which he received, both in his father's house and
 at the school      of Grimma,       did not produce     on him the usual
 but    a contrary effect, as it inclined him ver)' early to think
 and to act for himself.             At the age of only fix or seven,
 when he ought to have been otherwise employed, he would
 sit whole hours studying maps and books of geography, and
 wish, at the same time, that he might have an opportunity
 ol travelling over all the countries which he saw represented
 before him.         His father,    first professor of law   at Wittenberg,

original         Hungarian          family name          into that of Chladeniixs,
was desirous that the author, his only son, should                        apply    him
self to the             law, though it was contrary to his                inclination.
Dr. Chladni,              therefore,     studied law first at        Wittenbenr,    and
then at Leipsic, and, after the usual forms, took his decree
of doctor. On his father's death he quitted this line, for
which he had no attachment, and, devoting himself entirely
to the study         of nature,        delivered lectures on physical and           ma
thematical subjects   qualify himself for a professorship
                                    to
which he had some hopes of obtaining. In his 19th \c*r he
began to learn              to play the harpsichord            ;   and he afterward*
read a great            many os the principal works                  on the theory      of
music,          by which       he found that the             plivsico-mathematicyj
part      of   that science was for more defective than other branch**
of natural philosophy.                       Being    therefore    possessed    with an
idea that his time could not be better employed than                             in en
deavouring to make discoveries in this department, he ac
cordingly          tried     various     experiments on the vibration* us
strings and the different kinds               of vibration in evlindric piece*
of wood,          first discovered,          through calculation,        by the elder
Eulcr      ;    and found that, though a great deal had been laid                     on
the nature          of    these    elastic    bodies,     yet the manner       of vibnv-
tion and the proportion of tones in other elastic bodies, which
do not proceed, as in the former, in straight lines, but de
pend on the vibration of whole surfaces, were totally un
known, and that the little which had been written on that
subject,         by some authors, did not correspond                    with nature.
He     had already long remarked, that even- plate                        of    glass   or
metal emitted               various      tones according as it was held             and
struck in different places ; and he was desirous to discover
the cause os this difference, which no one had ever examined.
He     fixed       in    a vice the axle       of    a brass plate    which bcloncrd
to a polishing machine, and found, that by drawing the bow
of    a    violin over       it,   he produced          very different tones,     which
were           stronger    and     of longer duration than             those obtained
                                                                                 merely

merely by striking it.         The observation,    that not only strings
but also olher elastic bodies may be made to produce sounds
by drawing a violin bow over them, Dr. Chladni docs not
give as a discovery       of his own;      as  the so called iron violin
has been long known, and as he had read                of an instrument,
constructed     in Italy *, where glass or metal bells were made
lo sound      by means of two or more violin bows drawn over
them.       But the idea of employing this instrument to exa
mine vibrating tones was first entertained by himself. Hav
ing accurately remarked the tones produced by the above-
mentioned metal plate, he found that they gave a progression
which corresponded           with the squares of 2, 3, 4, &c.         Not
long before he had read, in the Transactions                of the Royal
Society of Gottingcn,           the observations    of Mr. Lichtenberg
on the phenomena produced by strewing pounded resin over
a glass plate or cake of resin, and he repeated many of his
experiments.         This    led him   to the idea that, perhaps,        the
various vibratory movements           of  such  a plate would be disco
vered by a diversity       of phenomena, if      he strewed over it sand
or any thing of the like kind.                By this experiment there
 was produced a star-formed figure ; and the author, having
continued his researches, published the result of them in a
 work entitled, Discoveries respecting the Theory of Sound,
 printed at Lcipsic in 1787 \.              It contains a multitude of
 new observations         on the vibrations of different bodies, the
 proportions of the tones of which had been incorrectly
 given by others; on the vibrations which are produced by
 vibration and rotation conjointly; on the longitudinal vi
 brations ofa string, first announced by the author             ; and up
 on various other circumstances relating to acoustics.                 The
 author addressed this work to the Academy of Sciences at
 Peterlburgh,      with    a  view, perhaps, that it might give occa
 sion to analytical investigations       on the fame subject.      J. Ber-

394                      On   the   Invention      of the Eupboa,
noulli, who, next             to the elder       Euler,    had made considerable
additions to the science of acoustics, and who unfortunately
lost his life soon after, while                  bathing in the Neva, endea
voured,      in consequence of the above work, to determine by
calculation the vibrations                  of   a square plate ; but the result
did not agree with experience, and Dr. Chladni does                                      not
think it     possible to advance one step                  in this theory by ana
lysis alone.
     While Dr. Chladni               was employed          in   these investigations,
his situation was exceedingly unpleasant. He, however, did
not suffer his courage to be depressed, but exerted his abi
lities the more, in order that he might procure for himself
better means of subsistence. As he had examined the nature
of   so   many sonorous bodies, he resolved to invent                        a new       mu
sical instrument ; and he began to consider whether it                             might
not be possible by rubbing glass tubes in a straight line, with
the wet singers, to produce                  sounds in the fame            manner as          u
done   in the harmonica by rubbing them circularly.       That
glass tubes, like those in his euphon, would not merely by loth
rubbing emit any tones, he had long known by theory and
experience ; and he therefore                     applied himself to the solution
of   the difficult question, in what manner the instrument ought
to be constructed          to answer the intended               purpose.      After va
rious fruitless attempts              for    a year and a         half, during which
his imagination            was so full        of    the   idea,    that sometimes         in
his dreams he thought he saw the instrument and beard its
tones, that        is,   like those of the harmonica,                  but with mote
distinctness     and       less     confusion, he at length, in              a   state   be
tween steeping and waking, obtained solution of the pro    a
blem which had given    much employment to his thought*.

ihort slumber       ;    but scarcely had he closed his eyes « hen the
image of an instrument, such as he wished                              for, seemed to
present itself before him,                 and terrified        him   so   much that he

immediately started up in            a  kind of enthusiasm ; and made a
series    of experiments which convinced him that what he
had     seen was      perfectly right, and that he had it now in his
power to carry his design into execution.                  He made his ex
periments and constructed his first instrument in so private a
manner, that no person knew any thing of them.                          On the
 8th of March 1790 his first instrument of this kind was com
 pleted    ;  and    in a few days he was able to play on it some
 easy pieces       of  music. It was now necessary to give to this in
 strument, as it was entirely new, a new name, and that of
 ettpbon, which         signifies   an instrument that has a pleasant
  sound, appeared to him the most proper.
    
       The    first instrument      of this kind      made    by Dr. Chladni
 .was in found, and particularly in the higher tones, as good
  as those which          he made      afterwards   ;   but the construction
  was deficient in strength,             so  that every week      some hours
  were necessary to keep it in proper repair ;                 and it was im
  possible to convey         it the distance of        a  mile without almost
   totally destroying it.         Dr. Chladni       also for want      of better
   tubes     employed those used for thermometers, and marked
   the whole and half tones by a coating of sealing-wax on the
   under side ; but as the wax, owing to the moisture and vi
   bration,       often cracked     and    flew off, it was attended        with
   danger to the eyes.           It was,    therefore,   extremely difficult to
   give to the construction          of  the instrument sufficient     strength;
    but this the inventor           at length accomplished,          so that  his
    new euphon cannot be injured or put out of tune either by
    playing or by carriage.             The third instrument        constructed
    by Dr. Chladni          was   somewhat      different from the first and
   the   second ; as the fore part, which in the two former rose
     upwards with an oblique angle, stood at right angles, so that
     it could be transported with case in a particular carriage
     made for that purpose.            Instead   of   the  thermometer tubes
     used in the first, the doctor now employs tubes                of different
     colours.       In   the  second      instrument those for the         whole
      tones   were     of dark    green glass ; but he used        for the half
                                                                           tones,

  396                 On   tbe   Invention of    tbe  Eupbin,
   tones, in both, a      milk white kind of           glass.    In a word, the
  euphon has         some      resemblance       to   a   small writing-desk.
  When      opened,      the      above-mentioned         glass tubes,    of the
  thickness    of  the barrel      of  a quill    and about sixteen       inches
  long,   arc*  seen   in    a    horizontal    position.     They are vieued
  with water,      by means of a sponge,                and   stroked  with   the
 wet fingers in the direction of their length, so that the in
  crease of the tone depends merely on the stronger or weaker
 pressure, and the slower or quicker movement of the fingers.
  The number of         tubes at present is forty-two.             In the back
 part there is a perpendicular sounding-board divided in the
 middle, through which the tubes pass. It appears therefor*
 that the euphon ought not to be considered                   as  an altered   or
 improved harmonica,               but as     a totally new and different
 instrument.        In  regard to sweetness          of  sound, it approaches
 very near     to the     harmonica      ;   but it has several advantage*
 which no unprejudiced person, who examines both instru
 ment?, will deny.
     In  the first place       it is simpler, both in regard to its con
 struction and the movement necessary to produce the found,
 as  neither turning nor stamping is required, but merelv tbe
 movement of the linger.
     3. It  produces its sound speedier;             so that as soon as    it is
touched you may have the tone as full as the instrument is
capable     of giving    it ;   whereas,    in the harmonica, the tomes,
 particularly the lower ones,            must     be   made to increase gra
                                                                           ^
dually.
     3. It has more distinctness           in quick passages, because the
tones do not resound so long as in the harmonica, where the
sound    of  one low tone is often heard when you wise only to
hear the following tone.
    4. The unison is purer than is generally the case in the
harmonica, where it is difficult to have perfect glasses, mhich
in every part give like tones with mathematical exact neU.
It is however as difficult to be tuned as the harmonica.
                                                                         5.»<

      5.   It  docs not affect the         nerves    of  the performer;         for   &
  person scarcely feels a weak agitation in the fingers; whereas
   in the harmonica,             particularly     in concords of the lower
   notes,     the    agitation extends to the arms and even through
   the whole body          of  the performer.
      6.   The    expence       of this instrument will          be much less in
  future than that         of   the harmonica.
      7.   When        one  of   the tubes breaks,       or any other part is
  deranged,       it can be soon repaired, and at very little expence;
  whereas, when one of the               glasses   of  the harmonica breaks,
  it  requires much lime and is very difficult to procure another
  capable      of giving      the fame tone       as the    former, and which
  will   correspond       sufficiently with the scries of the rest.
      Though        Dr. Chladni        has been much occupied              with the
  construction and improvement of the cuphon, he has, how
  ever,     still continued        his researches respecting the theory of
  sound, and collected materials for a continuation of his essay
  before     mentioned,         which     contain     abundance       of    valuable
  matter.        In    one   paper,    which may       be  found in the Berlin
  Musical Journal for August 1792,                  he has     given    sonic    very
  accurate observations            respecting    the longitudinal       vibrations
  of  a string,     first announced by himself, which depend upon
  laws    of  nature totally different from those            of  the usual vibra
  tions.       Dr. Chladni        transmitted    also, a few years ago, to the
  Friendly Society of the Searchers                into Nature at Berlin,           in
  order to fulfill        his duty as      a  member, two          essays,    one   of
¦
  which      contained observations            on the tones produced             in  a
  tube    by burning          inflammable       air; from which it           appears
  that these tones, first remarked             by Mr. De Luc,         are nothing
  else   than pipe tones,           as the sonorous      body is not the        tube
  but the column of air contained in it.                   The other     essay was
  entitled Collections towards             promoting      a better   Explanation
  of  the Doctrine        of Sound.       The author here shews how this

accurate knowledge of these mutual relations                              depends upon
that of the laws to which their structure is                          subjected,     and os
which    the effect is to determine the                     number      and iflbrunent
of    the planes arranged           around the primitive form,                     in order

undergo, to represent to himself the polyedron                           thence result

such an angle or edge undergoes,                and  of which       the result is
this or that secondary form.              I  have endeavoured         to subject
the arrangement of the letters to a regular progress in rela
tion with the order of the alphabet ; so that this arrange
ment might appear as if occurring naturally of itself.
    I. Let us suppose that fig. 1. represents an oblique angled
parallelopipedon, the faces of which have angles different in
measure, and which arc the primitive form of a particular
kind of mineral such            as   feld   spar  *.    Having      adopted the
vowels to denote, in general, the solid angles, place the four
first A E I O at the four angles of the upper basis, following
the order    of   the alphabet,        and    at the fame time the com
mon mode of writing,               which is to begin at the top and to
proceed from right to left.             (See  Jig.   2. where the arrange
ment of the letters in lines is rendered sensible to the eye.)
    a. Having adopted the consonants to denote the edges, in
 general, place,       according to the fame              rule,    the   first  six
 BC D FG        II  on the middle of the            sides  of  the upper base,
 {Jig- 1.)   and on the two longitudinal                edges of the lateral
 face, which first presents itself from left to right.
    3. Lastly, place on the middle of the upper base and the
 two lateral faces, situated in front, the three letters                  I'MT,
 which are the first of the syllables              that form the word pri
 mitive.
    4. Each of the sour solid angles or of the fix edges, de
 noted by letters, is susceptible,             in the present case, on ac
 count of the         irregular     form     of   the   parallelopipedon,        of
 undergoing peculiar laws of decrement                    ;  but as these laws
 act with the greatest possible symmetry, at least                 in common,
 every thing that takes place on one of the angles or edges,
 pointed out, is repeated on the angle or edge diametrically
 opposite   among those which remained unoccupied ;                        so  that
  the latter is supposed to perform the same function                       as the
     The  parallelopipedon    it supposed   to be represented   in such a manner
 that the angle  0 A C,    farthest from the observer, is one of the angles of
 the base.
                                                                          former.

                           Short Method of expressing
former.            For example,       Ap (Jig. 3.),                being the same form
as   fig.    1.   the decrements which the angle                         A   undergoes, oc
casion       similar ones on the angle p                      (Jig. 3.).          The    cafe is
the fame with the edge                A       r, in      regard to the edge            Op; of
Iu     in regard to        E   s,   &c.       After this, nothing is necessary
but to denote the number                      of solid angles or edges which
undergo decrements really distinct, because the latter actually
contain those which take place on the analogous angles or
edges.
     5.     It will,   however, be sometimes necessary to point out
these last angles or edges ; and                         in that    cafe we may employ
the small letters which bear the fame names                                    as the large
letters employed           in figure      1   ; that is to fay, that p            (Jig. 3.)     be
denoted           by a; sp by c; p             u by b,       &c.         But it will not        be
requisite         to mark      these small letters on the figure.                        It will
be sufficient          to introduce           them in the            sisTi   of   the crystal :
because they may be easily referred,                                in idea,      each to       its
proper place.
     6.     To    denote the effects of decrement* by one, two, three
or more ranges,            in breadth, the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, &c. may
be employed, as sliall be explained hereafter ; and to denote
the       effects      of decrements            by       two, three, &c. ranges in
height, the fractions !,               j,     -',   &c. may be used.
      7.    The     three letters     I'M     T      will serve to denote either the
form of the nucleus,                 without any modification,                     when they
compose            alone the sign of the crystal,                        or the faces which
would be parallel to those of the nucleus in cafe the decre
ments did not extend to their limits; and these letters will
then be combined               in   the sign        of   the crystal with those which
have relation to the angles or the edges on which the decre
ments act.
     8. The principal or most simple                         decrement,           in   regard to
any solid angle whatever, such as O, may take place either
on the base    or on the plane T, which
                     P                   to the right of the        is
observer,           or on the plane             M        situated    to the left.         But    it
must        be remarked that the                    observer        is   supposed      to move
                                                                                          round

                    the different     Crystalline Fortns.                    401
round the crystal till he is opposite the angle on which the
decrements he is considering take place ; or, what amounts
to the fame thing,            that he is supposed to turn the crystal
until the angle in question is found opposite to him                  ;  and it
is in regard to this position that such a decrement                  is said to
take place towards his right            or towards his left.          For    ex
ample,     if the angle    A    be under consideration, we must con
ceive that the observer, who at first was opposite to the point
Q,    has placed himself opposite to         A j then, by     still supposing
figure 3 to represent the same solid as figure 1, the decre
ments to the right will be those which take place on the
plane     AY. sr, parallel        to the diagonal drawn from            E  to  r;
 ami the decrements          to the left  will  take place    on the plane
AI     u r, parallel     to the diagonal which           goes from      I   to  r.
 We     shall   see  hereafter      the advantage      of viewing in this
manner, in regard to the uniformity of method.
     9. To denote the first of the three decrements of which
 I  have spoken, or that which takes place on the base P, the
 indicating figure must be placed above the letter.                     To de
 note the second, or that which takes place towards the
 right, the figure must have the usual place of an exponent
 On the right, and towards the top of the letter; and the
 third, or that which takes place             towards     the left, must        be
 denoted by placing ihe figure towards               the left, and,       in  the
 like manner, towards the top of the letter.
     Thus O will        express     the effect   of  a decrement        by two
 ranges in breadth, parallel           to the diagonal       of the plane       P,
  which    passes  through the angle        E  {fig. 1); O1 the effect        of  a
  decrement by three ranges, parallel              to the diagonal        of   the
  face  T, which     p:\ssos   through    the angle    I ; and  *0    the effect
  of  a decrement     by four ranges parallel to the diagonal of the
  face  M, which passes through the angle E.
      10. In regard to the decrements on the edges,                         those
  which take place towards the contour li C F D of the                       base
  may be expressed by          a figure placed    above or below the let-
      Vol. II,                            D d                                  ter,

 403                     Short Method          of   expressing
 ter, according       as their effect operates upwards or downwards,
 departing from the edge to which                       they arc referred      ;  and
 those that regard the longitudinal                   edges   G,  H,   may be de
 noted by an exponent placed                 cither in the usual manner or
 on the left of the letter, according as they take place either
to the right or the left.
    Thus D will         express a decrement by two rariges proceed-
ing from        D towards C          ;   Ca       decrement by three          ranges
proceeding from C to                 D; D,          a decrement by two ranges
 descending on the face          M     ; 3H a decrement by three ranges
proceeding from          II  towards G, Sec. To determine the direc
 tion of the decrements to the right or left of any ridge, we
must     proceed      as in     regard      to the decrements         which    affect
the angles       (8).    For example, the decrements to the left of
the edge      G will be those which take place in proceeding
from     Ej   to  A r ( Jig.    3) .
    1 a.   In  the case in which we should be obliged to denote,
 by means      of   a  small letter, such as d, a decrement on the
edge, opposite        to that which           bears     the   large  letter  D,    we
ought to consider         the crystal         as   turned upside down:         Thus
d would       express a decrement              by two ranges         ascending     on
the    inferior    base   p;    as   D   expresses one which            ascends on
the upper base P.            For   the same          reason    c would express       &
decrement by three ranges proceeding from                         sp  (Jig- 3.)   to
wards     EO.      .
    13.   If the   fame angle or the             fame     edge undergoes several
successive decrements, on the fame                       side, or several    decre
ments, in      regard to different sides, we may be satisfied                   with
writing     one letter     accompanied with different figures indi
cating the decrements.
    Thus      D (Jig.       1.)   will    denote       two decrements       on the
«dge     D;   one     by two ranges ascending                  above   the  base   P,
and     the other by three           ranges descending           on the plane     M.
~'H*  will   denote two decrements                by two ranges on both sides
of  the edge     H, k.c.

        ^4.   If there  arc mixed decrements,             they may he denoted,
   according to the fame              principles,      by employing the frac
   tions    i \ I,    &c. the numerators of which refer                       to decre
   ment in breadth, and the denominator*                          to decrement          in
   height.
        15.   It now remains       to discover a method              of  representing
  the intermediary decrements.                   An   example        will    convey an.
  Wea     of   that which     I have adopted.          Let    AEOI        [Jig. 4.)    be
  the fame face as fig. 1, and let us suppose a decrement                            by a
  range     of   double moleculæ, according to lines parallel to ,vj<,
  so that     O   v may measure lines equal to two                 sides   of   a  molc-
  cula, and O x lines merely equal to one side.                          This decre-
                                                               1
  ment, therefore,         may be denoted           thus (O        D'F2):       first the
                                                                                         1
  parenthesis       shews that      the   decrement          is   intermediary;         O
  shews that it takes place by one range on the angle denoted
 hy     the fame letter,     and that it refers to the base              ;   D' F' in
  dicate, that for one edge of molecula subtracted                           along the
  side D, there arc two cdjjcs subtracted alone: the                       side   F.
       16.  It  is useful to have a language          to express these disserent
  signs in such a manner Ihat they may be easily written when,
 dictated.         The   signs  O', 'O might          be enounced           l>v  savin?,
  0    two at the right, O three at the lest.                   To   enounce       O, O
 we might say,         O under two, O         above sour      :  and lastly, the sign
    t
  (O D' F:) might be thus enounced                      :   In    a   parenthesis      O
 under one, D one, F two.
      17.    Let   us now give an example              of   the combination            of
 these different signs in the expression               of  a   compound crystal
 line form.         But it wdl    first  he necessary to determine              the or
der according to which               the letters that concur to form one
expression ought to be arranged.                   Should we admit the al
phabetic order, the result would be                 a  sort   of  confusion       in the
view presented by the formula.                    It appears therefore more
natural to adopt that order which would direct the observer
in    the description     of the same crystal ; that is to fay, to begin
by the prism or the mean part               ;   to indicate its different faces

the faces of the summit, or of the pyramid. This will be il
lustrated    bv the different       examples    we (hall mention        in thtf
course os this article.
     Let z v (fig. 5.)       be the variety    of feld-spar, named jimi-
laire, the      primitive      form of which        is represented      fig.   I.
In this variety       the plane    nqxr (Jig.     5.) results from a de
crement by two ranges on the edge G (Jig. 1.), proceeding
towards      H  ; the plane      rk s pv x (Jig. 5.) is parallel to the
plane M (Jig. 1.),            which    is concealed only in part by the
effect of the decrement.             The plane sump is parallel to the
plane T ; the pentagon k aj/ u s arises from a decrement by
twp ranges on the angle I, parallel to the diagonal whicb
proceeds from         A   to O  ; and, in the last place, as this decre
ment does not reach its limits, the summit bears                    a second
 pentagon     zlnrk        parallel to the base   P. All this description
                                                              t
 may be thus        expressed    by five letters, G1   M T I P.
      j 8. Let  us next proceed        to parallelopipcdons       of  a   more
regular form ; and let us first consider the cafe in which
 they differ from the rhomboid.               We (hall suppose that the
 pa.-allelopipedon       is the fame as that      of fig.  I,   the form       of
 v Inch     has varied, so as to become more symmetrical.                     In
 consequence        of this variation, certain solid or salient angles,
 which were         different   in the first parallelopipcdon, hare be
 come equal       :  whatever     takes place in the one is repeated           in
 the other ; and consequently            they must    be marked with the
 same letter.      Thus, in     algebra, certain solutions are simplified
  in    the particular cafes in which a quantity           at first supposed
  lo be different from another becomes equal to it.
       19. Let  us conceive, for example, that the primitive form               it
 a right prism,       the base    of which   is the oblique-aneied paral
  lelograms      (Jig. 6.),   and we (hall have       O  - A,    I = E,      Sec.
  We      must then substitute on both sides          the second ktter for
  the first, as seen       in the figure.     By continuing      to run over
  the different modifications of the parallelopipcdon, we dull
   see them pass        through different degrees of simplicity, ina

                       the different   Crystalline Forms.                   405

     04. And, in the last place, for the cube that of figure 11.
 Jlere the base only is denoted by letters, because what takes
 place in regard to this          base may be     applied to any one of the
 other faces.
     35. For all these different primitive form3 a method of
 figures, analogous to that which I have adopted for the
 oblique-angled parallclopipcdon of figure              1, may be followed      j
 but the letters of the fame name, figured in the fame man
  ner, need not be repeated.
     One example will            serve to give    an idea  of this method.
 Let   a  r (Jig.     12.)  be the most    common variety of the cymo-
  phane,the nucleus of which is           a  rectangular parallclopipcdon,
  such as that seen         fig. 8.    The   sign  of the secondary      crystal
will   be,    MT'GC BA*               "*A, in which      M   corresponds      to
  goblnr, T            to bets,       SG lo  fgnm, G          to   bell,    15 to

  daej,      or  b  ac  e,  A1    to  cfg 0,   and  aA  to c e h 0.
     To illustrate      better the steps which have conducted            to this
  expression,       let us point out,       for a moment, all the angles
  and all the edges by as many particular letters, as                if the  pa
  rallclopipcdon were oblique-angled.              (Strstg.   13.)
     The    sign then      will become M        T 'G II'   BFE'        ~»0;  but
  by comparing figure 13 with figure 8, we sec that H                     =    G,
  F  =. B, O = A ; by substituting then in the place of the first
  letters their values, we sliall have            MT'GG          B  li A* *A,
  which amounts           to the expression above shewn, by suppressing
  the useless repetition        of B.

founding,      for example,      'G   G2 with G1 G.           The    first sign
denotes      decrements     which     take    place on       the   faces    t  T
 (Jig. 8.), proceeding from         the edges     G towards     those   which
correspond with them behind the parallelopipedon                  ;  and    the
second denotes       decrements which take place on the face                 M
proceeding to meet each other.             If the    two decrements       took
place simultaneously, their representative             sign would be JG2.
    In the preceding signs, each letter, such as :G or G1, can
not be applied but to one edge situated as that letter itself to
the right or left; but 1G1 may be applied indifferently                       t»
both edges      : for this reason it is needless to repeat that letter.
    27. Let us give a new example, taken from the topaze
dijlique, called commonly the Saxon topaz (Jig. 15.). If we
suppose figure 9 to represent          the primitive form, which is a
right prism, with rhombuses for its bases, we shall have as
the sign of the variety in question 3G3              M B E P,           which
is explained \n the following manner : 1. The planes similar
Xaotzqr (Jig. 14.) arise from a decrement by three ransres
on each     side  of the edges    G (Jig.   9) ; ad, the planes        ty A s,
sy Ap,     are parallel to the planes      M,     and thus the preceding
decrement has not attained to                its  limits; 3d,     the facets
h  ky t v, nky     s b, and  ghki,     b u k  i, arise from two     successive
                                                                                 *
decrements on the edges B, one by two ranges, and the other
by three; 4th, the facets acghvxm, and those which cor
respond to them, on the other side, arise from two successive
decrements on the angles E, one by one range, and the other
by two ranges ; 5th, in the last place, the terminating face
cdjlig        corresponds to the       base    P of the primitive form.
    28.  It may     be readily concluded from the fame principles,
  hat the dodecaedron        with rhombuses for           its planes,    origi
nating from the cube          (Jig. 8.), is      expressed by the        single
letter B   ;   that the octaedron originating from the fame nu-
                         I
cleus, has for sign     A, &c.
    29. The rhomboid, supposing it placed under the most
natural aspect, that is to fay, in such a manner that the twp
 solid angles     composed    of   three planes with equal          angles be
                                                                          upon,

                      the different    Crystalline Forms.                  407
upon one and the same vertical axis, has properly no base,
but only two summits, which are the extremities of the axis.
These angles and edges may be denoted                     as seen   figure 15.
The    letter   e makes known that          the angle which bears it is
similar to that marked with the same large letter; so that if
all the lateral angles had their indications expressed, the
three    nearest the upper summit would bear the letter                 E, and
the three next to the lower summit, and which are visibly
opposite to the first, would have for their indicative letter e.
    As   the rhomboid has its six faces equal                and similar, it is
only necessary to consider the decrements in regard to one of
the faces, such as that which bears the letter -P, because all
the   rest    are only repetitions       of  the latter.      This being laid
down, ist, the decrements               which depart        from   the   upper
angle    A, or from       the upper edge B,      will  have their indicating
figure placed below the letter A or B ; ad, those which de
part from the lateral angles E will be denoted by the fame
letter written twice, one on the right, and the other on the
left; 3d, in regard to those which depart from the lower
angle e, or from the lower edge             D,   the figure destined to ex
press them will be placed above the               letter e  or D.
    Let us suppose, for example, that             figure 16 represents ana
 logical carbonat of lime, in which              the vertical faces     ecpg,
 ogrz,        &c. result from       a decrement by twq ranges on the
 angles     e (J>g. 15.); the oblique faces mtlce,           be go, &c. from
 a decrement        by two ranges on the edges D, and the terminat
 ing faces imcb, iftb, from a decrement by a range on the
 edges   B,    we stiall have the following sign          e   D B.
    30. The other primitive forms, after what I have said in
 regard lo the pnrallclopipedon, will be attended with no dif
 ficulty.      I  stiall run them over in succession.           Figure   17 re
 presents the expression           of the oolaedron with scalene trian
 gles  ;   figure    18  that   of the octjcdron with isosceles triangles,
 and figure 19 that          of  the regular oclaedron.         To   place  the
 figures, which         accompany the letters,          we stiall conform to
 what has been        said  in regard to the rhomboid. Thus (Jig. 18.)
                                      Dd4                                    wo

408                      Short Method       of expressing
we must put the figure below for the decrements                     which pro^
ceed from        A   to  B;    above     for those that depart from            D;
and at the side for those which depart                  from   E.
    If we    wished to denote          the result    of   a decrement by one
range on all the angles            of  the regular octaedron         (Jig. 19.),
we should write         A   'A1  ; and to indicate the result           of a  de-
crement by       a range      on all the edges we should write B B.
The    first  of  these decrements          produces       a cube, and the     se
cond     a dodecaedron        with rhombuses         for its planes.
    31. In some kinds of crystals, as those of the nitrat of
potash, the octaedron, the surface of which is composed of
eight isosceles triangles, similar four to four, must be situated
as represented figure 20, in order that the secondary crystals
may be in the most natural position               ;    that is to (ay, that the
edges at the       junction of        the two pyramids composing the
octaedron      may be, one in         a  vertical direction       as F,  and the
rest in a horizontal direction as           B. By comparing fig. 20 with
fig. 21,   where    the   letters   have   been  placed as if all the angles
and all the edges had peculiar functions, we shall readilv con
ceive the distribution           adopted figure        20, and brought       ba<.k
to the symmetry of the real primitive figure ; for, in the pre
sent case, we have E = A, D = C, G ~- V. The indicating
figure must       be' placed      below the letter for decrements             tic-
parting from B         ;   and    on one    side  or below it for those de
parting from        A,   ac wording as their effect           (hall be directed
towards B or F.
    32. The tetraedron being always regular, when it be
comes the primitive form, its expression will be represented
 figure 21.      To indicate, for example,              a decrement by three
 ranges on all the edges we must put              B    and B ;    and to denote
                                                    1
 one by two rangrs, on all the angles, we mull put                   A   *A% as
 in the cafe of the regular octaedron.
    33.    A   short view     of  figure 23    will   be sufficient   to give an
 idea  of   the method       of denoting      the regular hcxaedral prism
 in ordinary      cases  j and with regard to the manner              of placing
                                                                               the

the figures       I   shall not enlarge on              it,   as   it    may be easily        de
duced from what we have adopted in regard to quadrangular
prisms.       But,      it    sometimes    happens            that three of the solid
angles, taken alternately, arc replaced                        by   facets, while the         in
termediary angles              remain untouched.                    In that        cafe the ex*
preslion     of   the prism will be that seen fig. 34.
  34. The rhomboidal dodecaedron, in certain species, as that
of red silver ore, has six of its facca which perform the func
tions of the planes of            a   prism    ;   while the            six   other faces en-i
ter into the analogy of rhomboids (29)     that the faces of    ;       so
each order may undergo particular decrements, independently
of   those which regard the faces                   of   the other order.                 Figure
25 represents the expression of this dodecaedron. Each face
of the summit, in the same case, may be considered as the
base    of   an oblique quadrilateral prism (20), and the adjacent
planes as besonging to the fame                         prism.           Thus      the manner
of placing the              letters   which indicate               the       decrements,      and.
the figures that accompany these letters, will be analogous
to that which takes place                 in
                              quadrilateral prisms.
   35.  In other species, such as that of the garnet and sul-
phure of zinc, each solid angle, composed of three planes,
may be assimilated to the summit of an obtuse rhomboid;
and     thus          by   employing figures            only for one face we shall
 have the expression represented                    by   figure 26.
     36. We            shall    not employ the sign of the dodecaedron
 with isosceles triangular planes, because                          it   is   more natural to
 substitute       the       rhomboid      from which               it    arises,    as we have
 more simple laws of decrement.
     37.
           It   remains to give the means of representing                           a   particular
 case   which         takes place      in certain         crystals,           where the parts
 opposite to those that ohey certain laws                       of decrement remain
 untouched, or arc modified                        by   different laws.   This cafe
 belongs, in    particular manner, to turmalins
                       a                        and                                ;         it    is
 easy then to indicate the difference    means of   zero.          by                    a
 For example, in the very obtuse turmalin, the nucleus of
 which       we       shall    suppose represented                 figure 15, the            prism
 which       is   enncagonal has six           of   its planes produced                   by sub-
                                                                                         tractions.

other three by subtractions of two ranges on three                                only of
the angles              E or      e.   Moreover, the inferior summit has
simply three faces                parallel to those of the nucleus ; * bile on
the superior summit the three edges B are each replaced by
a facet, in consequence of a decrement by one range which
does not attain to its limits.                   The representative sign of this
form will be              :   D   e  E P B,    b.    The quantities E,          b   shew,

and the other that the edges opposite to B remain also un

law, taking place by two ranges,                          the sign would become

                                 According to this we are supposed to admit
that the decrements,                   represented      by   a large   letter,   do   not
implicitly contain like decrements analogous to the small
letter of the fame name ; or reciprocally, that if the second
letter sliould not enter into the expression of the sign with a
different figure, we should not place there the same figure
accompanied with a zero.                       In    the   first case,   each     of   the
two letters          expresses       a decrement which           is peculiar to the
edges         or angles          it denotes; in       the second,      that which ic
affected         by     a   zero stiews that the angle or edge it denote*
undergoes            no decrement.
     38. Let us still quote the variety of the fulphure of tine,
which exhibits the dodecaedron having rhombuses for iu
plafies, the four solid angles of which, composed of                                three
planes, are replaced                   by triangular facets        situated     like the
 faces      of    a tetraedron,        while the opposite angles remain un
 touched *.               By always adopting          figure    16 to represent the
 primitive          form, we should thus express the variety in                     ques-

one or more figures                ;   the values          of which,             as well as the
positions, indicate the laws of decrement                                   which the angles
or corresponding edges undergo.                             We       must except the three
consonants            P,   M, T,       each       of which, when                 it   forms part of

takes place to the right or left                  of the angle, or of the edge

     10. The parenthesis,              such as (O D" F2), denotes an inter-
mediary decrement.                  The       letter   O     indicates   :    first    that the
decrement takes place               by   three ranges on the angle O, and
that its effect      is    ascending.            D' F* make known                      that for
one edge of moleculæ subtracted     along the side marked D,
there are two edges subtracted along the side marked F.
   11. Every small letter, comprehended      in the sign of                                    a

that which bears thdarge letter of the fame name on the
figure    ;   or the small letter in question                     is   omitted        as   super*
fiuous.
     12.    We   must except the letter                 e,    which      is   always found
on the figure         of    the     rhomboid,               and   which indicates             the
angle opposite to that which bears the letter                            E.

one large and the other small, with different figure*, the
two angles or two edges opposite to which these letters cor
respond, are supposed to undergo each separately the law of

figure followed by a zero, makes known that the decrement
indicated     by this figure     has no effect on the angle or edge
to which that letter belongs.
X.    Curious    Fail refpeBing      the  Natural History 0/ the Otter.
    By C.     Poissonnier,          Justice of Peace of the Canton of
    Bonnat, Department of la Creuze.                 From Le Moniteur
    Universe!, Nivofe 21, An. VII.
X.    HAD     considered as a fable what Father Vanierc fays, ir*
the fifteenth     book of his poem called Prdium Rusticum,                 in
regard    to an otter    which he had tamed to such a degree that
it would plunge before his eyes into a canal of vail extent,
and bring to him with great fidelity the prey it had caught.
From     the    accounts     I  had    read in the works        of different
naturalists,     I  believed that this animal was            of  a nature so
ferocious that it was 'no way susceptible of being tamed;
but I am now convinced of the contrary. Having procured
a young otter in the month of Germinal last, it has fully
 repaid   all  the care    and    attention    I bestowed     on   it; for it
goes regularly every morning to take a turn on the banks                     of
 the small river Creuze, which            runs at the distance of about
 a  hundred paces from my habitation,                and    seldom     return*
without bringing me a fish still alive.             To whatever distance
 it goes, it always returns with' the utmost punctuality to the
 small kennel which        I   have constructed     for it.
     It has been said also that this animal is amphibious,                 but
 I have    found the contrary to be the cafe.              My    otter   neves
 plunges into the water but to catch its prey, and it returns
 as speedily as possible to        die banks, where it sliakes itself
 like a small water-spaniel.           If it is obliged to remain under
 water for any length of time, it raises its head in order to
 breathe ; from which I conclude that the otter swims better
 than other animals ; but is not amphibious,                 since it cannot
 live under water above half au hour.

                                         Cairo, Thermidor 25th, An.     VI.
   T^H E      Commission of the Sciences remained a month at
   Rosctta, until Egypt was entirely subdued.            I  am busily em
   ployed at present      in the department       to which    I belong.     I
  have had the good fortune to be encouraged and protected
  by General Menou, who commanded in the province of Ro
  sctta.   He  gave me an escort, to enable me to penetrate              the
  Delta, and to hunt for animals.          I  have found a number         of
  very interesting birds.     To   observe them alive, describe them
  zoologically   and anatomically ; to prepare          stuffed skins and
  skeletons,  have been my occupation           in the     most agreeable
  country of Egypt.         I have   made   many new observations,
  which I intend     to write down for the Institute        of Cairo.
     The   botanists   arc very unfortunate      in  regard to their sci
 ence.     Egypt has scarcely furniflied them with twenty               dif
 ferent species;     and, besides, they have lost all           the  paper
 which    they   brought with them.          The     cafe has    been   the
 fame with my spirit       of wine    and  powder for stuffing birds*
 These articles were on board the Patriots, which was loft                in
 the harbour of Alexandria.           This vessel had      on board also
 the effects of the aeronauts.
    The   most astonishing tree here is the sycamore-fig.              One
 of  these trees is sufficient to (hade      several    of the peasants'
 huts, with the oxen that raise water          to   water the meadows
 by means of wheels.

    THE    naturalists arc all employed each in his              own de
partment.      The mineralogists      have   not found any       thing of
importance.      They    have  been occupied only         in examining
                                                                         the

The ruins have furnished them a much more abundant har
vest.    The thousands of columns which every where occur
 have presented them with granites, breebes*, and Egyptian
 marble of the greatest beauty. The monuments, astonish
ing on account of their bulk, which arc seen here, have al
ready given us a specimen          of  the wonders we shall behold            in
Upper      Egypt.      Pompcy's      pillar,   and    the   column       called
Cleopatra's needle,         do not, however, make            so  much im
pression as an Egyptian vase covered with hieroglyphics, and
in  perfect preservation.        This vase.stands in the great mosque
of   the Arab town ; and         I hope that you      will  see  it in Paris,
notwithstanding its enormous weight.
    I  have examined         with   C. Champi        the stones      of which
 the walls   of  the  Arab town     are built.      They    are corroded      tj
 the very centre in such a manner as might induce people                      to
believe that saltpetre here is very abundant;            but we were sur
prised to find scarcely any thing except sea-salt and                  a verv
 small quantity os a nitrat, the nature           of which     we have not
 been able to determine, as we had not the necessary means,
 but which, in all probability,          is nitrat  of lime.       I  am em
 ployed   in getting repaired the boxes which contain our che
 mical apparatus, and which have suffered considerably. More
 than half of the sulphuric acid              has been lost, and has in
jured the boxes.

   Alexandria stands in the middle of                       a desert.        The Turkish
town is built at the expence of that of the Arabs, where no
thing has been preserved untouched but the cisterns, none
of which have been formed under the new town. The ob
jects of culture here consist of beautiful palms, which have'
a somewhat          dismal appearance,             fig-trees, the caBus opuntia,
and wretched vegetables,               to which the inhabitants do much
honour by giving them the names of cabbages, sorrel, pars-
Icy, 8cc. The onions, however, deserve particular attention.

The grapes which we have ate here for a fortnight past are
brought by water from Rosctta and Cyprus : water- melons,
which are abundant, come also from Rosetta                              :    they are cul
tivated here, but in small quantities.
   The Bedouin Arabs who inhabit                              the desert,         and who
seed there their flocks, which they afterwards bring for fate
to Alexandria, wear a white dress that appeared to me to
have a great resemblance               to the ancient Roman habit, and
which     produces        a very sine effect.               The painters,          when     I
asked what they thought                of   it,   entertained        the same opinion.
The men         here are strong,            of    large     size,    and well      propor
tioned.       This, no doubt,           is   owing to the dress worn                 by   the
children and the lower classes, which                         is    merely   a   blue shirt.

pay to    a   climate     so   different from our own, and above all to
the difference         of nourishment.                 Though         the    heat here      is
only 2,2 or 23 (81 or 84 Fahr.), on account of the sea-
breeze which cools the atmosphere, the hygrometric dispo
sition   of the air    has   a   powerful effect on the animal icom-my.

   The    plague,    so  much dreaded in Europe, creates no unea
siness   here, though it still exists          in some houses of the city.
People walk in the            streets   with as much confidence as if
they were not exposed to the danger of touching an infected
person, and catching that cruel malady.                     Dubois, the sur
geon, has had         a great deal      of  conversation     with a  physician
who has long practised in this country.                       He assured him
that the plague is not so dangerous as it is generally repre
sented, and that many persons, attacked by epidemic diseases,
die for want     of   assistance, because the terror inspired            by the
plague is stronger than all            the tics   of affection.   A  lazaretto
was established here almost as soon as we arrived.                  It  is situ
ated in the ancient isle          of Pharos,     at the entrance    of  the old
harbour.

418                    On  lie Extraction of Opium.
 this Society,      I  have taken the liberty to subjoin a sew ex
 tracts from a memorandum                on the subject,          part   of    a  work
 on the arts, manufactures, and agriculture, of Hindoostan,
 collected     at various times         during     my residence          in India.
 I  do not pretend to any practical knowledge                   ;   but   if it may
 afford the least hint to those engaged in the pursuit,                        I (hall
 feel great pleasure in the communication.
     The   greatest quantity         of opium imported from India is
 prepared in the province of Bchar, the soil of which mostly
 consists of clay, with a considerable portion of sand.                           The
 richest foils    of this    description    are preferred         by the natives
 for the cultivation         of    the   poppy, which         is the        PapaK.tr
somniscrum        of Linnæus.          The ground       is ploughed sixteen
 or eighteen       times,     and    manured with the dung of cattie
 folded on it at night,         or rotten     cow-dung      ;     the manure         is
 ploughed in,        and the ground thoroughly broken and care
 fully levelled with       the    harrow.       The   feed     is    sown      in the
 broad-cast      way    ; and    the field    is then divided into squares
 of four or     five feet, leaving an interval,           which        is raised fix
 inches;     and on these ridges          a  channel is excavated to con
 vey water to every square,            from   a  well near the field.             The
 plants are five or six inches from each other, and are watered
once a week,        or oftener,       until they are sufficiently            ripe for
 the extraction of the opium.                  About   seven days after the
 flowers fall, when the capsules discover                  to the pressure a
degree   of    hardness,     they begin to collect the opium.                       Al
 fun-set,    a  double incision is made on each capsule,                         from
the stalk upwards, at one stroke                of the nehrea : the opera
tion is repeated every second day,               for a fortnight           or three
weeks.      The juice which             has    exuded    during        the      night,
from the wounds made the preceding evening, is scraped off
the capsule with a small iron scoop ; this is done early in
the    morning        before   the   dew    is dispersed.          The    seeds    are
valuable    for the oil they contain, and,            as  an article of food,
are in great request with the natives.

 XIII.    Description     of the Mangle     invented by      Mr. Jee. Ex*
    trailed from      the  Transactions of the Society for the En
    couragement        of Arts,   &c*     Vol.    XVI.
   1 HIS        mangle (fee Plate      XI.)      is so constructed     that thu
handle is required         to be turned   one way only, which moves
the machine more steadily and safer for the linen,                     than by
varying the turning of the handle.
    Fig. 1, is a perspective view of         the mangle when at work.
The letters of reference answer                to   the  same parts       as   in
fig.  2 ;   but here the great      wheel     is hid    by a   board which
lies on the frame         B.
    A,   fig. 2, is the great wheel, 15 inches in diameter, the
teeth   of which, being on the under fide, cannot be seen in
this view     ; B   is the arbor on which the pinion           C is  fastened,
which is worked by the winch              D.       The pinion causing the
 large wheel to revolve, works the            crank E F, (the part E is
 ai inches long) which being             fastened to the moveablc bed
 K by a pivot at G causes it to          move forward and backward,
 by one continued motion           of  the winch,       guided    in its place
 by the pulleys 1 1 1 1.          HH are two levers for raising the
bed to put in or take out the linen which is wound on the
 rollers   LL:      this is effected by the open studs            GG      at the
 ends   of   the bed being brought alternately             over the ends       H
of  the levers, the other ends        of which       are then pressed down
  by the hand.
    Fig.   3 is a   front view of one of the open studs.

silver medal to   Mr. Jee. Two complete modeli            arc referred   in  their
 repository for the use of the public.

    Mrs. Applcby, wife of the Rev. William Appleby,
 Wooten, Lincolnshire, laboured under dyspeptic complaints
 upwards of twelve years.            Nine physicians had tried their
 art, but to no purpose. The disorder seemed to gain ground,
 and was accompanied with violent spasms and a paralysis of
 her lower extremities. Dr. Harrison of Homcastle, »bo
 last attended        her, desired (lie would try the oxygenating
 system;        and conjointly with Dr. Darling of Glandford
 Bridge, it was effected in this manner.             Bark and oxymuriatg
 of   potash     were    given,   and    oxygen    air inhaled      ;  and the
 change produced          was so great,       that to the surprise       of  the

  L HE     National Institute,      in its public sitting Nivose 15,
An.  VII.    proposed   the following prize subjects        :
                             GRAMMAR.
   This   class not having       received    any paper that seemed
worthy of the prize before announced, have prolonged the
term of competition to the next year, and propose the same
subject under the following form :
                                            " To examine what the
French language       has gained in clearness and elegance,          and
what it may have lost in naivete          and energy since the time
of Amyot to     the present    day."
   The prize      is a gold     medal    of  the value   of   five hecto
grammes.        It will be adjudged in the public sitting of
Germinal 15, An. VIII.             The papers must be written in
French, and transmitted before the 1st Nivose, An. VIII.
   This class also proposed : " To point out the means pro
per for giving new activity to the study            of  the   Greek and
Latin   languages    in France."
    The prize   the fame as the above, and         will  be adjudged   in
 the public sitting   of Mcflidor    15,   Year VIII. The memoirs
 must be transmitted     before the 1st    of Germinal the same year.
                          MATHEMATICS.
    The Academy of        Sciences    had proposed as the subject       of
 the mathematical prize,          for 1794, an investigation of the
orbit of the first comet of 1770.           Astronomers have tried,
                                    £  c 3                            but

42»                            Prize    Questions by
but without      success,    to subject the observations           made    of that
comet to the laws of parabolic                   motion.         Prosperin      and
 Pingre employed themselves particularly in this research,
and mathematicians are indebted to Dusejour for an im
portant piece of labour, in which lie has reduced to less than
a degree the maximum             of   the errors    of  the parabolic       hypo
thesis.     Lexell was able to represent with                   precision these
observations       in an ellipsis        described    in the course        of five
years    and a    half; but       as   this comet was not            seen   before
 j 770,   and    has not appeared           since,   so   rapid    a   revolution
seems inadmissible         ;  unless    we suppose that the comet              ex
perienced,      before its appearance,         very strong       perturbations,
which     brought its aphelion much nearer to                     the fun; and
that, after its disappearance,            it experienced contrary pertur
bations, which removed that aphelion to a very great distance.
We find,      indeed,     that, in the ellipse alluded to, the comet
passed very near to         Jupiter    at these two epochs.           These sup
positions,     however, are very improbable             ;   and ouerht not to
be admitted until we arc well assured                      that   the    observed
motion of the cornet             cannot be represented in a non-re
entering orbit        (orbite von rentrante)          or at least one very
much elongated.
    To clear up this remarkable phenomenon in the system                        of
the world, the Institute proposes:
    1.  To  discuss all the observations           which can be sound           of
the comet      of   1770,     by determining, if        necessary,      the posi
tions of the      stars  with which it was compared.
    2. To examine, with             care, whether the observations            can
be represented in a non-rc-entering                orbit.
                            be found impossible,                determine the

elements     of  the elliptic orbit, which correspond              most exactly
with these observations.             But to give to the calculations all
the precision      necessary, and to leave no doubt              of  the jusincf*
of  the consequences deduced from them, it                   will  be abfolutdv
required    that attention be paid to the following points:
    j. To    free the observed longitudes and latitudes from the
                                                                           effect*

 effects of parallax, aberration and nutation, in order to ob
 tain the true positions,         and    that    there   may be no need to
 employ, in the calculation of the geocentric places, but the
 longitudes counted from the mean equinox.
    2.   To employ in       the calculus the true place            of the fun ;
 that is to fay, augmented              20   seconds     for aberration, and
 counted    from the mean equinox.
    3. To give, for each observation,                  the difference    of the
 observed place of the comet, and that               deduced from calcula
 tion  ;  and  to   join   to these     differences     the corrections to be
 made in the heliocentric            longitudes and latitudes, in order
 to make the error       of   the geocentric places vanish.
    4. To give       the error which           must be produced         on the
 geocentric place by an error of 10 seconds in the calculated
 longitude    of  the fun    ;   and to determine also the effect          of  a
 small error in the radius vector            of  the earth.
    5. Lastly, though the nebulosity which surrounds comets
 generally prevents their phases from being well distinguished,
 it will not be     useless    to examine whether these phases could
 have    had   any sensible        influence on the observed places;
 and, in that cafe, they mutt             be taken      into the account,      if
 possible.
    By paying attention to all              these   points, which, for the
 most part, have been hitherto neglected,                 it may be at length
 possible to discover whether the movements                     of that comet
may not really        be   represented       in a non-re-entering         orbit,
 or whether the irregularities observed               in its course may not
 have been owing, in a great measure, to the elements                    of  the
 earth's orbit,     which       are not perhaps         sufficiently  well de
 termined to give with precision                the geocentric places      of  a
 planet which approached            so near the     earth.
    The prize is a kilogramme of gold. Papers on this sub
ject will not be received beyond the 15th of Messidor,
 An.   VIII.     The Institute will announce                 the piece   which
 has gained      the    prize in      its public     sitting    of Nivose 15,

PROCEEDINGS          OF   THE FRENCH NATIONAL INSTITUTE.
   IN   the above sitting       C. Paliflbt Beauvoir       read a  memoir
on the rattle-snake.        The author      asserts  that this reptile is
not  so  terrible, nor of    so ferocious  a  nature, as is commonly
believed.     There are even certain times of the year when                 it
is extremely gentle, and will suffer itself to be laid hold of
with the hand. C. Falissot caught nine rattle-snakes in the
course   of two hours, while hunting with              an   American, in
the United States      ;  and he saw one at the       house of the same
American, which had been kept there for five years.                   Some
have pretended that the females devour their youne; but
C.  Palissot fays that they only place         them in their mouth,
and   carry them in         that manner       when     threatened      with
danger.      As  a  proof of this, he relates the following curiooi
anecdote:    one day he saw a female rattle-snake accompanied
by five young ones of about the size of the barrel of a quill.
The young ones, frightened by the noise which he made,
took shelter     in the mouth os the mother,               which    carried
them    to a little distance.      Having followed        and    concealed
himself, the young recovered courage ; quitted their retreat
and began to sport on the grass, till, being alarmed by the
noise which he again          made, they returned        to their former
asylum.       This    scene     was   repeated     several    times,    and
C.  Palissot declares that different      people    told    him they had
been witnesses     of   the fame thing.
   C. Peyre read        a memoir on       the   danger to which tha
National Library       is exposed from fire, owing to the building*
in its vicinity.
   C.  Testier gave an account       of  the researches he had made
on the ordinary and possible duration of gestation or preg
nancy. The author made a great many experiments on ihe
females    of different animals,       such   as cows, mares, swine,
rabbits, &c.       In more than      a   hundred cows the time of
gestation    varied   from eight months twentv days                 to rrn
months      seven days.       Those made on marcs             and   rabbits

gave      variations equally great.                   In    regard       to   the    human
species,      the observations             which       ought to         serve   as certain
data    arc    very     imperfect        ;   but    pregnancy, according to                  C.
Teflier,      may be prolonged               a quarter beyond the usual time.
A   child, therefore,           says the     author, born beyond the eleventh
month of the widowhood of the mother ought not to be any
impeachment of her chastity.                          And     such was the sentence
 pasted by a celebrated                decree      of   the parliament            of Paris,
which declared           as   legitimate a prince of Conde bom eleven
months after the death of his father*.
    The sitting was terminated by the reading of an allegorical
poem in two cantos, by C. Colin-Harleville, entitled, Th*
Adventures of Melpomene and Thalia.

    THE       National Institute of Paris having received minutes
of   the eight first sittings            of    the Institute       of Cairo, they were
 read to the three classes              in their fittings of the 26th, 27th,
 and 28th       of Frimaire.
    The Institute of Cairo, formed by Bonaparte after the mo

Aului Gclliut. A         woman of a respectable          character Drought forth a child
in the eleventh month after the            death  pf her husband.          The woman was
accused    of having violated her chastity           ; but the emperor        Adrian, under
whose reign the affair happened, decreed that it was possible for pregnancy
to be extended to that period.              The following        are   the author's words :

     The objects with which the Institute will            be occupied are      :
 j.   The propagation of knowledge in Egypt.                 2. Researches
 into the natural history, industry and history of Egypt.                The
 Institute, which meets on the first and sixth of every decade,
 held its first sitting on the 6th of Fructidor,               An. VI.    In
 this fitting Monge was appointed president,                and Bonaparte
vice-president.         General      Bonaparte then proposed         the   six
 following questions       : *. Are the ovens employed for baking
ammunition        bread capable       of any improvement in       regard to
the expence      of fuel, and what       are these improvements        ?
     2. Does Egypt furnish any thing which can be substituted
for hops in the brewing of beer ?
     3. What are the best means to cool and purify the water
of the Nile ?
     4.   In the   present    state   of things    at Cairo, whether        is
it most      convenient to construct a wind-mill or                a  water-
mill    ?
    5. Does Egypt furnisti resources           for manufacturing gun
powder, and what are these resources            ?
     6.   What   is the   state   of jurisprudence, of judiciary order
civil and criminal,       and    of education in Egypt        ? What im
provements are possible in these departments, and wished for
by the natives      ?
                      Second Sitting,     FruBidor    11.
     C'. Andreofli     made a report on the fifth question proposed
                                                                          by

                                   the Institute at Cairo.                                             42?
by Bonaparte in the preceding                       sitting.        He       first observed, that
Egypt does not furnish sulphur, and that this article was
formerly procured from Venice.  The Commission were of
opinion that it might be procured from Sicily. The charcoal
employed in Egypt is from the lupine, which is burnt in
trenches        and afterwards            sifted.     The          saltpetre is indigenous ;
and it is even said that veins                      of it      are found in the neigh
bourhood of Cairo              :   it is manufactured in the fame manner
as   in Europe.          It   is there in the state                 of   a real nitrat            of   pot
ash, and not          of lime,      as   in France       : .   it is baked with the straw
of Turkey corn, and purified with the white of an egg. Gun
powder is manufactured with the hand, and the workmen
labour quite naked. Each mortar contains fifteen pounds,
and it is pounded              for     seven    hours.             The       pestles weigh from
nineteen to twenty-five pounds each.                                      The       wages         of    the
workmen             are from twenty to twenty-five paras                                  :   they add
water to        it,   and to granulate the powder                             it   is   sifted.        This
powder         is   excellent, and cheaper than that made in France.
The inhabitants manufactured 2000 cantars annually, great                                         a
deal of which was exported to Leghorn.   The beys had very
little powder. Mourad-bey had no more than 1500 cantars.
This manufactory might with care be easily increased, and
considerable          quantities of gun-powder                           might be sent from
Egypt to Europe.
      Cit. Monge         read      a     memoir on that optical phenomenon
called         by   the French sailors mirage.
     It   often happens            at sea, that      a   (hip        seen at       a     distance ap
                     painted in the sky, and not to be supported                                   by
               A if
 pears as                                                          the
water.                similar effect was observed    the French in the   by
 course    of their march through                   the Desert           :    the villages seen at
a    distance seemed to be built on an island                                 in   the middle           of   a
 lake.         In proportion             as they approached,                   the apparent sur
 face     of   the water became narrower             when they were only at
                                                               ;
a    small distance,          it   disappeared, and the same illusion began,
 in   regard to the next village.                    C. Monge ascribes this effect
 to   a   diminution of the density                  of the lower stratum of the at
                                                                                              mosphere.

428                                     Proceedings         of
mosphere.          This diminution               in the Desert is produced                br
the increase       of     heat arising from that communicated by the
rays of the fun to the sand with which this stratum is in im
mediate contact.               At
                         it takes place when, by particular
                                    sea
circumstances, such as the action of the wind, the lower
stratum      of   the atmosphere            holds in solution             a greater quan
tity of water than the other strata. In this state of things
the rays of light, which come from the lower parts of the
heavens,      having arrived at the surface that separates the                           less
dense stratum         from those above                it,   do not pass through that
stratum, but are reflected,                  and paint in the eye of the ob
server an image           of   the heavens, which        appearing to him to
be below the horizon, he takes                   it       for water, when the pheno
menon occurs at land.                    If he   is       at sea, he thinks he fees         in
the heavens         all    the objects which float on that part                       of the
surface occupied           by    the image           of   the heavens.
                          Third Silting,             FruSlUor       16.
     C. Berthollct        read   a   memoir on the formation                   of ammo
nia under several circumstances                           where the existence          of   it
has not hitherto been supposed.
   C. Sulkowfky read description of the route
                                    a                                         from Cairo
to Salehie.  The route which the French army                                  followed      in
pursuing Ibrahim Bey had been before unknown.       Thofe
who proceed from Cairo                      by
                         the gate of Nasr first enter the
Desert where there arc                  a   great     many houses now deserted.
The village of Elmalarie, which    found on this route, w*»
                                                      is
the ancient Ileliopolis.  In another village called Elmare
there are thousands of palm trees. To the right of this route
there   is   nothing except sandy deserts                    ;    but on the left there
is   abundance      of    cultivated        land.         The places through »hich
the arniy     passed were Lacoubey, Elhanca,                         Elmenii, Belbcys,
Souva, Coraini, Salehie, and                     a   great manv others, »hich               it
only traversed in the course of                  a    rapid march.
     C. Berthollct communicated                      the result     of his cjumlnatioa
of   the gun-powder found                 in   the castle        of Cairo.     This    pow
                                                                                         der

                            the Institute at Cairo.                          439
der contained only          -,1,-  (2 J ounces     per pound)     of saltpetre;
the   rest was    sulphur, charcoal, earth, and            muriatof soda.
    C. Monge        read a memoir           on some ancient monuments
found at Cairo.           We learn by this memoir              :  1.  That   at a
place called the Sazar, in a recess inclosed by a grate situated
in the. street conducting from               the building where the Insti
tute sits to the castle of Cairo,             there was a granite vase, co
vered with        hieroglyphics         both within and without.            This
 vase had some resemblance               to one found in the great mosque
 at Alexandria, but the dimension of the hieroglyphics was
 larger.     C. Monge         requested      that   the Institute would      take
 the necessary measures             to get this monument removed              to a
 proper place, till an opportunity could be found offending it to
 France,       a. That in the castle of Cairo, after having passed
 the place called Joseph's Castle, there was a door-threshold,
 formed of       a  fragment of a polislied obelisk of basaltes, the
 hieroglyphics of which were in good preservation. C. Monge
  made a similar request in regard to this monument.
     C. Monge         presented       to the   assembly a specimen        of the
  stone employed         for the      mason-work of the castle of Cairo.
  This   stone i9     of  the fame nature as the rock on which                 the
  castle is built, and is composed            of  that shell called numifmal,
  because it resembles            small   pieces   of money.      These shells
  may be easily split        in the direction of their thickness.               In
  the inside     of them      is seen a delicate spiral, which, at differ
  ent points     of   its course, divides itself into several branches.
  This    spiral   served    as a lodging for the animal which              con
  structed the sliell.         The old walls of Laon, in             the depart
   ment of Aisne, are of           a composition perfectly similar.
                         Fourth Sitting, FruftiJor 21.
       C. Sulkowsky informed his colleagues that                   he had      ob
   served a bust of Isis on the banks of the Nile                 near Tcrane,
   and two stones with hieroglyphics in                 a garden   of   the  fame
   village.      He    requested       that  they might be transported           to
"
   Cairo, and deposited in the place where the Institute met.
                                                                     C. Geoffrov

     C.    Geoffroy read a memoir,               from which             it results that
the ostrich exhibits only the rudiments of that organisation
necessary for flying.           All    the apparent    instruments of flying
in   that bird arc constructed              in such a manner as to preclude
the possibility     of it.     Extent of wing and consistence of fea
thers are not the only things wanting.                            It   is not provided
with muscles sufficient           to raise it and support                it in the air,
and its air vesicles are         of   less size      than those found in other
birds.
                        Fifth Sitting, Fruclidor 26.
     A    commission     having been appointed to make                     a report     on
the fuel most advantageous to be used for heating the camp-
ovens, and on the means to reduce the consumption,                                C. H.
Say presented that report, the result of which was, that the
stalks of the carthannis or fafranum, reeds, and the straw of
maize, would furnish            a sufficiency        of     fuel to heat the ovens,
and at a moderate         ex pence.
     C. Bonaparte       presented to the Institute a copy                  of   the   C«-
nqifsance des Temps for the year                 VII
                                    ; and invited the Insti
tute to employ themselves in the formation of an almanack.
C. Monge, Nouet, Dom Raphael,                               and    Beauchanip         were
charged        with, this object.. This almanack was to compre
hend      a   triple division of time according to the custom of the
French, that of the Cophts, and that of the Mussulmans.
     C. Fourier     read a memoir on the general solution                       of alge
braic equations.
     C.   Parsevalread       a translation       of a fragment of          Tasso taken
from the 17th canto.
     C.   Desgenettes     read some observations                  on various     diseases
which ill-informedpersons might confound with the plague,
and from which he proved them to be very different.
                Sixth Sitting,        \Jl   Corns,    Diiy, Ytar 11.
     C. Bcauchamp         presented         a   sliort calendar,         which might
be immediately printed             for the       use   of    the army.          This ca
lendar contained the old and the new division                            of time.       C.
                                                                          Bcauchamp

                        the Institute    at Cairo.                      43 1
Beauchamp communicated also several astronomical observa
tions, which are to be published in the Memoirs of the In*
siitute.
    C. Berthollet   read a letter addressed       to him by    C. Laplace,
member of the French National Institute.                   That geometri
cian recommended         to him     to 'make      observations    of the oc-
cultations of     the stars   by the     moon.       The    fame    member
gave an account also       of  the processes employed         in Egypt for
making indigo.         They    are exceedingly       simple, but imper
fect.    It  appeared,    however,      that    by means of some slight
changes the quality      of this   article might be much improved.
    C. Fourier    read a note     on the plan       of  a  machine moved
by wind, which might          be employed       for watering land.      The

             Seventh Sitting, Vendemiairc           6, An.   VII.
    C. Norry    read a memoir concerning the column                 of Alex
andria called Pompey's Pillar, in which he gave the dimen
sions of the principal parts of that monument.                  On this oc
casion   C. Dolomicu      offered an opinion respecting           the period
when this column was erected,              according to which it ought
 to be referred to the age that followed the reign              of Constan-
tine.    The chapiter      and pedestal        exhibit    the character    of
degradation, which         distinguishes      the   architecture of that
 time  ;  but the sliaft    seems     to belong to an earlier period,
when that art still retained all its purity.
    C. Savigny     read a memoir on a new species              of nympha.
 The author     gave an account         of  the characters      common to

 mission composed       of C. Dcnon,          Rigcl, Dutertre, Redoute,

    C. Beauchamp       read a memoir on his voyage              from Con
stantinople to Trebisonde.
    C. Deli fie  read a memoir         on the palm which          bears   the
fruit called domm.       It is  the cuffiopbora     of Thcophraitus.
    C. Dolomieu read a memoir, in which he shewed the ne
cessity of studying ancient geography and geology. He sixes the
site of the ancient Alexandria'       between two hills    of fandv   calca
reous stone.     He   explained    the successive    changes which that
city experienced,      and is    of opinion, that      the  sea   must have
risen a soot since the,   time of Ptolemy.
    The   above pieces when delivered were accompanied                bv the

    This journal    is published    every tenth day.        Each number
consists of fvvo    sheets and a     half   octavo,   and   costs 20 sou*
French     money, or     10   francs for 12 numbers.               Subscrip
tion     received   by C. Marc-Aurcle, printer to                the  army,
French quarter       at Cairo.      It was accompanied            by a pro
spectus    announcing that this journal would be merely lite
rary ; that no intelligence or political discussions would be
admitted    ;  but that every thing relating to the arts and sci
ences, commerce, both in a general and particular point of
view, civil and criminal legislation, moral and religiou* in
stitutions, would     be thankfully received.

             COATING FOR GLASS RETORTS, &C.
    Professor   Wurzer      at Bonn, in a letter to Professor    Gbtling
f Jena,    says :
                    "  It is not merely economy that makes us de
sirous   of obtaining     good coating for glass apparatus,     but be
cause the labour bestowed on many processes is often ren
dered entirely useless by the vessel not being able to stand the
necessary degree      of  heat.    As  circumstances    during  a certain
time prevented       me from obtaining         new glass apparatus,       I
made various trials to supply that deficiency, and found the
following coating of the greatest service.            I look fragments
 of porcelain coarsely pulverised and well sifted, and as much
pure clay, which I previously softened with           as much of     a sa
 turated solution     of muriat of   soda as was requisite    to give the
 whole the proper consistence,            and  then  proceeded     in the
 usual manner.      My    glasses," adds Professor   Wurzer, "which
 arc coated    with this     substance, often   stand an incredible de»
 gree   of heat without breaking."
                      FREEZING OF MERCURY.
     The    severe   cold which was experienced          in   London     at
 Christmas       afforded     an opportunity     to Mr.   Pepys   junior,
 and several other able chemists, to repeat the experiments
 of Mr. Lowitz, of Peterfburgh, on the production of ex
  traordinary cold. The result confirmed the truth of them.
 When       the thermometer was at 17 of Fahr. a mixture of
  snow and muriat of lime produced such a degree of cold as
  to freeze   a  quantity of mercury in        a few  minutes.      It  was
  then malleable, and, when broken, exhibited            a fracture simi
  lar to that of zink.
     At   the fame time the chemists         in Paris were occupied in
  repeating    Lowitz'i experiments.           C. Fourcroy     and    V'au-
  quelin by means        of  the fame mixture froze twenty pounds ot
  mercury in a platina crucible in thirty seconds:            mercury in
     Vol, II,                         Fs                            apor.

 434                   Mw     Voyaget   of Discovery.
  a porcelain crucible took four times as long to freeze.            Upon
 inserting the end of the singer in the mixture, it lost, in four
 seconds, all feeling, and was not restored to sensation till after
 it had been held a long time         in the mouth.         Upon the first
 insertion  of  the  finger  in  the mixture,    an   acute  pain was felt,
 as if it had been violently pressed in a vice.
    1 he extreme cold by our accounts from the Continent
 was very general over Europe.
                 NEW VOYAGES OF DISCOVERT.
    The French Government              have    in contemplation a new
voyage    of  discovery    round the world, under the direction of
 Captain Baudin,         who lately returned from a botanical          ex
pedition to America.           Three corvettes, le Vengevr, la Str-
fente, and la Menacante, are fitted out for this purpose, and
will  sail as soon as pastes can        be procured      from the British
Ministry. They          are to proceed    first to Tenerifle, for the
purpose    of  collecting plants,     and   thence along the coast of
Africa to the Cape of Good Hope. They are then to fail
along the eastern side of Africa, from which one of the cor
vettes is to be sent back to Francewith            the plants, that they
may not be spoiled by        a  longer voyage.       'J he other two cor
vettes   will then    proceed     to New Holland,        to make geogra
phical observations       on the unknown parts of that island             ;
and afterwards     visit the   coast of Peru, Chili,       8cc. and parti
cularly the river      La Plata, which they        are to fail up a* far
as they possibly can.
