            I. Further Studies on Molecular Force.
                   By WILLIAM SUTHERLAND".
IN     two recent papers on the Attraction of Unlike Mole
     cules the result has been established, that if two molecules
of mass m1 attract one another with a force 31A1 mi°/r", and
two of mass m2 with a force 32A2 m,"/r", then an m, attracts
an m, with a force 3(A12A)'mimg/r"; from which it follows
that Am" is resolvable into two factors A'm each belong
ing to a molecule. Now in the “Laws of Molecular Force”
 (Phil. Mag. xxxv., March 1893), values of M*l, which is
proportional to Am", are given for a large number of sub
stances as determined by five methods, so that it is only
necessary to take the square roots of the tabulated values of
M°l to get relative values of Alm. Indeed, in originally study
ing the values of M*l, the first step I took was to examine   #.
values of (M'l)"; and I noticed the reign of law amongst
them, but apparently not over so wide a range of values as
was dominated by the empirical law M*l=6S + 66S*, where
 S is the sum of certain constants characteristic of the atoms
 in the molecule, and called the Dynic Equivalents of the
 atoms. Accordingly this empirical expression was adopted
in the “Laws of Molecular Force.” Yet even this expression
 failed to apply to the simpler typical compounds; but in
 connexion with the values of (M’l)* I have discovered that
 there are two principles in operation amongst them, one

2                Mr. William Sutherland on the
''         to the serial compounds of carbon, and the other to
the simpler compounds such as those of inorganic chemist 2
The advantage of the empirical expression M'l-6S+66
was that it happened to lend itself to some of the transition
cases which occur between the two classes.        But now it is
clearly our duty to set aside the empirical law, and confine
our attention to (MPI) proportional to A'm. The following
is a brief statement of the order in which these further studies
will be taken, and of their results.
   1. Values of (M’l) in the carbon compounds, with deter
mination of the parts contributed to them by various atoms
and radicals, and proof that in the non-metallic atoms these
parts are approximately proportional to the volumes of the
atoms.
   2. (a) and (b).     Development of two methods of deter
mining (M'l) for inorganic compounds, especially compounds
of the metals, tabulation of the results of the methods, with
proof that valency controls the magnitude of molecular force
in these compounds. (For example, if RS, is a compound of
a metal R of valency n with n atoms of S, then (M*l) for
RS, is the sum of a value for R and n times a value for S,
all divided by the square root of n.)
   3. Determination of (MP) for the uncombined metals, with
proof that in the main chemical families (M*l) for each atom
is proportional to the square root of the volume of the atom
and also to the square root of its valency. Relation between
the volumes of the metallic atoms in combination and the
parts contributed by them to (M’l)” in their compounds.
   4. General summary of results, and analysis of molecular
attraction into the sum of atomic attractions, with general
statement of their laws.
        1. Values of (M'l) in the Carbon Compounds.
   To begin with, the law of the Dynic Equivalents remains
unchanged, for the dynic equivalent of an atom being the
number of CH2 groups which would contribute as much to
the value of M*l for a molecule as the atom does, it remains
the same for (MPI) as for M'l. This will appear in all the
values of (M*l) that follow. From Table XXV. of the Laws
of Molecular Force we get the following values of (M'l)'oc A'm
for the paraffins:—
              C.H.       C.H.     C. His.    Clo H.
               3.8        7.7       9.5       11.2

                                 Laws of Molecular Force.                                  3
 The difference for each CH2 group is 97 from C. He to C.H14,
 •90 from          C6H14        to    Cs His,      and '85 from       Cs His    to   C10H23.
 There appears to be a progressive diminution in these differ
 ences for CH2. It will be of advantage, therefore, to study
 a more extended series, such as is given on page 266 of the
 “Laws of Molecular Force” for the paraffins from C.His
 to C18H34, the values of M*l being got, as there explained,
from Bartoli and Stracciati’s surface-tensions at 11°C.                                   To
complete the series we can obtain approximate values of M*l
for C3H8 and C, Hio by the approximate relation Ml- 1190 v1T,
given on page 247 of the “Laws of Molecular Force,” dividing
 by 10" to reduce to the same units as are employed in
 table xxv. T., is the boiling-point measured from absolute
zero, and v, is the volume of a gramme at the boiling-point :
for C.Hs, T = 246 and v1=1-75; and for C.H10, T =274 and
v1=1-71; and thus the values of M*l to go along with the rest
are 22:1 and 32.3; and for (MPI) we have the series of values
and differences:

    Here, although the values of the differences for CH, are
unsteady (doubtless on account of the difficulty of preparing
the paraffins pure), there is on the whole a progressive dimi
nution in the value of the difference: thus from C2H6 to C#His
the difference is 5:7, and from C8H18 to C14Hso it is 5'2 But
in the case of the esters from C3H6O2 to C10H2002, to which
we proceed, there is no such diminution. The following are
the mean values of (M'l) for the different isomers under each
formula :—

       This scheme embodies the principle of the Dynic Equiva
   lents, for an atom such as I is represented as producing the

                     Laws of Molecular Force.                  5
same effect on the value of (MP)' whatever may be the number
of CH2 groups it is associated with. In the “Laws of Mole
cular Force” it was shown that there is a striking parallelism
between the values of the dynic equivalents of the atoms and
of their refraction equivalents. I had a strong impression
that this must be due to the fact that both quantities were
nearly proportional to the volumes of the atoms, but was not
then able to test the idea through lack of values of the volumes
of the atoms. But by means of the characteristic equation for
liquids given in that paper, and an unpublished simplified
form of it, I have been able to get approximate values of the
limiting volumes of the members of a number of series of
compounds. Let & be the limiting volume of a gramme of
substance of molecular mass (weight) M.; then the differences
in M8 for a difference CH2 in composition are as follows:—
paraffins 15:7, alkyl iodides 16:4, alkyl bromides 17, alkyl
chlorides 16, alkyl oxides 17.3, alkyl amines 17-3, esters 17.5,
and benzene series 16:8.      The values of MS for the lowest
available members of these series are CH, 25, CH3I 52,
CH:Br 46, C.H.Cl 55.5, (C2H5)2O 83, NH3 20, C3H6O2 64,
and C.H. 75'5; so that for M8 we have the scheme given
above with (M*l)*.
    The following are the few data on which the numbers in
the scheme for the nitriles, sulphides, nitro-compounds,
nitrates, and sulphocyanates are founded, on the assumption
that in (M’l) CH, has a value 9 and in M8 approximately 17.

    In Table IV. there are no values given for the olefine
series C, H2n; but the data for the olefines in table xxv. of
the “Laws of Molecular Force” show that (MPI) for C.H., is
practically identical with that for C, H2n+2. On this account
the dynic equivalent of the two terminal hydrogens of a
paraffin C, H2n+2 was, in the “Laws of Molecular Force,” said
to be negligible; but the better mode of expression in accord
ance with the usages of physical chemistry would be to say
that the double-bonded union of two carbon atoms in an
olefine changes the dynic equivalent of the two carbon atoms
 by an amount equal to that of the two terminal hydrogen
atoms of the paraffin. The first point to be noticed about the
expressions for (M'l)” in Table IV. is that in the paraffins the

6                 Mr. William Sutherland on the
two terminal hydrogen atoms H+H are apparently repre
sented by an initial term 2:2, which is more than twice as
large as the value 9 for CH2; while in the M6 expression
for the paraffins the term 9 which represents the volume of
H+H is only about half of the 15-7 for CH3. Associated
with this peculiarity of the paraffins, there must be taken
another, namely, that methane, CH, while chemically the
first of the paraffins, separates itself absolutely from the series
as regards molecular force, but not as regards M8. In respect
of molecular force it behaves as an element, as is shown in the
“Laws of Molecular Force,” and in the “Wiscosity of Gases
and Molecular Force” (Phil. Mag. Dec. 1893); and its value
of (M’l)', namely 1:5, is only a half of the 3:1 which it would
be if it came within the scheme for the paraffins in Table IV.
Thus it appears to be necessary for at least two CH2 groups
to be associated before each takes its characteristic value in
(M'l)"; and this must be connected with the series-building
power of carbon.      It should be noticed that the value of CH2
in (M'.) depends only slightly on the mode of association of
the carbon and hydrogen atoms according to the usual
structural formulas, because isomeric substances have almost
always nearly equal values; thus, according to the equation
Ml=1190 x 10"viT, as vi varies very slightly from one
isomer to another, we see that amongst isomers (M'l) varies
nearly as the square root of the boiling-point. Take pentane,
C5H1, as an instance: for normal pentane,         C#
the boiling-point is 38°C., while for tetramethylmethane,
C(CH3), it is 9°5 C.; so that (M*l)” for the latter is
 (282.5/311)', or '953 times that for the former, which,
according to the scheme, is 6:7; and, accordingly, there is
only a difference of 3, corresponding to the great difference
in structure attributed to these two pentanes. Thus it is not
the position of the two terminal H atoms in the paraffins that
determines their apparent large value of 2:2; and provi
sionally we have to recognize two values for I'H' One
 being 2:2, and the other a fraction of 9, and must leave the
 hydrogen atom to be returned to after we have considered
 some others.
    In the alkyl haloid compounds we must regard the halogen
 atom as displacing one of these terminal           atoms, for the
 value of each CH2 group in (M'l) still remains the same.
 Hence if we assume that the one terminal H left has a value
 1:1 in (M'.) and 4.5 in MS, we can calculate at once from
 the schemes in Table IV, the values of the halogen atoms in

                         Laws of Molecular Force.                              7
(M’l)', and also the limiting volumes of the atoms, and
similarly with the other atoms and radicals involved in
Table IV. : for instance, in that Table Cl-|-H has a value 3.3,
whence that of Cl is 2:2; so in M8 the volume of Cl-H H is
23:5, so that the volume of Cl is 19. In this way have
been derived from Table IV. the values now given in Table VI.
for the parts contributed to (MP) and M8 by various atoms
and radicals, which after this will sometimes be denoted by
the symbols F and B: in the third row of numbers are given
the values of the ratio B/F.

   For the first ten atoms and radicals the approach in the ratio
to constancy is close enough to show that F is nearly pro
portional to B, or that attracting-power in these atoms is
nearly proportional to the volume of the atom; the mean
value of the ratio for the first ten is 10, of which the value
for CH2 is nearly double, and that for the terminal H of
paraffins less than half; the value for NH3 will be considered
£               along with those of some other compounds of
   drogen. It would appear from the values for NO2, NO3,
CN, and CNS, that the value for N of F is 1:7, and of B is
about 15.
   It will be useful at this stage to consider the values of
(M*l) and M8 in those inorganic compounds for which they
are obtainable from table xxv. of the “Laws of Molecular
Force.”

8                 Mr. William Sutherland on the
   For the first six compounds the ratio is the same as the
average in the last Table; but in H2S, H2O, and NH3 it
falls to a lower value, the reason for which appears to be the
presence of the H atoms operating like the two terminal H
atoms in the paraffins. To see whether this is the case, let
us suppose S, O, and N carry the values already found for
them into (M*l) and M8, then we get for
          B .............. #. "J's H. #9.        Ha # NH.
          F .................. 1.6      1.9         1-2
           B/F ............... 4.4      4-7         5:0
In each case the ratio comes near to the value 4 found for
the terminal H in the paraffins; though both in (MPI) and
M6, Hà in NH3 appears smaller than H2 in H2S, H2O, or the
paraffins.
   Returning to the values of the ratio in Table VII., the
values for the compounds of P and As seem also to come near
to the value 10; but this has no particular significance, as
we shall see later on that a different principle is at work
amongst some of these compounds; even at present we can
see that (MP) for PCls has a value 6.6, which is exactly three
times the value adopted for Cl, leaving nothing for P; and
when we turn to the value for CCl4, namely 6:8, which is a
good deal less than that for 4Cl, we must recognize clearly
that we are getting into a type of compound in which the
pure additive principle ruling in the carbon series no longer
applies. Of course, in connexion with CCI, it may be said
that it might be expected to be exceptional because CH, is so;
but then CH2Cl and CH3I are not exceptional, a fact well
worthy of attention in view of the exceptional nature of CH4.
Indeed, if we take the series of ratios 9 for Cl, 12 for
CHCl2, and 12 for CC1, with 13 for SiCl, and 13 for SnCl4,
we see an increasing departure from proportionality between
(M’l)" and volume M8, which will become comprehensible
when we have dealt with inorganic compounds as a whole.
An attempt to trace the intermediate cases, such as that of
CHCls, would lead us into too much detail, though promising
light on the great old controversy in chemistry between the
dualistic and unitary theorists and on the transition from
electrolyte to non-electrolyte.
   But without going into transition cases, there are a few
more values which we ought to discuss before leaving the
carbon serial compounds, as they bear upon the large value
of F which belongs to the H atom when apart from the

                           Laws of Molecular Force.                            9
radicals CH, and NH3. The values of (M'l) for benzene and
its monohalogen substitution compounds are :

which give for Cl–H the value 1.0, for Br–H 1-6, and for
I-H 24; and these, with the values found for the halogens,
give for H in benzene the values 1:2, '9, and ’8, the mean of
which is 1-0; still a large value and nearly equal to the 1:1
belonging to each CH in benzene, which, it should be noticed,
is larger than the 9 for CH2. Strictly speaking, all that the
last numbers really show is that the difference between the
halogens and hydrogen in benzene is about the same as the
difference between the halogens and the terminal hydrogen
in paraffins. The following values form the beginning of a
series which, if extended, would illustrate the transition from
one type to the other:—
                              C.H.g.     C.H.Cl.        C.H.Cla.       C.H.Cla.
    (M*)*..................     4-0          5:1           6.7            7.6
They give Cl–H=1:1, 2(Cl–H)=2.7, and 3(Cl–H)=3.6,
which are in fair enough agreement. In the following cases
we have only CH2 groups and halogens.
    we.'"                                 on "..       c.',           e."
    (M'.)".....................   6-7         7.5           7.1            7.8
With 9 for CH, in (MPI)", these give for Cl the values 2:45
and 24, and for Br 2.65 and 2:55, which are a little larger
than those adopted from the series, namely 2.2 and 2.5.
   The data of table xxv. of the “Laws of Molecular Force”
furnish values of (MP) for the elements H, O, and N, and
for CH4, which are gathered into

   To these may be added an uncertain set of values for Cl2,
namely M8=34 and (M°l)'=24, their ratio being 14;
excepting this, we see that the element gases and CH4 have
nearly a constant value 18 for the ratio M6/(M'l)', a value
which is nearly double the 10 for atoms in the combined
state.     It should be noticed that the ratio 19 for CH2 in the
carbon series ranges itself along with the values for the

 10              Mr. William Sutherland on the
 elements and CH4. It is very remarkable that as regards
 molecular force, CH, not only detaches itself so completely
 from the paraffins and compounds in general, but also attaches
itself so consistently to the elements. It is interesting to find
 C2H4, which is the first of the olefines, detach itself from its
 class; in the “Laws of Molecular Force” it was proved to
have a characteristic equation intermediate in form to those
 for elements and compounds. It has already been pointed
out that the olefine CnH2n has the same value of (M2i), as     the
paraffin C, H2n+2; but this does not apply to C2H4, because
instead of the 4-0 for C, H, it has the value 2.5 for (M’l)', and
 for MS it has 43, which is much larger than the 34 of two
ordinary CH2 groups; the ratio M8/(M*l) is 17, which goes
with the values found for CH, and CH4.
   The case of the elements will be returned to when the
 methods of getting further data have been developed in the
 following parts of this paper.
    To close for the present the discussion of the carbon serial
 compounds, the main result had better be restated, as it has
perhaps been obscured by foreign details; it is embodied
briefly in Table IV., and is this, that the attracting-power of
a molecule is the sum of powers belonging to its atoms, the
power of an atom varying with its chemical function, but
remaining constant when that function is constant. As a
subsidiary result, it has been shown that the attracting
powers of the atoms of Cl, Br, I, O, S, N, and C (C unattached
to H) are approximately proportional to their volumes in the
 combined state.
   2. (a) and (b). Methods of finding M*l for Compounds of
                     the Metals, with Results.
   (a) While we are on the present line of investigation, it
will be convenient to consider such values (relative) of the
parameter of molecular force, that is of (M'l)', as are ob
tainable for solids, both element and compound. These can
be got in two ways: first, from the surface-tension of the
solids at their melting-points, which are still measurements
made on liquids, but at the transition-point into solidity; and
second, from the principles of “A Kinetic Theory of Solids.”
(Phil. Mag. vol. xxxii.). According to the “Laws of Mole
cular Force” (Phil. Mag. March 1893, p. 258), l in terms of
the 10" dynes as unit of force is given by
                        l=2x5930av'M',
where a is the surface-tension in grammes weight per metre

                     Laws of Molecular Force.                  11
at # of the absolute critical temperature, which is near the
ordinary boiling-point, v is the volume of unit mass at the
same temperature, and M the ordinary molecular mass
(weight); so that with the megamegadyne (10” dynes) as
the unit of force, we have
                  M’l=2x5930 x 10"a(M/p)*.          . . . (1)
    In the case of melted solids a has been measured at the
melting-point only; and as the absolute melting-point of
solids is not a constant fraction of their absolute boiling
points, we shall have to be content with comparatively rough
 approximations to the values of M*l, if in the above equation
 (1) we use the value of a at the melting-point instead of that
 at 3 of the critical temperature. In the case of mercury the
 surface-tension at the melting-point has been found by
 Quincke to be 58.8 grammes weight per metre; and I have
 estimated that at the boiling-point, if mercury behaves as an
 ordinary liquid, the surface-tension would be 42-6. Then, to
 keep the values of M*l in a rough way more comparable with
 those hitherto discussed, we will for all the melted solids take
 a at 3 of the critical temperature as roughly given by
 42.6/58.8 times its value at the melting-point; denoting
 which by am, we have, when we likewise allow for the differ
 ence between p at the melting-point and at # of the critical
 temperature by a factor 1:09, the equation
    M*l=2x5930 x 10-"x:723 x 1-092,(M/p);
                          =9346 x 10-"a,(M/p)*. . . . (2)
    To preserve continuity in the work this equation will be
 applied first to compounds only, and later on to the metals.
 It is to Quincke that we owe the first measurements of the
 surface-tensions of a number of elements and compounds at
 their melting-points (Pogg. Ann. cxxxv. & cxxxviii.); and
 there are some more recent measurements for a number of
 compounds by Traube (Ber. der Deut. chem. Ges. xxiv.
 p. 3074). The values of the surface-tension given by Quincke
 in his second paper are brought into better agreement with
 those of his first and with Traube's when multiplied by 14,
 and accordingly these values multiplied by 1.4 are entered
 in brackets in the following Table as values of a, and the
 numbers derived from them are put in brackets also. The
 density at 15°C. will be used in place of that at the melting
 point, because too few values at the melting-point are known,
 and the difference between the two is really immaterial in
 comparison with other unavoidable roughnesses in these cal
 culations. The formula by which Quincke calculated a from

his experimental data is not exact (see Worthington, Proc.
Roy. Soc. xxxii.); but his values have been taken as exact
enough for present purposes. The first set of data for all the
K and Na compounds are Traube's, the rest are Quincke's.

   The first point to attend to in these numbers is to ascertain
whether the additive principle applies to the values of (M*l)".
The differences for K and Na are 1.2 in the chlorides, 9 in the
bromides, 1:2 in the nitrates, 1:1 in the nitrites, 1:1 in the
chlorates, 1.1 in the cyanides, of which the mean is 1:1. This
is encouraging enough if we remember the roughnesses of
calculation and experiment. Proceeding to take the differ
ences for the compounds of the dibasic acids, we get for
K2-Na2 1.9 in the carbonates, 1:8 in the sulphates, 1.4 in the
chromates, 1.9 in the bichromates, and 1.6 in the metaphos
phates, the mean of which is 1:72, which is less than twice the
mean 1-1 for K-Na.                                     It will be shown later that in a com
pound RS, where for instance R represents an n-basic acid
and S a monad metal, (M*l)*= (F, + nF.)/n}, where F. and F.
are the parts due to R and S : according to this principle the
value of Ka-Na in the above compounds ought to be only
23 or 1:41 times the value for K+Nal; while according to
the mean values found above, K2-Na2 is 1.6 times K–Na.
In view of the relation for RS,
                                                (MP)+/n3 = F/n+F.,
the best plan is to take values of (M*l)}/n} which are the sums
of F./n and F, or the sum of parts not due to atoms but to

14                 Mr. William Sutherland on the
equivalents. In the case of the K and Na compounds of the
dibasic acids in Table IX., we will reduce the value of (MP)*
to that for equivalents not by dividing by the theoretical 2*
but by the empirical 1.6: for convenience the value of (M’l)*
thus reduced to the value for equivalents will be denoted by
2F, the relation between the two being as a rule
                          XF =(M'l)/n},
though in the present case we are taking 1.6 in place of 2*
in order to allow for a slight difference in equation (2) as
applied to the compounds of the dibasic acids; so also in
Na, P.O; 1.6 v2 will be used instead of 4*.

   Thus the additive principle holds throughout the values of
(M*l) in Table IX, for the K and Na compounds of the
monobasic acids, and in Table X. for equivalents of their
compounds with dibasic acids; and if we knew the values of
F for K and Na, we could at once obtain the values for the
other atoms and radicals and equivalents involved. We
might adopt the values already found for F for the halogens
in the organic compounds, but seeing that we do not know
yet how far the absolute values given by equation (2) are to
be relied on, the following process is safer. From the
potassium compounds we get that in (M*l), Cl–F–1.2,
Br–F=1:8, and I-F=2:7; while in the molecular volumes
M/p, which in solids is very nearly the same as M8, we have
Cl–F=13.9, Br–F=20:5, and I-F=30.1; or, using mean
values obtainable from data for the haloid compounds of
Li, Na, K, and Rb given later on in Table XIII. from C. W.
Clarke (Phil. Mag. ser. 5, iii.), we have Cl–F–10:3,
Br–F=16:7, and I-F=26:8. It will be seen that these
two series of differences in M/p are about ten times the cor
responding differences in (M°l)', and 10 was the value that
we found for the ratio of B the atomic volume to F for the
halogens in organic compounds : thus then it happens that
equation (2), in spite of the roughnesses in it, gives values of

                      Laws of Molecular Force.                  15
F for the halogens in harmony with those already found.
Accordingly we could adopt for F for the halogens in inorganic
compounds the values found in the organic, but it seems to
me preferable to work out the results for inorganic compounds
on their own basis.      To do so we need the atomic volume of
fluorine F. Now from the studies made by many chemists
on the molecular domains (so-called volumes) of liquids at
their boiling-points there have been found values carried
by the individual atoms into the molecule, and for the halogens
Thorpe (Journ. Chem. Soc. 1880) gives the values F=9:2,
Cl=22:7, Br=281, and I=36'6, whence for comparison
with our series of differences for the solid state we get
Cl–F=13:5, Br–F=18.9, and I-F=27.4, which is
curiously close to identity with our series, and indicates that
we may take 9 as the atomic volume of F, so that with
Clarke's differences given above we have in round numbers
the following atomic volumes:—F=9, Cl=19, Br=26, and
I=36, to be compared with the former Cl=19, Br=24.5,
and I=32 (Table V.). Accordingly the part contributed by
the fluorine atom to (MPI) is about 9; and with the series of
differences given above we have the series of parts carried by
the halogen atoms into (M°l)', namely:
            F=-9, Cl=2.1, Br=2.7, and I=3.6
to be compared with
                     Cl=2.2, Br=2:5, and I=3:2 in Table V.
With the above atomic volumes of the halogens and Clarke's
molecular volumes of the K and Na haloid compounds given
later on in Table XIII., we get the following mean atomic
 volumes, Na=7:4 and K= 18.6; and with the above values
 of F for the halogens, we get from Table IX. that the mean
 value of F for Na is 3-1 and for K is 4.2. With these values
 of atomic volume and F for Na and K, we can derive from
Tables IX. and X. the volumes of a number of negative
radicals and their values of F when they are monobasic, of
 F/2 when dibasic, and of F/4 when tetrabasic. These are
 given in the next table.

    The values added in brackets in the last table are          ''
from Table VI. for purposes of comparison, and show that
according to our methods of calculation, for the inorganic
compounds the values of F come out about 1:1 times their
values as found in organic compounds (see also the values for
Br and I above). This is a satisfactory result so far as it
goes, but on the strength of it we will not proceed to a com
parison between B and F in the last table, but will wait till
we have controlled these values by an independent calculation.
The data for other compounds in Table IX. are too few to
be worth discussing separately, but will be considered in
connexion with values by another method. The only data
for the surface-tension of liquid compounds at their solidi
fying points known to me and not included in Table IX.
 are those of Traube for some compounds of Na and K with
the fatty acids. These will now be briefly considered.

 These values of (MPI) are exceptional, for they do not in
 crease by 9 for each addition of CH2 to the acid radical :
 with 4.2 for K and 3.1 for Na, also 2-9 for HCOO and 9 for
 CH, we can calculate the following values of (M'l) for com
 parison with those just obtained from experiment—

     The reason for the discrepancies in these two sets of values
 would have to be sought for by a special inquiry.
  2 (b). Second Method of determining (MP) for Inorganic
           Compounds, namely by the Kinetic Theory of Solids.
     In “A Kinetic Theory of Solids” (Phil. Mag. ser. 5, xxxii.),
  it was shown that, for a homogeneous isotropic solid composed
  of molecules which can be regarded as spheres of diameter
  E whose centres are at an average distance e from their nearest
  neighbours, D being the average kinetic energy of each,
                               2D          1

                    Laws of Molecular Force.                 17
are in contact, and p(r) the attraction between two molecules
at distance r apart, the summation to extend to all molecules
within appreciable action of any one. It may be more con
venient to sum both members of the above equation for all
the molecules in unit mass, when we get
                    >2D         1
If the law of force is given by p(r)=3Am"/", then XXrd(r)/6
reduces to what is denoted by lp in the notation of the “Laws
of Molecular Force,” and e”= m/p, so that

This equation was established on the assumption that the
molecules collide as though they were perfectly restitutional
spheres.
   Now X2D is twice the kinetic energy of the motion of the
centres of mass of the molecules in unit mass, and, if the
energy of other motions is negligible, equals 2.Jc6, where 6 is
the temperature and c the specific heat. e”(e–E) = E”(e/E-1)
approximately; if the molecules are invariable with tempera
ture, e/E-1=b6, where b is the coefficient of linear expansion
of the solid, and it was shown that the metals behave as if E
diminished with rising temperature in such a way as to make
e/E –1 =7b6 approximately; and as E”= m/p nearly, we have
             mX2D          2m.Jc6    .
m being the actual mass of a molecule, and M the ordinary
£ mass referred to that of the hydrogen atom.              Now
cM, by Dulong and Petit's law, is nearly 64 for the metals,
so that                M°l="61J(M/p)/b. . . . . . . (7)
The values of b have not been found experimentally for a
number of the most interesting metals, but can be got by
means of an empirical relation given in “A New Periodic
Property of the Elements” (Phil. Mag. ser. 5, xxx., also
xxxii. p. 540), namely, if T is the absolute melting-point
bTM = 044, and then
                  Mel-61J(MP)TM/044.           . . . . (8)
Taking J as 4.2 x 10" ergs and using 10” dynes as the unit of
force as hitherto, them finally
                  M'l=5.8 x 10-"(M/p)TM. . . . . (9)
This equation applies, so far as we know at present, only to
the metals; it has been deduced from (3), which applies only

18               Mr. William Sutherland on the
to solids in which the molecules are monatomic or composed
of equal atoms, as in the case of the elements, all the atoms
being treated as separate spheres. The corresponding equation
for compound solids is sketched in section 9 of the “Kinetic
Theory of Solids” (Phil. Mag. ser. 5, xxxii. p. 550), but in a
form which is not correct unless a strained interpretation is
put on certain symbols; but we can easily establish the
correct form now.      There would be no need to establish a
separate form of equation for solid compounds if we knew
that the molecules move as wholes; but, on the contrary, we
have evidence that the atoms in the molecule move almost
independently of one another, for according to Joule and
Kopp’s law the molecular specific heat of solid compounds is
the sum of the atomic specific heats of the atoms in the mole
cule. In a certain sense a solid compound is like a mechanical
mixture of its atoms: in the act of combining the atoms have
produced mutual changes in their sizes and attracting-power
and other properties, and the solid is like a mechanical mixture
of these changed atoms. Now in the establishment of equa
tion (3) for elements, the first term 2D/3e”(e–E) is calculated
as the collisional pressure per unit surface, that is the force
transmitted across that surface by the collisions of molecules,
or rather atoms, of diameter E, average distance e from next
neighbour, and kinetic enegy D, while the term Xrd (r)/6e”
is the resultant attraction which equilibrates this collisional
pressure. Let N be the number of atoms in unit volume,
then e”= 1/N, and the collisional pressure can be written
2DN/3(1-E/e). Now if we have N molecules of a compound
solid in unit volume, and if each molecule contains n1 atoms
of an element A1, n2 atoms of an element A2, and so on, then
the collisional  p' due to the ni atoms of A, in unit
volume is mivi°Nni/3(1-El/e1), and similarly for the other
atoms, the total collisional pressure being their sum, so that

pounds in the present state of our knowledge; but as it was
shown that for the metals 1- E/e=7b6, where b is the
coefficient of linear expansion and 6 the absolute temperature,

                          Laws of Molecular Force.                19
 it is reasonable to imagine that in the last equation 1–Eiel,
  1-E2/e, and so on, can be replaced by a single mean value
 proportional to b6, where b is the linear coefficient of expan
 sion of the solid compound. Denote each by ab6, where a is
 a constant which may or may not be the same as the 7 for
 metals, and replace nimi", + nams", + ..., which is twice the
 total kinetic energy of the molecule, by its value 2JMc6,
 where c is the specific heat of the compound, then the last
 equation becomes
                             2J Mc      1                  -

 in which b is at present unknown for most compounds. But
 as in the metals bTM'='044, so we may assume for com
 pounds that bTM" is constant ; and merging this unknown
 constant and 1/a into a single constant k, for compounds of
 the same type we get finally
                      M'l-5.8x10-£(MPTM,                . . . (13)
 differing from the equation (9) for elements only in the con
 stant k to be ascertained for each type of compound. It so
 happens that for binary compounds of monad elements such
 aS ' or KI, the value 1/2 for k gives good results; and as
 Mc for the chlorides of this type is 12.7, and for the bromides
 13.8, and the iodides 13:4, the mean of which can be taken
 as practically double the 64 for the atomic specific heat of
 the elements, then the equation (13) for such compounds
 reduces to the same as that for the elements (9).
     We will first take the data for the haloid compounds of the
 metals of the Li family; the melting-points are those given
 in Carnelley's paper on the Periodic Law (Phil. Mag. ser. 5,
 xviii., also Journ. Chem. Soc. xxix., xxxiii., xxxv, xxxvii.);
the molecular domains (volumes) are those given by F. W.
 Clarke (Phil. Mag. ser. 5, iii.), and differ slightly from those
 previously given in this paper in Table IX. Below the
values of (M'l) calculated by the equation (9) are given
values from Table IX. found from surface-tensions.

    The general agreement between the two sets of values of
 (M*l) is surprisingly good, the values found by (9) being on
the average about 7 per cent. larger than those found from
surface-tensions. The data for the haloid compounds of the
other metal of this family, namely Cs, are incomplete, at least
I have failed to find data for the densities of Cs compounds;
but the following considerations give us the molecular domains
of Cs compounds in a satisfactory manner; the mean differ
ence in the molecular domains of the corresponding Na and
Li compounds is 5:4, for K and Na it is 11:2, and for Rb
and K 15:8, numbers which are closely 1 x 5'4, 2 x 5-4, and
3 x 5'4. Consequently for Cs and Rb compounds we should
expect a difference 4 x 5:4 or 21:6, which when added to the
domains for the Rb compounds gives the domains tabulated
hereunder with the melting-points taken from Carnelley’s
diagram —

The simplest way to deal with compounds of the type RCl2,
 RCls, and RCl, is to replace kMc/64 in equation (13) by 1,
 as we have done with the type RCl, and then ascertain what
 values must be assigned to kMc/64 to make the results con
 sistent with one another; then, having the value of Mc for
 each type, we can assign the value of k for each. As the
 event proves that kMc/64 is 1, or nearly 1, for the simple
 types RCl, RCl2, RCls, and RCli, we can proceed to tabulate
 '. of (M*l)               from (9), namely,
                          M’l=5.8x10 (M/p)TM, . . . . (9)

which thus becomes the fundamental equation for the elements
and the above types of compounds. For these types k there
fore varies inversely as Mc, but Mc is mici + m2c2+ ..., that
is the sum of the atomic specific heats, which for most atoms
are each nearly equal to 64, so that for these types Mc/64 is
equal to the number of atoms in the molecule, and accordingly k
is inversely proportional to the number of atoms in the mole
cule. When we come to types such as RNO3, involving a
compound radical NOs, some of whose component atoms have
an atomic specific heat less than 6.4, k is inversely as the
number of radicals in the molecule, so that for RNO3 it
remains 1/2 as for RCl, but Me is no longer 2 x 64. The
case of R(NO3), is not so simple, but these matters will be
gone into later on ; at present we proceed with the application
of (9) to the types RCI2, RCls, and RCl.
    The data and results for a number of haloid compounds of
these types are given in the next table, the melting-points
being as before taken from Carnelley's table and diagram,
and the densities used in calculating the molecular domains
 being derived from various sources (chiefly F. W. Clarke's
 collection of data in Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections,
 xii. and xiv.); the bracketed values of the molecular
 domains are the approximate results of interpolation.

     From the row of ratios it appears that the boiling-point
 method gives results which on the average are 1.08 times
larger than those given by the melting-point, an accord which
is again surprising, seeing that in an arbitrary manner we
assumed for compounds the relation TbM'=constant, estab
lished experimentally only for the metals: if instead of 044
we took 040 for the constant, the agreement between the two
methods would become complete for most of the compounds.
This agreement proves what was asserted in connexion with
equation (13), that k for these types is inversely proportional
to the number of atoms in the molecule.
     Before accumulating any more data it will be well to extract
the general results from those just given in Tables XIII, XIV.,

24                Mr. William Sutherland on the
and XV.      In the haloid compounds of the Li family the mean
difference in (M*l) for the chlorides and fluorides (Cl–F)
is 1:1, for Br–F 1:8, and for I-F 2:5; which are a little
smaller than the 1:2, 1:8, and 2.7 which we got before, although
the values of (M'l) in Table XIII. are larger than those in
Table IX.
    Similarly we have the average values Na–Li=1:1,
K-Li=2:2, Rb-Li=3.6, and Cs—Li=49, which go
nearly as 1, 2, 3, and 4. The corresponding differences in
the molecular domains with Clarke's values given in Table
XIII., are Na–Li=54, K-LI= 16*6, Rb-Li-32'4. The
same molecular domains taken in conjunction with Thorpe's
values for the halogens in organic compounds lead, as has
been already shown, to the domains 9 for F, 19 for Cl, 26 for
Br, and 36 for I, which lead to a mean value 2.0 for Li; so
that the molecular domains of the metals of the Li family in
the compound state are 2.0 for Li, 7.4 for Na, 18.6 for K,
344 for Rb, and probably 56 for Cs. To obtain the values
 contributed to (MPI) by these atoms, it must be remembered
 that from the results in Table IX. we found that the value
 for fluorine might be taken as 9, so for the numbers in
 Table XIII. it should be taken as about 9, giving for the
 halogens the values 9 for F, 2.0 for Cl, 2.7 for Br, and 3.4
 for 1, nearly the same as the former values 9, 2:1, 2:7, and
 3:6; which will be retained and lead to the values 2-4 for Li,
 3.5 for Na, 4:6 for K, 60 for Rb, and 7:3 for Cs, which go
 very nearly as 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    To complete the data for the Be family we require the
 densities of the haloid compounds of Be, but as these appear
 to be waiting we must approximate to the molecular volumes
 of the Be compounds by means of the fact that the molecular
 volume of BeO is 5 less than that of MgO ; subtracting then
 5 from the molecular volumes of MgCl2, MgBr, and Mg I,
 we can supply the following
                       Supplement to Table XIV.

            (M*!) ...........    6'4      7.8       3-6
     On passing from the haloid compounds of the monad
  metals in Table XIII. to the compounds of the dyads, triads,
  and tetrads in Tables XIV. and XV., the first point to arrest
 attention is that the values for 12–('l, Is–Cls, IA-Cl, are

                    Laws of Molecular Force.                       25
not 2 and 3 and 4 times the value of I–Cl already found in
connexion with the monad metals: we have the following
mean values:—
            I–Cl.       I2–Cl2.       Ja-Cla.        I. —Cli.
             1-4           1.8          2.7             3: 1
The discrepancies in these values might be ascribed to an
error in the assumption that kMc/64 is equal to the same
constant 1 for all these types of compounds; and it might be
supposed that the constant ought in each case to be chosen
so that I2–Cls, I3-Cl3, and II-Cl, are 2 and 3 and 4 times
I-Cl.       But this supposition breaks down when it is re
 membered that in the types RCls and RCI values of (M*!)"
as found by the independent boiling-point method are only
 8 per cent. larger than those by the other method. It is
 true that the boiling-point method is only approximate, but
that the approximation is fairly close can be seen by com
   aring the following pairs of values, the first of each pair
 £      the approximate value from Table XV. and the second
 the value from Table VII., namely:—
         PCla.      AsCls.      CC11.         SiCl1.        SnCl4.
         6:0         6'3         6-3           6.6           7'4
          6.6        7:0         6'8           6.9           7.8
    These comparisons show that the phenomenon that the
 values in (MP) for I-Cl, 12–Cl, Is–Cls, and I,-Cl, do
 not stand as 1, 2, 3, 4 is a real one, and not the result of
 accumulated imperfections in the methods of calculation.
 The values given above for these differences stand more
 nearly in the relation 1, 2’, 3, 4'; and supposing it to be the
  true one, they can be brought into almost complete harmony
 if we return to the old relation bTM#=constant, and denoting
  by E an equivalent replace it by bTE:=constant, which would
  reduce the values of (MP) for the four types in Tables XIII.,
  XIV., and XV. by factors 1, 1/2*, 1/3', 1/4" : then the
  numbers 1:4, 1:8, 2:7, and 3:1 for I-CI, I2–CI2, Is–Cls, and
  II–Cl ought to be as 1, 1/2*, 1/3', and 1/4'. Dividing the
  numbers by these powers, we get for I–Cl the series of values
  1.4, 1:2, 14, and 1:4, which are as nearly constant as possible
  under the circumstances.                                       -
     This constitutes the main part of the proof that in com
  pounds of the type RS, where R is an n-valent atom and
  S a monad, (MP) is of the form (F.--n F.)/n', whence
   (MP)''n'= F./n+F. Thus our best plan will be to divide
  the numbers in Table XIII. by 2*, and those in XIV. by

26.                   Mr. William Sutherland on the
3' and 41%, and tabulate the results as F/2+ F., F./3+ F.,
and F/4+ F., according to the type of compound.

   There are some irregularities among these numbers, the
most pronounced being where the value for Srl, falls below
that for Cale; but ignoring these as due to no fundamental
error, we get, taking the data for the chlorides as the best,

    The values just given for the types RCls and RCI, are the
means of those given by both the melting-point and boiling
 point methods, the latter being reduced first by dividing by
 1:08 the mean ratio of results by the two methods, and then
converted to equivalent values by dividing by 3 and 4'.
    Again, amongst the types RCls and RCIA, taking the values
of F/3+ F, and F./4+F, for the chlorides as the most
 reliable, but allowing for the others where necessary, and

   In the compounds of the zinc family irregularities appear
in (M'l) : thus for I,-Cl, we get with Zn 2:7, with Cd 1.6,
and with Hg(ic) 1.3, instead of the 1.8 proper to dyads: so
also are the compounds of Cu(ous) and Ag exceptional, for
Cu2I2-Cu2Cl2 is 3:4 and AgI-AgCl is 1.9; but the reasons
for these irregularities can hardly be gone into in the present
paper, though in a general way they suggest themselves.
   So far the method of the Kinetic Theory of Solids has been
applied to only the haloid compounds of the metals, and it.
will be interesting to see how it works with compounds in
volving more complicated acid monovalent radicals such as
 NO3, ClO3. The equation (13), which for the haloid com
 pounds was shown to simplify down to (9), must for these
 compounds be used in its original form (13) with k=1/2:
 for the nitrates of the form RNO3, Mc has a mean value 24,
 so that (13) becomes
                       M°l21 – K.

tributed by the radicals NO, CIO, BrO, and I0, to (M*l)',
along with the values reproduced from Table XI., where they
were obtained by the surface-tension method:—

               NO.                 ClO4.            BrO.           IOa.

                 3.7                36               3.7
    The agreement in the two sets of values is good only for
NO3, but it should be noted that the value for BrO2 from
Table XI. is too small in comparison with that for ClO3,
With 3.6 as the value for NO, we can obtain from Table XIX.
values for Ag and Tl, namely Ag=34, which is 1 less than
Na, while the irregular results for the haloid compounds of
Ag would make it about 5 less; for Tl the value is 4.2.
    To the data for the carbonates, sulphates, and metaphos
phates of the monad metals similar considerations have to be
applied as to those for the nitrates. Equation (13) has to be
used with a value 28 for Mc in the carbonates of type R,CO3,
 33 in the sulphates R2SO4, and 50 in the metaphosphates.
As there are 3 radicals in these types k will be 1/3, and as in
the case of RCl, we divided our original values of (M*l) by
2' to get true values of (M*l)'/2 or XF., so also in these
types we must do the same : thus for the carbonates R2CO3,

   The value of XF, for Tl2CO, is probably too small because
the melting-point given for this compound seems to be too
low. Confining our attention to the Na and K data, which
are the best, we get for F/2 for CO; the value 2:8 as against
3.3 by the surface-tension method, and for SO, F/2 is 4:3 as
against 4-0 in the surface-tension method. This value 4:3
gives for F in Ag a value 3-6, while 3.4 was the value de
rived from the nitrate, in Tl F is 4.9 from the sulphate as
against 4.2 from the nitrate; the values for the metaphos
phates again show that Na and Ag have nearly equal values
for F, and that for P206 F/2 is 7.4, while 6.7 was the value
found by the former method.
   We advance to a higher degree of molecular complexity
when we take up the nitrates of the dyad metals of type
R(NO3)2; here Mc is 41.6, and as there are three radicals in
the molecule k is 1/3, and thus
                                  41-6
                |M?l=5.8 x 10" 3 x 6.4  (M/p)TM'. . . . (17)
It happens that this equation, when applied as in the next
Table to the nitrates of Ca, Sr, and Ba, gives values for
(MP)' which are nearly the sum of F for Ca and twice F
for NO3, and so on, so that the effect of valency does not
appear here; but before remarking further about this let us
take the data :—

With F for NO3 as 3.6, for Ca as 64, Sr 7.4, and Ba
8:4 (see Table XVII.), we get for the nitrates 13.6, 14.6,
and 15.6, when valency is ignored, and these values are in
substantial agreement with those just given in the Table.
The question arises whether, this is merely the fortuitous
effect of some peculiarity of these nitrates not taken account
of in equation (17), or whether it is due to the fact that the
valency of the atom which determines the type exercises less
influence as the radicals to which it is united become more
complex ; or, in other words, do the compounds of the metals
when complex enough tend towards obeying the same law
for (MPI) as holds in the carbon compounds? The question

30                  Mr. William Sutherland on the
is merely raised in connexion with the results of the last
table, to which by themselves little weight need be attached,
but we will return to the matter shortly in connexion
with the organometallic compounds. Meanwhile we will
take the data for a few compounds of tri- and tetrabasic acids
with which to gain some more knowledge of the influence of
the basicity of an acid radical on its attracting-power; these
compounds are LigPO, and Aga PO, the orthophosphates of
Li and Ag, Na, P.O; and Ag, P.O., the pyrophosphates of Na
and Ag, and along with these will be taken Na2B,07, the Na
salt of the dibasic pyroboric acid.         -
   For the orthophosphates Mc=41, for the pyrophosphates
63, and for the pyroborate 63; in the orthophosphates there
are four radicals to the molecule, so that k=1/4, so for the
pyrophosphates k=1/5, and for the pyroborate k=1/3: thus
the equation (13) becomes for the orthophosphates
               21 - P.
             M°l  = 5.8 x 10-4 * 4 x4164 (M/p)TM', . . . (18)
and so on. To reduce (M*l) to SF., we must divide it by 3%
for the orthophosphates, by 4's for the pyrophosphates, and
by 2” for the pyroborate; and thus we get
                            TABLE XXIII.

   With 2.4 as the value of F for Li, and 34 for Ag, we get that
for PO, F/3 is 3.4 and 4:1, or in the mean 3.7; so with 3.5
for Na and 3.4 for Ag, F/4 for P20, is 5.0 and 4.6, or 4.8 in
the mean ; so also F/2 for B101 is 8.5, the value found by the
surface-tension method for F/2 in B,07 was 7-2, and for F/4
in P3OT was 4 1 (see Table XI.), which would be obtained
on dividing the values just found by 1:2.
   We are now in a position to make the same comparison
between the values of # for a large number of acid radicals
in inorganic compounds, and the volumes B of these radicals,
as was made in connexion with organic compounds. In the
following Table the first row contains the value of F as given
by the surface-tension method in Table XI., in the second
row the values of F given by the Kinetic Theory of Solids, in
the third the mean of these two sets of values, in the fourth the

    The values of the ratio for NO3, NO, and CN, namely 8.5,
 8, and 9, are not far from the mean value 10 found for the
 same ratio in organic compounds: for these three radicals the
 values of the ratio in Table VI. were 10, 9, and 8; for C10,
 the ratio in the last table is 9, but for BrO3 it falls to 7.5, and
 for IO3 to 6. This is due to the values of B for these radicals
being smaller than they ought to be if regular, for B for
 BrOs instead of being less than for ClO3 ought to be 6.4
greater, which would make it 41, and bring the ratio up to 9;
similarly B for IOs ought to be 16.5 greater than that for
ClO3, which would bring it up to 51, and make the ratio 8.

    This part of the table shows that for the dibasic acid

for the dibasic acid radicals has the same value as B/F for
the monobasic. There is only one datum for a tribasic acid

  32                     Mr. William Sutherland on the
     For the tribasic acid radical the ratio 3B/F is 12, and
  therefore 2B/F is 8; for the tetrabasic radical 4B/F is 17,
  and therefore 2B/F is 8:5; and both these values for 2B/F
  range themselves with the values found for 2B/F in the
  dibasic radicals. This, then, is a noteworthy result, that for
  all acid radicals of a basicity higher than 1 the ratio 2B/F is
  nearly constant, and has half the value of the same ratio for
  radicals of basicity 1. This recalls the result we found before,
 that for atoms in organic compounds the ratio B/F has a
 value nearly half of that for the elements and CH, C2H4, and
 CH2. Our results for the acid radicals may be summed up
 in the two formulas—B=9F nearly in the unibasic, 2B =9F
 nearly in the polybasic.

    The values for compounds of O, S, Cl, Br, and I have been
 introduced into the table only to give an idea of the degree
 of approximateness of the values in the table, for more accu
 rate values for these compounds have been already discussed.
 First let us consider the values of M/p which may be taken
 as M8.
    These numbers show that in M8 CH, has a value about
 16.5, which is close to the limiting domain for CH, in the
 organic compounds, though it ought to be larger, seeing that
 the density p used in the organometallic compounds is not
 the limiting density, but that of the liquids about 15° C.
 We will take the value for H to be the same as in the organic
 compounds, namely 4:5, and then CH3 is 21, C, H, is 37.5,
 C3H7 is 54, and C, H, is 70.5; with which we get the follow
 ing mean values of the atomic domains of the metals in the
 organometallic compounds:—
     Zn.     Hg.     Sn,    Pb.     Si.     P.       As.      Sb.
     28      30      49      49     42     33.5     27-5     46
    Except for P and As, these domains are much larger than
 in the inorganic compounds: for instance, the domain of
 PbCl2 is only 47.8, which is actually less than the domain of
 Pb in the organic compounds. Of course the one number is
 calculated for the solid state, and the other for the liquid, but
 this could explain only a small part of the discrepancy. There
 is no doubt that the metallic atoms occupy more space in the
 organic than in the inorganic compounds; in the inorganic
 compounds Sb may be seen to have a domain about 20, while
 in the organic compounds the value is 46. This is a very
 significant fact, that seems not to have been noticed by those
 who have occupied themselves with the question of molecular
 domains (volumes).                             -
    As regards (M*l)', we know that in organic compounds
CH2 has a value 9, which is the value it possesses amongst
the chlorides, bromides, and iodides of the last table; but in
the metallic compounds the values are smaller. In the Zn
compounds 2CH2 has the values 1:8 and 1.5, with Hg 1:7 and
1:2; in the Sn compounds 4CH2 is 2:8 and 1:7, and in the
Pb compounds 2:4: in every case the greater the number of
CH2 groups the smaller the value of CH2; the compounds of
S show the diminution clearly, for they give for CH2 instead
of 1:8 the values 1-6, 1:5, 14. These results seem to show
that the approximate equation (14), used to calculate the
values of (MPl) in Table XXV., gives less and less accurate
results the more complex the molecule becomes, but at the

34                    Mr. William Sutherland on the
same time they show that as the value for CH, between the
methides and ethides is not far from the truth, the values for
the methides may be taken as nearly correct, and where a
value for the methide is wanting an approximate one can be
got by subtracting from the value for the ethide '75 for each
CH2. Thus we get the following Table for the methides
only:
                                 TABLE XXVI.
            ZnMe, HgMe. SiMe. SnMe. PbMe... BMea. NMe2. PMea.

    Here again values are given for the methides of N, O, S,
 Cl, Br, and I, only as checks. The first point to ascertain is
whether in the true metallic methides (M*l) follows the laws
proper to organic compounds or inorganic metallic compounds.
 In the organic compounds CH2 has a value 9, and the other
H of CH3 a value 1:1, so that CH3 is 2, and thus the values
for SiMe, and SnMe, are less than for Me, : therefore the
organometallic compounds do not behave as ordinary organic
compounds; but as we have seen the valency of the metallic
atoms play an important part in the values of (MP) for their
inorganic compounds, it will be best to try the effect of
treating the methides as we did the metallic chlorides and
similar compounds. That is, we must divide the values of
 (M'l) in Table XXVI. by n', where n is the valency of the
metallic atom; then, subtracting 2 for CH3 from each of the
results, we get the values of F/n for the metallic atoms. These
are given in the first row of the following table, the second
row containing the values from Table XVIII.

    It appears that the values of F for the metallic atoms in
 the organometallic compounds are double the values in the
 inorganic compounds, whether the atoms are dyad, triad, or
 tetrad; and this seems to correspond closely with what we
 found in the stud, of the ratio B/F for the compound acid

                          Laws of Molecular Force.                 35
 radicals, because for basicities higher than one this ratio came
 out only half the value for basicity one, which corresponds to
 a value of F double what would be expected from other con
 siderations.    As these facts show a characteristic influence
 belonging to compound radicals, it will be instructive to return
to the case of the nitrates of the dyad metals, in which, ac
cording to what we have just seen, the values of (MP) in
Table XXII, when divided by 2” and reduced by 3-6, the
value for NO3, ought to leave values for F/2 for Ca, Sr, and
Ba which are double the values obtained from the halogen
compounds. Performing these operations we get for
                                     Ca.         Sr.        Ba.

         From Table XVII.......      3.2         3.7        4-2
The values of F/2 from the nitrates are only 1:5 and not 2
times the values from the chlorides; and thus the nitrates of
these metals do not come satisfactorily under this principle,
and there are too many steps in the process of determining
the value of F/2 from the nitrates to enable us to fix upon a
probable cause of the discrepancies in these nitrates.
    With the organometallic compounds we have finished the
data for compounds to be discussed in the present paper, and
have now an opportunity to make a comparison between the
values contributed by the atoms of the metals to M8 and to
 (M'l) in a molecule, though to keep it clear that in the com
pounds of the metals we have had to take account of valency
n we will give the values of B/n and F/n in the following
table. There is considerable difficulty in getting the atomic
volumes of such atoms as P and As, because the relations of
the chlorides, bromides, and iodides are not consistent with
those of the chlorides, bromides, and iodides of the monad
metals; the volumes of the lower members of the monad and
dyad series are also difficult to assign, being small. In the
case of P, As, and Sb the volumes adopted are those given
by Thorpe (Journ. Chem. Soc. 1880) as the domains of these
atoms in liquids at their boiling-points; they are therefore
probably too large, but not necessarily much too large, because
the domains of the halogens in organic compounds at their
boiling-points are almost identical with their limiting volumes
in these compounds, and also in metallic compounds. Ac
cordingly the values of the limiting volumes of the atoms
given in the next table are only such general approximate
values as represent best the         : 2
                                         of the simplest compounds.

    A glance at the numbers for the Li and Be families of
metals shows that the ratio of B to F is not constant, as we
found to be approximately the case with non-metallic atoms
and radicals; but when we get to the families which are half
non-metallic and half metallic, as in the P family and the C
family, we see that the ratio, except in the case of C itself, is
not far from 10, the value which we have hitherto found for
non-metallic atoms and radicals.                              For further assurance as
to the reality of this distinction between metals and non
metals, the best course will be to determine values of M*l for
the uncombined metals.
      3. Determination of M*l for the Uncombined Elements.
    Data are available for both methods of calculating M*l, and
that of the Kinetic Theory of Solids will be taken first as
being applicable to a greater number of substances. At first
the molecular mass will be regarded as unknown, and for M
the usual atomic weight will be used in equation (9). The
following table contains the values of T the melting-point
and of M/p from L. Meyer’s ‘Modern Theories of Chemistry,’
and the values of M*l [not (M*l)'] calculated from them by
equation (9), as well as the values of the ratio (M/p)/M*l
 [not (M/o)/(M'l)"]. Equation (9) applies strictly only to the
metals, but in a formal manner it is here extended to some
non-metals.

   The first point of importance brought out by this table is
that in the main families the ratio (M/p)/M*l has a constant
value characteristic of each family, and in the subfamilies a

38                   Mr. William Sutherland on the
value simply related to that of the main family: thus in the
first family the range in the value of the ratio is only from
2.9 for Li to 2-6 for Cs, with a mean value 2:7, of which the
value for Cu and Ag in the subfamily is a quarter. In the
second family the ratio is constant from Be to Ba with a
value 1.0, but the mean value 1.3 for Zn and Cd in the sub
family is greater than that of the main family, which is in
strong contrast to the behaviour of the copper subfamily, and
may have some significance, as will be seen presently; the
distinct manner in which Hg separates itself with a value 3
should be noticed. In the third family there are only two
members, Al and La, which both have the same value for the
ratio, 9, and in the subfamily Ga has 3 times this value, in
which respect it is similar to Hg, and In has double the value
of the main family, Tl has perhaps 1.5 times that of the main
family. In the fourth family there is only one main repre
 sentative Ce with a value '75, of which that for Sn is exactly
double, as was the case with In and the third family; the
 value for Pb appears, like that of Tl, to be 1.5 times the value
 of the main family. In the fifth family a certain arbitrari
 ness in our separation into main and sub-families becomes
 apparent, because P, As, Sb, and Bi have the close relation
 ships of a main family, Di, which is the only metallic repre
 sentative of the fifth family, has a value 62 for the ratio, of
 which those for As, Sb, and Bi are double, and that for P is
 again double those for As, Sb, and Bi. In the sixth and
 seventh families, where the metallic character disappears, re
 gularities in the ratio (M/p)/M*l disappear, but in these non
 metallic elements the tendency is towards M/p being pro
 portional to (M*l) and not to M*l. In the eighth family
 the ratio (M/p)/M*l has a mean value 41.
    The second point of importance brought out by Table XXIX.
 is that the ratio (M/p)/M°l for each main family exhibits a
 remarkable relationship to the valency of the family when
 the main family is metallic. This is shown in the next table,
 where the first row contains the valency of the family, the
 second the value of the ratio (M/p)/M*l for the family, and
 the third the product of these two.

    Product of valency and ratio ... 2.7        2.0 2.8  3.0  3-1  3-3
    This table shows that if n is the valency, or perhaps it is
 safer to say the order of the main family, then n(M/p)/M*l

                         Laws of Molecular Force.            39
shows a close approach to constancy, except in the case of
the second family, whose place seems to be taken by the dyad
zinc subfamily, in which the ratio (M/p)/M°l is 1:3, and
therefore the product n(M/p)/M°l is 2.6. As the subfamilies
have a ratio (M/p)/M°l, which is a simple multiple or sub
multiple of the value in the main family, we can say that in
the metals n(M/p)/M*l is close to 2:8, or a simple multiple or
submultiple of 2:8, except in the second family, where it is
2-0. Thus the attracting-power of a metallic atom is pro
portional to the square root of its volume or of a simple
multiple of its volume, and also to the square root of its
valency. This relation for the metals can also be stated in
another interesting form, for as lp represents the potential
energy due to the attractions of the molecules in unit mass,
M°l/(M/p) is the potential energy of mass M, which may be
taken as forming the greater part of the heat of vaporization
of the gramme-molecule; thus, then, the potential energy of
the molecules in a gramme-equivalent (and probably the
latent heat of vaporization of a gramme-equivalent) of the
metals in the main families has nearly the same value for all,
and in the other metals a value which is a simple multiple or
submultiple of this. The methods devised in this paper for
calculating M*l for inorganic compounds also lead to approxi
mate values of their latent heats of vaporization, which are of
some importance in Thermochemistry.
   With this knowledge of the relation between M*l and
volume in the uncombined metals, we can return to the study
of the relationship of the parts carried by the metallic atoms
into (M2i) and M6. We have already seen that the metallic
atoms in combination do not have their parts of (M*l) and
MS proportional to one another; and in the light of what we
have just found for the free metals, we ought to compare the
square of the part F carried by a metal atom into (M31) in
compounds with the part B carried into M/p. Here are the
values for the Li family:—

 in compounds

 while for the free metals the relation was found to be
                                      M°l=M/p.
 It is noticeable that the constant 9 for the Be family is the
 same as that for the Li family.

 interesting inquiry into the other metallic families, and trace
 the transition from the form of relation F*= a M/p + b holding
 amongst the powerfully positive metals to the form F=cM8
  (c being a constant) characteristic of the non-metals, and
 apparently of some weakly electropositive metals.
     We proceed now to the surface-tension method of finding
 M°l for the metals, chiefly to draw attention again to a dis
 crepancy between the values of M*l for the free metals given
 by the Kinetic Theory of Solids and those by the method of
 surface-tension. This was pointed out at the end of the paper
 on the Kinetic Theory of Solids, but it can be brought out
 here in a more definite manner and with more interest, seeing
 that the two methods have been proved in this paper to give
 accordant results for binary compounds. To the gain of the
 Kinetic Theory of Solids, the discrepancy will be largely
 cleared up as due to molecular complexity.

    The equation for the surface-tension of the elements has to
be modified from the form in which it was used for compounds,
because in the Laws of Molecular Force (Phil. Mag. March
1893) it was shown that the virial constant l of compounds
falls in the liquid to half of the limiting value in the gas,
whereas in the elements H2, O2, and N2 it retains the same
value in both states. Now the equation (9) was designed to
give the value of l for compounds in the gaseous state from
measurements of their surface-tensions as liquids, therefore
in applying equation (2) to the elements we must provisionally
divide by 2, and get

   Where two values of an are given for one metal, they are
the result of different methods of measurement; the data are
all Quincke's except one of the measurements for lead made
by myself. If matters were exactly as we suppose them to be,
in applying equations (9) and (19) the values of the ratio in
the last table ought to be 1, or a constant near to 1, such as
we found in the case of the binary compounds, while the
range in the actual values of the ratio is from 33 for S to
6.0 for K. In seeking for the reason for this discrepancy, we
must remember that in using the equation (19) of the capil
lary method we have assumed that the characteristic equation
of the metals is on the same type as that of the element gases;
but there is this distinction                                    between the metals and the
element gases, that some of the metals, namely Na, K., Zn,
Cd, and Hg, are known to be monatomic in the vaporous
state, while the element gases are diatomic; and it is exactly
for these metals and tin that the ratio in the last table has its
largest values, while the smallest values belong to S, Se, and
P; and S and P are well-known instances of exceptional
molecular complexity, their vapour-densities at low tempera
tures being such as correspond to the formulas S6 and P.
It is therefore probable that the discrepancy has to do with
an effect of molecular complexity not taken account of in
equation (19). We saw that the distinction between the
diatomic element gases and compounds was expressed by
introducing the factor 2 into the left side of equation (2);
and if we suppose that amongst the elements the effect of
molecular complexity is to introduce into the right side of
the equation (19), namely
                              M*l =                * x 10"a, (M/p.)*,
a factor equal to the molecular complexity, defining the
molecular complexity of an element as the number of pairs
of atoms in its molecule, which is 1/2 for Na, K., Zn, Cd, and
Hg, 2 for P, and 3 for S, then the values of M°l by the capillary

                         Laws of Molecular Force.                              43
method in the last table would be multiplied by these factors,
and also the values of the ratio. Treating the molecular
complexity where unknown as 1, then the values of the ratio
become:—

    The numbers for K, Hg, and Sn are about double the
average for the other elements; the experimental value of an
is said by Quincke to be uncertain in the case of K, and also
for Cu and Fe, while the pairs of values given for Ag, Au,
and Pb show that in some cases a large experimental error is
possible in these difficult measurements. Thus the effect
which we have assumed as due to molecular complexity brings
the discrepancies within the range of experimental error in
all the satisfactory cases except that of Hg. But even if the
explanation just suggested for the inequalities amongst the
values of the ratio in the last table proves not to be correct, it
has at least been demonstrated that these inequalities do not
indicate any real discrepancy amongst our equations, because
the effect of different molecular complexity has to be allowed
for. Thus while the results of the capillary method of finding
 M°l do not, in the case of the elements, confirm the values
given by the Kinetic Theory of Solids, they do not invalidate
them, and the complete explanation of the relation of the two
sets of values may not be obtainable till we know the charac
 teristic equations of the metals.
    The     transition      cases from metal element to non-metal
 element will not be gone into at present, but it will be
 advantageous to gather here the values of M8 and (M'l)*
 and their ratio for the non-metal elements.                      We have seen
 reasons for believing the values in Table XXIX. to be
 relatively correct on the whole, although it must be expected
in such an instance as that of Cl that the method there used
 for finding M*l must give a rather rough value: in the
 following table the values given are reproduced from
 Tables VIII. and XXIX.

    As has already been pointed out, the numbers for Clare
 rough, so that no importance attaches to the discrepance
 between the ratio 9 for Cl and 14 for Cl2, which numbers
 ought to be identical. All that the table shows is that the
 relation found to hold between M8 and (M'l) in the gaseous
 non-metals does not extend to the other non-metals.          The
 transition cases from metal to non-metal will have to be
 worked out before the principle ruling in the values of (M’l”
 for the non-metals becomes clear.
     4. General Summary and Analysis of Molecular into
                             Atomic Attractions.
    The chief result of the present inquiry has been the
 demonstration that M*l, which occurs in the treatment of the
 attractions of like molecules, and which represents Am” in the
 expression 3Am"/"for the attraction between two molecules
 of mass m, can be analysed into two factors (M'l) which are
 the sum of numbers characteristic of the atoms composing
 the molecule whose mass referred to the atom of hydrogen is
 M. This is the logical outcome of the proof given in the
 papers on “The Attraction of Unlike Molecules,” that the
 attraction of two unlike molecules is expressed by the product
of two parameters characteristic of each and equal to the square
 roots of the corresponding attractions for a pair of each of the
molecules. The values of (M'l) studied in this paper are there
fore relative values of A'm. But as we have found no evidence
of a direct connexion between m and A'm, it is desirable to
remove all implication of such a connexion, which was
originally adopted for the sake of analogy with the Newtonian
law of gravitation. Accordingly A'm would be better denoted
by a single symbol a, so that the attraction between two
molecules of mass m1 at distance r apart is 3al"/r", and of two
molecules of masses m1, m2 is 3a1 ag/r", and so on.
   The fact that a for a molecule is the sum of parts due to
the atoms in it enables us to analyse molecular into atomic
attraction; for if two molecules of composition B, C, Da . . .

                    Laws of Molecular Force.                 45
are at a distance r apart, and if the force between the atom or
radical B in one molecule and C in the other is k8%f(r), and
between C in one and D in another is kryöf(r), and so on,
then the attraction between the two molecules is
       K(b'82-'-c'y'-- ... +2edy8+2db88+2bc&y+ ...)
                     =k(b8+ cy+d6+ .)”,  • *
so that a, the parameter for the whole molecule, is given by
                    a=k*(b8+ cy--d3+ ...),
which is the symbolical statement of our result for the carbon
series of compounds that the parameter a for a molecule is the
sum of parts due to the separate atoms and radicals in it, and
shows that in these compounds the atoms and radicals attract
one another with a force proportional to the product of
parameters characteristic of each. This does not imply that
the parameter belonging to an atom is invariable, for the
atoms in a free element have different parameters from those
they possess in a compound: by chemical combination both
the volumes and force-parameters of many atoms are altered,
and the amount of alteration depends on the chemical function
of the atom in the molecule; while the chemical function of
an atom or radical in an organic compound is constant, its
force-parameter is constant. This influence of chemical
function on the parameter of molecular force becomes mani
fest in the typical inorganic compounds, especially of the
metals. If the compound is of the type RS, where R is an
atom of valency n combined with n monad atoms S, then the
expression for a takes the form
                         a=(#) (p + no)
 (p and a being parameters belonging to R and S); or perhaps
a more suggestive form in which to put it is
                         a"/n=(p/n + a)",
which means that the mutual energy of two molecules of this
type divided by the number of equivalents in each can be
obtained by regarding each equivalent as a separate attracting
entity. The equations just given hold true not only when R
is a metal and S a non-metal, but also when R is an acid
radical of any basicity and S a monad metal. The law for
the more general case of a compound R.S., has not been
investigated in this paper because of the want of suitable

data ; nor have the transition cases between the simple
typical compounds and the organic series been worked out.
It is interesting to find in molecular force a new clue towards
the realization of the desire of chemists to trace out the
transition from the dualistic to the unitary type of compound.
   The atomic parameters 8, y, ... p, a ..., relative values of
which have been given under the symbol F, which is the
part contributed by an atom to (MP)', have been shown to
be related to the volumes of the atoms; in the organic com
pounds many atoms and radicals have F closely proportional
to the volume of the atom, and in the case of the halogens
this holds good also in the inorganic compounds. Denoting
the volume of an atom by B, the approximate relation is
B= 10 F or 9 F, but for a compound acid radical of basicity
higher than one the relation becomes B=9F/2; here again
is evidence of chemical influence on molecular force.      In the
case of metallic atoms in their compounds, it has been
shown that F is not proportional to the volume of the atom,
and on passing on to the uncombined metals it is found
that F, which represents the atomic parameter, is in the
main families of metals approximately proportional both to
the square root of the volume of the atom and the square
root of the valency, and in the subfamilies is a simple
multiple of a number which is so proportional. On returning
to the metal atoms in the combined state, it was found that
the relation is F*= a B+b in each family, a and b being
constants characteristic of the family. The profound influence
of valency in the uncombined metals is again of deep chemical
interest, as is also the great difference in the law connecting
atomic parameter and volume from that holding amongst the
extreme non-metals. These are the main results; amongst
subsidiary results may be mentioned a certain amount of con
firmation given to the Kinetic Theory of Solids by its successful
application to the calculation of force parameters, successful
insomuch as its results are in harmony with those obtained
by a perfectly independent method. This confirmation is the
more useful because it applies to the extension of the theory
to compound solids, whereas in the original paper the metals
only were treated of.

  II. The Influence of Temperature on the Specific Heat of
            Aniline. By E. H. GRIFFITHs, M.A."
                          [Plates I. & II.]
OU' knowledge of the effect           of changes of temperature
       upon the specific heat of substances is limited. The
reason of this is evident, for, in addition to the difficulties of
thermometry, the experimental methods usually adopted are
based on comparisons in which water is used as a standard,
and our knowledge of its capacity for heat at different tem
peratures is far from satisfactory. The conclusions of Rowland
(1879), of Bartoli and Stracciati (1893), and my own
investigation completed in 1892, all point to the fact that the
specific heat of water diminishes as the temperature rises to
20°C., at which temperature Bartoli and Straeeiati find it is
a minimum. My observations did not extend beyond 27°C.,
up to which temperature I found no signs of a minimum,
which Rowland places at about 34°C. When such discre
pancies exist with regard to the standard, it is not surprising
that the conclusions arrived at regarding other substances are
unsatisfactory.
    For other reasons water is by no means an ideal standard
for calorimetry. Its capacity for heat is so great that the
changes in temperature caused by the immersion in it of
bodies whose specific heats are small are too minute to be
measured with exactness under ordinary circumstances.
The difficulty is surmounted in practice by causing the
immersed body to cool through a considerable range. Other
errors are, however, introduced by this method, for the
transference of the hot body into the cool water can rarely be
conducted without loss of heat. What we require is a liquid
of small capacity for heat whose temperature-coefficient of
specific heat is accurately known. It should also, if possible,
be a liquid easily obtainable in a fairly pure state and should
have a low vapour-pressure at ordinary temperatures. I
believe that in Aniline we possess such a liquid, and I hope to
be able to adduce sufficient evidence to lead to the conclusion
that its specific heat is now known with considerable accuracy
over a range of 15° to 52°C.
    The method I have adopted is an old one, viz. a supply of
heat to the interior of the calorimeter by means of an im
mersed conductor whose ends are kept at a constant potential
 difference. I admit that there are difficulties inseparable from

48           Mr. E. H. Griffiths on the Influence of
the method (such as doubts as to the actual resistance of the
conductor when its temperature is raised by the current,
&c.), but when once these difficulties are overcome, there is
no such accurate means of determining the quantity of heat
passed into a calorimeter in a given time.
   The limits of this paper forbid any detailed account of the
somewhat complicated apparatus used in this investigation, and
I do not contend that it is of the form which I should have
selected had my object simply been to determine the specific
heat of aniline. I am at present engaged in a determination
of the latent heat of evaporation of water and other liquids at
different temperatures, consequently the apparatus has been
designed and put together in anticipation only of that investi
gation, and many portions of it are unnecessary and in fact
detrimental to ". inquiry I am now describing. Hence I
have been compelled to adopt methods of observation which
may not, at first sight, seem the most advantageous.
   I have in my possession an apparatus for maintaining the
walls of a chamber at a constant temperature. The arrange
ment has been fully described in a communication entitled “The
Mechanical Equivalentof Heat,” Phil. Trans.clxxxiv. A.(1893),
and as I shall somewhat frequently have to refer to this paper,
I will now label it with the letter “J.’ Briefly, the apparatus
as there described consists of a tank containing about 20
gallons of water within which is a steel chamber shaped some
what like a hat-box with vertical sides, the space between the
double walls and floor containing rather more than 70 lbs. of
mercury, which communicates by a narrow tube with a gas
regulator differing but little from the ordinary pattern. Thus
a row of about 50 tiny gas-jets (placed under a tube through
which water is always flowing) are so controlled as to be dis
tinctly affected by a change of 150°C. in the temperature of
the steel chamber. An addition has been made to the appa
ratus since the publication of the description in paper J, where
it is stated that tap-water continually passed into the tank
through a silver tube placed above the gas-jets: this plan
answered admirably from the temperature of the tap-water
 (10° to 12°C.) to about 30°C. Last year, however, Prof. Cal
lendar and I wished to use the tank for purposes of comparison
of platinum and air thermometers up to 50° or 60° C., when
it was found that alterations in temperature presented them
selves, occasionally amounting to as much as 'o' C.,-the lag
in the temperature of the large mass of mercury being so
great that when the gas was lowered by the action of the
regulator, the resulting inflow of cold water tended to lower
the temperature of the tank before the reaction of the regu

           Temperature on the Specific Heat of Aniline.       49
lator could again heat the inflow. As now arranged, when
working above temperatures about 20° C. a small motor acts
as a heart and, the tap-water being shut off, pumps the tank
water itself round through the silver tube placed above the
gas-jets. The water, by passing through the pump &c., is
slightly cooled : thus the work of the regulator is confined to
simply supplying the heat lost by convection, radiation, &c.,
and it performs this task admirably. As an illustration, I
may mention that in the series of over 50 experiments treated
of in this communication on only one occasion did the tem
perature of the steel chamber change by as much as Tho°C.
throughout the duration of an experiment. On the solitary
occasion that a change amounting to nearly 5'9" C. was
observed, the cause was found in the caking of the lime through
which the gas was passed on its way to the regulator, and, in
consequence, the experiment was discarded before working
out its results.
   A large screw, placed in the tank-water, revolved at about
800 times per minute and raised a considerable sea—the flow
passing round, under, and over the steel chamber, the top of
which was about 4 in. beneath the surface of the water.
   The calorimeter was formed of brass and was suspended by
glass tubes which, after passing through the lid of the steel
chamber and through the water, projected above the lid of
the tank. The diameter and depth were each about 10 centims.
and the capacity about 700 cubic centims. Within it was sus
pended a silver flask with which three silver tubes communi
cated. One was connected with a glass tube passing to the
exterior through which substances could be introduced. The
second tube, which was about 18 feet in length, was, after
leaving the top of the flask, twisted into a spiral within the
calorimeter; the other end, terminating in the lid of the
calorimeter, was then connected by a glass tube with a four
way tap entirely immersed in the outer tank. The third tube,
which opened into the bottom of the flask, communicated with
about 30 feet of copper tubing placed in the tank-water. The
object of the whole arrangement was that the gas on leaving
the calorimeter (after evaporating any liquid in the flask)
should have acquired the temperature of the calorimeter, and
that any gas passed into the flask should assume the tempera
ture of the outer tank. True, this portion of the apparatus
was not necessary to the experiments on aniline, but I have
felt it advisable to describe it, as explaining some of the sub
sequent operations.
   A coil of fine german-silver wire, supported on glass pillars,
was placed within the calorimeter and so arranged as to

50             Mr. E. H. Griffiths on the Influence of
surround the silver flask.         Communicating with this coil
were four leads—Nos. 1 and 2 of which were fastened to one
end, and Nos. 3 and 4 to the other end of the coil at the roof
of the calorimeter, and, passing up through the steel vessel,
communicated with the exterior.            Nos. 1 and 3 formed the
ends of a circuit in which were placed a high-resistance
 galvanometer and the Clark cells; Nos. 2 and 4 a circuit
 which contained a rheochord of special construction (for a
 description see paper J), reversing-keys, and storage-cells.
 It was thus possible to maintain the ends of the calorimeter
 coil at a difference of potential equal to that of any number
 of Clark cells; and I am convinced that the variations in the
 potential-difference during the course of an experiment rarely
                     E                              •     •
 amounted to 10,000: (The grounds on which this somewhat
 bold statement is based are fully given in paper J, p. 283.)
 The contents of the calorimeter could thus be heated or cooled
 without any disturbing effects from external causes. By
 means of the electrical arrangements above described, the
 supply of heat could be regulated at will and accurately de
 termined, while, by the insertion into the flask of a volatile
 liquid such as ether, it was possible, by adjusting the current
  of dried air, to regulate the rate of cooling.
      Particulars of the Clark cells have already been published
  (paper J, pp. 286-288), and the whole 36 maintain to-day
 almost exactly the same relative values as they had when
  compared with the Cavendish standard in 1892 : there is,
  therefore, every reason to believe that their absolute value
  remains unchanged. I have not yet had time to repeat the com
  parison with the Cavendish standard, but I hope to do so shortly.
  I do not, however, anticipate that any correction will be found
  necessary. The whole of these cells were contained in a bath,
  through which the tap-water was turned by means of a regulator
   whenever the temperature exceeded 15° C.
      The calorimeter previously described differed considerably
   from that used in my determinations of the mechanical equi
   valent. During these experiments the air-pressure in the
   space between the walls of the calorimeter and those of the
   steel chamber containing it was reduced to from 5 to 2 millim.
   as measured by McLeod's gauge; and my observations proved
   that there was a strangely rapid diminution in the loss by
   convection, &c., when the pressure fell below half a milli
   metre*... I proposed, however, during the experiments for
   which this second calorimeter was designed to maintain the

            Temperature on the Specific Heat of Aniline.          51
calorimeter and the steel chamber at nearly equal tempera
tures, and it did not, therefore, appear so necessary to guard
against convection and radiation gains and losses. Previous
experience had convinced me of the absolute necessity for
keeping this intramural space dry, for I found that the
slightest moisture in the contained air has the most astonish
ing effect in changing the conditions.              It was therefore
necessary that all joins should be absolutely tight, for the lid
 of the steel chamber was under water, and I proposed, in the
 preliminary experiments, to place water within the calori
 meter.   The use of indiarubber was forbidden, as I intended
 to insert ether in the silver flask and aniline in the calori
 meter; and even if such had not been the case, indiarubber
 connexions are, at the best, unsatisfactory and unreliable.
 I decided, therefore, not to commence my experiments until
 I found that the apparatus was absolutely gas-tight in all
 parts; and I may mention that the greater part of last summer
 was unsuccessfully devoted to the endeavour to secure per
 fection in this respect. During last winter I spent considerable
 time in the effort to obtain some suitable medium by which
 to join glass to metal; and with the assistance of Mr. Thomas
 I was at last successful in procuring an alloy by which an
 air-tight join could be formed”, and which would stand con
 siderable changes of temperature. Five glass tubes passed
 from the calorimeter to the steel lid, rendering ten such glass
 to-metal joins necessary, besides several similar ones in the
 exterior connexions.
    In the spring of this year the intramural space was ex
 hausted until the reading of the McLeod gauge connected
therewith was reduced to 11, indicating a pressure of about
0.12 millim. The apparatus was then left untouched for a
month except that the temperature was occasionally raised or
lowered, and at the end of that time the reading of the gauge
was still less than 12. Dry air was then readmitted to this
 space, and the silver flask with its connected tubes (embracing
about 50 feet of tubing with several joins) tested in a similar
manner. Those who have had to deal with low pressures will
understand that when all was found satisfactory a great diffi
culty had been surmounted. I did not retain this vacuum
during the experiments, as I felt that it would subject the glass
tubes &c. to a continuous strain which the conditions of the
experiments rendered unnecessary. The labour had not been
lost, however, for I was able to count with confidence on the
gas-tightness of the whole apparatus.
   I now pass to a description of that vital part of any such
                     * Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. 1894.

52            Mr. E. H. Griffiths on the Influence of
investigation, viz. the thermometry. The method I proposed
to adopt necessitated extremely accurate measurements of
small differences of temperature. The actual elevation was
of little consequence, and therefore the use of differential
thermometers immediately suggested itself. Two platinum
thermometers (labelled AB and CD) were constructed with
 great care: four stout platinum leads passed down the stem of
 each, supported and insulated in the usual manner by small
 disks of mica, and the resistance of all these leads was made
 as equal as possible before attaching the coils. Great atten
 tion was given to this matter, and it is safe to assume that the
 leads in no case differed amongst themselves by 1 in 10,000.
 The coils, consisting of a particularly pure sample of platinum
 wire, were then attached, and several days were devoted to
 securing their equality. Their resistance in ice was about
  18 ohms: thus Ts'o, of their resistance could be directly
 determined in the box. The galvanometer swing was about
 500 for a change of 01 in the box; and such equality was
 secured that when both thermometers were placed in ice (the
 necessary precautions being taken with regard to exterior
 connexions &c.), no difference in the swing of the galvano
 meter could be observed; thus they differed by a quantit
 certainly less than 1 in 100,000. This equality,       £
 not a necessity, was a great convenience.
    Although cut from the same length of wire and insulated
 in a precisely similar manner, the coils did not possess exactly
 the same coefficients. The resistances in steam and sulphur
 were repeatedly determined and checked by observations in
 the vapour of aniline. Both thermometers were on several
 occasions heated to a red heat, the hard glass tubes containing
 them becoming slightly bent in the process; but since this
 annealing no further change has been observable in them.
 The method of completely standardizing such instruments
 has been fully described by Professor Callendar and myself
 in Phil. Trans. 1891, A, and I need not therefore here dwell
 upon it. The values of 8 differed slightly, viz. 1:513 and
  1:511; but such a difference, even if not allowed for, would
  over the range 0° to 100° C. in no case cause an error
  exceeding about 50,0°C. in elevation. These thermometers
  were so connected that the compensating leads of A were
  placed in series with the coil of B, and vice versa. Any
  heating of the stem of A or B, therefore, added an equal
  resistance to each arm of the bridge; and as the leads were
  everywhere bound together, the indications were absolutely
  independent of all changes in temperature except those of the
  bulbs.

            Temperature on the Specific Heat of Aniline.                  53
   Great care is required to accurately determine the fixed
points of such thermometers. For example, a difference of 1°
at 100° C. made a difference of 067835 ohm: thus a difference
of 1 millim. on the barometer caused a difference of .00244
ohm. Readings of the pressure were taken on a standardized
#-inch diameter mercury-barometer, and also on a compen
sated sulphuric barometer suspended beside it. It was found
that the observations, if corrected to 100° C. by the pressure
as deduced from a mercury-barometer, were not in close
agreement; but if by the sulphuric-acid barometer, the
results were satisfactory. On examination it appeared that
the first observations of each series, when corrected for pres
sure, were in harmony whichever barometer was used; but
such was not the case with subsequent ones of the same series.
The cause is, I believe, to be found in the necessary handling
of the barometer that takes place when adjusting the mercury
to the ivory point. The temperature within the case under
goes a change, and the indications of the thermometer usually
placed within the metal tube surrounding the barometer give
but little information as to the real temperature of the mer
cury column, whereas the sulphuric-acid barometer requires
no manipulation and is independent of such temperature
changes. As an example of the consistency of the boiling
point when corrected by the H2SO4 barometer, I give the
following consecutive results :

54             Mr. E. H. Griffiths on the Influence of
   The above examples will show that it is possible to deter
mine the resistance at 100°C. to better than 1 part in 250,000,
and nearly the same order of accuracy is obtainable, with
proper precautions, in the vapour of sulphur.
    I believe the most difficult point to accurately determine is
freezing-point, and for really satisfactory determinations it is
advisable to use distilled-water ice; but if this is manufactured
in the usual manner there is great danger that some trace of
salt may be carried from the freezing-mixture to the ice.
 One precaution I have found advantageous when using
 ordinary ice, viz., on adding water to the powdered ice it is
advisable to use water resulting from the melting of that ice
itself rather than either distilled or tap water.
    I will not burden this paper with any further detailed
account of the standardization of these thermometers. Between
 March 4th and July 7th the fixed points were determined on
 over 30 occasions, in ice, steam, or sulphur vapour, and no
 variation which would affect temperature measurements be
 tween 0° and 100° C. by as much as 2.000°C. presented itself
 during the latter half of these observations, the record and
 reductions of which alone make a large pile of manuscript.
     The two thermometers, with their leads connected as
 described, were placed at opposite ends of a bridge wire of
 platinum-silver. During the spring of this year this wire was
 subjected to a most careful calibration by what was practically
  Carey Foster's method, and it proved to be more unequal than
  I had expected. It was therefore re-calibrated by a different
 method in which a resistance-box was used as a shunt, and the
  agreement between the results was satisfactory. The whole
  wire was 80 centim. long and had a total resistance of about
  “4 ohm. For convenience, and to avoid thermal effects, a
  similar wire connected with the galvanometer was laid along
  side it, and the sliding-piece was fitted with a screw so arranged
  that a small turn of the screw-head made contact with both
  wires”.
     The wire and contact-maker were covered by a thick
  copper shield (the screw-head projecting through a narrow
  slit) passing from end to end of the bridge: thus the tempera
  ture of the wire was kept uniform. By means of a vernier the
  divisions on the scale could be read to 'o millim., which with
  this wire and thermometers AB and CD indicated at 50° C.
  a temperature difference of .000915°C.f The temperature
    * This method of making the connexion is due to Professor Callendar,
  and is exceedingly effective and convenient.
    t A thicker wire giving a more open scale was tried at first, but found
  to be less convenient than the one finally adopted and calibrated.

           Temperature on the Specific Heat of Aniline.        55
coefficient of this wire was found to be '00029.          The re
sistances of the different parts of the wire were, after
correction for the errors of individual coils, &c., merely ex
pressed in terms of the mean box ohm, the absolute value
being of no consequence so long as the fixed points were
determined in terms of the same standard. The remaining
two arms of the bridge were constructed of german-silver.
They were wound together, boiled in paraffin, placed in a
bottle, and I expended much care in finally adjusting them
until equal. Their resistance was about 5 ohms and the
galvanometer about 8 ohms, which, assuming the resistance of
the thermometers as about 20 ohms each, would give nearly the
maximum of sensitiveness. A single storage-cell was always
used, and a resistance of 40 ohms was placed in the battery
circuit when the thermometers were in ice.            A table was
then calculated which gave the resistance necessary in the
battery circuit when the thermometers were at any tempera
ture in order that C*R (where R is the thermometer resistance)
 should be constant. Thus the rise in the temperature of the
thermometer coils due to current-heating was always the
 same, and consequent errors were eliminated, a point to which
 I attach considerable importance.
    The value of R,-Ro in thermometer AB was 6:88815;

 tures can be deduced.
    There was no difficulty, in the arrangement above described,
 in reading with certainty a difference of 10'00°C., and, as an
 illustration, I may mention the fact that if the thermometers
 were placed in separate hypsometers side by side on the
 bench and one of the hypsometers was then removed to the
 ground (about 3 feet below), the difference in the bridge-wire
 reading thus caused slightly exceeded 4 millim.
    Before leaving this portion of the subject I may mention
 that I carefully compared the thermometer A B with two
 standards from the International Bureau of Weights and
  Measures, which passed through my hands this summer
  on their way to Sydney University, and further with a
  separate standard sent me by the Bureau in February 1893.
  As the particulars of this comparison are now in the pressf, I

56           Mr. E. H. Griffiths on the Influence of
need not refer to them further than to say that the results
were most satisfactory.
    When the experiments were in progress the thermometer
CD was placed in a hole drilled in the wall of the steel
chamber parallel to the side and separated from the inner
surface by only 1's in...: thus it assumed the temperature of the
walls surrounding the calorimeter. Thermometer AB passed
within the calorimeter and was immersed to an inch above
its bulb in the contained liquid. The reading on the bridge
wire thus gave the difference between the temperature of the
calorimeter and the walls of the surrounding chamber.
    To ascertain the actual temperature and the constancy of the
 temperature of the surrounding walls, a second hole, like that
 already described, was drilled in the steel, in which a mercury
 thermometer of open scale was placed. The stem, where it
 protruded above the lid of the tank, was surrounded by a glass
 tube up which the motor pumped the tank-water, which, passing
 out at the top, returned to the tank. The stem, therefore, was
 maintained at a steady temperature, and the fluctuations ob
 served might be considered as solely due to changes in the
 walls of the steel chamber.     The stem of thermometer A (used
 at the lower temperatures) was divided into millimetres, about
 27 to a degree, and No. 11. (used at the higher) about 20 millim.
 per degree. They were observed through a telescope con
 taining a micrometer-scale giving direct readings to 'o of a
 millimetre.    The tenth of one of these divisions could be esti
 mated, and thus changes of It'00" C. (i.e. about 025 millim.)
 were easily observable. This was important, as the bridge-wire
 readings £ to be corrected for any movement in the tempe
 rature of thermometer CD–that is, the temperature of the
 walls of the chamber.
     The stirrer (which consisted of two nearly vertical narrow
 paddles, reaching from top to bottom of the calorimeter) was
 so placed as to throw the liquid across the silver flask and coil
 against the thermometer. This form of stirrer was not the
 one I should have adopted had the apparatus been designed
  solely for the experiments which I am now describing. In
 that case I should have preferred the form described in
 paper J, which threw the liquid from the bottom to the top
 of the calorimeter; and I believe that such irregularities as
 have presented themselves in these experiments, especially
 with the smallest mass, are due to insufficient stirring. When
 the calorimeter is full of liquid the nature of the stirring is of
 less consequence; and as I proposed in the experiments for
 which the apparatus was designed to completely fill the calori
 meter, I adopted the form which it appeared to me would

           Temperature on the Specific Ileat of Aniline.            57
generate the least heat compatible with efficient mixing. The
stirrer was supported in the same manner as that described in
a former paper; that is, its bearings were entirely external to
the calorimeter except at the base, where, to check vibration,
an agate cylinder hung within a ring *.
    In place of the 2000 revolutions per minute used in my
former work I confined myself, for the reasons above stated,
to a comparatively slow rotation of from 500 to 300 revolutions
per minute. The revolving shaft was electrically connected
with the chronograph in '. a manner that the time of every
1000 revolutions was automatically recorded on the tape.
    Before commencing the observations on aniline I introduced
299-35 grms. (in vacuo) of water into the calorimeter, and,
with a view to ascertaining the water-equivalent, performed
a few experiments to determine the rate of rise when a known
current was passed through the coil. The point was not of
 great importance, as I proposed to determine the specific heat
of aniline by a method requiring no knowledge of the water
 equivalent, which, however, when the specific heat of aniline
 was known, could be deduced from the experiments, and thus
 a previous determination by means of water would serve as
 an independent test of the accuracy of the results. I had not
 covered the german-silver coil with any insulator, since,
 aniline being itself an insulator, the precaution was un
 necessary; and this freedom to use the naked wire was one
 of the chief reasons which led to the adoption of aniline as a
 suitable liquid for my subsequent work. I was therefore
 aware that I could not expect very satisfactory results from
 the use of water. The polarization was considerable, as shown
 by the back E.M.F. at the termination of an experiment, and
 also by the difficulty experienced in making any accurate
 determination of the coil-resistance.        However, it was sub
 sequently found that the experiments gave very fair results.
 The temperature was raised from about 5°C. below to 5°C.
 above the surrounding temperature (i. e., through about
  12 centim. of the bridge-wire), and the times of passing the
 several divisions of the bridge-wire were recorded on the chro
 nograph. Five experiments were performed, and the results of
 the first three gave a water-equivalent of 80.1, and Nos. 4 and 5
 of 79.8. They were thus divided into groups before the results
 were calculated, as the coil showed £ signs of change in
  resistance between the two batches of experiments. I had
 proposed to continue these experiments with a different mass
  of water, but became alarmed as to the effect on the coil of
    * A portion of the shaft of the stirrer was constructed of ivory, to
 diminish its thermal conductivity.

58            Mr. E. H. Griffiths on the Influence of
the change that was going on, and decided to withdraw the
water, for had the coil become useless from any cause, the
whole apparatus would have had to be taken to pieces and the
base of the calorimeter unsoldered, &c., involving a delay of
at least a week or two.
   During the time that the water was in the calorimeter
I performed a considerable number of experiments to deter
mine the rise in temperature due to the work done by the
stirrer. With this form of stirrer and the low rates, tr.” was
practically a constant, where t was the time of rising 1 centim.
of the bridge-wire and r the rate of revolution per second.
The resulting correction was comparatively small, amounting
to about 2's of the heat generated by the current during the
water-equivalent experiments; thus any small error in the
correction introduced when eliminating the heat supplied by
the stirrer became unimportant.
   After the water was withdrawn, the whole apparat:              Was
kept for three days at a temperature between 40° and 50° C.,
while dried air was forced continuously through every part of
it. At the end of this time a sulphuric-acid bulb (through
 which the air passed on its exit from the apparatus) showed
 no increase in weight. I then introduced 294.99 grms. (in
 vacuo) of aniline into the calorimeter *.
    I will at once state that no great pains were taken to secure
an absolutely pure specimen of aniline. For my subsequent
experiments the purity of the aniline was a matter of no con
 sequence, as I only required to know the actual capacity of
 the calorimeter and contents at different temperatures.
    Again, as regards the purposes of this investigation I think
 that it will be of greater service if I am able to supply experi
 menters with the specific heat of a quality of aniline at all
 times procurable, rather than if I gave the constants of a
 quality only to be obtained with difficulty. The sample I
 used was supplied by Messrs. Harrington Bros., as “pure
 colourless,” and had but a light brown tinge. It was re
 distilled by me once before use, and I also determined its
 boiling-point, which was in agreement with that of a specially
 £ sample which I had examined on a previous occasion f.
   urther (and this I have always found to be a fair test of the
 purity), the temperature of the boiling-point did not change
 during distillation.
    From the time that aniline was first introduced into the

           Temperature on the Specific Heat of Aniline.            59
calorimeter all signs of polarization disappeared, and the in
sulation of the coil was very perfect.
    I will now describe the method of conducting an experiment.
   The tank was first brought to the desired temperature, and
the experiment was not proceeded with until the tank-tempera
ture had had time to become steady. Freshly distilled ether
was then introduced into the silver flask, and dried air passed
through it (the stirrer in the surrounding aniline being con
tinually at work) until the whole of the ether was evaporated.
 The taps connected with the silver flask were then closed, the
 key inserted in the storage-circuit, the connexion with the
 Clark cells made, and the rheochord adjusted until the potential
 difference at the ends of the coil was shown by the high
 resistance galvanometer to be equal to that of the Clark cells
 used. Three or four of these cells were placed in parallel arc,
 and the files thus formed in series: therefore, when using an
 electromotive force of 4 Clark cells, we had really in use 12
 or 16.
     Throughout an experiment the attention of my assistant "
 was directed to keeping the potential balance as even as
 possible. I meanwhile had to observe and mark the time of
 transit across the graduations of the bridge-wire. A reversing
 key was maintained at a constant period of oscillation (about
 twice per second), and as the temperature rose the oscillations
  of a dead-beat galvanometer mirror (which were viewed
  through a telescope fitted with a micrometer-scale) steadily
  diminished, and the moment when they ceased could, to my
  surprise, be determined with great accuracy. By pressing a
  key, the time was recorded on the chronograph tape.
     The mercury-thermometer inserted in the walls of the steel
  chamber was observed at regular intervals, any alteration
  noted, and a correction afterwards applied to the bridge-wire
  reading—the value of each division of the bridge-wire in
  terms of a millimetre of the thermometer-scale being known.
  The time of each 1000 revolutions of the stirrer was auto
  matically recorded on the tape, thus the only notes that had
  to be taken during an experiment were of the changes of the
  mercury-thermometer. The chronograph was one of some
  what novel construction, for which       I am indebted to Mr. E.
  A. Pochin. It was worked by a water motor, had a triple set
  of recording hammers, and was controlled by an electric
  clock which was compared at regular intervals with a “rated”
    * I take this opportunity of returning my thanks to Mr. C. Green,
  Scholar of Sydney College, Cambridge, for his able assistance during
  these experiments.

60             Mr. E. H. Griffiths on the Influence of
Dent's chronometer, but as the greatest gain in rate observed
was less than 1 in 12,000, no correction was necessary.
   I find it impossible to give a detailed record of the obser
vations, as it would fill a volume. I therefore propose to give
an example in full of one of the experiments by drawing at
random one of the leaves from the mass of records.

         Temperature on the Specific Heat of Aniline.          61
                    Reduction of the Results.
   Let 60 be the temperature of the surrounding envelope and
6, that of the calorimeter at any time t. Let the change in
temperature per second due to the work done by the stirrer
be a, and let p equal the gain in temperature per second due
to the combined effects of convection, conduction, and radiation
when the difference in temperature between the calorimeter
and the surrounding envelope is unity.
   Let a wire whose resistance is R at 6, and R1 at 6, be im
mersed in a liquid contained in the calorimeter, and let the
mass of the contained liquid be M and its specific heat S,
when the temperature is 61.
    Let the capacity for heat of the calorimeter be wi when
the temperature is 61.
   Thus the thermal capacity of the calorimeter and contents
at any temperature 6, is SIM + wi.
   If the ends of the wire be kept at a constant potential
difference of E, then we get (paper J, p. 367):—
           J.R.'s M+, + ta-p("-")}=''.
   Since a is small and we can make 6 – 6, of any magnitude
we please, it is always possible to obtain a value of 6, such
that a -p(61–60) =0, and in that case

   This temperature (viz. that value of 6, which causes
 a-p(6–6) to vanish) I shall denote throughout this paper
 by the term “null point,” by which I mean that value of 6
at which the observed rate of rise is due to the electrical
 supply only, and I shall use 6N to indicate that temperature.
     wo or three methods of finding 6.N. suggest themselves.
 If the stirrer be set working when there is no electrical
 supply, then 61 will gradually approximate to 6N, and a few
observations as to the rate of change in 61 will supply sufficient
information to enable the observer to set the value near to
 6N, and the calorimeter can then be left to gradually assume
 the true value. I have given this method a fair trial, for the
apparatus has been left working for twenty-four hours at a
 time, and the value of 6N ascertained with precision.
   For example, at the rate of 9:10 revolutions per second it
was found that the value of 6N-60 (expressed in terms of the

62           Mr. E. H. Griffiths on the Influence of
mean bridge-wire centimetre) was about 9.2 (i.e. 0°.85 C.
approximately), and that when the rate was 5:00 the value
was about 2.7 (=0°25 C. approximately); and it is noticeable
that the ratio 9.2 : 2.7 is nearly that of (9:1)*: (5:0)”, thus
indicating that the heat developed by the stirrer varied
approximately as r", where r is the rate of revolution.
   A modification of this method renders it possible to deter
mine the thermal value of the stirring work. After obtaining
6N as above, find what value of 61 will cause the temperature
to remain steady when the heating effect is that due to the
stirring and a potential-difference of one Clark cell. Call
this temperature 6.N. ; we have thus two equations,
                       a-p(6N –6)=0,

                ** J. R.S.M.E.)           6.-6:
    Whatever method is adopted the experiments involve much
labour and time, for a redetermination of 6N must be made
for each change in 60, as it is probable that owing to changes
in the viscosity and surface-friction of the contained liquid,
6N would be some function of 60 when the rate of revolution
of the stirrer is constant ; and a complete determination of
the value of 6N for each value of 60 would have doubled or
trebled the length of the investigation.
    It has always appeared to me to be possible that the value
of p is a function of the rate of change in the temperature of
the calorimeter. The temperature-gradient from the calori
meter to the surrounding walls must alter slightly with the
rate of change in 61, and the rate of loss or gain in temperature
of the calorimeter must as a consequence be affected ; or, in
other words, I think it probable that the value of 6N is a
function of  #,   hence the value of 6N obtained by experiments
such as those described above, where the temperature of the
calorimeter is constant, may differ appreciably from the value
of 6N when the temperature is rising.
   The method I finally adopted must diminish, although it
does not entirely eliminate, any error due to this change in
6.N.

 error arising from the assumption that 6N is independent of n.

   Let us assume that the value taken for 6N differed from

When the values of       '- '. (where n=2, 3, or 4)        were
plotted as ordinates with 61 as abscissa, the resulting straight
lines were found to intersect not in one but in three points,
which, however, were so near to each other that (except in
one case) the probable error introduced by assuming that any
one intersection gave the true value of 6N was less than that
above indicated. The triangle formed by joining the three
points of intersection was almost invariably of one form and
of nearly equal dimensions, indicating that its existence was
not due to experimental irregularities but was connected in
some way with the difference in the rate of rise with different
values of n. I think that my impression that p and hence
6N are functions of #.     is thus confirmed.               -
   In any case the error caused by the assumption that 6'N is
the same with different rates of increase in temperature, must
be less than the error resulting from the assumption that it is
the same when the temperature is rising and when it is
steady.              -
   Again, the null point finally selected for each group of ex
periments was always obtained in the same manner from the
three points of intersection. Any error, therefore, is of the
same nature in each case, and as the specific heat was obtained
by the subtraction of one ordinate from another, the effect of
any erroris diminished considerably. True, when the absolute
value of the ordinate is used in order to obtain the water
equivalent of the calorimeter, any error in the position of 6s,

           Temperature on the Specific Heat of Aniline.         65
and therefore in the length of the ordinate, would produce
its full effect, and might be appreciable, but as regards the
determination of the specific heat by the method of differences
it is almost certainly negligible. It would be represented by
(e="E"), where pi and p2 are the values of p when
the masses of the liquid are M1 and M2; and since
                   p1(MIS1+ wi)=p2(M2S1 + wi),
the limit of error is given by the expression
                     plS1(M2-M1)     X   6-6s.

Now the value of       SI(M-M1) in these experiments was

We can now find the value of SIMI, and therefore

   Thus both the specific heat of the liquid and the water
equivalent can be found if two groups of experiments with
different masses of liquid have been performed at the same
temperature,
   Since J=4-198x10" "ergs, when the unit of heat is “the
quantity of heat required to raise 1 grm. of water through
 1° C. of the air-thermometer at 15°C.,” it follows that the
results obtained at different temperatures are all expressed in
 terms of that unit, and are not dependent upon our knowledge
of the changes in the specific heat of water.
                            Corrections.
   Before proceeding to plot the results the following cor
 rections had to be made:—
    I. For changes in the temperature of the steel chamber
 during the time of an experiment. For temperatures below
 26°C. a mercury-thermometer labelled A was used, situated
 as described on p. 56, and 1 millim. change in A was equi
 valent to 4:05 millim, in the bridge-wire reading. Thermo
 meter II. was used for temperatures above 26° C., and
 1 millim. change in II. was equivalent to 5.5 millim. of the
 bridge-wire. #. resulting correction had to be added or
 subtracted from the bridge-wire value of d6, and it rarely
 exceeded 0.2 millim.                     -
    II. The correction to the “mean bridge centimetre.” This
 correction was given with great exactness by the table result
 ing from the calibration of the bridge-wire previously referred
 to. It is applied as a factor to   #.                   - -
    III. The normal rate of stirring during experiments 1 to 8

            Temperature on the Specific Heat of Aniline.           67
was 9:10 revolutions per second, for the remaining experi
ments 5:00. A considerable number of experiments gave
tr°=800,000 approximately, where r is the rate per second,
and t the time of rising 1 centim. of the bridge-wire. The
                                                   -*.*
correction to the normal rate therefore is      £          where r is
the normal and r1 the observed rate.                2
   As the stirring rarely departed much from the normal this
correction was always small, it in no case exceeded 00006,
and rarely exceeded 00002; and as the values of tr" given
by the stirring experiments did not differ by more than
1 part in 50, the correction is sufficiently close.
   IV. The correction consequent on changes in the tempera
ture of the bridge-wire. This is given with sufficient accuracy
by the expression
                    # x {1+.00016(6–59)},
6, being measured by a Fahrenheit thermometer.
   W. The correction for the temperature of the Clark cells.
Assuming Lord Rayleigh's temperature-coefficient 00077,
we get
as #.
         #"
              {1 + 00154(6–15)}; for the rate of rise varies
   WI. The subsequent operations are simplified if some arbi
trary value is assigned to R', and the consequent value of         #
for that value of R ascertained.        As the resistance of the coil
increased from about 8:45 to 8.6 ohms as 61 increased from
15° to 50° C., it was found convenient to take 8:5 ohms as
the arbitrary resistance. The correction is        # # X
   The true value of R1, however, is not that obtained by
merely taking the resistance in the usual manner with a
small current.       I have in paper J, pp. 404–7, published
a full account of a method of finding the increase in R'
due to an increase in the potential-difference of 1, 2, &c.
Clark cells.
   The increase, with this coil, was carefully determined, with
the following results”:—
   * I have to thank Mr. F. H. Neville, Fellow of Sidney College, Cam

    The resistance of the coil was carefully determined for
 each group of experiments, at the mean temperature of the
 group, and also occasionally at a fixed temperature, in order
 to trace any change. During the first series a slight increase
 was observable (apart from the natural increase due to its
 temperature-coefficient). This was possibly a consequence
 of an oversight on my part, as I had forgotten to previously
 anneal the wire. After it had been raised to the highest
 temperature attained during these experiments the further
 change became negligible.                                     -
    The absolute value of R1 was obtained by means of the
 dial-box described in paper J, pp. 408–10. The errors of the
 separate coils and of the coils in the bridge-arms had been
 ascertained by a direct comparison, which had been made by
 kind permission of Mr. Glazebrook, with the B.A. standards
 in the autumn of 1892.
    VII. The value of       # at several points of the range (which
 was usually about 15 centim. of the bridge-wire, i. e. about
 1°4, C.) having been ascertained, the results were plotted
 (with 61 as abscissa) in order to ascertain the regularity &c.
 of the observations, which was generally found to be satis
 factory. The values of       # at the readings 60 and 70 of the
 bridge-wire were then obtained and divided by n”. Three
 experiments having been performed at each temperature with
 three different values of n, the intersection of the three lines
 thus found gave 6N, the ordinate for that abscissa giving the
 rate of rise due to the electrical supply alone. A plan of
 these intersections is given on Plate I.
    A glance at Plate I. will show that the null point in each
 case is not accurately defined.
    The intersection of the 3- and 4-cell lines is always to the
 left of the other intersections.           -              -

            Temperature on the Specific Heat of Aniline.                   69
   I have shown (p. 65) that the error introduced by this
uncertainty is in any case small, more especially so as the
results are deduced from differences in the ordinates.                   The
most probable position appears to me to be about midway
between the points of intersection of the 2-cell line with the
other lines; but as it is improbable that the position of the
point would vary capriciously as the temperature rose, I have
selected points on the smoothed curve (called the “null-point
curve”) which passes most nearly through the various inter
sections.
   It will be noticed that the null-point curve approaches more
nearly to the outside temperature as the value of 61 increases".
This indicates either (1) that the work done by the stirrer
had diminished (this would probably be due to diminished
viscosity or surface friction); or (2) that the loss by con
vection, &c., had increased. The former is I think the more
probable explanation.
   When the depth of the liquid is increased, the stirrer has more
work to do and the supply of heat is greater while the loss
remains unchanged. The null point therefore is at a higher
elevation when the mass is greater, and Pl. I. shows that
6N-69 is nearly proportional to the depth, i.e. to the mass, of
the contained liquid.                                             -
   In order to illustrate the method of applying the various
corrections, and also to indicate their comparative magnitude,
1 give in full (Table III.) the working out of experiment 26,
of which the details were given in Table II. The numbers in
Roman numerals indicate the sections on the preceding pages,
in which the particulars of the correction are given. The
greatest correction is that given by the calibration of the
bridge-wire, and this can be applied with great certainty.
    I do not consider it necessary to crowd this paper with
similar details regarding the remaining experiments. Table
IV. (pp. 71, 72) is a summary in which I have given the
numbers necessary for the remaining calculations.
   * This curvature is more marked than would at first sight appear from
an inspection of Plate I. Owing to the difference in the temperature
coefficient of the two differential thermometers, the true bridge null point is
given by the expression 59.84+.00038, where 6, is the temperature of
the thermometers. The position of the bridge null point is shown by
the vertical lines on the left,

          Temperature on the Specific Heat of Aniline.           73
   The value of  # having been ascertained            as above indi
cated, the capacity for heat of calorimeter and contents is
easily deduced.
   The operations are shown in Table W.
   Col. I, gives the temperature of the null point in de
            grees C. of the air-thermometer (from Table IV.).
    , II. the rate of rise at the null point as deduced from
            the group of experiments at that temperature
            (from Table IV.).
    , III. the value of the mean centimetre of the bridge
           wire at the temperature of the null point, denoted
           by C.
    , IV. gives the rate of rise when R=1 true ohm and the
           potential-difference 1 volt (e=1.4342, e”=2.0570),
            expressed in degrees C. of the air-thermometer.
           The value of R! used in this reduction is 8:4966
           instead of the 8:5 ohms which was selected as a
           convenient arbitrary value of R in the reductions
           in Table IV. The two wires connecting the roof
           of the calorimeter with the steel lid had a total
           resistance of .0068 ohm. We may assume that
            half the heat generated in these wires passed into
            the steel lid, and half into the calorimeter. We
            may therefore consider their resistance as 0034
           ohm = r. Now the points which were kept at a
            constant P.D. were at the lid of the calorimeter
           and between these wires and the coil. The equa
           tion is J.H
                      “-R,
                          =#(1+...)" hence the effective
                                      R1/’’
           resistance R1-r=8-5–'0034.
    , W. gives the reciprocals of the numbers in Col. IV.
    , WI. The value of J is assumed as 4:198". The
           numbers in this column give the capacity for heat
            of calorimeter and contents expressed in terms of
            “a thermal unit at 15° C.” The results when
           plotted as ordinates, with 61 as abscissa, are shown
           in Plate II (a).

                      Remarks on Tables IV. and V.
      Experiments 1 to 3 (3 cells) and 4 to 5 (2 cells) were per
   formed with a view to testing the working of the various
   portions of the apparatus, and in order to ascertain the
   minimum quantity of liquid that could be used with safety.
   The results were not satisfactory: the values of                #     at the
   same temperature, when deduced from the different experi
   ments in which the conditions were similar, differed con
   siderably, occasionally by as much as 1 per cent. The cause
   was evident: the depth of liquid was too small to give satis
   factory results with this form of stirrer. Considerable
   difficulty was experienced in maintaining the potential balance,
   and it is possible that at times portions of the coils were
   uncovered. I therefore decided on increasing the depth of
   the liquid.
      Experiments 6 to 8.—The mass of aniline was now increased
   by about 60 grms, and the observations became more satis
   factory. These experiments were performed with a stirring
   rate of 9:10 per second. I had not yet decided upon the best
   method of ascertaining the null point, and unfortunately did not
   perform any 4-cell experiments. When deducing the results,
   I assumed that the intersection of the 2- and 3-cell lines stood

          Temperature on the Specific Heat of Aniline.        75
in the same relative position to the intersection of the 2- and
4-cell lines as was found in those cases where a 4-cell experi
ment had been performed.
   The null point is of course (see Plate I.) in a very different
position from that found when the stirring-rate was 5:00; and
the close agreement between the results given by these three
experiments at the high rate, and experiments 13 to 15 at the
same temperature but with a slow rate, is a satisfactory proof
of the validity of this method of finding 65.
    Experiments 8 to 39 call for no special comment. They
were all conducted with a stirring-rate of (approximately) 5:00;
Nos. 9 to 24 with the same mass of aniline as 6 to 8.      From
No. 25 upwards the mass of aniline was increased to 569-53
  l'In S.
    On plotting the values of the capacity for heat of this mass
of aniline and the calorimeter, the spot obtained from experi
 ments 25 to 27 appeared in a somewhat abnormal position;
 consequently, although I had considered the experimental
 work as completed, I decided to repeat these experiments, and
 Nos. 40, 41, and 42 give the result. They agree so closely
 with the corresponding group as to confirm the position
 originally assigned to the curve at that temperature (about
 16°.7 C.).
    The curves on Plate II. (a) give the capacity for heat of the
 different masses of aniline together with the calorimeter, at
 different temperatures. Both of the curves resulting from
 the larger masses show a marked change between 15° and
 25°C. It is worthy of notice that the specific heat as de
 duced from these curves shows little or no signs of any similar
 change, but that it appears very markedly in the water
 equivalent curve, and in such a manner as to indicate that it
 was approaching a minimum. Had I not been able to deter
 mine the specific heats by methods independent of the
 behaviour of the calorimeter, I should have concluded that
 the temperature coefficient of the specific heat of aniline
 altered considerably at the lower temperatures.
    This indicates the necessity for extreme caution in similar
 investigations.
    Table VI. gives a summary of the results, obtained from
 the values given by the curves in Plate II. (a).

(as above pointed out) in fair agreement with that deduced

    NoTE (Sept. 6, 1894).—Having unfortunately strained one
 of the leads when the tank was at a high temperature, the
 insulation between the coil and the steel chamber commenced
 to fall off on Sept. 1st. I have therefore most reluctantly
 been compelled to take the whole apparatus to pieces, in order
 to replace the ebonite insulators. On Sept. 3rd I withdrew
 the whole   of the aniline, and on examining it I found that
 in colour   it had darkened considerably. The experiments
 described   in this paper were completed on Aug. 3rd and
 on Aug.     16th the apparatus was again set going, and
 was kept continually at work until Sept. 3rd. During this
 time electrical currents were continually passing through the
 coil and the stirrer must have made some millions of revolu
 tions. The nature of the experiments that I was then engaged
 upon compelled close attention to the capacity for heat of the
 aniline, and I am convinced that even a small change in the
 specific heat could not have escaped my notice. It would
 appear, therefore, that the change indicated by this darkening
 was not of a nature to sensibly affect the specific heat.

III. A Method for Comparing the Values of the Specific
    Inductive Capacity of a Substance under Slowly and Rapidly
    Changing Fields : Results for Paraffin and Glass. By
    EDWIN F. NORTHRUP*.
                              [Plate III.]
       AXWELL’S electromagnetic theory of light entails the
         relation that the square of the index of refraction of
a substance, for infinitely long waves, shall equal its specific
inductive capacity. But as the refractive index has only
been obtained for very short waves (excepting some experi
ments upon the refractive index of a few dielectrics for electric
waves), it is not unexpected that this relation should not hold
in the case of many substances whose specific inductive
capacity has been determined in steady or very slowly
alternating fields. It is to be expected, however, if the field
of force under which the value of K is obtained could be
made to alternate at a rate which would produce waves com
parable in length to the waves with which the refractive index
 is determined, that the agreement of K and u” required by
 the theory would be obtained. The experiments of Professor
 Hertz upon electrical oscillation have suggested certain
 methods for determining the specific inductive capacity under
 fields changing at a rate which approaches that required. No
 research, however, aiming at a direct comparison of the values
 of K under slowly changing and oscillating fields, which is as
 fully conclusive as could be desired appears to have been
 made. The objects held in view in the following investigation
 were:—1st. To perfect a method which will enable the specific
 inductive capacity of solids (for which substances the value
 of K departs most from the required relation) to be deter
  mined under fields of force varying slowly or rapidly as
  desired; and 2nd. To employ the method on one or two sub
  stances, to learn if the agreement with the theory is closer in
  the latter than it is in the former case.     With the method
  under consideration this comparison may be made with the
 same apparatus and under conditions similar in all essential
 features.
                     Description of Apparatus.
     Fig. 1, Pl. III, gives in elevation the apparatus employed.
  Fig. 2 in plan. The dimensions of the parts are given in
 the diagram in centimetres. The following are its essential

      Inductive Capacity of Solids under Varying Fields.        79
features:—Three heavy brass plates, A, B, and C (fig. 1);
each 12 x 14 inches, are fastened parallel to one another, and
are capable of being separated each from the other through a
range of several inches. Each plate is held in position by
four insulating strips of ebonite which extend out from its
edge; four iron rods, with a screw-thread cut upon their
entire length, pass through the ends of the ebonite strips,
which may be secured in any position upon the rods by bolts
one above and one below each strip (figs. 1, 2, and 3). At
the centre of each of the two outside plates, and perpendicular
to them, is fastened a heavy brass tube. A rod, half of which
is brass and half ebonite, slides in this tube, the ebonite
portion extending between the plates; and the whole is capable
of being moved in the tube by means of a rack and pinion.
 A scale, divided into twentieths of a centim., is marked upon
 the brass portion of the rod, and a vernier is attached to the
 side of a section cut in the tube.    Each of the ebonite rods
 carries at its end between the large plates a thin plane plate
 of glass; its surface facing the centre plate being covered
 with a thin metal foil. These two small plates are as
 nearly as possible parallel to the parallel large plates, and
 their position between them is given by the vernier scale.
 The two outside plates, B and C, are connected by a brass
 rod, as shown in fig. 1. At the centre of this rod is a brass
 ball kept well polished, which is capable of adjustment
 towards or away from the centre plate, by having the ends of
 the brass rod made to slide in tubes fitted to the two outside
 plates. The ball may also be rotated about the rod as an axis,
 or moved up and down. Another ball, nearly opposite the
 first, is fastened to the centre plate by a short metal pin,
 which permits it also to be rotated. This arrangement of the
 two balls allows them to have a wide range of adjustment in
 relation to each other, and permits different portions of their
  untarnished surfaces to be brought opposite.
     This apparatus is arranged as follows:—The two outside
  plates are connected to the earth. One terminal of a large
  induction-coil is also connected to the earth, while the
  other is attached to the ball, n, which is fastened to the centre
  plate. When the balls are separated about 6 or 8 millim.,
  sparks pass between them when the coil is put in operation.
     We have here an oscillating electric system. The lines of
  force divide themselves between the two halves of the appa
  ratus, reaching from the centre plate to the two outside plates.
  In the region of the small plates, the field may be considered
  as practically uniform. Hence, if these two small plates are
  at equal distances from the centre plate, which we consider for

80        Mr. E. F. Northrup on the Specific Inductive
the present as midway between the outside plates, they are
always at the same potential with respect to each other.
   If a slab of dielectric be now placed upon the centre plate
and beneath the movable plate, it will have two effects: 1st,
to make the capacity upon its side of the centre plate greater
than it is upon the other side; and, 2nd, to raise the potential
at any point above it to a higher value than is the potential
at a corresponding point upon the opposite side of the middle
plate. Therefore, in order to keep the two small plates at an
equal potential in reference to each other, they must be
placed at unequal distances from the centre plate. The value
of the specific inductive capacity of a substance is deduced in
a manner presently to be shown, from the relative positions
of these plates. Either one or two slabs of dielectric may be
used, and several different dispositions may be given to the
apparatus in a manner serving to prove the correctness of the
determinations.
   As the object of the experiment is to make a comparison
of the values of the specific inductive capacity when obtained
under slowly and rapidly oscillating fields, it becomes necessary,
in obtaining the value under the latter condition, to completely
separate out any slow changes in potential, which the centre
plate may be subject to, from the rapid changes which take
place when oscillation occurs, and which alone are to be made
use of. It follows as a consequence of the large self-induction
of the secondary of the induction-coil, that the potential of
the plate to which the coil is attached rises slowly at first,
until, finally, it becomes sufficiently high to break down the
dielectric of the spark-gap ; the rapid oscillations occurring
only during the passage of the sparks. The following method
was successfully employed to tell when the movable plates
had the same potential in reference to each other, and to
“weed.” out the effects of the rapid oscillation to be used
from any effects of slow changes in potential which might
take place.
   Two fine wires were led from the movable plates to the
primary of a highly insulated transformer which was distant
about 2 feet from the apparatus (figs. 1 and 2). The
secondary of the transformer had its terminals end in a spark
gap. This was made by approximating the points of two
needles, fastened to the end of a small slab of paraffin held in
a wooden clamp. One needle was made to slide in a fine
glass tube, to allow the length of the spark-gap to be readily
adjusted. It may be mentioned here that any device which has
an appreciable capacity as compared with that of the movable
plates cannot be employed to show when these plates have

            Capacity of Solids under Varying Fields.          81
the same potential, if the spark-gap is used directly connected
to the plates; and such is the case when the apparatus
is used with slowly varying fields. When the plates are
connected with the primary of the transformer, it is not a
disadvantage to add capacity to the secondary. However,
after trying a large number of devices such as a telephone,
electrometer, electroscope, &c., a spark-gap was found to be
the simplest, most accurate, and in all respects the most con
venient arrangement both with slowly changing and oscillating
fields. One reason why the spark-gap best serves the purpose
is because it requires at least 300 volts to make a spark pass,
and consequently small and irregular alterations in potential
are not shown.    An electrometer-needle, on the other hand,
keeps up a continual oscillation which is very confusing. A
lens was adjusted in front of the spark-gap, and the room
darkened when readings were taken. The transformer which
was finally adopted, after many trials of different forms, con
sisted of fine wire wound upon two glass tubes which slid
over each other; the wire upon the inner one forming the
primary, that upon the outer one the secondary. The inside
tube was 1% inches in diameter and 7 inches long. This tube
was given a thin coating of paraffin to insure high insulation;
and in this was traced, with the aid of a lathe, a uniform spiral
groove, there being in all 55 turns, 16 to the inch. No. 42
copper wire was wound in this groove, and the ends, soldered
to terminal loops of somewhat larger wire, were secured at
the ends of the tubes with drops of sealing-wax. The
secondary, made in the same manner, consisted of 116 turns
of wire of the same size, wound in a groove 35 turns to the
inch. When all is in proper adjustment for oscillating fields,
and the two small plates are at unequal potentials, bright
sparks pass at the detector spark-gap, whenever rapid oscilla
tions in the potential of the centre plate occur. If, however,
the two balls (p and n, fig. 1, Pl. III.) are so far separated
that no sparks can pass between them, the potential of the
centre plate is then only varying at a slow rate and no sparks
pass at the detector spark-gap, for the change of induction in
the secondary is not sufficiently rapid to raise the potential to
the 300 volts or more required to break down the dielectric.
This point was carefully tested by working the coil—which
had a sparking distance of 4 inches—to its full capacity and
so placing the movable plates as to be always at the greatest
difference of potential in reference to each other.       Unless
'' passed !' the balls, no sparks whatever passed at
the detector spark-gap. But whenever sparks did pass
between the balls, so that rapid oscillations were taking place,

     f, now, the transformer is dispensed with, and the wires
from the movable plates are connected directly to the spark
gap, and the two balls (p and n, fig. 1) are separated so that
no sparks can pass between them, then evidently we have a
slowly changing field, and the movable plates are, as before
shown, at the same potential in reference to each other when
the sparks go out at the detector spark-gap. The manner of
taking the observations and the results obtained will be given

   In this case plate A   #.    4) is placed exactly midway be
tween the plates B and C. Two equal slabs of dielectric are
used, one being placed upon C, the other upon A. The
thickness of the blocks of dielectric and the distances between
BA and CA are determined by considerations respecting the
approximate value of K for the dielectric. If these distances
are correctly taken, positions may be found for plates N and
M where they are always at the same potential, and where
they are approximately in the centre of the spaces between
the plates and the dielectric.                                 -

          Use of Apparatus according to First Method.
   According to the theory given under Case I., the value of
 K may be obtained when the capacities of the two sides of the
 apparatus are unlike and unknown. It was found, however,
 unless the apparatus is so disposed that the capacities of the
 two sides are nearly equal, that the value of K obtained is
 not quite exact in the case of slowly varying fields, and that
 with oscillating fields no result whatever can be obtained.
 The formula is based upon the assumption that static condi
 tions hold. Now the formula assumes that, when the centre
 plate has a given potential, the surface-density of each side of

86       Mr. E. F. Northrup on the Specific Inductive
the plate is proportional to the capacity of the corresponding
side of the apparatus. This, however, is not strictly true. As
the alternations grow more rapid, the average surface-densities
upon the two sides of the middle plate tend to become equal,
though the capacities of the two sides of the apparatus are
unlike. Moreover, if the capacities of the two sides differ
largely, there is such an interference of waves, when rapid
 oscillations are taking place, that no position can be found for
 the movable plates where their potentials in reference to each
 other will always be equal, and consequently the sparks in the
 detector spark-gap cannot be made to disappear. This diffi
 culty is not observable if the capacities are made nearly the
 same. It becomes necessary then, in using the apparatus
with one slab of dielectric, to have the capacities of the two
 sides approximately equal. This adjustment can be made in
a manner to be shown presently.
    In taking observations by this method we proceed thus:
 The plates M and N are first brought into contact with the
 centre plate and the zero positions upon the scales are deter
 mined. The block of dielectric to be tested is then placed
 upon the plate A, and plate M is brought to rest upon it.
The reading upon the vernier scale gives the thickness of the
block. Great care, of course, is taken to cut this block so
that its two faces are parallel. We may now leave plate M
resting upon the dielectric or give it any desired position
above it. The wires leading from N and M are first connected
 directly to the spark-gap and the balls, p and n, are so far sepa
 rated that no spark can pass between them. In the experi
ment as tried, two large coils were connected in series so as
to make the period of the slowly changing field as long as
 possible. The coil being set in action, the sparks at the
 detector spark-gap are observed, and the plate N is slowly
 moved up and down until a point is found where the sparks
 entirely disappear. There is a distanee of about 2 millim.
 through which the plate may be moved without the sparks
 appearing. A reading is taken at the upper and at the lower
 limit of this space, and the mean taken as the true reading.
 The limits of accuracy of the method are confined to the
 accuracy with which this setting of the plate N can be made.
 Any other error should be attributed to crudeness in the con
 struction of the apparatus, and not be considered as intrinsic -
 to the method. These readings so taken, give by applying
 formula (8) an approximate value of K for slowly changing
 fields. The capacities of the two sides may now be made
 nearly equal by approaching the two lower plates until they
 are the proper distance apart. This distance is determined

   This value of D, then, makes the capacities of the two sides
the same, within the limits in which K is known. A still
closer value of K may now be obtained as before. Two
adjustments of the apparatus are sufficient for an accurate
determination. If the adjustment is exactly right a and a
cancel out in expression (3), and hence
                           K=     di
                               d2–d4.
Readings should now be taken with the different values given
to d1. The closeness of the agreement of the values of K
then obtained furnish a test of their accuracy.
   To obtain, next, the value of K under oscillating fields we
proceed as follows :-The two balls, n and p, are approached
so that sparks can pass between them, the distance being
chosen such that the best conditions may exist for oscillations
taking place. The movable plates are then connected to
the primary of the transformer, and the spark-gap to the
secondary. Great care should be taken that the primary
leads are symmetrically arranged and of the same length,
and that no conductor be near them.        Carelessness on this
point led for some time to conflicting results. Waves of
energy should reach the transformer along both leads at the
same instant, which they will not do if the leads are of un
equal length. The plates are set by means of the spark-gap,
as in the case of slowly changing fields. If the value of k
comes out much smaller than in the case of slow fields,
another adjustment of the apparatus may be necessary. This
being made, another determination can be made for slowly
varying fields, using formula (8), which for small differences
in the capacities of the two sides gives results correct within
the limits of other necessary errors. Thus, after the appa
ratus has been correctly arranged, a comparison by this

88       Mr. E. F. Northrup on the Specific Inductive
method of the values of K under slowly changing and oscil
lating fields is possible, without changing the plates. How
ever, if the capacities are equal for the two sides when slowly
changing fields are used, it was found by a careful test that
the simple formula, K=       *:   J., may still be used when the
field is oscillating, although the capacities of the two sides
are now slightly different. The reason for this is that with
oscillating fields the average surface-densities upon the two
sides of the centre plate are the same, and hence cancel out
of formula (3). The proof of this rests upon the fact that K
was found to be the same for all positions of d4, and this
would not be the case if the formula were incorrect. Thus,
as shown,

admits of results being obtained more quickly and satisfac
torily than in the one just described, and should be preferred
to the other if two equal slabs of dielectric are obtainable.

wax. The block used was a little larger than the plates and
4:34 centim. thick. Its melting-point was determined to be
543° Centigrade. Only one suitable block was readily ob
tainable, and so the first method was employed. Previously

to obtaining the final result many different dispositions of the
apparatus were tried, and the method tested in most of its
features. Experiments were also made upon a block of
paraffin smaller than the large plate; but it was found that
the results were incorrect in this case, which fact makes it
necessary to use blocks of the same size as or larger than the
plates of the apparatus.
   In obtaining the final values, the apparatus was adjusted
so that d2+ da=3:51 centim., and D was changed until the
capacities of the two sides were nearly equal. In all cases
superior and inferior readings were taken as previously

that published in a preliminary article; further experience

   Thus K for paraffin is 3 per cent, less in oscillating fields
than in slowly varying fields.
                       Observations upon Glass.
   Plate-glass seems to be the most important substance upon
which to experiment, as its specific inductive capacity has
been found very different by different observers, and because
the values of K found for it are much greater than the square
of its index of refraction. The greatest pains were taken to
obtain certain results for this substance; and as the values
obtained differ considerably from those found by other ob
servers, it is hoped my readers will pardon the mention of
some tedious details.
   The second method was employed as described under
Case II. Twelve plates of American plate-glass were used,
six plates being placed in each half of the apparatus. By
making the proper selection of plates for each side, the two
piles were made of the same thickness. The density of this
glass was determined with a Jolly balance and found to be
2.678.     All measurements of dimensions were made with an
excellent pair of vernier calipers and repeated a large number
of times. Referring to fig. 4 for the meaning of the letters,
the following dimensions were employed. These are all given
in scale-divisions which equal one half the metric system :—
P=10:21, di- 11:964, d. E5:010, d =x,
   In order that there might be no springing of the plates
after all had been adjusted, eight ebonite posts were placed
at the corners as shown in fig. 4. The plate N was supported
upon three thin tubes of ebonite.        All surfaces where there
could be any harmful leakage of electricity, such as along the
supports to the plates M and N, were covered with a thin
coating of paraffin. The small plates were connected to the
spark-gap or transformer with two No. 36 bare copper wires,

             Capacity of Solids under varying Fields.         91
each 23 feet long. These wires were supported near the
spark-gap at the ends of glass rods covered with paraffin.
The transformer and spark-gap were also carefully insulated
by glass and paraffin. These precautions are necessary by
reason of the fact that a small leakage of electricity from
the surface of the small plates changes the reading in a marked
 manner. Leakage of electricity, however, could be seen by
 darkening the room, and could also be detected by a peculiar
manner in which the sparks went out. This was carefully
 looked for and avoided. In making the test with oscillating
 fields, half of the readings were taken with the transformer
 in one position and then the other half were taken with the
 ends of the transformer reversed, and the mean of the two
 series taken as the true reading. This becomes necessary
 unless the primary and secondary of the transformer are
 symmetrically arranged in reference to each other. Indeed
 it was found that the readings could be perceptibly changed
 by sliding the secondary coil over the primary into different
  positions. It is easily seen, however, that if the primary and
 secondary always have the same relation, and the connexions
  to the primary are reversed after half the readings are taken,
 the error is eliminated in the mean of all the readings.
  The current through the coil was at times large and again
  small, and also occasionally reversed; but these changes, as
  expected, did not affect the results. The length of the indi
  cator spark-gap could also be changed without affecting the
  mean reading. Readings for slow fields were taken in sets
  of ten and averaged. The mean of twenty such sets, taken
 with slow fields, was 3.097. The greatest departure from
 the mean was +:09.       Finally, from (17), when di = 11:964,
 d2=5.010, d = 3.097, we obtain K=6.254.
                         Called K = 6.25.
     The value was next obtained for oscillating fields, no
  change being made in the apparatus, except to connect in the
  transformer and approach the balls to the proper distance for
  sparks to pass and cause oscillations. Readings were taken
  in sets of twenty each. Following is the average of each of
 the sets taken :—
                              10-982
                              10-910

                              10:970
     The connexions to the transformer were now reversed :—

                 11:000
                 10.998
                 10.999 = mean of 160 readings.
                   8:030 = zero-reading of scale.
                   2.969 = d.
   d2=5.010, di = 11:964, and hence K = 5.861.
                          Called K^ = 5.86.
    These results, then, give the specific inductive capacity of
 plate-glass 6.2 per cent, less in oscillating than in slowly
changing fields.
    Though the relative values of K for glass under these two
 conditions seemed to be undoubtedly correct, it was not ex
 pected to find such a low value for slow fields; and so, to
verify the results obtained, the apparatus was taken apart
 and put together again with the dimensions changed and the
experiment repeated for slow fields. The distances chosen
were P=6'401, d2=3:524, di=11:964; and as the result of
thirty readings d=1:574.             Whence K=6:14, or 1.8 per
cent. less than before.
   These results show that there is a decrease in the value of
K for paraffin and glass when the alternations of force are
rapid, but that the change is much smaller than several
observers have stated. M. Blondlot found K for glass in
oscillating fields to be 2.84. J. J. Thomson obtained for
glass the value 2.7 (see ‘Recent Researches in Electricity
and Magnetism,” by J. J. Thomson, p. 471 and following).
Ewing found the value of mirror-glass by a method of oscil
lations (Physical Review, July and August 1894, p. 51) to be
5.84. His calculated value for glass was 6'24.
   The above method, it is believed, is capable of giving
accurate results if the apparatus be well made, and it is hoped
that the detailed description given above will enable anyone
to readily repeat the experiment. Should this be done, I
would suggest that the apparatus might with advantage be
made considerably smaller.                                        -
   I desire to say, in conclusion, that I am greatly indebted
to Professor Henry A. Rowland for suggestions, and especially
for the opportunity of performing the experiment”.

Mr. Northrup, and only one or two very minor points are my own.—

             IV. “Densities in the Earth's Crust.”
                      By J. BRILL, M.A."
   N the seventeenth chapter of his “Physics of the Earth's
      Crust, the Rev. O. Fisher has investigated an arrange
ment of the densities and thicknesses of the different layers
composing the Earth’s crust, which would give, to a high
degree of approximation, a uniform value for gravity over the
Earth's surface. As attempts have recently been made, in
the pages of this Journal and elsewhere, to criticise the method
of investigation, it occurred to me that it might be desirable
to give an independent investigation of the equations obtained
by Mr. Fisher. This might possibly serve to render the
meaning of the work clearer than is done in the book.
   In the chapter referred to above the central nucleus is
supposed to consist of concentric spherical shells of uniform
density, so that it will only be necessary to consider the
portion outside this, which we will hereafter refer to as the
“crust.” We will suppose this portion to consist of m layers,
whose densities, commencing from the outermost, are re
spectively p1, p.2, ..., p. We will also use the symbols
ki, k2, ..., k, to denote the distances of the lower surfaces
of the respective layers from the Earth's surface, these dis
tances being measured along a radius of the Earth. This will
be more convenient than taking symbols to denote the thick
nesses of the layers. Since we suppose the layers forming
the crust to be of varying density and thickness, we see that
the p’s will vary from one radius to another, as also will the
k's, with the single exception of k. We must suppose
k, constant, as we have laid down that the inner surface of
the Earth's crust shall be a sphere concentric with the outer
O116.
   Let O be the Earth's centre, and P a fixed point on its
surface. We will take OP as the axis of polar coordinates,
and consider the vertical component of the attraction at P of
a polar element taken somewhere within the crust. If p be
the density of the element we are considering, this will be
represented by the expression
                   * sin 6(a–rcos 6)

   We will change the variables in this expression by writing
cos 6= u and r = ah. The expression then becomes

where we have rejected the negative sign that arises in the
transformation from 6 to u, as we afterwards intend to
integrate with regard to u in the direction in which that
variable increases.
   Now, if h be less than unity, as it is in the case we are con
sidering, we may write
             ' = 1 +h P1 + h^P2 + ... + h"P, +&c.,

and therefore
      pu-h
 (1–2ph + /*): = p +h(uP1-1)+...+ h"(uP, –P,-1)+&c.
   Now, we have the formula
               (2n + 1)/uP, = (n+1)P, 11 + nP,-1,
and therefore
                               m+1
              AP,-P,-1= 2n + 1 ( n+1-P,-1).
  Thus we obtain
       —h                                      +1
 (I-'-e H/(P-n +...+ £ h"(P.11-P,-)+&c.
   If we differentiate this with respect to u, we deduce
     1-Ah       - 1 +#h dP,              n+ 1     (' ''')-       +&c.

                 = 1 + 2h P1 + ... + (n+1)h"P, +&c.,
since

   Thus the expression for the portion contributed to the value
of gravity at P by our element is
     ap dh du døb{h*+2/"P1 + ... + (n-1)h"P.-2+&c.}.
   Imagine a solid element cut out of the crust by radii drawn

term obtained by the integration of that containing h". The

       We cannot evaluate this term until we know the manner
    in which u depends upon u and p. As u and b vary the
    quantity u will experience discontinuities in its variation, but
    it is doubtful if anything of the nature of an abrupt discon
    tinuity would arise. If such discontinuities arise they must
    be rare. Of course at the seaboard there is an abrupt variation
    in the density of the topmost layer, but the depth of the sea
    is at first quite small as regards our problem, and afterwards
    increases with a fair approximation to continuity.
       We have supposed m layers to exist, but this is to be taken
    as the maximum number. There may be less than m in
    certain portions of the crust, and this may be provided for by
    considering certain pairs of consecutive k's to be equal
    throughout the said portions.
       The equations introduced above as assumptions are prac
    tically the same as those discussed by Mr. Fisher. It is
    evident that we cannot introduce more than a certain number
    of these assumptions without making the crust to consist of        ---
    uniform concentric shells. But, working on the assumption             *
                                                                           -

    that this is not the case, we find that we have to stay our
    approximation at a still earlier point than this consideration

       Photographic Action of Stationary Light-Waves.             97
would appear to indicate. This will be evident from a con
sideration of the method used on page 241 of the “Physics
of the Earth's Crust, and its subsequent applications in
chapters xvii. and xxvi. We have, in each of the cases dis
cussed, gone to the furthest approximation allowable under
the circumstances. The limitations are made perfectly clear
in the book, and I do not think that there is anything to be
added to this part of the work.
   Finally, we see that we are left with a residual effect, which
is undoubtedly very small, and it is not impossible that such
an effect might exist in the case of the Earth.
V. The Significance of Wiener's Localization of the Photo
   graphic Action of Stationary Light-Waves. By J. LARMoR,
   F.R.S., Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge".
Th:       experiments by which Wiener demonstrated f that,
       when stationary plane-polarized optical undulations are
produced in a photographic film, by reflexion of a stream of
incident plane-polarized light at a metallic or other backing,
the photographic action occurs at the antinodes of Fresnel’s
vibration-vector and not at the nodes, have been employed by
its author and others to decide between the various theories
of light. If for purposes of precise description we utilize
the terminology of the electric theory of light, which formally
includes all the other theories by proper ' of the vibra
tion-vector, we may say that the photographic action takes
place at the antinodes of the electric vector which corresponds
to Fresnel's vibration, and not at the intermediate antinodes
of the magnetic vector which corresponds to MacCullagh's
and to Neumann's vibration.
   The crucial experiment of Wiener relates to the case when
the angle of £ is half a right angle, so that the direct
and reflected waves which interfere are at right angles to each
other. If the vibration take place along the direction of
intersection of the two wave-planes, it will present a series of
nodes and antinodes; but if in the perpendicular direction
there will not be such alternations of intensity. The experi
ment showed that when the light is polarized in the plane of
incidence, the photographic    #.     develops a series of bands;
but when it is polarized in the perpendicular plane these
bands are absent.
   The argument employed is that the photographic effect will

be greatest at those places in the stationary wave-train where
the vibration is most intense; and the conclusion is drawn
from it that the actual vibration is represented by Fresnel's
vector and not by MacCullagh’s ; in other words, that the
vibrations of polarized light are at right angles to the plane
of polarization. The force of this argument, as against
MacCullagh's theory, would, however, be evaded if the vector
of that theory were taken to represent something different
from the linear displacement of the aether, or if vibrations
were excited in the molecule by rotation instead of transla
tion, or by stress, as Poincaré has pointed out ".
   But as a matter of fact it seems difficult to assign any
reason of the above simple kind, on either theory, in favour
of the photographic disturbance occurring at the antinodes
rather than at the nodes of the optical vibration. The re
markable suggestion thrown out by Lord Rayleigh some time
' to Wiener's experiments, and afterwards verified by
  ippmann, that certain effects in colour photography produced
by Fox Talbot and Becquerel were really due to this kind of
localization of the photographic effect, is not in opposition to
such a view ; for the consideration adduced was simply that
a localization, periodic with the waves, would, if it happened
to exist, produce effects like the observed ones. At any rate,
the observed localization demonstrates the important result
that the effect is due to a specific dynamical action of the
waves, and not to mere general absorption of the radiation.
    Ilet us consider the actual circumstances of the case.
There are about 10” molecules of the sensitive medium in the
length of a single wave of light: thus in the stationary wave
train all the parts of a single molecule would at any instant
be moving with a sensibly uniform velocity, which increases
and diminishes periodically, The vibration of the molecule
 would thus be, were it not for the influence of differences of
inertia or elasticity between its parts and the surrounding
 aether, very nearly a swaying to and fro of it as a whole :
if it were exactly this, it could not be expected to produce
 any breaking up of the molecule at all. Moreover, as at the
 antinodes of the vibration there is movement but no stress in
 the medium, so at the nodes there is stress but no movement;
 and it does not seem at all clear that alternating stress might
 not be as potent a factor in disintegration as alternatin
 motion. A representation has been constructed by ''
 Kelvin f of a system in which internal vibrations can be

excited by simple translation, by means of the device of an
outer shell imbedded in the aether and containing inside it
masses with spring connexions; and such a system might also
be adjusted so as to respond to simple rotation, and therefore be
excited at the nodes of the wave-train instead of the antinodes.
   A theory based in this manner on difference of inertia must
take the density of the aether to be very minute compared
with that of matter; therefore if the molecule is to have free
periods of the same order of magnitude as the periods of the
incident light-waves, the elastic forces acting between the
atoms and concerned in these periods must be very intense.
But Lord Kelvin's well-known estimate of the rigidity of the
aether on this hypothesis makes it very small compared with
the ordinary rigidity of material bodies". In fact on
Pouillet's data, which imply a considerable underestimate,
the energy of the solar radiation near the sun's surface is
about 4 x 10" ergs per cubic centimetre; it easily follows that
if the amplitude of the aethereal disturbance is, say, e times
the wave-length, the density of the aether must be about 1/10*e,
and its rigidity, which is equal to the density multiplied by
the square of the velocity of propagation, therefore 1/10e".
On an elastic solid theory it is desirable to have the density
very small: thus if we adopt 10-” as the maximum likely
value of e, the density of the aether comes out 10-” of that of
 water, and its rigidity about 10", whereas the rigidity of steel
or glass is of the order 10".
    Now at first sight it would appear that the elastic tractions
 exerted by an aether of such small rigidity on an imbedded
 molecule swaying backwards and forwards in it, would be
 vanishingly small compared with the elastic forces between
 its constituent atoms which are concerned with free vibrations
 of the kind of period under consideration; and that therefore
 they would be quite incompetent to produce violent disturb
 ance in the molecule.       But on a closer examination this
 difficulty may to a considerable extent be evaded.
    Let us imagine an imbedded rigid nodule of linear dimen
 sion L, and let the force necessary to displace it in the aether
 in any manner through a distance a be Lt. Let us compare
 with it a similar nodule of linear dimensions cI displaced
 through a distance ko. There is complete dynamical simi
 larity between the two cases; the strains at corresponding
 points in the aether are equal, and therefore so are £ trac
 tions per unit area. Thus the forcive necessary in the latter
 case to produce the displacement kit is k"Ia, and therefore to
 produce the same displacement was in the previous case a

100      Mr. J. Larmor on Wiener's Localization of the
forcive &La is required. If now instead of comparing the
total forcives in the two cases we compare the forcives per
unit volume, an increase of linear dimensions in the ratio of
* to one diminishes this forcive in the ratio of k” to one.
Thus, if only the atoms are taken small enough, an aether of
very slight rigidity can exert a forcive on them which, esti
mated per unit volume, is of any order of magnitude we
please. The features of the case are in fact analogous to
those of the suspension of small bodies, such as motes, in a
 viscous fluid medium like the atmosphere: if only the par
ticles are small enough they will float for an indefinitely
   reat time against the force of gravity, even be they as
 £ as platinum,-the only limit being in that case the one
imposed by the molecular discreteness of the air itself.
    It would appear that the application of this principle does
 much to vivify the notion of an elastic solid aether. A medium
 of this kind, which is excessively rare and, as a consequence,
 of very feeble elasticity, would exert practically negligible
 tractions on the surfaces of a mass of matter in bulk, while
 it may exert relatively very powerful ones on the individual
 atoms of which the mass is composed if only they are suf
 ficiently small, it being of course supposed that the structure
of the medium itself is absolutely continuous. And it would
 even appear that a medium of very small density and
 rigidity may be competent to excite powerful vibrations in
the molecules notwithstanding the strength of the forcives
which hold them together.
    We may thus imagine a working illustration of a ponder
 able transparent medium of elastic solid type as made up of
 very small spherical nodules of great density and rigidity
 dispersed through the aether and imbedded in it. We may
 even imagine these nodules to be collected into more or less
 independent groups, each of which will have free periods of
 relative vibrations of its own nearly independent of other
 groups, in the manner now well known in connexion with
 Prof. Ewing's model of a magnetic medium. A wave running
 across such a medium may excite these groups, and thus
 illustrate the theory of selective absorption by means of a
 system in which    :     the elasticity of the ambient medium is
 operative, but no other internal forcive.
    The explanation of a very weak medium exciting such
 powerful tractions implies of course strains of enormous
 intensity, so that its limits of perfect elasticity must be taken
 enormously wide compared with anything we know in ordi
nary matter. The magnitude of the strains also requires
that the displacement of an atom relative to the aether must

         Photographic Action of Stationary Light-Wares.                 101
 be a considerable fraction of its diameter; and this is suf
 ficiently secured by the large value of e above that which is
 required to keep down the density of the aether, combined with
 the great relative density of the atom. It would thus seem to
 be possible to account for sufficiently large differential trac
 tions between the component atoms of a molecule, especially
 if some of them lie well under the lee of others, to produce
 brisk internal vibration.
    In this way we could imagine the construction of a sort of
 model illustrative of an elastic solid theory of refraction,
 including selective absorption and other such phenomena, in
 the form in which it is presented by von Helmholtz and
 others. In the simpler case, in which the atoms are not
 grouped into systems capable of synchronous free internal
 vibrations, let (#, m, #) denote the mean displacement of the
 free aether, and (#1, m1, #1) that of the atoms. Then the
 equations of vibration assume the forms

 instead of the scalar a.
    The conclusion, then, is that in this limited range an elastic
 solid theory of a very rare aether is not so much at fault as
 would at first sight appear.
    A theory based on difference of rigidity without difference
 of inertia, after MacCullagh's manner, would have to be
 realized by ascribing to the atom an atmosphere of intrinsic
 aethereal strain, instead of endowing it with great inertia;
 and this could only be possible in a rotational aether, and
 would in fact form a mechanical representation of the electric
 theory. As such it must be expected to give an account of
   * There are introduced by von Helmholtz (Wiss. Abh. ii. p. 216) in
addition, a forcive proportional to the absolute displacement of the atom,
and a frictional one proportional to its absolute  :          The former is
 derived-from the idea that the heavy central masses of the atoms are
unmoved by the aether, and only outlying satellites are affected by its
motion. On our present view this restriction might be dispensed with,
except in so far as it renders possible an illustrative theory of absorption
of an analytically simple character. The consequences of the above equa
tions are set out by various writers, e. g. Carvallo (Comptes Rendus, exii.
p. 522).

102       Mr. J. Larmor on Wiener's Localization of the
the phenomena of electricity as well as those of light", and
in such an account is founded one of its chief claims.
    A development of the electric theory has recently been
essayed by von Helmholtzf, on the basis of the formal equa
tions of Heaviside and Hertz, in which the free aether is still
supposed to be an elastic medium of excessively small density
in which the dense atoms are imbedded.                 If such a view
 should turn out to be the basis of a consistent body of theory,
the considerations given above with respect to the intensities
 of molecular tractions would have a bearing on it also.
     Let us now consider more particularly the explanation that
 would be offered by the electric theory of light. The difference
 between a material medium and a vacuum consists in an altered
 effective dielectric coefficient. This difference is simply and
 naturally explained by the hypothesis that the material mole
 cules are polar owing to their associated atoms having atomic
 charges equal in amount but opposite in sign, and that they
 therefore possess electric moments just as the molecules of a
 magnet possess magnetic moments. An electric force thus
 tends to pull the two constituents of a molecule asunder; and
 its full intensity is exerted in this manner, not merely its dif
 ferential intensity over the range of the molecular volume. But
 a magnetic force has no such tendency even when we take the
 molecule to be magnetically polarized, because the two poles
 of a magnetic element cannot be dissociated from each other;
 the magnetic moment is thus directly associated with the
 atom, not with the molecule. In the case of the stationary
 light-waves the antinodes of the electric force are therefore
 places where alternating disturbances of a kind suitable to
  produce decomposition of the molecules are maintained, and
 may produce strong effects through sympathetic molecular
  vibration or otherwise; but at the intermediate antinodes of
 the magnetic force the individual ultimate atoms may be
 disturbed by the alternating magnetic force, but there is no
  tendency to separation of the constituents of the molecule.
  On the electric theory, therefore, there is abundant justifica
  tion both for the magnitude of the effect produced, and for
  its localization as determined by Wiener's experimental in
 vestigation.
     The theory, noticed first it seems by Weber, which ascribes
  molecular magnetism to the orbital rotation round each other
  of ionic charges, and which has very strong recommendations
  from the point of view of the dynamics of the aether, may
  form a partial exception to this statement. It leaves the
     * (f. “A Dynamical Theory . . . .” Phil. Trans. 1884, §§ 122–124.

question open as to whether the principal part of the mag
netic moment is due to orbital motions in the atoms or to the
motions of the constituent atoms in the molecules; though it
suggests strongly the latter alternative. In that case there
will usually be a differential magnetic action of the field as
between these moving atoms; but the magnetic actions on
positive and negative ions will be by no means equal and
opposite, as is true of the electric actions. Thus, for example,
in the limiting case of two equal and opposite ions revolving
round each other, the elements of the equivalent ionic con
vection currents will be at each instant parallel, and there will
be no differential magnetic forcive at all; there will also be no
magnetic moment; but the electric differential action will
retain its full force.
   It is well understood, and in accordance with this explana
tion, that the energy of chemical combination of atoms into
molecules is almost entirely that of electrostatic attraction of
their atomic charges. In fact the electric attraction between
them diminishes according to the law of inverse square with
increasing distance, their magnetic attraction according to the
law of the inverse fourth power: if these forces are of the
same order of magnitude in the actual configuration of the
atoms in the molecule, the work done by the former during
their combination must be almost indefinitely greater than
the work done by the latter.
   If we contemplate the purely dynamical basis which must
underlie the descriptive explanations of the electric theory of
light, it is difficult to see how there can be any place for a
theory of the aether loaded by the material molecules, which
dynamical views usually associated with Fresnel's theory
demand. There could be no polarity in the inertia of a
mere load, such as the present considerations require. On
the other hand, the presence of electrically polarized mole
cules is effectively a diminution of the elasticity of the lumi
niferous medium ; and I have tried to show elsewhere " that
the principles of MacCullagh's theory of optics are in sub
stantial agreement with all the general features of our
electrical and optical knowledge.
   It is definitely implied in the electromotive, as distinguished
from an electrodynamic, character of the electric theory of
light, that the atomic charges vibrate in unson with the
light-waves, quite unimpeded by any material inertia of their
atoms. This hypothesis is conceivable and natural, indepen
dently of any particular explanation, on the theory that the

104      Mr. J. Larmor on Wiener's Localization of the
atoms are themselves intrinsic mobile configurations of stress
or motion, or both together, in the ultimate medium.
   [It is not without interest to consider how far the conception
mentioned above of an isotropic solid medium of very small
density, with very massive minute nodules imbedded in it but
exerting no direct forcives on each other, will carry us in
forming a representation of optical phenomena. The theory
is of the Young-Sellmeier type, because each nodule has one
or more free periods conditioned by its form and by the
surrounding elasticity.
   On eliminating (#1, mi, #1) from the equations expressed
above, we obtain the vibrational equations of the aether,
supposed thus loaded. Its elastic properties are found to be
conserved intact, but the effective density as    2

                                                        When the
coefficient a is of aeolotropic type, by reason either of the
form or the distribution of the nodules, we have effectively
an isotropically elastic medium with aeolotropic inertia; this
leads to Fresnel's wave-surface, provided the elasticity is
labile in Lord Kelvin’s sense. The theory also leads to a
formula for ordinary dispersion, of the usually admitted type
(Ketteler's) for isotropic media; but, on the other hand, it is
in default by assigning a dispersional origin to double refrac
tion.   If we wish to include the minute effect known as the
dispersion of the optic axes in crystals, it will be necessary to
assume for the elastic stress between aether and matter a
somewhat more general form, involving (after von Helmholtz)
absolute as well as relative displacement, but always of course
remaining linear.
   The assumption of elasticity of labile type also allows an
escape from the usual difficulties of a solid aether in the
matter of reflexion. In that problem the elasticity would
naturally be taken continuous across the interface, the volume
occupied by the molecules being on this hypothesis extremely
small compared with that occupied by the aether.
   We may further amend the theory, by getting rid of the
difficulties associated with lability, at the same time avoiding
the difficulty as to how a body can move through a perfect
solid medium, if we take the aether to be a rotationally elastic
fluid, and retain the material load as before.
   But an essential and fundamental difficulty will still remain.
It is the extremely small volume-density of the energy involved
in radiation which permits a very small inertia, and conse
quently a small elasticity, to be assigned to the aether, and so
prevents it from acting as an appreciable drag or exerting an

        Photographic Action of Stationary Light-Waves. 105.
appreciable force on finite bodies moving through it. But these
very properties would incapacitate it for acquiring the very
large volume-densities of energy that would have to be
associated with it in order to explain electrodynamic phe
In Omena.
    Any representation which would make the aether consist
of molecules of ordinary matter is open to the objection that
the thermal kinetic energy of gases and other material systems
must then, in accordance with Maxwell’s law of distribution
of energy, largely reside in it. But, on the other hand, if
we hold to the view of matter which was first rendered pre
cise by Lord Kelvin’s theory of vortex atoms, namely, that
the aether is the single existing medium and that atoms of
matter are intrinsic singularities of motion or strain which
belong to it, then there is no inducement to assume for the
aether a molecular structure at all, or to make its inertia any
thing comparable with the inertia of the atoms on whose play
the thermal energy of the movements of the matter consists.
On such a theory the inertia, and the resulting kinetic energy,
of the matter may be hard to explain, but it is certainly
something different from the inertia of the underlying
medium in which the atom is merely a form of strain or
motion. On such a theory refraction, and also double refrac
tion, will be caused by the atmosphere of intrinsic strain
which represents the electric charge on the atom; and only
dispersion will be assigned to the influence of sympathetic
vibrations in the atoms or molecules, thus doing away with
any difficulty of the kind mentioned above.
    In the theory of gases the ordinary kinetic energy of the
molecules represents sensible heat, and as such may be derived
for example from the dissipation by friction or otherwise of
the mechanical energy of ordinary masses: it is of the nature
of kinetic energy of the masses of the atoms. But the store
of energy which keeps up radiation is of electromotive kind,
is concerned with displacing electricity, not with moving
matter except indirectly; at least no consistent scheme has
yet been forthcoming which includes both. It is quite con
ceivable that the disturbances which occur in the ordinary
encounters of molecules are of far too gentle a character to
excite the very powerful elasticity which on a certain form of
the electric theory binds together the continuous medium
taking part in optical propagation, any more than a system
of solid balls rushing about in an enclosure bounded by a
heavy continuous rigid solid can excite sensibly the elastic
qualities of that body. The opinion has been widely sup
ported, both on theoretical and experimental grounds, that a

106 Mr. C. T. Blanshard on the Róle of Atomic Heat
gas will not emit its definite radiations however high the
temperature to which it is raised, unless there is chemical
decomposition of the molecules going on. If that be so, the
aether does not act as an equalizer of the kinetic energy
between the different modes of vibration of the molecules,
and the ordinary theory of gases need make no reference to
the aether.
   If I have understood aright, a similar view has been ex
pressed as at any rate a possible explanation of the difficulty
as to the application of Maxwell's distribution theorem in the
theory of gases, by Prof. Boltzmann himself. The law of
distribution of energy is perhaps unassailable for the case of
molecules like small spheres, with three degrees of freedom,
all translational. By including the rotational modes of free
dom, which may be none at all for a monad gas, only two
for a diad, and three for other types, and these possibly not
complete, a sufficient number of freedoms is obtained to cover
the known range of values of the ratio of the specific heats.
The introduction of any vibrational types would make too
many; so on this ground also it is not likely that such types
can enter into those among which the thermal energy is
divided.—December 4.]
WI. The Róle of Atomic Heat in the Periodic Series of the
            Elements. By C. T. BLANSHARD, M.A.”
BY     a study of the latest, or most accurate data of atomic
       heats and melting-points I have been enabled to
arrive at definite relationships between them, which I will
endeavour to set forth. In Grundzüge der theoretischen
Chemie, Leipzig, 1893, p. 106, Lothar Meyer says:—“The
periods of fusibility do not coincide with those of other
physical characters, are also less regular than these, but are
in close relationship to the atomic volume.” With regard to
Dulong and Petit's law, W. Ostwald says (“Outlines of
General Chemistry, English translation, p. 177):—“We can
only note empirically that the law holds good for substances
with atomic weights higher than thirty.”
   A survey of the accompanying curve of atomic heats, made
to correspond with Lothar Meyer's curve of atomic volumes,
will, notwithstanding several blanks and several doubtful
values, demonstrate the two following laws of atomic heat:
   1. The atomic heat decreases in any series from the monad
to the tetrad element, and then increases till a maximum is
reached with the heptad element.

108       Mr. C. T. Blanshard on the Róle of Atomic Heat
   2. The variation is greatest with elements of low atomic
weights, becoming less and less as the atomic weight increases.
   I hope in the next place to show in a fabular form that the
melting-points of the elements are intimately connected with
their atomic heats, and that four general laws govern this con
nexion. Were sufficient data to hand with regard to latent
heat of fusion &c., there is no doubt that many similar relation
ships would be established. There is evidently plenty of work
before physical chemists in this direction. In the arrange
ment of the groups of elements I follow a plan used by Lothar
Meyer, of using Roman numerals combined with lettering.
Thus the Li group is I., the Cu is I.a.; Group II. is Ca &c.;
II. a Be &c.; II.b Fe, Ru, Os. In placing the iron elements
here, and not in a separate group, I am following W. Preyer,
Das genetische System der chemischen Elemente, Berlin, 1893.
The groups are entirely arranged by their atomic heats, but
will be found to be practically identical with Lothar Meyer's
classification. The melting-points taken are the most correct
up to date, from (1) the late T. Carnelley’s “Physico-Chemical
Constants,’ 1887; (2) H. Landolt and R. Börnstein, Phys.
 Chemische Tabellen, Berlin, 1894; (3) The Chemical Society's
Journal. Several determinations are very rough, others are
altogether wanting. The specific heats, which are much more
complete, are from the last two sources and ‘Watts Dictionary
of Chemistry.          They are all taken at as near as possible the
constant t”, 15°. The atomic weights are from Landolt and
Börnstein and the Chemical Society's Journal. From these
and the specific heats I have calculated the atomic heats with
much greater accuracy than has hitherto been thought
necessary. Blanks denote that no reliable data are to hand.
A query denotes that the observation has been made, but not

              in the Periodic Series of the Elements.        111
   The atomic heat affords another proof of Lothar Meyer's
classification of sodium with the alkali metals, rather than
that of Mendeléeff, who, followed by W. Preyer, places it in
the copper group. Its chemical affinities to potassium are
very close; thus E. Augé (Comptes Rendus, 1890, cx. p. 1139)
obtained a sodium alum, by regulating both concentration
and temperature.
   To get comparable results, the specific heats must be
observed at a constant temperature. With regard to melting
point, magnesium presents an irregularity in the zinc group,
if the usual melting-point, 430°, is adopted; but the number
has been corrected by more recent observation, restoring com
plete harmony to the series. The order of melting-points of
Sn and Pb in Group IV., and of Sb and Bi in Group W.,
both apparent anomalies, will be seen to favour, rather than
contradict, the laws of atomic heat and fusion; for in both
cases the atomic heats are reversed to correspond with the
melting-points.
   I have placed cobalt in IV.b, and nickel in VI.b, notwith
standing Zimmermann's values for their atomic weights; and
in doing so, as before, I have been guided entirely by the
atomic heats, leading to Mendeléeff's original classification,
which placed Co before Ni on purely chemical grounds, from
the analogies of the former to Rh and Ir, and of the latter to
 Pd and Pt (Ann. Supp. viii. p. 133 et seq.). Zimmermann
 (1886) finds Ni=58.71, Co=58.89.
   The above tables appear to establish the following laws:—
    1. In groups I. and II. (which I will call the metallic
 groups), as the atomic weight increases, both the melting
point and the atomic heat decrease.
    2. In groups III. and IV. and all the a groups (termed
 collectively intermediate groups) the atomic heat increases
 with the atomic weight, while the melting-point decreases;
 the former being characteristic of non-metals, the latter of
metals.
    3. In groups V., VI., and VII. (the non-metallic groups),
 as the atomic weight increases, so do both atomic heat and
 melting-point.
    4. In the b groups the melting-point increases with the
 atomic weight, whilst the atomic heat decreases; the former
 being a non-metallic, the latter a metallic characteristic.
    The a may be called copper groups, and the b iron groups.
    It is to be noted that both groups IV. and V. become
 irregular in the same way when their last members are
 reached, these having more marked metallic characters. Thus
 both Sn and Pb in group IV., and Sb and Bi in V., have

 112 Mr. C. T. Blanshard on the Role of Atomic IIeat
 both melting-point and atomic heat in inverted order. The
same order is found to hold in their latent heats of fusion.
Thus Person found that tin requires 14.25 cals., whilst,
according to Rudberg, lead requires only 5.8. There are no
 data for comparing antimony and bismuth. In the zinc
group we find that the latent heat of fusion varies directly
as the melting-point.                          -
   The irregularities in group III. a as to melting-point can
not be explained in the above manner. The elements that
follow Al, viz. Ga, In, and Tl, behave, as regards atomic heat
and melting-point, like the non-metallic groups.
   The inverse ratio between melting-point and atomic heat
in the intermediate groups is well illustrated by carbon and
boron. The former, which has never been melted, has the
lowest atomic heat of all solid or liquid elements; whilst the
latter, which is very infusible, has the next lowest.
   If the above laws are true, they should enable melting
points not yet ascertained, as of thorium, molybdenum, &c.,
to be predicted with tolerable accuracy. Thus, Th should
melt at about 700°, Mo at about 2000°.      Buchholz found this
latter to be imperfectly fusible at a white heat. Again, the
melting-points and specific heats of new elements should be
capable of being predicted with much greater accuracy than
has been possible hitherto. Thus Brauner's Bohemium (see
“Nature’ for October 11, 1894) has had the specific heat of
0.03 predicted for it from Dulong and Petit's constant, but
no melting-point. By referring to group VI, where it will
occur after tellurium, Bo=213, it is easy to see that this
element will have a melting-point of about 650° and specific
               61 –n.o.

     In group VII, the volume-heats are constant.
     Several elements, of known atomic weight, offer no data
  for both C and D, and are altogether omitted.
     The above tables make clear the following laws:—
     1. In each natural group of elements volume-heat varies
  inversely as atomic volume. (Group IV.a is an exception as
  far as available data go.) .
     2. The variations of volume-heat become less and less as
  valency for oxygen rises, until the seventh group is reached,
  when it becomes constant.
     3. As atomic heat increases in some groups and decreases
 in others, with increase of atomic weight, whilst atomic
 volume regularly increases, it is evident that the increase in
 atomic volume proceeds at a higher ratio than the variation
 in atomic heat.
    4. Atomic weight being a constant increment, it follows
 from the preceding law that in any natural group specific
 gravity varies more than specific heat.
 VII. On a Suggestion by Professor J. J. Thomson in
    Connevion with the Luminescence of Glass due to Kathode
    Rays. By JOHN BURKE, B.A., Lecturer in Physics, Mason
    College, Birmingham".                              -
 L' August, at Oxford, I communicated a paper to                 the
        British Association on a strange luminous phenomenon
 which had been observed by Beccaria more than a hundred
years ago. It was there pointed out that although the
 conclusions arrived at by the Italian physicist, if true, were
 likely to lead to results of an extremely interesting character,
in connexion with Mr. Crookes’ important researches on the
luminescence of glass, &c., in vacuum-tubes, and although
the mysterious nature of the phenomenon was likely to
attract much attention, yet the subject was allowed to retain
its obscurity. Beccaria (“Artificial Electricity, § 766)
observed that when vacuum-bulbs were broken in the dark a
light, consisting of a faint glow, was produced in the place
where the bulb lay. He attributed an electrical origin to the
phenomenon, owing to the manner in which certain substances
were supposed to behave in yielding the glow. He mentioned,
moreover, that the mere breaking of glass did not give rise to
the phenomenon, but that the presence of air was essential to
its production, and that when air was allowed to rush suddenly
into a vacuum by the bursting of a bladder at the mouth of a

116            Mr. J. Burke on the Luminescence
receiver, articles such as glass bottles, vessels of sealing-wax,
&c., became luminous by, he supposed, the violent dashing of
the external air on them; the luminosity was most conspicuous
at the necks of the bottles or at the upper edges of the vessels.
   As has already been remarked, Beccaria's researches appear
to have been forgotten for more than a century, and not until
quite recently has attention been drawn to them. This has
been done by Professor J. J. Thomson, who, in his ‘Recent
Researches in Electricity and Magnetism, p. 119, recalls the
fact and indicates its possible close relationship to Mr. Crookes’
theory of the luminescence of the glass in Geissler's tubes :
that the bombardment of the glass by the particles of gas pro
 jected from the kathode is intense enough to cause the glass
to become luminous. Prof. Thomson quotes from Priestley’s
 “History of Electricity’:—
    “Signor Beccaria observed that hollow glass vessels, of a certain
 thinness, exhausted of air, gave a light when they were broken in
 the dark. By a beautiful series of experiments, he found, at
 length, that the luminous appearance was not occasioned by the
 breaking of the glass but by the dashing of the external air against
 the inside when they were broke. He covered one of those ex
 hausted vessels with a receiver, and letting the air suddenly on the
 outside of it observed the very same light.”
    That the light observed in both cases was the same, unless
 the exhausted vessel, which had been covered by the receiver,
  was broken by the dashing of the external air against it, is a
  circumstance which, from considerations that shall presently
  be adduced, I think we may be justified in questioning.
     Through the kindness of Prof. FitzGerald in extending to
  me the facilities afforded in the Physical Laboratory of Trinity
  College, Dublin, I have been enabled to experiment upon this
  subject. It would be impossible for me to attempt to render
  in detail the acknowledgment of what has been due to his
  invaluable advice and suggestions.
     It must be mentioned at the outset that the present in
  vestigation has by no means been completed, yet, thus far, it
  appears that some of Beccaria's results have not been wholly
  of that degree of exactness which we should have hoped for.
  It must, however, be borne in mind that scientific appliances
  in his time were less perfect than they are to-day, and such
   mperfection may account for much inaccuracy.
     A number of incandescent lamps of various sizes with
  broken filaments were procured. An observer who had been
  fifteen or twenty minutes in the dark, whose sight had become

                  of Glass due to Kathode-Rays.              117
sufficiently sensitive to the faintest light, broke one of the
larger of these bulbs with a hammer, at the same time pro
tecting his face by a plate of thick glass. A faint white glow,
which lasted but for a very small fraction of a second, was
seen in the place where it was known the bulb had lain. The
experiment was repeated in the presence of several persons,
who testified to the same effect. The intensity of the light
seemed to depend upon the size of the bulb-the larger bulbs,
about 7 or 8 centim. in diameter, giving a greater intensity
than the smaller ones; whilst with bulbs of not more than
2 centim. diameter no luminous effect was perceived.
   A circular plate of glass, about 7 centim. in diameter and 2
millim. thickness, was then placed on the mouth of a receiver,
the opening of which was about 5 centim. in diameter, and
the contact made air-tight, whilst the air in the receiver was
exhausted until a vacuum of about 20 millim. had been
obtained.
   The plate of glass was then broken with a hammer. A
beautiful stream of white light was visible throughout the
whole receiver. The light, which lasted for a small fraction
 of a second, resembled that produced when vacuum-bulbs
 were broken, though it was more distinct, and consisted not
 merely of a uniform glow, as in that case, but was marked, in
 addition, by a number of luminous spots of various sizes: in
 fact the effect presented the appearance of a faint nebula.
    On account of the extreme faintness of the light, it was
found impossible to photograph it : at least any attempts in
this direction have hitherto proved unsatisfactory, even with
 the most sensitive plates I could procure.
    In some instances the luminous spots were observed to be
 unusually large; the fragments of glass were in such cases
 also found after each experiment to be of an exceptional size,
 often 7 or 8 square centim. in area.                           -
    This fact is especially worthy of notice, as it undoubtedly
 indicates that the fragments of glass themselves had become
 luminous, the continuous glow in all probability having been
 caused by the very minute fragments.
    Different kinds of glass were used without giving any per
 ceptible difference in the effects.
    Thin brittle plates of cast-iron and steel were tried in the
 place of glass, but yielded negative results, owing, perhaps,
 to the fact that they did not break up into innumerable
 fragments as glass did readily when struck with a hammer,
 or because the air was not consequently permitted to enter
 the vacuum very suddenly and with sufficient violence.

118           Mr. J. Burke on the Luminescence
   Various gases were made to take the
place of air. Fig. 1 represents the appa
ratus employed for this purpose., a is a
glass receiver; the strong glass ring b, the
opening of which was covered by a piece of
thin glass c, rested on the mouth of the
receiver a, and served to support a long
glass tube d, at the upper end of which,
being closed, there was an arrangement e
by which a weight f was supported and
allowed to fall by turning the handle h
and thus break the glass c and open free
communication between the gas in the tube
d and that in the receiver a.
   The joining between d and a was made
complely air-tight so that no leakage oc
curred.    The tube d was then filled with
carbon dioxide or oxygen, and the air in
the receiver a exhausted until a vacuum
of about 20 millim. was obtained. The
weight f was made to fall and break the glass c, so that the
gas in d  ''     enter violently into the vacuum. The same
luminous phenomenon was observed as on previous occasions
 when air was employed, with no perceptible difference as
 regards colour, intensity, or the general appearance of the
 glow and luminous spots.
    When the gases in both a and d were exhausted and the
 glass c broken as before, no luminosity whatsoever was
 observed, thereby showing that the mere breaking of glass
 did not suffice to produce the phenomenon; but that the
 presence of a gas was essential, though any gas was sufficient
 to produce the effect—that is, that some function performed
 by a gas in rushing into a vacuum was the cause or a circum
 stance invariably connected with the phenomenon.
    The three following hypotheses seemed possible —
    (1) The violent dashing or bombardment of the molecules
 # : against the glass might have caused the latter to emit
  ight.
    (2) It might have been a sort of miniature meteorite phe
 nomenon, caused by the collisions of the fragments of glass
 with the interior of the receiver and with each other ; the
 intense bombardment of the larger fragments by the minute
 dust particles giving rise to the luminous spots.
    (3) It might have been an electrical phenomenon caused
 by the rubbing of air against glass; somewhat resembling

                 of Glass due to Kathode-Rays.                   119
that produced by the friction of mercury against glass in a
barometric tube".
   In view of testing hypothesis (1) the following experiments
were made :
   A bladder was fastened to the neck of a small receiver, the
air in which was then exhausted until a vacuum of about
20 millim. was obtained.
   The bladder was then caused to burst, and a stream of
yellowish light was seen to descend within. This experiment
was repeated several times with receivers of various heights;
and it was found that in the case of tall receivers the light
was confined to the higher portion, near the mouth of the
receiver.
   The intensity of the light seemed to depend upon the
pressure in the vacuum, that is to say, upon the violence
with which the air entered the interior of the receiver.
   The general appearance of this yellowish light seemed to
indicate that the luminosity in this case was partly, if not
altogether, due to parts of the bladder taking fire, being
heated by the friction of the air against them, or by being
suddenly torn. Articles of various materials, such as those
mentioned by Beccaria, were placed in the interior of the
receiver, also a plate of glass supported horizontally so that
the air on entering might impinge directly upon it.
   A light in some respects, perhaps, resembling that men
tioned by Beccaria was observed, but only with short receivers;
for in the case of tall ones, under precisely similar circum
stances, no light was perceived in the lower region where
the articles lay; thus suggesting that in the former case the
portions of burning bladder had ' stopped, in their fall, by
the articles within the receiver. Beccaria took no precautions
to determine the part played by the bladder in the pheno
menon, or rather, he entirely failed to notice that it ever became
luminous.
   In order to stop the bits of bladder, gauzes of various
materials and different thicknesses were tried; such as should
stop the pieces of bladder but permit the air to rush through
without much impedance. The glass bottles beneath the
gauze, however, were not seen to give rise to any luminosity.
   A similar plan was made use of when air was allowed to
enter a vacuum by the breaking of glass.
   The apparatus employed for this purpose (see fig. 2) con
sisted of a cylindrical receiver, A.; a ring, a, which fitted
closely into the cylinder and was supported by iron rods
         * See Armstrong, Phil. Mag. ser, 3, vol. xviii. (1844),

120            Mr. J. Burke on the Luminescence
that were adjustable so that the ring could be moved up and
down, carried the wire gauze, b, which was tightly fastened
 to it. A plate of glass, c, was laid on the mouth of the
 receiver, and the contact made air-tight; d were articles
 such as glass bottles &c.; an electromagnet, e, supported a
 hammer, f, which fell and smashed the glass plate, c, when
 the circuit was broken at g. The part of the cylinder above
 the gauze was screened from the observer's sight.
                              Fig. 2.
                                          AiR PUMP
   The air in the cylinder having been exhausted, no light
was seen to penetrate the gauze, neither was there any lumi
nosity seen in the vicinity of d, when the external air was
allowed to enter the receiver, in the usual manner, by breaking
the glass, c.
   A bladder was then used instead of glass plates, but the
results were similar.
   Different gases were allowed to issue forth from bottles
containing these gases in a highly compressed state, on the
surface of glass, and especially on its sharp edges, but without
producing any visible effect.
   These results do not seem to harmonize with hypothesis (1).
Let us now proceed to the consideration of hypothesis (2).

   A single piece of glass cut into a definite shape was then
made to take the place of the great number of fragments,
some cotton-wool being placed on the plate of the air-pump
in order as far as possible to prevent the piece of glass from
breaking.
   The following facts were noticed :-(a) Only a single
spark seen. Not as on a previous occasion when a number
of fragments of glass were allowed to enter the vacuum,
 (8) the spark always appeared on the side of the receiver in
the direction in which the plate d had been drawn aside *
 (see fig. 3). (y) The piece of glass was found almost vertically
 under the place where the spark had taken place.
    It seemed probable that the spark was caused by the
collision of the piece of glass with the interior of the receiver.
Two strong pieces of glass were then struck violently together,
and a light similar in every respect to that previously ob
served was produced.
   These experiments seem to justify hypothesis (2): the
dust particles causing the glow by their impacts against the
interior of the receiver and against each other; whilst the
brightness of the luminous spots may be attributed to sparks
produced by the larger fragments of glass, and to the bom

 bardment of the dust particles against the surfaces of these
 larger fragments.
    A large quantity of fragments of cast-iron, steel, ebonite,
 sealing-wax, bone, &c., were tried as well as glass, but the
 attempt to obtain a luminous effect by the above method proved
 fruitless.
    If metallic dust should produce a luminous effect when
 made to bombard the surface of glass, and if different effects
 should be produced by lead glass and German glass, the
 theory that solid particles emitted from the kathode would
 give rise to luminescence of the glass would be justified. The
 above experiments, however, do not seem to throw much light
 on Mr. Crookes theory of luminescence due to the emitted
particles of gas.
    In the earlier stage of the investigation hypothesis (3)
appeared plausible enough. Any experiments, however,
that were made in connexion with it         '' not lead to results
of an interesting character.
    Whatever may be the real value of these experiments, it
cannot be doubted that the inquiry into the cause of such a
 phenomenon as that noticed by Beccaria must prove of the
greatest interest: firstly, on account of the obscurity enve
loping the subject, and, secondly, on account of the interest
attached to the artificial production (though on a small scale)
of meteoric phenomena in the laboratory.

   N his well-known memoir on the spectra of coloured flames
      Gouy (Ann. Chim. Phys. xviii. p. 5, 1879) draws attention
to the fact that different spectral effects are obtainable from
different parts of the flame of a Bunsen-burner. From his
observations Gouy concludes that the inner cone of a Bunsen
flame must be hotter than the outer one, and he remarks that,
though this is in some respects in accord with theory, the
mechanism of the phenomenon presents serious difficulties and
demands fresh researches.
   The mechanism alluded to by Gouy has, I think, been
explained by recent investigations on the “Structure and

Soc. lxi. p. 204, 1892), from which it is clear that the flame
of a Bunsen-burner must be regarded as consisting of two
distinct cones of combustion. In the inner one a partial
combustion of gas takes place at the expense of the oxygen of
the air admitted through the air-valves: in the outer cone,
such of these products of partial combustion (chiefly carbon
monoxide and hydrogen) as are capable of further oxidation are
burnt in the external air; but, being mixed with a large
quantity of fully oxidized products and with all the nitrogen
passing through the inner cone, the flame produced is of a
much lower average temperature than that of the inner cone.

has just been made secures a wide separation of the cones

 aid in volatilizing the liquid in the saturator. The air and
 gas pass by a T-tube into the cone separator, which consists of
 two coaxial tubes connected by an india-rubber collar g and
 maintained symmetrical by the brass guide k. By adjusting
 the supply of air and gas, the flame may be so arranged that
 the inner cone rests at h and the outer one at i.
               Flame-Spectra of Copper Compounds.
    In a previous part of this paper I have commented on the
 difficulties of tracing the chemical processes which accompany
 the production of flame-spectra. '' difficulties are specially
 great with salts of the alkalis, owing to the stability of their
 compounds at high temperatures. The case of chloride of
 copper, an easily altered substance, seemed likely to repay
 study, and I now give an account of the results which have
 been obtained.
    The spectrum produced by the introduction of cupric
 chloride into a non-luminous flame was mapped by Bunsen
 and Kirchhoff in their original memoir.
    In 1862 A. Mitscherlich, in a paper (Pogg. Ann. cxvi.
 p. 499) which raised the question as to the distinctive character
 of the spectra of compounds, described and mapped the
 spectra corresponding to what he called copper, copper
 chloride, and copper iodide. The copper spectrum was ob
 tained by using a solution of copper oxide in acetic acid :
 the copper-chloride spectrum by supplying a mixed solution
 of copper chloride and ammonium chloride by means of a
 Mitscherlich-tube to a Bunsen-burner.         Mitscherlich also
 noticed certain variations in the copper-chloride spectrum
 according to the quantity of hydrochloric acid present, and
 thought it probable that two spectra were obtainable, one of
 cuprous and one of cupric chloride.
- In a later paper (Pogg, Ann. cxxi. p. 459, 1864) Mitscher
 lich described the spectra of copper compounds in greater
 detail, and mapped carefully spectra which he attributed

                      Luminosity of Gases.                 125
respectively to cuprous chloride, cuprous or cupric oxide, and
metallic copper. The spectrum previously attributed by him
to metallic copper was now ascribed to one of the oxides of
copper, and the chloride spectrum, though not particularized
in the text, is indicated on the map as being due to cuprous
chloride only.
   In 1865 Diacon published (Ann. Chim. Phys. [4] vi.
p. 1, 1865) a paper on “The Influence of the Electro
negative Elements on the Spectra of Metals,” in which he
maps and describes the spectrum of cupric chloride as pro
duced in a coal-gas flame. He mentions that the spectrum is
due to the superposition of the spectra of oxide and chloride.
    Lecoq de   £             in his Spectres Lumineur (1874),
 gives a map of the spectrum obtained from copper chloride
 when the salt is introduced into a Bunsen-flame.   In describ
 ing this map Lecoq de Boisbaudran distinguishes four cases
 in the use of copper chloride for the production of spectra,
 according to the quantity of salt employed and the length of
 time it is held in the flame. The particular case mapped is
 apparently given by the author as the one in which the normal
 spectrum of cupric chloride is obtained.
    When in using the separator the spray of a dilute solution
 of cupric chloride is supplied with the air, the outer cone
 assumes a bright green colour; the lower cone is unaffected
 so far as the eye can judge (as soon as all air has been
 removed by diffusion from the space between the tubes), and
 nothing but the “candle” spectrum is seen in the spectro
 scope. If now a piece of asbestos soaked in hydrochloric
 acid be introduced into the upper cone, the green colour is
  replaced by a vivid blue. The same effect is obtained by
  introducing hydrochloric-acid gas with the gas-supply by
  means of the saturator. If the solution of copper chloride be
  replaced by one of copper sulphate or nitrate, similar effects
  are obtained. When these flames are examined by means of
  the spectroscope, the sulphate and nitrate of copper are seen
  to produce exactly the same result. The dilute solution of
  CuCl2 alone gives a spectrum containing the same lines and
  bands as the nitrate and sulphate with the addition of other
  faint bands. When hydrochloric acid is supplied, the blue
  flame obtained gives a spectrum in which the lines and bands
  common to the sulphate and nitrate are very faint, whilst the
  additional lines just referred to as pertaining to the CuCl2
  flame are greatly intensified, and new lines also make their
  appearance. Using cold hydrochloric acid, it is impossible
  to entirely quench those lines which are found in the simple
  sulphate and nitrate spectra. But if the hydrochloric-acid

 126                Prof. Arthur Smithells on the
saturator be jacketed by steam, or, more simply, if chloroform
be used in the saturator, these lines can be entirely eliminated.
 We have, then, to deal with two distinct spectra—one given by
copper salts in the entire absence of hydrochloric acid; the
other given when a large quantity of hydrochloric acid or
chloroform vapour is supplied to the flame. In the inter
mediate case when there is some hydrochloric acid—but not
an excess—a mixed spectrum is obtained. It is obvious that
one of these spectra corresponds to the oxide of copper and
the other to the chloride.
    These spectra have been carefully mapped" and compared
with the maps of previous observers, with the following results
 (see Plate IV.).
    1. The chloride spectrum corresponds almost exactly to
that given by Mitscherlich. He failed to map three bands
at the most refrangible end and to split up into three distinct
bands a region between X 460 and 480.
    2. The oxide spectrum bears a general resemblance to that
given by Mitscherlich, but with the exception of three bands
he did not map in any detail the vague bands of which this
spectrum is largely composed. One band at the least re
frangible end is entirely omitted by Mitscherlich.
    3. Lecoq de Boisbaudran's map comprises all the chloride
lines and bands, with the exception of two on the extreme
violet which he mentions but does not map, and all the bands
of the oxide except those which it is impossible to discriminate
in the presence of a strong chloride spectrum.
    4. Diacon’s map contains all the chloride lines and bands,
but the oxide bands are only vaguely marked.
    In addition to the appearances above described, there is one
other noticeable when using copper salts in the separator with
hydrochloric acid. When the flame of the outer cone is
turned blue by hydrochloric acid, a dull ruddy fringe is seen
to surround it. This becomes more developed as the quantity
of hydrochloric acid is increased. It gives a faint luminous
spectrum, chiefly in the red. As this red fringe is never
obtained except in the presence of a large quantity of hydro
chloric acid or chloroform and a copper salt, it seems natural
to ascribe it to a compound of copper and chlorine.
    It seemed desirable to inquire further into the chemical
changes involved in the production of the different spectral
   * The readings of the instrument employed (a two-prism Steinheil
spectroscope) have been plotted to the scale A2 " which while giving

                       Luminosity of Gases.                   127
effects, and to determine if possible to what definite compound
each particular effect was due.
    The effect of introducing a bead of cupric chloride into a
 Bunsen-flame has been carefully described by Lecoq de
 Boisbaudran (Spectres Lumineux, p. 156). As already stated,
he distinguished four cases, but of these we need only take the
 first, in which a large quantity of salt is used. The salt first
 melts, and then in a few moments is seen to be surrounded
by a brilliant patch of yellow, like a piece of ordinary candle
 flame; the exterior parts of this patch are reddish (again
 resembling carbon luminosity). Outside the yellow a bright
 blue colour appears, and outside this the flame is coloured
 green. The yellow luminosity is of short duration, the blue
 lasts longer, but soon the only tint remaining is the green.
    These three effects were so local and distinct that it seemed
 possible to collect the substances to which they were due,
 and this was done by holding in the flame glass or porcelain
 basins filled with water. The deposit obtained in this way
 from the yellow part of the flame was red in colour, it trans
 mitted greenish light, it could be burnished, it dissolved in
 nitric acid with evolution of red fumes, and in fact answered
 in every respect to metallic copper. The yellow luminosity
 observed with a large quantity of cupric chloride in a Bunsen
 flame must,    £          be attributed to the liberation and
 incandescence of minute particles of solid copper.
    The deposit obtained from the blue part of the flame was
 of a very pale yellow colour when freshly formed. On
 standing or by breathing upon it, the film absorbed moisture
 and became quite white: it answered in all its properties to
 cuprous chloride containing a little of the cupric salt.
    The green part of the flame produced a deposit which was
 almost black and corresponded in appearance and chemical
properties to cupric oxide. As the film was very thin, the
possibility of it having been originally cuprous oxide and
having subsequently oxidized was not excluded.
    From these experiments it is obvious that the three distinct
colour-effects noticeable when cupric chloride is introduced
into a Bunsen-flame correspond to three different substances,
viz., metallic copper, cuprous chloride, and an oxide of copper.
    It is highly improbable from a chemical point of view that
cupric chloride when introduced into a flame should afford a
spectrum. The easy decomposability of this salt and the
stability of cuprous chloride (which is volatilizable without
change) would lead one to anticipate the decomposition of
CuCl2 into Cu,Cl2, and Cl, long before there could be any
question of incandescence.      That this is the case can be

128              Prof. Arthur Smithells on the
easily seen by holding a bead of cupric chloride well above
the tip of a small Bunsen-flame, and supporting above it a
                                                                 |
porcelain basin filled with cold water. Though no flame is
seen the salt melts and volatilizes sufficiently to give a con
siderable film on the basin, which, on examination, is seen to
be almost wholly cuprous chloride.
   Taking it as established that the blue part of the flame is
due to cuprous chloride, the question arises, How does this
salt become converted into oxide of copper to which the green
part is due This could be easily accounted for by the action
of steam upon the chloride. That this is the correct explana
tion is established with something like certainty by experiments
with flames of combustibles containing no hydrogen.       In the
flame of carbon monoxide or carbon bisulphide, cupric chloride
produces almost exclusively the blue colour; whilst in flames
of hydrogen in which, according to the hypothesis, the
existence of cuprous chloride should be precluded by the
presence of steam, the green colour greatly predominates.
Again, a small jet of hydrogen or steam impinging on a
carbon-monoxide flame coloured intensely blue by cuprous
chloride produces the green at the point of contact.
   The remaining point of interest is to ascertain which of the
oxides of copper produces the green colour. When carefully
purified CuO is dusted on to a Bunsen-flame, a green tint is at
once produced; and the deposit obtained on porcelain from
the green part of a   £               flame appears to be black
at the instant of deposition. These facts point to cupric oxide
as the substance which produces the green colour. On the
other hand, cupric oxide is a substance which loses oxygen at
a high temperature. The dissociation of cupric oxide was
studied by Debray and Joannis (Compt. Rend. xcix. p. 583,
 1884). £ in vacuo they found it to yield oxygen at
350° C. At the melting-point of silver the tension of this
oxygen amounted to 56 millim., and a little above the melting
point of gold to 1000 millim. It would appear to be im
possible for cupric oxide to exist at the average temperature
of a Bunsen-flame, for this would demand an oxygen-tension
vastly greater than exists within or around such a flame. It
seems therefore necessary to ascribe the green glow to cuprous
oxide or some lower oxide of copper, but I have been unable
after several attempts to volatilize cuprous oxide by external
heating.
   It has already been stated that a cuprous-chloride flame
containing plenty of hydrochloric acid is surrounded by a dull
red margin. This appears to be due to cupric chloride.
When a super-aerated flame is obtained in the separator and
                                                                 b

is supplied with a spray of copper chloride, it is tinged wholly
green and is surrounded by a green halo. Round such a
flame the existence of cuprous chloride is impossible, and
when a piece of asbestos, soaked in hydrochloric acid, is intro
duced into the halo we do not get as a matter of fact any blue
colour, but the ruddy margin immediately appears, and it
seems impossible to attribute this to anything but the forma
tion of cupric chloride, which, in the presence of oxygen and
hydrochloric acid, remains as such and gives the feeble red
  low.
   The behaviour of cupric chloride in the separator admits of
easy explanation. In the inner cone the average temperature
is extremely high, and the products there generated consist
largely of carbon monoxide and free hydrogen. The cupric
chloride will therefore not only lose its chlorine but the
cuprous chloride, if we suppose it to be formed for a moment,
will be immediately attacked by the reducing gases and lose
the remainder of its chlorine.      We have therefore metallic
copper, and the average temperature is not sufficient to
£         its characteristic spectrum. The copper and the
  ydrochloric acid resulting from the decomposition of the
cupric chloride pass upwards. Some of the former is deposited
as a thin metallic film on the inner walls of the outer tube.
The rest passes to the outer cone where, at the lower average
temperature and in contact with atmospheric oxygen, some
cuprous oxide is formed and gives the green tint and oxide
spectrum. At the same time some cuprous chloride is formed
by the hydrochloric acid, and gives the faint traces of the
£. spectrum.
   It is important to observe that, according to the above
explanation, cupric chloride is decomposed in the inner cone
without evincing any spectrum at all. The fact that the salt
is easily reduced to cuprous chloride at a comparatively low
temperature, and that cuprous chloride can itself be easily
deprived of its chlorine by heating in a current of gases of
the same composition as those that are passed into the
separator, would lead one to the conclusion that the salt under
£ these changes before actually entering the inner cone.
 n this case we might at first expect to see some coloration
below it, and, indeed, Gouy (loc. cit. p. 29) describes such an
appearance, stating that a line of coloration is distinctly
visible parallel to and within the cone. I have repeatedly
tried to verify this observation, but could not succeed in doing
so either by the eye or the spectroscope. The matter is,
however, of no great consequence.

130              Prof. Arthur Smithells on the
              Flame-Spectrum of Gold Trichloride.
   Owing to the easy decomposability of gold trichloride and
the desirability of ascertaining more accurately the source of
the spectrum commonly attributed to it, I have examined it
with the separator.
   When gold trichloride is introduced on the end of a pla
tinum wire into a Bunsen-flame, a bright green flash of light
is produced accompanied by some bright sparks. The
coloration only lasts a very short time, and a considerable
residue of metallic gold is left on the wire. These facts are
noted and a map of the spectrum is given by Lecoq de Bois
baudran (Spectres Lumineu,v).
   A moderately dilute solution of gold trichloride, introduced
into the separated cones by means of the apparatus used for
copper salts (p. 123), does not colour either of them ; but
when a piece of asbestos moistened with strong hydrochloric
acid is held in the upper cone, a brilliant green colour is pro
duced and the green lines are seen in the spectroscope. When
the coal-gas is previously passed through the saturator con
taining asbestos moistened with strong hydrochloric acid, the
outer cone becomes slightly green, especially at the edge. If,
however, the saturator is jacketed with steam, so as to increase
the volatilization of hydrochloric acid, the upper cone becomes
intensely green. The same effect is obtained by using chloro
form in the saturator.
   If when, in either of the above ways, the upper cone has
acquired a bright green colour, the outer tube of the separator
is slid down over the inner one, the colour diminishes in
intensity, and when ultimately the orifices of the two tubes
are level, it disappears almost entirely except at the extreme
edge. The only alteration which the outer cone can suffer by
this approximation to the inner one is that its average tempe
rature must increase, whence it appears that the coloration by
the gold salt depends upon two circumstances—abundance
of hydrochloric acid and a low average temperature.
   This conclusion is easily confirmed. If, instead of bringing
the cones nearer, the upper one be surrounded by oxygen
instead of air, it becomes smaller and of higher average
temperature, and its green colour disappears except at the
extreme edges.
   The fact that a chloride of gold can under any circumstances
produce its individual spectrum is at first     £       remark
able when we consider the extreme ease with which the
salt is decomposed, and though the lower chloride or chlorides
might be formed, they are likewise easily decomposed, leaving

                         Luminosity of Gases.                          131
only metallic gold. There can be no doubt, indeed, that gold
trichloride is decomposed completely at a temperature far
below the average one of the flame in which it yields a
spectrum. It has, however, been observed by Debray (Compt.
Rend. lxix. p. 984, 1869) that gold chloride may be obtained
at 300° by passing a current of chlorine through a tube con
taining the metal, from which it is evident that the salt may
exist at abnormally high temperatures provided an excess of
chlorine be present. To test this question further, I per
formed the following experiment.
   By means of an electric current a pure gold wire was
raised to bright redness in a tube partially exhausted of air.
Chlorine was then allowed to enter the tube in considerable
quantity. When this was done, a slight sublimate was imme
diately formed on the sides of the tube opposite to the glowing
wire, and this sublimate on examination proved to be gold
trichloride. From this it is apparent that in presence of
abundance of chlorine, gold chloride may be formed at a red
heat, and so emit its characteristic spectrum. The case is not
an exception, but rather an example of the generalization
that dissociable bodies become stable in presence of excess of
one of the products of dissociation.
   It is now easy to understand why gold chloride introduced
into a flame on a platinum wire gives a spectrum. The great
bulk of the salt is decomposed so as to give an atmosphere of
chlorine in which a small portion of the salt volatilizes with
out decomposition. As has been already noted, much metallic
gold remains on the wire.
   I have shown that in using the separator the gold-chloride
spectrum may be maintained by introducing abundance of
hydrochloric acid or chloroform (the interconal gases con
tained no free chlorine), and that though the coloration may
be for the most part quenched by making the flame hotter, it
is most persistent at the edges. From these facts it appears
that, so far as the formation and stability of gold chloride are
concerned, an atmosphere of hydrochloric acid and oxygen is
potentially one of chlorine, the stable arrangement of the
system at a high temperature changing as follows" —
            30, 12HCl, 4Au becomes 6H2O, 4AuCls.
   It is clear, therefore, that provided we have a sufficient
quantity of hydrochloric acid or free chlorine, gold chloride
may exist in a flame at a temperature sufficiently high to
produce its spectrum.
  * It is stated in Gmelin's ‘Handbook, vi. p. 215, on the authority of
Proust, that gold is soluble in hot hydrochloric acid in presence of air.

                        Salts of the Alkalis.
   Salts of the alkalis (and, so far as I have examined them, of
the alkaline earths), when introduced into the separator by
means of the spray, impart their characteristic tint and
spectrum to each cone, but as the inner cone has a much
higher average temperature than the outer one it acquires by
far the brighter tint.
   These facts may be exhibited in a very striking way as
follows:– A mixed solution of cupric chloride and lithium
chloride is introduced into the sprayer feeding a separator with
air; if the gas-supply be in excess, the undivided flame shows
a mixed colour due to the copper and lithium salts; but if
now the gas-supply be diminished and the cones allowed to
separate, the inner cone appears bright crimson and the
outer one only green. The explanation of this is very simple:
the colour proper to the copper salt is, as we have seen, deve
loped only in the outer cone, that due to the lithium salt in
both cones; but in the upper one it is so faint as to be
entirely masked by the green of the copper salt.
                            Conclusions.
   The experiments recorded in this paper afford some evi
dence as to the validity of the view of the origin of flame
spectra advocated by Pringsheim. If, as he concludes, the
flame-spectra commonly attributed to the alkali metals are a
direct consequence of chemical processes occurring in the
flame, the same is presumably true for the spectra of chemical
compounds such as those of copper and gold. As a matter
of fact chemical changes do accompany the production of the
spectra dealt with in this paper. Thus when cupric chloride
is introduced into the flame, we have the formation of cuprous
 chloride and of cuprous oxide. The case of gold chloride is
 more important. In the case of this salt the spectrum is
 only developed when a large excess of chlorine or of hydro
 chloric acid and air are present ; in their absence a consider
 able quantity of a spray or dust of the salt may be passed
 through the flame without giving any spectrum. The gold
 chloride, in fact, can only be maintained at a temperature
 sufficient to develop its spectrum when it is surrounded by
 an atmosphere either of chlorine or of an equivalent mixture
 of hydrochloric acid and oxygen. The gold-chloride mole
 cules, however, must not be regarded as remaining intact
 under these circumstances, for where a dissociable salt appears
 to be maintained in the undissociated state, through the
 presence of an excess of one of the products of dissociation,

                      Luminosity of Gases.                   133
we ascribe it to the fact that, if momentarily dissociated, there
is instantly a reunion. Whilst, therefore, on the one hand,
the high temperature at which the gold-chloride spectrum is
developed compels the separation of the gold and chlorine,
the large excess of chlorine on the other hand, by the action
of mass, compels a recombination. Though this in a sense is
tantamount to saying that the    £            molecules remain
undissociated, the dynamical view of dissociation obliges us
to picture a constant interchange between atoms of gold and
atoms of chlorine.
   We are obliged to conclude, therefore, that the experiments
recorded above are quite in harmony with the view advocated
by Pringsheim.
   In a previous part of this paper I have offered some criti
cisms of the experiments on which Pringsheim based his
conclusions. Notwithstanding this I have never considered
his view to be disproved : on the contrary, it seems prima
facie to be a reasonable explanation of many phenomena
occurring in flames. The facts I have now brought forward
are in harmony with it, but I believe the evidence is still far
from complete, and that further experiments are necessary
to establish the doctrine that the light-emission from coloured
flames is a direct consequence of chemical processes.
   I have to express my grateful £ ments to Sir G.
G. Stokes, Bart., for the interest he has taken in the work
recorded in this paper and for his invaluable and ever ready
counsel.   I have received much assistance from Mr. Frank
land Dent, B.Sc., who especially has devoted the most patient
labour to the drawing of the spectra.
   The chief conclusions arrived at in this part of the paper
are :
   I. When cupric chloride is introduced into a flame, three
substances are formed: metallic copper, cuprous chloride,
and cuprous oxide. The first of these give a bright yellow
flame and a continuous spectrum; the second a bright blue
tint and brilliant spectrum of bands and lines; the last a green
tint and spectrum of not very strongly developed banas.
Under certain circumstances cupric chloride may exist in a
flame, when it gives a feeble ruddy tint and a continuous
spectrum.
   II. Gold chloride gives a flame-spectrum only in presence
of an excess of chlorine or of hydrochloric acid and oxygen.
   III. In the above cases the development of a spectrum is
concomitant with chemical changes affecting the substance
concerned; a fact in harmony with the view as to the origin
of flame-spectra advocated by Pringsheim.

     IX. Specific Inductive Capacities of Water, Alcohol, &c.
                           By J. HoPKINsoN".
IN the       December number of the Bhilosophical Magazine
       is a short article by Prof. R. A. Fessenden on the
Measurement of the Specific Inductive Capacities of Water,
Alcohol, &c. In this article he states that the high values
found by Cohn and Arons and others for water, alcohol, &c.
are not correct, but that the true values are in every one of
these substances very nearly equal to that called for by Max
well's theory. He also states that all the determinations of
such substances as sulphur, &c. are incorrect. The observa
tions said to be incorrect are not those of a single observer,
but of many whose results are in good accord.
    Taking solids first, it has been shown that the capacity of
light flint-glass at ordinary temperatures is the same whether
the time of charge is go.                second, or second, that it is
independent of the potential of the charge, and that its value
is about 6.7f. It is also well known that this glass insulates
so well that it will hold its charge for monthst. Is it sug
gested that these results are vitiated by electrolytic polari
zation or by a hypothetical laminated structure of the material?
The specific inductive capacity of ice has been determined by
Bonty S. He finds 78, practically the same value as Cohn
and Arons find for water.             But the resistance is from 10" to
 10" times as great as that of water, which quite precludes the
suggestion of electrolytic polarization.
    Turning to liquids, we have a large number of determina
tions which also deviate from Maxwell’s law.                     Take, for
example, castor-oil and ether. Both insulate well enough to
make certain that electrolytic polarization does not affect the
result. Quincke determined the capacity of ether | by three
very different methods and found it in each case about 4:7;
 my result by a fourth method was 4.75. For castor-oil I
 obtained by two very different methods 4.78 and 4.82". All
these results deviate much from Maxwell's law making use of

        X. On Colonel Hime's “Outlines of Quaternions.”
          To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
    GENTLEMEN,
     CANNOT agree with your reviewer in holding that
      paragraph 11 of the “Outlines’ is not quaternions. The
equation
                i=j=k= V-1 = -i=—j= -k,
 as your reviewer says, may be nonsense; nevertheless it
 follows from the fundamental principles of quaternions as
 laid down by Hamilton and Tait. It is said that "= –1 and
j*=–1; therefore it follows that i*=j*, unless in quaternions
 the axiom does not hold which says that things which are
 equal to the same thing are equal to one another. But from
 * = f° it follows that i = + j or —j, for we are told that it is
 only the commutative law of all the laws of algebra which
 breaks down, and here that peculiarity does not enter. By
 extending the same reasoning to the : two pairs, we obtain
                i=j=k= V-1=—i=-j=-k.
 How does your reviewer demonstrate that it is nonsense?
 He says that i, j, k have already been defined as co-perpen
 dicular unit-vectors, and to say that they are equal is to rob
 them arbitrarily of their most characteristic feature, so that
 they are no longer what they were defined to be. Yet a few
 sentences before this same writer defends Hamilton's no less
 arbitrary violation of the definition of a vector, which does
 not indeed rob it of any of its meaning, but piles on it what

136 Prof. A. Macfarlane on “Outlines of Quaternions.”
does not belong to it. That which in Hamilton is an
“outburst of genius” is in Colonel Hime “contrary to the
whole genius of common sense.”
   The manner in which the author founds the calculus is not
satisfactory to your reviewer. This is not surprising; on
examination I find that it is based on a collection of defini
tions.   The fundamental rules are explained as follows:—In
if the former symbol is a quadrantal versor and the latter a
vector, the effect of the former on the latter is to change it    k
into k. Logically, we expect that in i i the former symbol is
a quadrantal versor and the latter a vector, giving i as the
result; but it is not so : both symbols are now to be con
sidered quadrantal versors, giving i” = — 1. These two
inconsistent theories are simultaneously applied to find the
product of two vectors,
               m1 +m2.j + m3k and nii-F maj + nak.
 The product consists of two kinds of terms; mini ii is a type of
 the one, and mine ij of the other. We are asked to believe that
 in mini if both unit-vectors become quadrantal versors, while
 in min, if it is only the former of the two. The operator and
 operand theory is applied to one set of terms, and a double
 operator theory to the other set of terms; while in the          *.
 vectors themselves there is no operator at all.
    In my papers on Space-analysis I have attempted to lay
 down the fundamental principles in a logical manner. When
 that is done, the meaning of every expression and equation
 becomes clear, and there is no need for a special chapter such
 as we find in the “Outlines, on the “Interpretation of Qua
 ternion Expressions.” The best proof of the correctness of
 my principles is that they have enabled me to carry the
 analysis beyond the point where Hamilton left it.
     In conclusion I wish to say that I yield to no one in
 admiration of the works of Hamilton and Tait.     The attitude
 of mind of your reviewer appears to be that of “wondering
 awe.”     In that I cannot follow him; I stand in awe of the
 truth only.

                XI. Notices respecting New Books.
An Introduction to Physical Measurements, with Appendices on
   Absolute Electrical Measurement, &c. By Prof. F. KoHLRAUSCH.
   Third English edition, translated from the Seventh German edition,
   by T. H. WALLER, B.A., B.Sc., and H. R. PROCTER, F.I.C., F.C.S.
   London: J. and A. Churchill, 1894.
SOME time ago reference was made in         these pages (Phil. Mag.
       [5] vol. xxxvii. pp. 334, 502) to the fact that the earlier
editions of this work had become somewhat out of date by reason
of the widening of the scope of physical measurements. Prof.
Kohlrausch very rightly pointed out that the fault did not lie on
his side, as the latest (seventh) German edition contained a very
large amount of new matter. This edition now becomes accessible
to us in the form of an English translation.
   Prof. Kohlrausch has aimed at giving a tolerably comprehensive
list of experiments which may be performed in a physical labo
ratory, as exercises for students or as parts of a physical research.
This wideness of aim necessarily entails a certain amount of brevity
of description, and consequently details of apparatus are generally
omitted.    The book differs in this respect from others of its class,
the majority of which are either intended to meet the wants of
special students or else have been compiled primarily for use in
some particular laboratory: in either case the details referring to
construction or arrangement of apparatus are often found inapplic
able when the book comes to be used under other conditions.
Prof. Kohlrausch has omitted mere lecture-experiments and such
as are designed to establish the truth of physical laws: it is
assumed in all cases that the experiment is undertaken to deter
mine some physical constant. The omission of the determination
of coefficients of absolute expansion of liquids by heat, and the
measurement of wave-lengths by the biprism, may be due to this
cause, although the former are often required in physical work.
A more important defect is the absence of all reference to the
measurement of latent heat, either of fusion or vaporization. In
connexion with electricity and magnetism the number of experi
ments which might be described is now so great that a selection
becomes necessary, and in the present volume the choice has been
on the whole a good one. The only measurement which does not
receive attention is that of the mutual induction between a pair of
 coils, no method being given for its determination. In describing
the various forms of galvanometer the D'Arsonval or suspended
coil type ought to have been included; and in connexion with
Mance's method for the measurement of battery resistance the use
of a condenser with the galvanometer (Lodge, Phil. Mag. June
 1877) should be referred to. It does not seem to be generally

138                Notices respecting New Books.
known that satisfactory results can be secured by this simple
device. In the appendix on the absolute system of measurements
the dimensions of dielectric capacity and magnetic permeability
are each given as zero, with the result that the same quantities
appear to be of different dimensions according as they are measured
in electrostatic or electromagnetic units.
   The translators have given a fair rendering of the German text,
but unfortunately they have retained nearly all the misprints of
the original. This is the more remarkable seeing that a printed
list of corrigenda exists, and has been issued with (at any rate,   s
some) copies of the German edition. Out of this list of fifteen mis
prints only three are corrected in the present translation. Several
additional ones have been introduced, the most unfortunate of
which is the use of the word “density” for “specific gravity” on
p. 44, just in the place where a distinction is being drawn between
the two terms.     In the tables at the end of the work a few minor
omissions and misprints occur; for example, in Tables 30, 32, and
33 the units of measurement are not stated, while in Tables 22
and 22(a) C.M.G. is printed for C.G.S. The symbols used by
Prof. Kohlrausch have generally been retained, especially in the
sections dealing with electricity, where the use of i for current
strength and w for resistance will scarcely commend itself to
English readers. On the other hand, Kohlrausch's n for refractive
index has been replaced by u, in accordance with English usage.
The volume forms an important addition to the literature of the
physical laboratory, and can easily be cleared of such superficial
blemishes as have been indicated.              JAMEs L. HowARD.

THIs fourth and concluding volume of the well-known chemical
dictionary brings to a close a standard work of reference of
which the first volume appeared in 1888. Altogether we shall
not be far wrong in stating that the editors have taken about a
decade in revising, rewriting, compiling, and editing the vast
amount of material which constitutes the modern science of
Chemistry. That they have done their task well has already been
acknowledged in noticing the former volumes in the pages of this
Magazine. It is with great satisfaction that we are enabled to
renew this acknowledgment in the case of the present volume,
which extends to 922 pages and contains an Appendix of 34
pages comprising the more noteworthy of the recent discoveries in
inorganic chemistry.
   A dictionary of science is not an easy work to treat of from a

                   Notices respecting New Books.                   139
reviewer's point of view. But in this fourth volume there are
certain long articles on special subjects by well-known authorities,
which form a most valuable feature of the work, and to which
attention may be directed. Thus, instead of the separate articles
on electricity, light, heat, &c., which appeared in the old dictionary,
we have one comprehensive article on Physical Methods used in
Chemistry, which occupies no less than 100 pages and is divided
into the fourteen sections:—Capillarity, Crystallographic Methods
(references only), Dialysis and Diffusion, Dynamical Methods
(references only), Electrical Methods, Freezing-points of Solutions
(references only), Optical Methods, Osmotic Pressure (references
only), Photographic Methods (references only). Specific Heats of
Solids (references only), Thermal Methods, Vapour Pressures of
Solutions (references only), Wiscosity of Liquids, Volume Changes
(references only). In cases where references only are given, it is
because the section forms the subject of a special article elsewhere
in the work. As a guarantee of soundness of treatment we need
 only mention the names of the contributors. Thus, Prof. Ostwald
 is responsible for the section on electrical methods (46 pages),
 Prof. Hartley writes on optical methods (spectroscopic methods),
 Mr. George Gladstone the section on refraction and dispersion,
 and the editor (Mr. Muir) on polariscopic methods. Dr. Capstick
 contributes the sections on capillarity and viscosity. The section
 on thermal methods is also written by Mr. Muir. Taking it as a
 whole this article on Physical Methods is perhaps one of the most
 valuable in the Dictionary; with the references and the original
 communications it constitutes a compact little monograph on
 Physical Chemistry, and those who have followed the developments
 of science since the time of the old Watts' Dictionary, cannot but
   e struck by the vast encroachment of Physics upon Chemistry, to
 the great advantage of both sciences.
    The article on Photographic Chemistry is by Prof. Meldola and
 is compressed into about 5 pages; Dr. Halliburton contributes 15
  pages of most valuable information on Proteids; Mr. O'Sullivan
  writes on Starch, and also a long article (35 pages) on Sugar, in
  which the enormous development in this branch of organic
  chemistry, due chiefly to the researches of Emil Fischer, is very
  well summarized and set forth.         The article on Solutions is
  divided into two sections—the first, by Prof. Arrhenius, representing
  the views of those who hold to the physical theory, and the second,
  by Prof. S. U. Pickering as the representative of the so called
  “hydrate” theory. It is interesting to compare the views of the
  two authors.      Arrhenius sets out with the definition:—“A
  solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more bodies in the
  liquid state.” Pickering states:—“The view that hydrates exist
  in aqueous solutions, and analogous compounds in non-aqueous
  solutions, is one that has long been held by many chemists; it is
  only in the last few years, however, that the hydrate or association
  theory has assumed a precise form, and that definite experimental

140                    Geological Society:—
evidence in support of it has been accumulated.” It is most
valuable to have the views of the supporters of the two rival
hypotheses thus brought into juxtaposition, and the editors have
shown great judgment in inviting contributions from both schools
in the present unsettled state of this most important subject.
   Among other special articles attention may be called to that on
Specific Volumes by Prof. Thorpe, and that on Terpenes by Prof.
Tilden. The latter gives in a space of some 11 pages a very good
résumé of our present knowledge of the compounds of this group,
and here again one cannot fail to be struck with the great
development of chemical science since the publication of the old
dictionary. It is chiefly to the work of Wallach, and to the
introduction of the conception of the asymmetric carbon atom, that
this advancement is due.
   The various short articles by the editors do not call for special
notice; it is sufficient to state that the standard of excellence has
been maintained throughout. It is with the greatest pleasure
that we acknowledge the indebtedness of the whole chemical
world to the editors of this great work and their coadjutors. The
selection of contributors has from the beginning been most
judicious, the treatment of the various subjects has been kept well
within the bounds of sound knowledge, and the terseness of
description has enabled them to compress into the allotted com
pass of four volumes the vast mass of fact and theory of which
the modern science of Chemistry is composed. It is a matter for
congratulation that English scientific literature is in possession of
such a work. To simply commend it to the notice of chemists is
insufficient; we may go so far as to declare that it is absolutely
indispensable to every worker in every department of our science.

    1. “Notes on some recent Sections in the Malvern Hills.        By
Prof. A. H. Green, M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   The sections described occur on the east side of the Herefordshire
Beacon, and for convenience are named the Warren House Rocks.
They are bedded, and have a general north-and-south strike. The
great bulk of the rocks are hard, close-grained, and splintery, and
are largely altered, and in many cases thickly veined with calcite.

            Denbighshire Series of South Denbighshire.            141
Details of their structure are given; and the author states that he
is inclined to regard them as a group of bedded acid lavas and tuffs,
crossed by three bands of dolerite. What little balance of evidence
there is seems to be in favour of the intrusive character of the
dolerites.   No true limestones have been found, and the only very
calcareous rock seen is regarded as a rock belonging to the volcanic
group which has been largely calcified.
    Somewhat similar rocks are found on the southern part of Ragged
stone Hill, and a shattered felstone occurs forming an isolated boss
south of Chase End Hill.
    Several hypotheses present themselves as to the relationship be
tween the Warren House Rocks and the Crystalline Schists. The
former may be distinct from the latter, in which case the absence of
mechanical deformation would indicate that they are younger. If
we consider that the Malvern Schists have been formed out of
volcanic rocks by dynamic metamorphism, the Raggedstone Hill
rocks may be a portion of the volcanic complex which has under
gone only partial transformation, whilst the Warren Hill rocks have
altogether escaped metamorphism, the crystalline schists repre
 senting its final stages.
    2. ‘The Denbighshire Series of South Denbighshire. By Philip
 Lake, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
    The area to which this paper chiefly refers is the south-western
 quarter of the Llangollen basin of Silurian rocks. The beds are
 here very little disturbed, and the sequence is readily made out.
 The following subdivisions are recognized (in descending order):—
       Leintwardinensis-slates; with Monograptus leintwardinensis.
       Upper gritty beds; with no fossils known.
       Nantglyn flags; with M. colonus, Cardiola, &c.
       Moel Ferna slates; with M. priodon, M. Flemingii.
       Pen-y-glog grit.
       Pen-y-glog slate; with M. personatus, M. priodon, Retiolites
          Geinitzianus, &c.
     Farther east the fossiliferous beds of Dinas Brân appear to lie
 considerably above the Leintwardinensis-slates.
     On comparison with other areas it is found that this succession is
 almost identical with that in the Long Mountain, in North Denbigh
  shire, and in the Lake District. It is also inferred that the
  Leintwardinensis-slates represent the Leintwardine Flags of Here
  fordshire, and that the Dinas Brân beds correspond with a part of
  the Upper Ludlow.
     3. ‘On some Points in the Geology of the Harlech Area.         By
  the Rev. J. F. Blake, M.A., F.G.S.
     In testing the conclusions arrived at in regard to the Llanberis
  and Penrhyn area by an examination of that of Harlech, two

142            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
questions are raised concerning the latter:—(1) Can a succession be
traced below the Purple Slates similar to that which the author has
described as occurring in Caernarvonshire? and (2) Where is the
most natural break in the series, and does it show an unconformity?
    With reference to the first question, the author gives his reasons
for concluding that, as far as the succession is seen in the Harlech
area, it is similar to that of Caernarvonshire. A group of Purple
Slates is described which so closely resembles the Llanberis and
Penrhyn Slates that he considered himself justified in definitely
correlating them with those slates. Below these are slaty grey
wackes, which, if not identical with those of Caernarvonshire, bear
a greater resemblance to them than any other part of the series
does. No older beds are seen. Above the Purple Slates are the
Harlech Grits proper.
    In discussing the second question, the author describes con
glomeratic beds occurring some distance above the base of these
Harlech Grits; but at Pont Llyn-y-Crom the junction between them
and the underlying Purple Slates shows features recalling what is
 seen at Bronllwyd. He discusses the possible existence of an
unconformity at the base of these grits, and concludes that on the
 whole the phenomena point, though not very strongly, to an
 unconformity of no great importance.
    The concluding part of the paper is occupied with a consideration

        GENTLEMEN,
 I    READ in No. 232, September 1894, of the Philosophical
       Magazine a paper by Mr. Webster Low, “On the Velocity
 of Sound in Air, Gases, and Vapours for Pure Notes of different
  Pitch.” I deem it important to acquaint the Editors of the Philo
  sophical Magazine that as long ago as 1881 I used a method nearly
  identical with Mr. Low's in order to determine the velocity of
  sound in some gases (air, CO, N,0), and particularly in chlorine,
  its value for this gas being till that time quite unknown. My
  results were published in the Acts of the Venetian Institute",
  and in abstract in other periodicalst. As to chlorine, which was

      INFLUENCE OF MAGNETIC FIELDS ON THE ELECTRICAL
                    CONDUCTIVITY OF BISMUTH.
            To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
      GENTLEMEN,
   I regret that mention of the papers by Dr. Edm. Van Aubel in
the Annales de Chimie et de Physique for 1889, and in the Journal
de Physique for 1893, was omitted from my paper “On the Influence
of Magnetic Fields on the Electrical Conductivity of Bismuth ” in
your Magazine for November last. In his work on the Tem
perature-Coefficient of Bismuth, van Aubel found that it was con
siderably changed in a magnetic field; and at the “Congrès des
Electriciens” in Paris in 1889 he emphasized the necessity for
observing the temperature, in measuring magnetic fields by the
resistance of bismuth spirals.
                          I remain, Gentlemen,
                                     Yours faithfully,

 ON THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE ON THE SPECIFIC HEAT
             OF ANILINE.     BY E. H. GRIFFITHS, M.A.
   NOTE, Dec. 7, 1894.—In a communication made to the Royal
Society on November 22, Professor Schuster pointed out an error
in my determination of the value of J, viz. that I had not made a
necessary correction for the specific heat of the air displaced by
the water; for the method I had adopted gave the difference in
the rate of rise when a certain space was filled first with air and
then with water. This correction raises my value of J by about
1 in 4000.
  Now the specific gravity of aniline (1.02) but slightly exceeds that

144            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
of water; and as the method described in the preceding pages also
depends upon the measurement of differences in the rate of rise,
the correction would eliminate and would, therefore, not affect the
values of the specific heat of aniline as given in Table VII. Again,
if there are any errors in the values of the electrical standards
upon which my determination of J depends, they also would
eliminate during the calculations by which the specific heat of
aniline was ascertained.     There can, therefore, be no doubt that
the value assumed for J (4,198 x 107) is the correct one to be used
for the reduction of the observations on aniline.
      ON THE DIELECTRIC POWER OF ICE.           BY M. A. PEROT.
   I published on June 29, 1894, the result of experiments made to
determine the dielectric constant of ice by electrical oscillations.
In calculating these experiments, which I had carried out as for
glass, I made an error due to the external capacity, which in those
experiments is altered, the condenser being wholly or partially
immersed in the dielectric. M. Blondlot having pointed out the
disagreement between his results and those which I had obtained,
I have gone through the calculations, and made new experiments,
the result of which is given below:—

  ON THE REFRACTION AND DISPERSION OF ELECTRICAL RAYS.
               BY E. GARBASSO AND E. ASCHKINASS.
   The authors summarize the results of their research as follows:–
   We have shown that the rays proceeding from a Hertz's pri
mary conductor may, by means of a prism built up of resonators,
be resolved into a spectrum, and draw from this the following
conclusions:
   (a) The rays of electrical force emitted are not necessarily to be
regarded physically as monochromatic, but as compound, with as
much justification as ordinary light.
   (b) Helmholtz's theory of colour-dispersion acquires fresh sup
port from our experiments.—Wiedemann's Annalen, No. 11, 1894.

mechanical explanation of the laws discovered by him. On
the basis of the researches of Galileo, Newton was the founder
of the Mechanics of to-day; and on his principles the edifice
of the action-at-a-distance theory has been founded. Until
Newton's time the notion of a direct action at a distance was
completely unknown : on the contrary, many experiments
exist by the Greek philosophers to account for the seeming
action at a distance by the intervention of a medium; there
fore Demokritos sought to explain natural phenomena by the
motions of very fine bodies. First Boscovich, Mosotti,
Wilhelm Weber, and many others developed the aspect of
nature on the basis laid down by Newton, in accordance with
which the universe consists of a number (if even very great)

University of Munich, for the attainment of the degree of Doctor of

146               Dr. S. Tolver Preston on some
of material points, which, without anything intervening, act
on each other directly at a distance, according to a mathe
matically exact formulated law. If the initial positions and
velocities of all the atoms are given, then their motions can be
calculated for any periods of time from the equations formulated
 by Newton, and so a clearly defined mathematical problem
 is '.
      t is, however, well to observe that Newton did not believe
 in such an action at a distance without the intervention of
 £g. as appears from his third letter to Bentley, where
   e says:—
     “That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to
 matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance
 through a vacuum, without the mediation of anything else,
 by and through which their action and force may be conveyed
 from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity, that I
 believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent
 faculty of thinking, can ever fall into it” (Newton’s third
 letter to Bentley,   £         25, 1692-3).
     In the same sense speak many subsequent important
 scientists.    For instance Count Rumford remarks :
     “Nobody surely in his sober senses has ever pretended
 to understand the mechanism of gravitation, and yet what
 sublime discoveries has our immortal Newton been enabled to
  make, merely by the investigation of the laws of its action”
  (“An Inquiry concerning the Source of the Heat which is
 excited by Friction,” by Count Rumford, Phil. Trans. 1798).
     These last scientists are therefore not satisfied with the
  Boscovich-Mosotti explanation of natural phenomena; they
  demand rather an explanation (by the intervention of a
  medium) of the seeming action at a distance. To give such
  an explanation was never seriously attempted by Newton :
  the first attempt of that kind is to be found in the mechanical
  gravitation theory of Le Sage, born at Geneva in 1724. This
  theory is contained in a memoir published in the Transactions
  of the Royal Berlin Academy for 1782, under the title
   Lucrèce Newtonien. There is also a book, Deuw Traités
  de Physique mécanique, edited by Pierre Prévost, Paris,
  1818, which contains a full description of Le Sage's theory.
     Le Sage lays emphasis on the probability of the existence
  of a mechanism of gravitation, and devoted his life to the
  development of his idea. The introductory paragraph of his
  memoir (entitled Lucrèce Newtonien) is as follows, translated
  from the French original, viz.:
     “I propose to show that if the first Epicureans had had as
  healthy ideas of Cosmography as several of their contem

                Dynamical Theories of Gravitation.           147
poraries (to whom they would not listen), and only a part of
the knowledge of Geometry which was then prevalent, they
would in all probability have discovered the laws of universal
gravitation and its mechanical cause. Laws, the discovery
and the demonstration of which constitute the fame of the
most powerful genius that has ever existed; and Cause, which
after having been the ambition for a long time of the greatest
scientists, is at present the despair of their successors. So
that, for example, the celebrated laws of Kepler, discovered
somewhat less than 200 years ago, partly by gratuitous
conjectures, and partly by repeated trial and error, would
have been no more than inevitable corollaries which could
have been arrived at by these ancient philosophers by in
vestigating the mechanism of nature. The same conclusion
applies also to the laws of Galileo upon the fall of bodies, the
discovery of which took place still later, and which have been
more contested, because the experiments upon which this dis
covery was based permitted a latitude in their results
(necessarily rough), which would make them fit equally well
with other laws, so that one did not fail to contest them :
whereas the inferred consequences of the shock of atoms would
have been unmistakably in favour of the only true principle,
viz., equal accelerations in equal times.” (Trans of Royal
Berlin Academy, 1782.)
   On this paragraph the following opinion is emitted by
Lord Kelvin, viz.:—
   “If Le Sage had but excepted Kepler’s third law, it must .
be admitted that his case, as stated above, would have been
thoroughly established by the arguments of his “mémoire”;
for the Epicurean assumption of parallelism adopted to suit
the false idea of the earth being flat, prevented the discovery
of the law of the inverse square of the distance, which the
mathematicians of that day were quite competent to make,
if the hypothesis of atoms moving in all directions through
space, and rarely coming into collision with one another, had
been set before them, with the problem of determining the
force with which the impacts would press together two
spherical bodies, such as the earth and moon were held to be
by some of the contemporary philosophers to whom the
Epicureans “would not listen.” But nothing less than
direct observation, proving Kepler’s third law—Galileo’s
experiment on bodies falling from the tower of Pisa, Boyle's
guinea-and-feather experiment, and Newton's experiment of
 the vibrations of pendulums composed of different kinds of
 substance—could either give the idea that gravity is pro
portional to mass, or prove   '2   it is so to a high degree of

148              Dr. S. Tolver Preston on some
accuracy for large bodies and small bodies, and for bodies of
different kinds of substance” (Phil Mag. May 1873, p. 323).
                       Le Sage’s Theory.
   Le Sage based his theory on perfectly arbitrary assump
tions. He assumed (Deux Traités de Physique mécanique,
Paris 1818, edition Pierre Prévost):—
   (1) That a number of streams of atoms, equally distributed
in space, exist; of which each stream moves continually in
one and the same direction.
    (2) The length of these streams (at the centre of which the
universe known to us is placed) is finite, but very great;
therefore gravitation must have a correspondingly limited
period for existence.
   (3) That the streams must be everywhere equally dense.
   (4) That the mean velocity of the streams is everywhere
the same.
   The conditions above set forth depend manifestly on per
fectly arbitrary assumptions, and it is not easy to see by
what mechanism such streams should either originate or be
kept up. As regards the behaviour of these streams of atoms
towards gross matter, Le Sage assumes the following. Gross
matter is chiefly freely penetrated by the streams of atoms,
only a small part of their energy is absorbed by gross matter,
which implies a continuous annihilation of energy. Whence
it arises that every portion of gross matter opposes a certain
shelter to every other neighbouring portion from the en
counters of the streams of atoms; and from this the apparent
attraction of the gross matter according to the Newtonian law
of gravity is easily explained.
    Lord Kelvin presupposes exactly the same streams of atoms
as Le Sage; the mechanism which regulates or maintains
these atom-streams therefore remains with him as obscure as
with Le Sage. An important progress in Lord Kelvin’s case
 consists, however, in the fact that he regards the atoms as
elastic. In order to explain the elasticity, he proposes to
regard the atoms as vortex rings in a perfect liquid. The
elasticity of these is then explained by the laws which Helm
holtz found to apply to the motions of such vortex rings.
    The aether atoms then rebound from gross matter in
accordance with the laws of elastic collision: instead of the
absorption (annihilation) of energy assumed by Le Sage,
 Lord Kelvin supposes that the aether atoms, in addition to
their translatory energy, also possess an energy of internal
 motion, just as Clausius assumes for the molecules of ordinary
gases.                  -

                Dynamical Theories of Gravitation.           149
    On account of the relatively very large dimensions and
 superior elastic rigidity of the gross molecule, it is scarcely
disturbed by the collision of the very minute atom. On the
 other hand, the minute atom is thrown into strong vibration
 and rotation by the blow.          This vibration or rotation
 (“internal motion”) cannot evidently be generated out of
nothing. The small atom therefore loses at impact a portion
of its translatory motion, by converting the same into internal
motion (vibration and rotation). The diminution of the
 translatory motion of the small gravity-atoms at their en
 counter with gross molecules is therefore rather to be looked
upon as a necessary deduction than as an hypothesis. One
might, indeed, easily illustrate this fact experimentally.
   If an elementary example be excused, we can consider the
case when any small elastic body such as a small polished
steel key-ring is thrown against the surface of a polished steel
anvil. A key-ring and an anvil (of the same metal) may be
equally elastic, but on account of the considerable difference
in their dimensions—therefore pliability—only the small ring
will be thrown into perceptible vibration by the encounter
(or into rotation, for the anvil cannot rotate on account of its
mass). The ring rebounds with a diminution of its translatory
motion, by converting the same into vibration and rotation.
   The atom gains its full translatory motion gradually again
by collisions against atoms of its own kind,—from the fact
that the proportionality existing between the amount of trans
latory motion and the amount of internal motion of the atom
continually strives to maintain itself constant; which is a
known consequence of the kinetic theory of gases, demon
strated by Clausius.
   So is explained how the aether atoms, in being sifted through
gross matter, on the average lose a certain velocity of trans
latory motion, and that therefore a portion of gross matter
“shelters” any other neighbouring portion from the impacts
of the aether atoms.
   The penetration of the two masses by the flying aether atoms
brings about the fact that on the adjacent sides of the two
masses the pressure of the medium is smaller than on the remote
sides of the molecular surfaces of the two masses.   The remote
sides encounter the full or undiminished translatory velocity
of the atoms. Therefore the two masses are naturally driven
together, and with a force which obviously, from the nature
of the case, must be proportional to the square of the distance
of the masses. The further explanation of the gravitation
effect is then exactly as by Le Sage’s theory.
   The present writer attempted in some papers, of which the

150                Dr. S. Tolver Preston on some
first appeared in the Philosophical Magazine, Sept. 1877,
to replace the arbitrarily assumed atom streams of Le Sage
and Lord Kelvin by a motion which is exactly analogous to
that which belongs to the kinetic theory of gases.
    In that way the most obscure assumption of Le Sage's
 theory finds an unforced explanation—namely, how the
 symmetrical motion of the atoms under the continual changes
 of their direction produced by their collisions against gross
 matter, is kept up.                               -
     Now it has already been mathematically demonstrated in
 the case of ordinary gases, that an automatic correction goes
 on in a system of bodies or particles in free collision, and such
 a one that the particles are forced to move equally in all
 directions: and this is the absolutely necessary condition for
 equal pressure in all directions. The rate of establishment of
 this automatic correction, which is chiefly brought about by
 the oblique encounters, has, in fact, been calculated mathe
 matically by Prof. Ludwig Boltzmann for ordinary gases.
 This adjustment (or correction) is in fact of such a stable
 character, that if the motion of the gas particles were artificially
 disturbed, the particles would of themselves equalize the
 motion again, so that an equal number of particles are moving
 in any two opposite directions. The motion can also be
 described so, that if we think of any small point situated
 anywhere in space, the atoms are at every instant flying
 towards and from this point, exactly as if it were a luminous
 point.
     Hence it follows that when a system of atoms is left to
  itself, it will, by the principles of dynamics, automatically
  adjust the character of its motion in such a way that this
  motion is adapted to produce the gravitation effects. The
  motion of streams of atoms equally at all angles, which
  Le Sage gave forth as an arbitrary postulate, is attainable
 in a gas without any postulate. Instead of streams, each of
  which for itself maintains a constant direction of motion, and
 which cease to flow after a long epoch of time, we have a per
  manent motion of atoms correcting itself in a self-acting
  manner; and which fulfils the wished-for object.
     So, therefore, we have succeeded, by starting from a very
  simple and thoroughly natural foundation, in establishing all
  those conditions which Le Sage needs for his theory.
     Nevertheless there are certain assumptions concerning
  quantitative relations to be added. In the first place, the
 mean length of path of an aether atom must be assumed to be
 exceedingly great. If, namely, the same were small in pro
 portion to the distance between two influencing masses, then

               Dynamical Theories of Gravitation.             151
in the intervening space between these masses, by the collisions
of the aether atoms among themselves, the normal proportion
ality between translatory and internal motion of the atoms
would be nearly restored (by encounters), and therefore the
mutual shelter of the two masses would nearly be nullified.
   The range of gravitation (its sphere of action) is therefore
conditioned by the mean length of path of the atoms, and
this may be regarded as an interesting deduction from the
theory. Accordingly, on the assumption that the mean dis
tances of the stars (excepting, of course, the relatively approxi
mated double stars) are large in proportion to the mean length
of path of the atoms, the inference would follow that the stars
do not gravitate towards each other—and apparently in that
way the universe would rather gain than lose in stability.
One sees then that the mean length of path of the ather atoms
must be great in comparison with those distances across which
Newton’s law has been demonstrated to apply with exactness.
   In an article in the Encyc. Brit. 1875 (or Scientific Papers,
vol. ii. p. 476) Maxwell raises the objection that by the atomic
encounters gross matter would be raised to a white heat; he
grounds this inference on the theorem that for thermal equili
brium between atoms or molecules the mean energy of
translatory motion must be equal. Now the pressure (to take
some symbol) is equal to the product of the mean energy of
translatory motion L of an atom into the number N of atoms
contained in the unit of volume.         If, therefore, the mean
energy of translatory motion of an aether atom be equal to
that of a molecule of gross matter, which we can calculate in
the case of ordinary gases, then N for the aether must have an
enormous value, in order to be able to account for the gravita
tion pressure. Now Maxwell says: we are tolerably certain
that N for the aether is small compared with the value of N for
gross matter. From this he concludes that in order to explain
the gravitation pressure, it is necessary to assume L enor
mously great. And according to the theorem that for thermal
equilibrium L must be the same for all atoms (or molecules),
it would follow that L also for the molecules of gross matter
must finally assume a value which is much greater than
that which we find in the case of gases. In other words, that
all gross matter must be raised to a white heat by the collisions
of the aether atoms. But, independently of the fact that the
above-named theorem, relating to thermal equilibrium, for
molecules or atoms of very different size is still contested, it
seems to me that no cogent reason exists for the assumption
that N is smaller for the aether than for gross matter. One
can, in fact, imagine the aether atoms as small as one pleases;

152              Dr. S. Tolver Preston on some
then an enormous number of them can exist in the unit of
volume combined with an enormously great length of path.
    In general, in putting forward a theory of this kind, we
should see no improbability in the assumption of either a very
great or a very small number. Our objection to uncommonly
great or uncommonly small numbers rests in fact upon custom,
and regularly disappears as soon as the theory in question has
further introduced itself.
    There exists in space field enough, when necessary, for
finer material, as our conceptions are not limited in the
direction of smallness, and the smaller the particles, the
quicker is their natural speed of motion, and the more intense
 the enclosed store of concealed energy: also the whole
 arrangement becomes all the less appreciable by our senses.
 The effects—called gravitational effects—on the other hand,
 do not escape detection by our senses; and reasoning from
 these effects, we trace and infer the invisible causes which lie
 at the basis of these effects.
     Evidently there exists just as little an obstacle in space to
 smallness of size as to any given velocity of motion, and there
 are reasons for supposing that gravity must propagate itself
 with great velocity. Precisely because the ' velocity
 of the atoms is great, the material concerned in producing
 gravity can be very limited in quantity, and notwithstand
 ing that exert a very considerable pressure. The atoms are
 therefore to be assumed very small, almost points, the con
 dition adapted for a great length of path. The analogy of
 this gravitation mechanism (at least in principle) with the
  generally assumed structure of our atmosphere, may be
  regarded as a recommendation to the theory.
     A further objection of Maxwell's, that according to this
  theory the action of gravity could only be kept up by an
  enormous expenditure of external work little short of ruinous,
  applies in fact to the theory of Le Sage in the form presented
  by Lord Kelvin; also to the theories of Isenkrahe and Bock
  considered further on; not, however, to the theory set forth by
  the present writer, because, according to this latter theory, the
  maintenance of the motion of the aether atoms demands just
  as little an expenditure of energy as the maintenance of the
   motion of the molecules of a gas in the ordinary gas theory.
   Moreover, the “shelter” of one mass by another is explained
   without any absorption of energy.
      The large store of energy contained in the aether atoms is
  moreover of use for the explanation of the most varied natural
  phenomena; and it may be observed that the intervention of

               Dynamical Theories of Gravitation.             153
a medium is wanted in other respects, for instance for the
elucidation of magnetic and electric phenomena.
    It may be mentioned, further, that the explanation of gravi
tation carries with it the great advantage of rendering super
fluous the idea of the existence of two (inherently different)
kinds of matter, “ponderable” and “imponderable.” The
smaller atoms in space do not gravitate, only because the
mechanism of gravitation cannot itself be subject to the con
ditions for producing gravitation. So, therefore, disappear
the almost contradictory properties, “ponderable” and “im.
ponderable,” which have been arbitrarily attributed to matter:
and we have therefore no reason for believing that the atoms
diffused in space differ essentially from gross molecules,
excepting in their dimensions. To the abandonment of the
idea of two inherently different kinds of matter, the abandon
 ment of two supposed different kinds of energy is analogous—
 viz., energy with motion, and energy without motion. Accord
 ingly there would remain only one kind of energy, namely,
 that which a moving body possesses.
    Another important quantitative relation is so conditioned
 that the “shelter” is evidently proportional to the surface
 exposed to the moving atoms; the gravitational effect, on the
 other hand, is proportional to the mass, as experiment shows.
 This result can only be achieved by supposing gross matter to
 possess a very porous structure. In that way, the gross
 molecules inside a body are reached or affected by the
 penetrating aether atoms almost with the same facility as the
 external molecules of the body. If we assume that the
 quantity of material contained in the substance of any mole
 cule is very small compared with the vacant space contained
 in that same molecule, and if one does not suppose any super
 fluous material in the structure of the molecule; the pro
 portionality existing between gravitation and mass can be
  satisfied as closely as observation requires.
                Some Remarks on Crystal Structure.
     Even Le Sage recognized that for the elucidation of the
  gravitational effects the assumption of a porous or open struc
  ture in matter is necessary.      Lord Kelvin draws a curious
  inference from this. In the Philosophical Magazine, May
  1873, postscript p. 331, Lord Kelvin supposes that it might
  be probable that bi-axial crystals would not be penetrable
  with equal facility in all directions by the aether atoms. If
  that were so, such crystals would possess a (even if very small)
  difference of weight, according as the one or the other axis is

154               Dr. S. Tolver Preston on some
vertical. Have, however, sufficiently delicate experiments
been made on this point?
   A contribution published by me in the Philosophical
Magazine for April 1880 on crystalline structure might be
mentioned here.
   I have tried to define further this open structure, so that it
appears to be well adapted for the explanation of cohesion,
adhesion, and chemical affinity.
   One knows how the cells of bees are formed by pressure,
and how by pressure elastic spheres may be converted into
angular, such as hexagonal-shaped, bodies.
   As remarked, the gravitation theory (and many independent
facts) demand that the molecules of bodies shall possess an
open structure; which also satisfies the conditions of lightness
and economy of material. As crystals exist, it is sometimes
supposed that the molecules of bodies (whose open structure is
often illustrated by cubes and other figures formed of wire)
themselves represent the shapes of the crystals.
   We do not, however, need to assume that the molecules
possess exactly such shapes, because if the separate molecules
themselves possessed even a rounded structure, they must be
pressed into angular forms as soon as two or more of them
were pressed together by impacts of the aether atoms. Let us
take for illustration the simplest open structure, viz. rings;
although it is not thereby implied that this is the sole ground
form of the molecules. Elastic molecules of any very open
structure of three dimensions would probably give a greater
stability to the crystal mass formed out of them.
   Simple elastic rings can then by pressure of their boundaries
against each other (as caused by the flying of very minute
aether atoms through the structure) conceivably be changed
into hexagonal, square figures, &c. Fig. 1 may serve to

              Dynamical Theories of Gravitation.                  155
show such a pressure-effect produced by atomic motion, where
elastic rings are converted into the hexagonal forms of crystals.
Cohesion (as now is generally supposed) is only gravitation *
by contact. From the above considerations, it becomes easy
to understand that elastic crystal forms can sometimes change
into non-crystalline forms; so some crystallizable metals, such
as iron and zinc, lose all crystalline structure by rolling and
hammering, and become ductile. Crystalline sulphur can, by
mere warming, pass over into a sort of indiarubber sulphur.
It is evident in fact that the irregular arrangement of the
elastic molecules of a substance favours the gliding of the
molecules over each other; while, on the other hand, the
regularly arranged molecules which are in contact at their
boundaries (corresponding to crystalline structure) cannot be
displaced at all without separating entirely : take for instance
crystallized cast-iron and some other metals.
    The freedom allowed to the molecules to arrange themselves
in the case of solutions may be favourable for the produc
tion of crystalline structure, while rolling, hammering, &c.,
manifestly forces the molecules to aggregate in an irregular
lmanner.
    When elastic molecules of very open structure cross each
 other irregularly in all directions, or are arranged in parallel
 layers (as produced by the rolling of a metal), then it be
comes obvious that a subsequent displacement of the molecules,
as by a tensile-stress for example, does not necessarily produce
 actual severance; but the atomic streams—from the very
 nature of this cause—can easily produce contact in fresh
 places, and so a gliding of molecules over each other is
 possible, without separation. So a bar of malleable iron
 gradually lengthens itself under a tensile-stress. On the
 other hand, because crystalline structure prevents all gliding
 of the molecules, it becomes impossible in this case for the
 atomic streams to cause contact in fresh places. The attempt
 to stretch a cast-iron bar, then, means separation of the mole
 cules. I will not pursue these considerations more at length
 here: they may well be thought out into greater detail.
    It may just be remarked, in passing, how elastic rings,
 fig. 2, can at first repel each other, merely on account of their
 elasticity of form; and how in fig. 3, if the molecules are
 made to approach closer by force, this has as a consequence
   * A fact observed by Prof. Dewar may be favourable to this view.
 The cohesion of metallic wires does not diminish (but rather the con
 trary) by a cold of -180°C. that of liquid oxygen. Now, cooling of
 the metal could manifestly have no influence on the atomic streams,
 which are independent,               -

 156              Dr. S. Tolver Preston on some
 that the pressure of the atomic streams over the enlarged
 surface of contact overcomes the elasticity of form, and the
                Fig. 2.                         Fig. 3.
                                            CO
 molecules cohere (which one calls “attraction”). As the
 converse of this, when the molecules are by a tensile-stress
 pulled nearly apart : then their elasticity of form can make
the molecules suddenly spring apart of themselves, as, for
instance, “unbreakable” glass flies into dust, when the mole
cular equilibrium is upset    '.  a very sharp blow. Also, in
general, if something is broken, the pieces will not readily
 unite of themselves, when placed in contact. The natural
elasticity of shape of the elastic molecules causes an initial
repulsion. By suitable assumption regarding thickness, stiff
ness, &c., of these ring-like molecular forms, the differences
between the “chemical affinity” of different molecules might
doubtless be accounted for.
     Some may think that the above considerations are too
 simple to contain truth. Nevertheless one may rightly ask
 whether it is not precisely simplicity that one in general
seeks in mechanism          The elucidation may serve as an
initial explanation of certain obscure facts, which may develop
itself further.
    Respecting the elasticity of molecules (or atoms) Lord
Kelvin makes the following observation:—
   “We are forbidden by the modern physical theory of the
conservation of energy to assume inelasticity, or anything
short of perfect elasticity, in the ultimate molecules” (Phil.
 Mag. May 1873, p. 329).
   The conception of elastic molecules (also illustrated in a
striking manner by spectroscopic observations) appears, as
said, to be a very practical conception for Physics, which is
much needed. By this assumption the almost inconceivable
idea of the sharp blows of “infinitely hard” molecules is
avoided. On account of the perfect elasticity, all motions
take place with “elegance” and smoothness, which permits
a mobile equilibrium in nature, and (without due precautions)
may well deceive the senses into the idea that in so-called
“space” all is in repose.
   It is a known consequence of the Newtonian law of gra
vitation, that the increase of attraction by diminution of
distance is so small that two massive bodies, when they touch

              Dynamical Theories of Gravitation.               157
each other, attract each other so much the less the smaller
they are; which one at once sees in the case of two spheres in
contact, and can also demonstrate for bodies of other shapes.
If, therefore, one attributes a massive structure to molecules,
then, for the explanation of cohesion and chemical affinity.
forces must be assumed which, by diminution of distance,
increase quicker in intensity than according to the Newtonian
gravitation law. On the other hand, the attraction of two
cylinders of finite length and infinitely small section becomes
infinitely great so soon as they touch each other. It is
possible, therefore, on the basis of the here assumed open
structure of matter, also to account for cohesion, adhesion,
and chemical affinity, without necessarily having recourse to
forces which, with diminished distance, augment quicker in
intensity than the Newtonian law of gravity demands.
                    The Theory of Isenkrahe.
   Two years after the present writer's first published paper,
appeared the gravitation theory of Dr. Isenkrahe", which
attempts an explanation of gravity based on the kinetic theory
of gases, and which seems in Germany to have become very
well known. The author of this theory makes no mention of
my theory, and it doubtless escaped his attention at that time.
   The gravitation theory of Dr. Isenkrahe is founded on
inelastic collision, which obviously involves the annihilation
of energy, whereby the gas producing gravity would, after a
certain (even very long) epoch, come to rest, and so gravi
tation cease to exist.
   In a plausible enough way (at first sight at least) the
author despises elasticity as a qualitas occulta, which, as he
thinks, needs an explanation just as much as gravity itself.
It seems, however, to have been overlooked that elasticity (at
the encounters of molecules) is already demonstrated to exist
by the principle of the conservation of energy, and of the
centre of mass. The explanation of elasticity is a deeper one
than the explanation of gravitation: therefore let us advance
from step to step forward in the elucidation, without pushing
on in too great a hurry.
   All the consequences of the kinetic theory of gases are
already built on the assumption of elasticity: the application
of this principle to the smaller particles is therefore to be
viewed as a perfectly natural and logical consequence. In
fact the gravitation pressure by the encounters of elastic

Sohn, Braunschweig, 1879.)        -

158               Dr. S. Tolver Preston on some .
particles is explained quite as completely as the air-pressure
is explained by the encounters of such particles (molecules).
If one only accepts as valid the two principles of the conser
vation of energy and of the centre of mass, then one must
attribute elasticity as well to the aether as to gas molecules,
without being troubled about the further explanation of its
nature.
   Therefore I have without hesitation regarded molecules of
open structure as elastic, which implies that by the impact of
such molecules no energy is annihilated. Dr. Isenkrahe
regards the molecules of bodies as absolutely hard solid
spheres which, in order that gravity by atomic encounters
(i. e. its proportionality to mass) may be explained, must be
far apart from each other. How can one imagine to oneself
a structure composed of perfectly hard molecules situated far
apart which shall have only tolerable stiffness and stability?
Such a body made up of widely separated spherical molecules,
if no other forces but gravity acted, could at the most behave
like a gas, but never as a 'i or liquid body.
   On the other hand, elastic molecules of open structure may
be made to cohere at their boundaries by the pressure of the
smaller atoms, which at the same time easily fly through the
open parts of the structure. Have we not here at least a
  roundwork for the conceptions upon which we may hope
to build further?
   Dr. Isenkrahe gives no limits for the value of the mean
length of path, whereas it seems to me to be a very important
point of my theory, that the mean length of path must be
assumed great in comparison with the planetary distances.
   Concerning the calculations which Dr. £ attaches
to his theory, Dr. A. M. Bock, who made the theory of
Isenkrahe the basis of his ‘Inaugural Dissertation”, expresses
himself as follows:–
   “The aim and the purpose of the atomic aether theory,
namely to construct universal gravitation, is, as mentioned in
the introduction to the Räthsel von der Schwerkraft, not fully
attained.     There is no formula deduced from which, as a
starting-point, one could follow out the theory further.
One sees oneself forced therefore, in the sense of the theory,
to deduce an (if only in some measure rigorous) expression
for the attraction” (p. 18, under the paragraph-title Die
Anziehung zweier Körper).
   On the developments and modifications which Dr. Isen
krahe’s calculations received through Dr. Bock I allow myself

no opinion. The bases of them are nevertheless quite un
altered, and therefore open to the same objections; namely,
he sets himself in contradiction with the principle of the
conservation of energy, which, moreover, Dr. Bock himself
admits.

   APPENDIX (added Jan. 1895).—All who have thought on the
subject know that, in the case of a falling body, the motion gene
rated comes from the aether, according to any dynamical explana
tion of gravitation: and when the body strikes the earth's surface,
shaking its molecules into vibration by the concussion, these
(“heat”) vibrations develop waves in the aether, or are “radiated”
away. So we have a cyclical process here, where motion passes
from a material agent and back again to that agent, in a circle.
    In accordance with the above we see, then, that stars or
 stellar suns do not “pour their heat unrequited into space,” but
 return their stores of motion to the source whence they were
 obtained. For if gravity be caused by a material agent, and if
 solar energy be derived from gravity, then manifestly solar energy
 is returning only to its original source, to be again available for
 generating heat (through gravitation) in some other regions of
 the universe.
    Evidently, if chemical action be caused by a material medium, then
 an animal or a steam-engine lifting a weight is an instance (again)
 of motion coming from a material substance, and going back to it
 in a circle at the same time.    A locomotive, as we know, converts
 all its energy into heat (which is radiated into the aether) as it
 progresses with its train: so clearly we have the cyclical process
 of exchange of motion again here: the same being true of work
 derived from falling water (cataracts) or from winds. If, finally,
 one pure speculation be permitted, we might suggest that over
 grown stars may, towards their centres, become from excessive
 compression inadequately penetrable by the atoms of the aethereal
 gas, and so the overgrown masses be broken up by conversion
 of the aethereal motion into heat. Thus cyclical change would
 apply to the Universe generally: the stellar bodies constituting in
 sum a gigantic grained gas inside an excessively fine atomic one.
 For the tentative development of this idea, a paper in the
 Philosophical Magazine, August 1879, also Sitzungsberichte, April
 1883, Vienna, may be mentioned. So it appears that the Universe
 may at present (in the same sense as a gas is) be in equilibrium of
 temperature.

 XV. Students’ Simple Apparatus for Determining the Me
    chanical Equivalent of Heat. By Prof. W. E. AYRTON
    and H. C. HAYCRAFT*.
                   I. The Object to be Attained. .      *
  S"        time ago the authors considered the possibility of
       constructing an apparatus for the determination of the
 mechanical equivalent of heat which could be placed in the
 hands of junior students, and which would enable a sufficiently
 accurate result to be obtained without the introduction of
 troublesome corrections. For such a purpose the electrical
 method was naturally adopted; for now that the commercial
 values of the electrical units are known with considerable
 accuracy in the C.G.S. system, it is possible to measure
 energy in foot-pounds by means of a good commercial
 ammeter voltmeter and watch with greater ease and certainty
 than by any mechanical dynamometer.
    Further, it has become easy to obtain as much electric
 power as is wanted for the experiment at a small cost, for the
 price of half a horse-power for ten minutes is only one-third
 of a penny, at 6d. per Board of Trade Unit. Hence there is
 not the practical objection to the electrical method that was
so formidable when currents of 20 or 30 amperes could only
be obtained by setting up a large battery of Grove or Bunsen
cells. Indeed every properly organized physical laboratory
is now provided with accumulators, from which a quarter or
half a horse-power may be readily obtained for use in such
experiments as those to be described ; or, when accumulators
are not available, power may be taken from the mains of one
of the numerous electric-supply companies.
                  II. Design of the Apparatus.
   The authors therefore set themselves to design an apparatus
which, when used with a good commercial ammeter voltmeter,
thermometer, and watch, would give the value of the me
chanical equivalent of heat correct to one per cent. without any
corrections having to be made even for the heat lost by radia
tion, convection, and conduction, and without any special
manipulative skill being required on the part of the observer.
   Broadly, the experiment consists in passing a known cur
rent through a resistance immersed in a known mass of water,
and measuring the rise of temperature in a given time, and
  * Communicated by the Physical Society: read November 23, 1894.
                                                                  /

    Determination of the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat. 161
the average value of the P.D. between the terminals of the
resistance.
   It is evident that if the loss of heat during the experiment
is to be small enough to be neglected in comparison with the
quantity of heat generated, either the rise of temperature
must be small, or must take place in a very short time, or
the ratio of the cooling surface to the mass of the water
heated must be small. As it is impracticable to reduce either
the rise of temperature or the time to very small limits, and
also to measure them with ease and accuracy, it is clear that
the result is best obtained by using a large quantity of water,
for the ratio of the surface area to the mass can then be made
small enough to bring the error due to cooling within the
required limits. But a large quantity of water necessarily
involves the use of a large amount of electrical energy; and
we thus arrive at the result that the accuracy attainable
depends upon the amount of power at our disposal, and will
be greater the greater the electric power that can be supplied.
   In designing such an apparatus, then, the first thing to
determine is the amount of electric power that can be used,
and the details should then be arranged so as to get the least
error in the result.     In those cases in which an increased
accuracy in one measurement involves a diminished accuracy
in another, it is best to make the errors due to the two causes
equal. For example, suppose that the time during which the
electric energy is supplied is such that we can only measure
it to one per cent., while the error due to cooling during the
experiment is only ¥ per cent. We can clearly increase the
accuracy of the result if we increase the time until the pro
bable error in reading it is equal to the error due to cooling
during that time, say # per cent. If we were still further to
increase the time, the error due to cooling would increase
and exceed # per cent, and our result would therefore be less
accurate. This equality of course does not apply to errors
that are not interdependent, such as errors in reading volts
and amperes: each of these errors should independently be
be made as small as possible.
   The measurements to be made are as follows:
   (a) The value of the constant current passed through the
resistance.
   (b) The average value of the P.D. between its terminals,
   (c) The mass of water heated, to which must be added the
water-equivalent of the containing vessel, resistance-coil, and
stirrer.
   (d) The rise of temperature of the water.
   (e) The time during which the current is passed.

162 Prof Ayrton and Mr Haycraft on an Apparatus for
    With the excellent electrical measuring-instruments now
obtainable it is possible to measure either current or pressure
with an accuracy much greater than one per cent.; indeed the
Board of Trade undertake to measure them within one tenth
part of one per cent." We can also measure the mass of water
with considerable accuracy: any error, even a large one, made
in determining the water-equivalent of the other bodies raised
in temperature becomes of small consequence when the water
equivalent is added to the much larger and accurately
measured mass. The measurements (a), (b), and (c), there
fore, give us little trouble and do not affect the design of the
"I'   he case of (d) and (e) is different.     In order to measure
 a change of temperature by means of a thermometer with the
 accuracy required, either the change must be fairly large or
 the thermometer must be very sensitive; but as it is of little
 use to employ an exceedingly sensitive thermometer to mea
sure the temperature of a liquid which is being locally and
 rapidly heated, even if the stirring is very efficient, it is
 necessary to use a fairly large rise of temperature. Similarly,
 if the circuit is to be closed and broken by hand, and the
 interval of time measured by an ordinary stop-watch such as
 would be found in a junior laboratory, there is a certain
 minimum time required to give the required accuracy of
 measurement. Also we must keep the ratio of heat lost to
 heat generated during the experiment equal to the probable
 error in the time or temperature-measurement; for as these
 three quantities are interdependent, the best condition is to
 make the percentage accuracy of the temperature measure
 ment, the percentage accuracy of the time measurement, and
 the percentage heat lost of beat generated, equal.

 or the accuracy of measurement is 0.64 of one per cent. The
 rise of temperature adopted should therefore be 3.87 degrees,
 the time being 2 minutes 20 seconds. The numbers actually
 adopted in the experiments were 2000 cubic centim. of water
 and a time of 2 minutes; the smaller quantity of water being
 adopted because the resistance of the immersed strip when
 made proved to be rather less than ohm, the watts taken at
 30 amperes being 260 instead of 300.
    To ensure success in an experiment of this kind it is neces
 sary that the water be as uniformly heated as possible, and
 that the stirring be very efficient; and after some considera
 tion the authors decided that the best of all plans would be to
 use a movable conductor of considerable surface, and so
 shaped that it might itself be used to stir the liquid. By this
 means an exceedingly uniform rise of temperature may be
 produced, every particle of water receiving heat direct from
 the strip at practically the same rate. The following is a
 description of the apparatus as constructed by the authors.
    A strip of manganin (chosen on account of its low tempera

        Determining the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.        165
 ture-coefficient), about $ inch wide, 0.03 inch thick, and about
 5 feet long, was bent into a series of zigzags (fig. 1) so as to
                              Fig. 1.
form a kind of circular gridiron, MM, in which the successive
portions of strip lie all in one plane, the whole being held
rigid by a strip of vulcanized fibre F crossing the gridiron
and to which each portion of strip was screwed. Another
precisely similar gridiron was placed 3 inches below the first,
and they were held together by three thin ebonite pillars E
screwed to the strips of vulcanized fibre, the whole forming
the top and bottom of a sort of cylindrical box, 5 inches dia
meter and 3 inches high. The two grids were joined in
series, and the ends of the strip of manganin were soldered
to two copper wires C C, about 0.128 inch thick and 6 inches
long, which were insulated from one another by vulcanized
fibre separators, and constituted a kind of handle by means of
which the open box could be moved up and down in the con
taining vessel.
   The whole surface exposed to the water received a thin coat
of varnish to prevent any electrolysis due to the difference of
potential between the different parts of the strip. At two
points in the same vertical line the zigzags forming the two
grids are bent so as to leave a space for the passage of a
thermometer t, the bulb of which is midway between the
grids when the lower one is resting on the bottom of the
vessel. The whole heating surface exposed to the water is
about 60 square inches, or 400 square centimetres, The

  166 Prof. Ayrton and Mr. Haycraft on an Apparatus for
  vessel used to hold the liquid is a thin glass beaker of just
  sufficient diameter to take the framework of manganin strip.
     Electric connexion with the two stiff wires which form
  the handle is made by means of two well-insulated very
  flexible leads LL, each composed of a strand of about 210
  copper wires 011 inch diameter. The size of the stout
  copper wires and of the flexible lead was chosen with the
  intention that there should neither be heat received nor heat
  lost on account of these connexions. The sectional area of
  the insulated flexible lead is rather greater than that of the
  stout copper wires, and the ultimate rise of temperature of
  both with a current of 30 amperes is about 7°C.; the rise of
  temperature during the short time that the current is passed
  being thus about equal to that of the water, and automatically
  preventing gain or loss of heat. The number of watts taken
  by the copper wires and flexible leads at 30 amperes is
  about 1.9.                                            -
     It may here be pointed out that it is far better, from the
  point of view of getting a good mechanical design, to use a
  large current at a low pressure than to take the same power
  from a small current at a considerable pressure. Thus it is
  easy to design a strong stirrer of the shape described above
  which will have a resistance of of an ohm, carrying 30
  amperes at 10 volts pressure; but it would be by no means
  so easy to make an equally efficient and substantial stirrer of
  33.3 ohms resistance to take 3 amperes only at 100 volts.
     It was thought worth while to ascertain to what extent
  conduction through these leads influenced the rate of cooling
  of the vessel when no current was passing, and cooling curves
  were therefore taken with the manganin framework in the
  vessel and attached to the leads. The average rate of cooling
  was found to be 0.000242 calorie per square centimetre area
  of surface per 1* C. excess temperature; which is only about
  4 per cent, greater than in the previously mentioned experi
  ments, in which a light wooden stirrer only was used, the
  value then obtained being 0.000232.

 weight of the manganin strip is 114 grammes, and the specific
 heat being about 0.09, the water-equivalent is 10; the equiva
 lent mass of water used being therefore 2047 grammes.

                      Average deviation from the mean="001=0.42 per cent.
   With this apparatus, then, we get in about 10 minutes,
including the experiment and subsequent calculation, a result
for the heat-equivalent of the watt-second ; and these results
have an average deviation from the mean, if several experi
ments are made, of less than $ of one per cent. This result,
as we have seen above should not differ from the true value
by as much as one per cert. It may here be pointed out
that as the water taken from the ordinary water-supply is
sure to be at least two or three degrees below the atmospheric
temperature at the time, it is exceedingly easy to arrange
that its mean temperature during the experiment shall
exactly equal to the temperature of the air, for no artificial
method of cooling is required, as would be the case if a
greater range of temperature were used. This, however, was
not done except in one or two of the above experiments, and
is not necessary to ensure the accuracy that was required.
   The mean temperature of the water in the above experi
ments was 15 degrees Centigrade; and our final result is that
at that temperature 0.2375 gramme of water are raised 1°C.
in temperature by the energy of one watt-second,

168 Prof. Ayrton and Mr. Haycraft on an Apparatus for
  Now we know with considerable accuracy the equivalent
in ergs of one watt-second, which certainly does not differ
from 10" by more than one tenth of one per cent.; that is to
say, the international volt and ampere do not differ from 10°
and 10- C.G.S. units of electromotive force and current by
more than that amount (see section on the recent history of
the electrical units). Hence the result we have obtained, the
error in which is less than one per cent, gives us at once a
value for the mechanical equivalent of heat with the same
accuracy.
   Since we find the equivalent of the watt-second in gramme
degrees at 15° C. to be 0.2375, we have at once, taking 10"
ergs equal to one watt-second, the mechanical equivalent of
heat in ergs per gramme-degree at 15° C. equals 4:211 x 10'.
   Reducing this to foot-lbs. at Greenwich per lb.-degree C.
at 15°C., it becomes 1408, or in foot-lbs. per lb.-degree F. at
59°F. it is 782.
   A series of four experiments made subsequently by some
students at the Central Technical College, in which the cool
ing error was eliminated by making the mean temperature of
the water equal to that of the air, gave as their mean 0.2384
calorie per watt-second, or 4:195 x 10" ergs per gramme
degree at about * C. Reducing this value to foot-lbs. at
Greenwich per lb.-degrees C. and F. respectively, we get
1403 and 779 foot-lbs.
  IV. Previous Determinations of the Mechanical Equivalent
                            of Heat.
   It is of interest to compare these figures with some of the
more recent results obtained for the mechanical equivalent.
   Rowland’s value for the mechanical equivalent in ergs per
gramme-degree at 15° C. is 4, 189 x 10", which reduced to
foot-lbs. at Greenwich per lb.-degree C. is 1401, and in foot
lbs. per lb.-degree F. at 59°F. is 778.3. Rowland used the
method of direct friction of water, and was the first to dis
cover that the specific heat of water was a minimum at 30°C.
and varied one per cent. between 5° and 30°C. (Proc. American
Acad. 1879–80).
   Dieterici (1889) gives as the result of a determination by
the electrical method in which Bunsen’s ice-calorimeter was
used, the number 4:244 x 10'. Correcting from the “legal”
 ohm employed by him to the international unit, we get the
 numbers 4,232x10", 1415, and 786 (Annalen der Physik,
vol. xxxiii. p. 417).
   Miculescu's careful determination by the direct method in

         Determining the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.                         169
1892 gives 4,186 x 10' on the mercury scale of hard glass, or
4.187 on the hydrogen scale, at about 12°C. The latter
number expressed in foot-lbs, at Greenwich per lb. degree C.
is 1400, and in foot-lbs. per lb. degree F. is 778. A platinum
non-thermal junction was used in these experiments, and was
calibrated against a Gonnelot standard mercury thermometer.
     Griffiths, using the electrical method, gives as his final
result (Proceedings           '         Society, vol. iv. p. 26), 4:198x10",
the corresponding numbers in the other units being 1404 and
780.
     The recent determination of Schuster and Gannon, also by
the electrical method, gives 4:180 x 10' on the mercury scale
of hard French glass, or 4.192 on the hydrogen scale, at a
temperature of 19°1 C. The latter value expressed in foot
lbs. at Greenwich gives 1402 and 779.
     Joule's values obtained by friction of water in 1878 gave
 the numbers 4:159 x 10", 1390.5, and 772.5 respectively
 (mercury scale); while his values obtained by the electrical
 method in 1867, when corrected for the error in the B.A. ohm,
 give 4 155 x 10", 1389, and 772, the average temperature of
 the water being 19°C. The following table gives the results
 obtained by various methods since 1867, the numbers havin
 been recalculated from those given in a table at the end of
 M. Miculescu's paper (Ann. de Chimie, vol. xxvii. p. 202):—

    The result obtained by our students is greater than the
 mean of these results by just one half per cent. It is pro
 bably not generally known that such accuracy can be obtained
 by the use of such simple apparatus as that here described,
 and the fact is we think sufficient justification for bringing
 the result under the notice of the Society.
       W. Recent History of the Practical Electrical Units.
    A short account of the recent history of the practical elec
 trical units is added for the benefit of those not familiar with
 the work of the Board of Trade Standards Committee.
    The first report of the Electrical Standards Committee,
 appointed by the Board of Trade at the end of 1890, was pre
 sented in July 1891, and contained the following recommen
dations among others :-                          -
    *4. That the resistance offered to an unvarying electric
current by a column of mercury of a constant cross sectional
area of one square millimetre and of a length of 106.3 centi
 metres, at the temperature of melting ice, may be adopted as
one ohm.”
   “10. That an unvarying current, which when passed through
a solution of nitrate of silver in water, in accordance with the
specification attached to this Report, deposits silver at the rate
of 0.001118 of a gramme per second, may be taken as a
current of one ampere.” .
   At the British Association meeting held at Edinburgh in
August 1892 the B.A. Committee on Electrical Standards, in
consultation with Dr. von Helmholtz, M. Guilleaume,
Professor Carhart, and others, agreed to the following resolu
tions among others :
   “2. That 14:4521 grammes of mercury in the form of a
column of uniform cross section 106.3 centimetres in length
at 0°C. be the specified column of mercury adopted as the
practical unit of resistance.”
   “That the number 001118 should be adopted as the number
of grammes of silver deposited per second from a neutral
solution of nitrate of silver by a current of 1 ampere, and

        Determining the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.       171
the value 1'434 as the electromotive force in volts of a Clark
cell at 15° C.”                 -
   These decisions agreed with those which had already been
laid before the German Government by Dr. Helmholtz and
the Curatorium of the Reichsanstalt. It was considered pre
ferable to define the mercury column in terms of length and
mass, as the sectional area cannot be directly measured with
such accuracy; but the length 106.3 centimetres was adopted
so that the sectional area might be, as nearly as could be
known, one square millimetre, as this area has been specified
in all previous definitions.
    In November 1892 a supplementary report was presented
to the Board of Trade by its Standards Committee, and in
 cluded the following resolutions —
    “4. That the resistance offered to an unvarying electric
 current by a column of mercury at the temperature of melting
 ice 14,4521 grammes in mass of a constant cross sectional
 area, and of a length of 106.3 centimetres, may be adopted as
 one ohm.”
    “10. That an unvarying current which, when passed through
 a solution of nitrate of silver in water, in accordance with the
 specification attached to this Report, deposits silver at the
rate of 0.001118 of a gramme per second, may be taken as a
current of one ampere.”              -
    “14. That the electrical pressure at a temperature of 15°
 Centigrade between the poles or electrodes of the voltaic cell
 known as Clark’s cell, prepared in accordance with the speci
 fication attached to this Report, may be taken as not differing
 from a pressure of 1:434 volts by more than one part in one
 thousand.”                                              -
    At the International Electrical Congress held in August
 1893 at Chicago these values were adopted by the delegates
 as those to be recommended to their several governments as
 legal units.               -
    The Board of Trade Committee, after having had laid before
 them the recommendation of the Electrical Congress, which
 was substantially that contained in their supplementary report
 of November 1892, presented their final report advising a
 legalization of the standards as defined, by an Order of Her
 Majesty in Council; and on August 23rd, 1894, this was
 effected, and the practical standards we may hope permanently
 settled.
    Of the three units—ohm, ampere, and volt—the two former
 are defined on the C.G.S. system, and the latter as a secondary
 unit from the relation of the first two. The numbers given
 in the above-quoted resolutions as to the ohm and the ampere

172      F. Womack on a Method of Determining the
are the values which appear to represent most accurately the
true volt and the true ampere. In the Report of the B.A.
Standards Committee for 1892 is given a table showing the
results of nine determinations of the ohm expressed in centi
metres of mercury, made between 1882 and 1892; the mean
of these results being 106:31, and the average deviation from
this mean being 015, or one part in 7000. We may there
fore safely say that the ohm, as now defined, does not differ
from 10° C.G.S. units of resistance by more than one part in
two or three thousand.
   As regards the ampere, we have the very careful determi
nation of Lord Rayleigh and Mrs. Sidgwick giving 0011179
gramme of silver per coulomb, that of Kohlrausch 0011183,
Gray .001118, and Potier and Pellat 0011192. It is at
least probable that the value 001118 adopted by the Board
of Trade Committee does not differ from that corresponding
to the absolute C.G.S. unit divided by ten by more than one
part in a thousand.
   Hence it is probable that the number of ergs equivalent to
one watt-second does not differ from 10" by more than one
part in a thousand; and that being the case it would seem
that, considering the great accuracy with which electrical
measurements can be made, the electrical method of deter
mining the mechanical equivalent of heat should be the most
accurate.
XVI. A Modification of the Ballistic-Galvanometer Method of
   Determining the Electromagnetic Capacity of a Condenser,
   By F. WoMACK*.
THE      method consists in placing the condenser in parallel
      with one arm S of a Wheatstone-bridge arrangement of
non-inductive resistances. A balance for steady currents
having been obtained, the condenser
is placed in circuit, and the throw 6
determined due to the depression of
the battery-key. The condenser is
then thrown out of circuit, and the
proportionality of the arms of the
bridge disturbed by changing the
value of S. The steady deflexion a
due to this want of balance is read.
From these two readings and the
known values of S, the capacity is
immediately determined.

being for any appreciable time on
open circuit, it is desirable to use
a reversing-key in the battery
branch, and to observe the throw
of the galvanometer due to re
versal of the sign of the current in
S; and immediately after observe
the deflexion due to the alteration    B
of S.                                  %/                    *
   The method is necessarily subject to the same disadvantages
as that of Fleeming Jenkin, in respect of it not giving the
instantaneous capacity of the condenser. But measurements
of the same condenser taken with different galvanometers, or
with a graded moment of inertia of the galvanometer-needle,
have led to nearly constant results, the capacity being appa
rently but little dependent on the period of charging and

discharging of the condenser. The effect would be likely to
be much more marked if the capacity were much greater.
    The conditions for a maximum throw of the galvanometer
for a given E.M.F. are, moreover, not the same as those for
the maximum sensitiveness to steady current. There is
usually no difficulty, however, in obtaining sufficient sensi
tiveness of galvanometer to detect want of proportionality of
the arms PQRS of the bridge, so that a change of S by 1
in 200 will thus give a deflexion of convenient magnitude.
It is, however, very advantageous to have a galvanometer
whose period of oscillation can be varied at pleasure, so as to
give about the same throw as steady deflexion for the chosen
value of dS. One advantage which the method has is that
there is no necessity to know the galvanometer or battery
resistance. In the ordinary ballistic-galvanometer method it
is very doubtful if the resistance of the galvanometer, unless
 it is measured at the time, is known within 1 to 2 per cent.
     Further, the two essential parts of the determination 6 and
 a may be made in quick succession, without any shifting of
 contacts or connexions and with the battery-current flowing
 continuously, leaving only the period of the galvanometer
 and its damping correction to be afterwards determined.
     The method may be of service in the simultaneous deter
 mination of the resistance of, and joint capacity and inductance
 of, a submarine cable or telephone- or telegraph-line.

               II. On the Measurement of Resistance.
        NUMBER of physical instruments, like the bolometer
         and platinum     £              depend on an accurate
  measurement of electric resistance. The question not un
  frequently therefore arises, what the limit of accuracy is with
  which, with a given galvanometer and resistance, the measure
  ment can be made.
      Whatever arrangement we adopt, the sensitiveness is always
  increased by an increase of electromotive force; and the
  limit is reached either when we have put into action all the
  electromotive force at our disposal, or when the currents
  become so strong that there is danger of overheating one or
  other of the resistances. The overheating may either damage
  the insulation or produce disturbances in the way of thermo
  electric currents, or be the cause of other irregularities. For
   a given resistance, we may generally fix on some current
                    * Communicated by the Author.

which is the greatest that can with safety be used. In
ordinary laboratory practice our battery-power is generall
sufficient, so that it is the heating of the conductors £
puts the limit to a measurement of resistance; and I propose
to discuss the question from this point of view. It may be
answered in a very simple manner. Imagine any network
of conductors, and let i be the current which passes through
the resistance to be measured (p). Consider a small change
of resistance 8p. This change will alter the currents, and,
amongst others, that passing through the galvanometer which
forms the measuring instrument. The change in the currents
is the same as if an electromotive force numerically equal to
i8p was introduced into the branch of which p forms part.
In order that this electromotive force should affect the galva
nometer, which we take to have a resistance g, there must be
some one mesh of the network of conductors which contains
both p and g. If there should be no other resistances in that
mesh, and if p does not form part of any other mesh, the current
8 y in the galvanometer produced by the change of resistance
öp will be given by
                                  '8
                            8w=+.              . . . . . (1)
                                 p+g
    If the above conditions are not satisfied, and they never can
be completely, the current through the galvanometer will be
smaller than the value given. It will be shown that we may
make such experimental arrangements as will render equa
tion (1) approximately correct; at any rate, that equation will
give us a lower limit for the change of resistance 8p which
produces an appreciable effect, if for i we substitute the
maximum current which can pass the resistance. If this is
denoted by im, and if by stands for the smallest current the
galvanometer can detect, we obtain
                             öp__3%

    This represents a somewhat important proposition:
    With a given resistance and galvanometer, the ratio of the
smallest change of resistance which can be detected to the sum of
the given and galvanometer resistance is equal to the ratio of the
smallest current which can be detected by the galvanometer to
the maximum current which can be sent through the resistances.
    If we have a choice of galvanometers and take account of
the fact that for the same type of instrument the deflexion
varies as the square root of the resistance, equation (2) shows

             Prof. A. Schuster's Electrical Notes.            177

   With a given conductor and type of galvanometer, the smallest

twice the ratio of the smallest current which can be detected by
means of a galvanometer having the same resistance as the one to
be measured to the greatest current which can be sent through the
galvanometer.                                                -
   For the smallest current which can be observed with a
galvanometer of given type we may write 89–2/(Vg).
Inserting this in equation (3) and observing that the equation
holds only when p=g, we obtain

   The highest percentage accuracy with which a given resist
ance can be measured is directly proportional to the square root
of the maximum electric work which can be done on it without
overheating.
   Sometimes the galvanometer-resistance is given but p may
be varied, as when we wish to design a bolometer or platinum
thermometer. Equation (2) shows that there will be an
advantage in taking p as large as possible provided we do
not thereby reduce the value of in. This can be done by
increasing the length of the conductor without diminishing the
cross section.
   The case which most frequently occurs is the one in which
we have a certain, but not unlimited, choice of galvanometer.
Each laboratory will probably be provided with a low and a
high resistance galvanometer; but we cannot for each in
dividual measurement construct one which has exactly the
right resistance. It is useful to realize, therefore, how much
we lose in sensitiveness by working with a galvanometer
which has not exactly the right resistance.
   Substituting again a/(Vg) for 8 y, the smallest observable
change of resistance 8p then becomes
                        öp= (p+9) #.

   It is seen that if the galvanometer-resistance is five times too
great or too small, the sensitiveness is reduced by 25 per cent.
 Except for very special purposes, such a reduction is not
 of great importance; but I think sufficient consideration is
 not paid, in ordinary laboratory practice, to the proper choice
 of galvanometer-resistance. The tendency is to use a galva
 nometer of too great resistance, probably because the makers
 take more trouble with the more expensive instruments, and
 in consequence they are more easily adjusted and less liable
 to get out of order. With the same instrument it is con
 venient to be able to vary the resistance; and this can be
 done by using the pattern of a differential galvanometer, and
 by dividing each of the two coils again into two parts. The
 resistance may be varied in that case in the ratio of 1 to 16.
 If we had the command of three galvanometers each having
 four coils respectively of '01, 4, and 1000 ohms, we could
 measure resistances varying between 0005 and 20,000 ohms,
 and always be within 25 per cent. of the greatest obtainable
 sensitiveness so far as the galvanometer is concerned. If we
 are only able to have one galvanometer, we can obtain a
useful combination by choosing one of four coils of about

              Prof. A. Schuster's Electrical Notes.           179
10 ohms resistance each. By joining them in multiple are or
series, we may change the internal resistance from 2.5 to 40
ohms, and conduct measurements of resistances lying between
half an ohm and 200 ohms with considerable accuracy.
   We have obtained a value for the smallest change of re
sistance which it is possible to measure with any arrangement,
but have not discussed how closely we may approximate to
the theoretical value by any of the known methods. The
simplest arrangement, in many ways, is that in which a
differential galvanometer is used, as in fig. 1. The two
nearly equal resistances to be compared
are p and p', while G and G' denote                   Fig. 1.
the two coils of the galvanometer. If
balance is obtained with a current in
passing through the resistances, it is
required to determine the change 8p
which will produce the smallest observ
able change of current 8 y in the galva
nometer. Equation (1) will be applicable if the internal
resistance of the battery b is small compared to p +g; for
in that case a small change of resistance 8p will not disturb
appreciably the current in G', and will produce the maximum
effect in its own branch.
   In order that this arrangement shall be workable, it is
necessary, however, that the maximum current i, which can
pass p shall also be able to pass through the galvanometer
without overheating it. Calling 'ym the greatest current which
the instrument will stand, we have as a necessary condition that
"Wm S. m.                             -
   As a second case, we take a differential galvanometer, but
place it in parallel circuit with the resistance p. The arrange
ment is diagrammatically represented in fig. 2.

    We might substitute an ordinary galvanometer for the
differential one, but balance the current by an independent
 battery, as we frequently do in the comparison of electro
 motive force. The arrangement is that
 shown in fig. 3. A small change 8p of p                Fig. 3.
 will show itself as a deflexion of the gal-       5                e

as before, with the exception that the E=                     P
 resistance g of the auxiliary battery is a
disadvantage. If b is large, we now have

    If we can make q small, we come back to the original
equation; and I have introduced this example merely to show
that however much we may vary the form of the experiment,
we always come back to the same limiting value.
    The method most usually adopted for a comparison of
 resistances is the Wheatstone-bridge, which is generally
assumed without further discussion to be the most delicate
arrangement.
    It seems advisable, therefore, to discuss a little more fully
the conditions under which the best effects can be obtained.

   This equation shows what we lose in sensitiveness by
making s too large or q too small.          If Carey Foster's method
is adopted, p=q, and the sensitiveness is necessarily reduced
in the ratio of V2: 1.
   The results here obtained are valid so long as we have
sufficient battery-power at our command. If we are limited
to a fixed and insufficient electromotive force, the conditions
are altogether different, and in that case the problem has
been fully discussed by Mr. O. Heaviside (Phil. Mag. 1873,
xlv. p. 114).
   M. Ch. Eug. Guye", in a valuable paper, has discussed
the best arrangement of a Wheatstone-bridge for bolometer
measurements, but he only considered the special case of the
equality between two and two of the four resistances. His
results are in agreement with those given above.
   In comparing the different methods of measuring resist
ance, we see that there is really no theoretical advantage of
       * Archives des Sciences physiques et naturelles, January 1892,

182           Prof. A. Schuster’s Electrical Notes.
the Wheatstone-bridge over any other balance method. We
obtain for all of them, on the contrary, the same limiting
value. When a differential galvanometer is used, the two
opposing currents pass through the coils of the instrument.
Whenever there is any danger of disturbances in the indica
tions of the needle due to heating-effects within the galvano
meter, the Wheatstone-bridge will have the advantage. I do
not know whether there are any actual measurements as to
the strongest currents we can send through a mirror-galvano
meter; but it seems likely that when the resistances to be
measured are such that weak currents only can be used, as
                                                               i
with a platinum thermometer or bolometer, the differential
arrangement will possess many advantages.
   It appears that, in order to obtain the best effects from a
Wheatstone-bridge, the resistance to be measured must adjoin
one which is small and one which is great compared to itself;
and these resistances must of course be constructed so that
they are not overheated when the maximum current passes
through the resistance which is to be measured. This we may
not be able always to accomplish easily, and in practice the
sensibility of the Wheatstone-bridge may have to be reduced
still further. I think, therefore, that for measurements of
resistance in which a high degree of accuracy is required,
the differential galvanometer deserves more attention than it
has so far received. If galvanometers can be constructed
so that convection-currents due to heat-effects in the cell
containing the suspended magnets can be avoided, it is very
probable that the differential galvanometer will often prove
to be the most suitable instrument.
   With respect to the maximum current which we may be
capable of sending through galvanometers of the same type,
it is to be noted that the magnetic field at the centre of the
coils is proportional to the square root of the electric work
done in the instrument. When the heating-effect has reached
the maximum allowable limit, the magnetic fields in different
instruments having similar coils, but wound with different
wires, will be the same.
   The proposition embodied in equation (4) may give some
useful hints in the construction of bolometers or platinum
thermometers. Thus we may ask the question whether for
certain purposes some other metal may with advantage be
substituted for platinum.
   The rise in temperature of a conductor 8t is connected with
the electric work (W) by the equation
                          Msöt=W,

where s is the heat-capacity in electric units (water =4:49).
For a certain allowable gain in temperature per unit time
and a given mass, that material is the best which has the
greatest specific heat. A metal of low atomic weight would
therefore have the preference. If the volume of the sub
stance be taken as fixed, we must make the product of
density and specific heat as great as possible. This product.
is highest for iron and steel (90), then follows copper (.80),
platinum (72), and gold (62). There would be an appre
ciable advantage in substituting a steel wire for a platinum
one, if small £ of temperature are to be detected by a
change of resistance, especially as the temperature-coefficient
of electric conductivity is considerably higher than that of the
other metals. There are, however, obvious disadvantages
connected with the use of steel which in most cases would
counterbalance its greater sensibility.

as to where or by whom they were made. At first I paid
little attention to the cubes, as I looked upon them merely
as mathematical curiosities. Not long since, on perusing
Gibson’s ‘History of Cork, I came on a passage extracted
from Smith’s      £          of Cork, published in 1750, in which
a pair of interpenetrating cubes is distinctly referred to as
the invention of Mr. Phillip Ronayne, of the Great Island
near Cove (now Queenstown). The cubes were said to be
constructed after Mr. Ronayne’s design by Mr. Daniel Voster,
who was at this time teacher of mathematics in Cork, and
editor of the well-known book on Arithmetic, compiled during
the early part of the last century by his father, Elias Wosterf.

   + Passage in Smith's ‘History of Cork’:—
   “Not far from the castle of Belvelly is Ronayne's Grove formerly
called Hodnets Wood; [now Marino] a good house and handsome im
provements of Philip Ronayne, Esquire. From the gardens one has a
Charming view of the river and shipping up to Cork, as also the town of
Passage on the opposite shore. This gentleman has distinguished himself
by several essays in the most sublime parts of mathematics; among
others by a treatise on Algebra, which has passed through several editions,
and is much read and esteemed by all the philomaths of the present
time. He has invented a cube which is perforated in such a manner

184          Prof. H. Hennessy on Ronayne's Cubes.
 . I was led by this passage in Smith's ‘History’ to more
closely examine the cubes, together with the box in which
they are contained. The box is mahogany, and it is fastened
by hasps of an old-fashioned pattern; it is itself manifestly
in an old style of work. One of the cubes is made of hard
wood, the other consists of a brass shell or frame, in which
two pieces of hard wood fill up the vacant space so as to con
stitute a complete cube. The brass work was not a casting,                    •
but the result of combining pieces of hammered or sheet-brass
suitably cut out which were welded or soldered together, and
the whole was manifestly finished by the use of file and
hammer. The only £ on the brass is the number 1,
placed on a part of the shell as a guide for inserting one of
the supplementary wooden pieces. This figure is undoubtedly
in the old style, and Mr. Yeates is distinctly of opinion that
the brass work is old-fashioned, as he satisfied himself, by
comparing it with old brass instruments, that it could be ver
 well assigned a date in the early part of the                   £
 century. It was most probably the work of an amateur, or
 done under the direction of a mathematician for a special
 object; for if it had been made by an instrument-maker for
 the purpose of sale a number of similar brass cubical shells
 could more easily have been made by casting.
    I have never seen any demonstration of the structure of the
 cubical shell, but it soon appeared manifest that it is based on
 the properties of a square. Lay off on the diagonal of one of the
 faces of the cube from its middle point two parts, each equal
 to half the side of the cube.        Draw lines at the extremities of
 these perpendicular to the diagonal, and two isosceles right
 angled triangles will be formed which constitute the bases of
 two equal triangular prisms, between which a cube equal to
 that from which the prisms were cut can slide. If the cube
  slides parallel to the faces of the original cube the prisms
 will be totally unconnected, and the whole problem turns
 upon their material connexion while allowing the sliding cube
 to pass between them.
      he annexed figures show the cubes separately, and also
 that a second cube of the same dimensions may be passed through the
 same, the possibility of which he has demonstrated, both geometrically
                                                                              :
 and algebraically, and which has been actually put in practice by the
 ingenious Mr. Daniel Voster of Cork, with whom I saw two such cubes.”
  (Smith's ‘History of Cork, 1st edition, 1750, vol. i. p. 172.) This passage
 is quoted by Gibson, who says that Daniel Voster was probably father
 to Elias, the author of the Arithmetic. But this is not correct—Daniel
  was the son of Elias, as I find from the eighth edition published in 1766
 that Daniel was editor of the book to which the name of Elias is prefixed
 as the author,

            Prof. H. Hennessy on Ronayne's Cubes.           185
 the penetration of the second cube through the brass which
 forms the frame of the first.
   The prisms must be connected at top and bottom by two
similar and equal flanges, the edges of which must lie between
the diagonal of the cube and the extreme corner of the flange.
If too far from the diagonal, connexion with the prisms would
cease; if too close to the diagonal, the second cube could not
pass between the flanges.
   The geometrical conception of a cube and the material
solid representing such a conception to the sight and touch
are different things. . It is easy to conceive how one geome
trical cube can pass through another of equal dimension by a
square opening whose diagonals are perpendicular to the
sides of the first cube. The triangular prisms left by this
opening would be equal; but they would touch by mere
lines, and could not be represented by a continuous solid
material substance. They would necessarily be distinct and
separate.                -
   If the second cube were passed through the first parallel to
the diagonal of the square on one of its faces, two triangular
prisms would be cut off each distant from the other by the
side of the cube. The sides of the base of each prism p would
                            1
        -
be manifestly p=a (1–      #)                           -
                                 and the long sides a(V2-1).
But these prisms would again be unconnected. They could
be connected by triangular flanges having knife-edges, and

186         Prof.  H. Hennessy on Ronayne's Cubes.
equally inclined planes terminating at the corners of the
cube. These knife-edges must manifestly be equal to the side
of the cube; and as the sliding cube on each flange has its
side perpendicular to the flange, the two flanges must have
their edges a little distant from the diagonal to which each is
parallel. The interval secures junctions of the flange with
the two prisms. The thickness t of flange downwards must
be also secured in order that the flange holds its place. The
inclination of the face of the flange will depend upon these
two quantities.
   The relations between a the distance of the knife-edge
from the corner of the cube, t the thickness of the flange at
the points of junction with the prisms, and 6 the angle of
inclination of the inner face of the flange to the face of the
cube can be easily found. As the sliding cube must have one
of its sides always perpendicular to the face of the flange, the
following equation must subsist —
           a=(a—t) cos 6+[p V2–(e–$a)] sin 6.
   As the least thickness of the flange parallel to the long side
of the prism may be represented by
                         t = (v- a) tan 6,
the above becomes

sin 6= V2–1 gives for t a maximum, or 6=24°28' would
give the greatest thickness for t. Between this and zero the
thickness would give a smaller inclination and also a different
value for w. In the model v has been chosen between the

 The side of the cube is very nearly 1.92 inch, and the above
 results agree with the measured values of v, p, 6, and very
 nearly with that of t.
     It thus follows that a material solid cube can be so con
 structed as to allow of a cube of the same dimensions passing
 through it by an aperture cut in the former without separa
 ting the remaining portions. As crystals are known to be
 penetrated by others of similar shape, this problem may
 possibly illustrate questions connected with the study of
 isomorphous groups of the cubical type which are frequently
  known to present the appearance of interpenetration.

              XIX. On the Liquefaction of Gases.
              By Prof. Dr. CHARLEs OLSZEwsKI*.
MY        researches concerning the liquefaction of gases, with
         which I have been occupied ever since the year 1883,
have been published in various scientific periodicals in the
Polish, French, and German languages, viz., in the publica
tions of the Academy of Sciences of Cracow (in Polish), in
the Bulletin International of the same Academy (in French
and German), in the Annals of the Academy of Sciences of
Vienna, and in Wiedemann's Annalen der Physik und
 Chemie and in his Belblåtter, as well as in the Comptes
Rendus. Though I suppose that my labours are sufficientl
known to the scientific world, yet there are motives £
lead me to ask the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine to
insert the following summary of the more important results
of my experiments.                                    -
   Firstly, because my researches appeared irregularly in
different scientific papers, as they proceeded; such as wished
to become acquainted with them being obliged to look them
up in all the papers I have mentioned. Secondly, because of
the experiments and public lectures of Prof. James Dewar,
concerning the liquefaction of large quantities of oxygen and
air. In several cases Prof. Dewar merely repeated my ex
periments: for instance, as regards the absorption spectrum
and the colour of liquefied oxygen. In these cases he con
firmed the observations I have made, and mentioned the
results of my work in the manner usually received in the
scientific world. But in his last experiments and lectures
respecting the liquefaction of considerable quantities of oxygen
'' air and their employment as cooling agents, Prof. Dewar
has thought fit not to make any mention of my labours in the
same field, which had been published several years before
 Prof. Dewar went over them again. In the number for June
 1890 of the Bulletin International de l'Académie de Cracovie,
 I have described an apparatus serving to liquefy a greater
 quantity of oxygen or air in a steel cylinder, from which it
 can be poured out into an open glass vessel, and used as a
 frigorific agent. It is entitled “K. Olszewski. Transvase
 ment de l’oxygène liquide;” and a brief report on the subject
 is contained in the Belblåtter of Wiedemann, vol. xv. p. 29,
 under the title “K. Olszewski. Ueber das Giessen des flüssigen
 Sauerstoffs.” That my labours should have thus been passed
                  * Communicated by the Author,

                   On the Liquefaction of Gases.              189
over in silence is all the more astonishing, because as soon as
the above-mentioned Bulletin was printed I sent a proof of it
to Prof. Dewar; I also forwarded him proofs of my other
researches, knowing that they interest him.
   The apparatus I constructed and described works very well
and can be used without danger, so that in October of the
same year (1890) I was enabled to obtain 100 cub. centim. of
liquid oxygen in the presence of an audience consisting of
over 100 students. In the following year, during the Congress
of Polish naturalists and physicians in Cracow (July 1891) I
obtained 200 cub. centim. of liquid oxygen in the presence of
a good many physicists, and showed its peculiar properties;
as, e.g., its bluish colour and its absorption spectrum. Subse
quently, without having altered my apparatus in any way, I
  ot about 200 cub. centim. of liquid air and used it as a
 rigorific agent in order to liquefy hydrogen. The construc
tion of my apparatus is very simple, and it can easily be
enlarged by using a steel cylinder of the capacity of 300,400,
500, or more cubic centimetres. The only reason that I have
never hitherto employed a steel cylinder of greater capacity
than 200 cub. centim., is the circumstance that the quantity
of oxygen or air which can be liquefied in this cylinder was
quite sufficient for my experiments.
   After these remarks, I shall now give a summary of the
more important results of my former labours concerning the
liquefaction and solidification of gases, and then describe
the apparatus I constructed, which serves to obtain great
quantities of liquefied oxygen and air; also stating my experi
ments made in order to liquefy hydrogen, by using large
quantities of liquid oxygen or liquid air as frigorific agents.
      Summary of the Results of my former Experiments.
   In 1883, and for several years following, I liquefied the
gases in a strong glass tube, about 30 centim. in length, 14-18
millim. in diameter within, with walls from 3 to 4 millim.
thick. Oxygen, nitrogen, atmospheric air, carbon monoxide,
nitric oxide, and methane, submitted to the influence of cold
in the tube by means of liquid ethylene, boiling in vacuo at a
temperature of -150°C., were easily liquefied under a pres
sure not beyond 50 atm. As my experiments proceeded, I
published their results in the p' I have mentioned;
and a detailed description of the apparatus I used in my
experiments is contained in Wiedemann's Annalen der Physik
und Chemie, 1887, vol. xxxi. p. 58, under the title “K. Ols
zewski. Ueber die Dichte des flüssigen Methans sowie des

 190                  Prof. C. Olszewski on the
verflüssigten Sauerstoffs und Stickstoffs.” In this apparatus
 I liquefied all the gases spoken of, in quantities varying from
 a few to a good many cubic centimetres of liquid, and
 determined their critical temperatures and pressures, as well
 as their boiling-points under atmospheric pressure. I suc
 ceeded in solidifying four of these gases, viz., nitrogen (6),
 carbon monoxide (6), nitric oxide (7), and marsh-gas (7), by
 lowering the pressure to several millimetres of mercury, an
 determined their freezing-points and the corresponding pres
 sures of solidification. I also showed that liquid oxygen and
air boiling in vacuo at a pressure of 4 millimetres of mercury
do not freeze though their temperatures are lowered to below
 –211° and -220°C. By diminishing the pressure of solid
nitrogen to 4 millimetres of mercury, I obtained a temperature
reaching – 225°C., the lowest that has ever been obtained and
 measured (6).
   With the same apparatus I also made a series of experi
ments with reference to the liquefaction of hydrogen, sub
mitting it to a pressure reaching 180 atm., and at the same
time cooling it down to -211° and even -220°C., by means
of liquid ethylene and liquid air boiling in vacuo (2). I also
showed that the critical temperature of hydrogen is below
 –220°C. In the same apparatus which served for the lique
faction of hydrogen I liquefied a mixture of two volumes
hydrogen and one volume oxygen, and thus obtained a liquid
which was in thin layers colourless and transparent (8). I
likewise determined the specific gravity of oxygen, nitrogen,
and methane at the boiling-points of these gases (15). The
same apparatus was also of use for examination of the absorp
tion spectrum of liquid oxygen and air, and showed that liquid
oxygen in layers not thicker than 7 millim. absorbs light
very strongly; also that it gives, among others, two strong
absorption bands, corresponding in position to two absorptions
of the solar rays, which are due to the oxygen in the air (13).
Using liquid oxygen as a cooling agent, I obtained pure ozone
in the shape '' a dark-blue liquid, easily and violently ex
ploding, and of which I determined the boiling-point (12).
   Besides the above-mentioned gases, I have examined another
series with regard to their behaviour at low temperatures,
especially those which had not yet been examined in this
respect, or which had been examined without success. I first
solidified the following gases and determined their melting
points: chlorine (10), hydrochloric acid (10), hydrofluoric
acid (11), phosphine (11), arsine (10), stibine (11), ethylene
(12), [silicon tetrafluoride" (10)]. Moreover, I determined

  the boiling-points of ethane (17), propane (17), and hydrogen
  selenide (19), as well as their critical temperatures and
  pressures. The following liquids were solidified for the first
  time by me:—methyl (14), ethyl (14), amyl alcohol (10),
  ethyl ether (10), carbon bisulphide (14), and phosphorous
  chloride (PCls) (14).
     In order to measure very low temperatures, I used exclu
  sively a hydrogen thermometer: the bulb was plunged in
  the liquefied gas itself; only exceptionally a few not very low
  temperatures were measured with the carbon-bisulphide
  thermometer. Wishing to ascertain how far gas-thermo
  meters may be used to measure very low temperatures, I com
  pared thermometers filled with different gases, and especially
  the hydrogen thermometer with the nitrogen, oxygen, and
  nitric-oxide thermometers, immersing them in liquid ethylene,
   gradually cooled to -151°C. It was proved by this that the
   three last-mentioned thermometers indicated temperatures not
   very different from those indicated by the hydrogen thermo
   meter, even at temperatures much lower than the critical
   temperatures of the corresponding gases.
      This experiment proved at the same time that nitric oxide
   does not change its molecular weight, corresponding to the
   formula NO, even at a temperature so low as – 147° C.
*  Profs. Victor Meyer and Daccomo, disregarding the results of
   my investigations, performed a similar experiment (Liebig’s
   Ann. d. Chem. ccxl. p. 326), but they cooled the nitric oxide
   with solid carbon dioxide and ether down to -70° C. only.
      As, according to my experiments on the liquefaction of
   hydrogen, its critical temperature lies below -220°C., it
   may be admitted that its coefficient of expansion does not,
   even at –220°C., differ much from the coefficient of gases
   at ordinary temperatures, and that hydrogen is the only body
   which can be used in a thermometer for measuring very low
   temperatures. The determinations of the temperatures by
   measuring the quantity of heat taken away from a given
   body, a silver ball for instance, is not precise ; for, as
   Zakrzewski" showed, the specific heat of silver changes in
   the interval of 0° to -100° C. by about 3 per cent.; so that
   the temperature which is thus determined must differ from the
   true one to some not inconsiderable extent.           Thermoelectric
    thermometers, or thermometers based upon the variation of
    the electric conductivity of metals at low temperatures, can
   be used only in the limits between which they have been
   compared with the hydrogen thermometer; every extra
   polation may lead to great mistakes. An excellent thermo

     Description of the apparatus given in the Bulletin International de
 l'Académie des Sciences de Cracovie, June 1890, under the title, “K.
 Olszewski, Transvasement de l'Oxygène liquide.”]
    Though I have simplified and improved my former appa
 ratus for liquefying gases to such a degree that I have been
 able to show the liquefaction of oxygen to a numerous
 auditory during the lecture, yet it leaves much to be desired
 as regards the practical application of liquefied gases as cooling
 agents.
    By means of my former apparatus I was able to obtain
 only small quantities of liquefied gases; a greater diameter
 could not be given to the glass tubes used for the purpose,
 because they would not resist the high pressure which
 is necessary for liquefaction. Besides this, the use of glass
tubes exposed to high pressures is always attended with some
 danger: it often happens that tubes tested for 60 atm. some
 times burst during the experiment at 40 atm., or even at a
lower pressure.
    I proved long ago (6) that liquid oxygen is the best cooling
agent; for it easily gives the temperature of –211°-5C. if
the pressure is lowered to 9 millim. of mercury, and it does
not freeze even at the pressure of 4 millim.
    To obtain considerably larger quantities of liquid oxygen
for the purpose of applying it as a frigorific agent, it was
necessary, instead of brittle glass, to use a substance endowed
with more resisting-power, even though not transparent, and
to find means to pour the liquid oxygen into a glass vessel.
My new apparatus excludes the inconveniences of the former
one, and renders it possible to preserve the liquid oxygen a
longer time under the ordinary atmospheric pressure.
    A flask of wrought iron, 5 litres in capacity (such as is used
to hold liquid carbon dioxide), containing oxygen under a
pressure of 80 atm., is joined by a narrow copper tube to the
upper end of a steel cylinder tested at a pressure of 200 atm.
This cylinder, having a capacity of 30–100 cub. centim,
according to the quantity of oxygen which we wish to liquefy
at a time, is immersed in liquid ethylene, of which the tem
perature may easily be lowered to -140°C. by means of an

                       Liquefaction of Gases                    193
 air-pump. The lower end of the cylinder is joined by a
  narrow copper tube to a little stopcock, through which the
 oxygen, liquefied in the cylinder, can be poured down into
 an open glass vessel kept cool by the surrounding air. Owing
 to this isolation, liquid oxygen contained in the open vessel
 evaporates but very slowly; and when after some time its
 quantity has considerably decreased, a new portion which has
 been liquefied in the meantime can be led down into the
 vessel by turning the cock. This may be continued until
 the store of ethylene serving to cool the cylinder and the
 amount of oxygen in the iron flask are exhausted. 240 g.
 of liquid ethylene suffice to keep the oxygen liquid at the
 atmospheric pressure for half an hour.
    By connecting the glass vessel which contains the liquid
 oxygen with a good air-pump, its temperature can easily be
 lowered to —211° C. Thus was solved the problem of lique
 fying considerable quantities of oxygen without the slightest
 danger. This decides me to resume my former experiments
 concerning the liquefaction of hydrogen; and I hope thereby
 to obtain more successful results.
    To this description, which I have given in a literal trans
 lation from the above-mentioned Bulletin International, I
 subjoin a diagram (fig. 1) representing a section of my appa
 ratus, which I shall shortly explain. But I must remark that
in the same year (1890), when proceeding to my experiments
 on the liquefaction of hydrogen, I doubled the dimensions of
 the apparatus without changing anything in its construction:
 The dimensions that I shall afterwards give refer to the enlarged
 apparatus.
    The steel cylinder a, of a capacity of 200 cub. centim., has
its upper end connected by means of a thin copper tube
with a metallic manometer b, and an iron bottle c 10 litres
in capacity, containing dry oxygen or air under a pressure of
100 atm., the lower aperture of the cylinder a being con
nected by a very thin copper tube with the little cock d,
which serves to let out the liquefied oxygen or air. The
cylinder a is placed in a glass vessel m with double or treble
walls, which serves to receive the liquid ethylene, of which
the iron flaskfis the reservoir. This flask (3 litres in capacity)
is shaped like a siphon, and contains about 1 kilog. of liquid
ethylene. The ethylene, liquefied and cooled in the flask f by
means of ice and salt, passes, after the cock is turned, into
the condenserg filled with a mixture of ether and solid carbon
dioxide. To lower the temperature of this mixture -78°C.)

to -100°C., the tube n is connected with a smaller double
action pump which at every movement of the piston draws
out about 1 litre of gas. When the pressure in the condenser
g is lowered to 50 millim. Hg, the vessel m is connected, by
turning the cock i, with a large vacuum-pump provided with
sliding-valves, and at the same time, by slowly turning the
cock h, the ethylene, already considerably cooled, is let down
into the vessel m. The liquid ethylene, on entering the
vessel m, at first evaporates quickly, and the vapour is forced
back into a gasometer by means of the large pump alluded to,
and may again be employed as a frigorific agent for a sub
sequent experiment. Owing to the very great difference
between the temperatures of the steel cylinder and the liquid
ethylene, the latter does not at first touch the cylinder directly,
but is separated from it by a thin layer of vapour, being in

 the spheroidal state : it is only when the cylinder has cooled
 considerably that the ethylene comes into direct contact with
 it; a violent boiling of the liquid shows that this has taken
place. Henceforward a more abundant stream of ethylene
may be poured in until it fills the vessel m above the cylinder a,
afterwards the cock h is closed, and the smaller pump which
is connected with the vessel m by means of the tube i must be
kept working without interruption, by which the temperature
of the ethylene is continually lowered; and when it has fallen
below the critical temperature of the gas contained in the
flask c (oxygen or air), the cock of this flaskis slowly opened.
The gas enters the cooled cylinder a under the pressure in
dicated by the manometer b, and becomes liquid speedily
enough, in consequence of which the index of the manometer
shows a constant fall; when it becomes stationary, the cylinder
a is wholly filled with the liquefied gas. When this has been
done, the bottle c is closed, and by slowly opening the cock d
the liquefied gas is poured into the glass vessel placed under
neath, which is secured from external heat by its triple walls.
Whilst the liquid oxygen is being poured from the cylinder a,
the pressure descends to 20 atm., and remains at this point
as long as any liquid oxygen remains in the cylinder: it is
only when there is no more that the pressure becomes less
than 20 atm. As the liquefied gas comes under the ordinary
atmospheric pressure, a considerable part of it resumes the
gaseous state, and only half or a third of the liquid remains
in the glass vessel after having cooled down to its boiling
temperature. In order to prevent the collected liquid being
blown out by the powerful jet, the thin copper tube through
which the stream flows is closed beneath, and provided with
four lateral openings.
   I mentioned above that the temperature of ethylene in the
vessel m must be lowered by pumping to less than the critical
temperature of the gas we wish to liquefy; but it is not
necessary to measure the temperature of the ethylene. It is
sufficient to measure its pressure. According to my compu
tations (3), the following relation exists between the pressure
and the temperature of the liquefied ethylene:—

   The critical temperatures, also according to my reckonings,
are : for oxygen -118°8 C.; for air –140°C.; for nitrogen,
-146°C. The pressure of ethylene must accordingly be
lowered to 100–40 millim. in order to liquefy oxygen; to
liquefy air, to 20 millim., and to liquefy nitrogen, to 10 millim.
    The pressure to which ethylene is subjected in the vessel m
is indicated by the metallic vacuometer k, for which in more
exact experiments a mercury manometer may be substituted.
The pressures I have stated above for ethylene are maximum
pressures at which it is still possible to bring about the
liquefaction of large quantities of the corresponding gases;
but it is generally necessary to take care that the pressure of
the liquid ethylene be lowered to the minimum obtainable by
the pump serving for the experiment. The more we lower
the temperature of the ethylene, the sooner the cylinder a is
filled with the liquefied gas, and the more liquid we obtain
by pouring out the liquefied gas under the ordinary pressure.
To lower the temperature of a considerable quantity of ethylene
to –146° or -150° C., which temperature is absolutely
necessary for the liquefaction of large quantities of air and
 nitrogen, a large air-pump with rapid and powerful action is
 required. When in 1890 I used a smaller pump, which drew
 out two litres of gas at each complete double stroke, I could
 only liquefy oxygen in the described apparatus; but when in
 the following year I brought from Burckhard’s factory, Basle,
 an excellent sliding valve-pump, six times larger than the
preceding one, and working with great speed and perfection,
 I was enabled in the same apparatus easily to obtain at once
 200 cub. centim. of liquid air. It is true that I never tried to
 liquefy nitrogen in large quantities, but I believed it unneces
 sary, taking into account my former experiments with nitrogen
  (6). I had already examined the properties of liquid and solid
 nitrogen, and showed that the use of liquid nitrogen as a
 frigorific £     is of no greater advantage than that of oxygen
 or air. However, considering that by using both of my
 pumps the pressure of ethylene in the vessel m is easily
 lowered to 10 millim. and the temperature to -150°C., I can
  decidedly affirm, that all so-called permanent gases, except
 hydrogen, may be liquefied in my apparatus. When we want
  to obtain such a considerable rarefaction of ethylene, the
  compressing tube of the larger pump must be connected with
  the exhausting tube of the smaller one, whereby the effect of
  the larger pump is exceedingly increased.
     It need hardly be said that the processes connected with
 the liquefaction of large quantities of gases, as the liquefaction
 of ethylene in the cylinder f, the charging of the cylinder c

                        Liquefaction of Gases.                       197
with oxygen or air, and the working of both the larger and
smaller pump, must be accomplished not by hand, but by
means of a gas-motor of 1–3 H.P.
   The indispensable condition for such experiments to be
successful, is the purity of the gases to be liquefied; the
liquid carbon dioxide, used as a frigorific agent, must be free
from moisture; the ethylene, oxygen, and air must be com
pletely dry and free from carbonic acid. A small amount of
carbon dioxide in oxygen or air renders these gases turbid
and opaque when liquefied : a slight quantity of moisture
may freeze and stop up the narrow tubes which join together
the component parts of the apparatus, and thus frustrate the
experiment, prepared with so much trouble. In order
absolutely to purify oxygen and air from water and carbon
dioxide, there must be put into the bottle a, before it is
charged, 1 kilog. of potassium hydroxide in thin sticks, that
will in a few days completely absorb the moisture and carbonic
acid which may be produced whilst the gas is being forced
into the flask, in consequence of the action of the condensed
*'' on the leather piston of the pump.
       e quantities of liquid oxygen and air I got by means of
 the apparatus described were quite sufficient for carrying
 out my experiments on the liquefaction of hydrogen and the
 examination of the optical properties of liquid oxygen, which
 I shall shortly describe. (' that account I did not think it
 necessary to increase the dimensions of the apparatus (which,
 however, it would have been easy to do), the more so because,
 after having liquefied the first 200 cub. centim. of oxygen or
 air, the operation may be repeated every 15 minutes, on an
 equal quantity of gas, as long as the store of liquid ethylene
 suffices, and the pressure in the bottle c does not fall below
 60 atm. : in this case other cylinders, containing the whole
 charge of the corresponding gas, should take the places of

     ln my earlier investigations * I found four absorption
  bands in the spectrum of liquid oxygen, corresponding to the

wave-lengths 628, 577, 535, and 480. Messrs. Liveing and
Dewar”, who at a later date examined the absorption spectrum
of gaseous oxygen in a long steel tube under a strong
pressure, found the same four absorption-bands in the visible
part of the spectrum, and, besides them, in the utmost red two
others, corresponding to the lines A and B of the solar
spectrum, which were also observed by Egoroff and Janssen.
   The apparatus I have described enabled me to repeat my
former experiments and to examine more exactly the absorption
spectrum of a thicker layer of liquid oxygen in the utmost
red.
   The liquid oxygen was poured out of the liquefying appa
ratus into a thin-walled glass tube, the lower end of which
was soldered and closely fixed into three glass vessels one
outside of the other, to preserve it from external heat. The
column of oxygen was 30 millim. thick and about 50 millim.
deep. In this glass tube the oxygen remained at its boiling
temperature (–181°4 C.) under atmospheric pressure, in
sufficient quantity for the experiment, during more than half
an hour, though it was strongly heated by a Drummond’s
lime-light, concentrated on it by means of a collecting-lens :
this light was used to produce the absorption spectrum. In
examination of the spectrum I used a universal spectroscope
of Krüss, with a prism of Rutherford. Besides the four
known absorption-bands, the experiment also proved the
existence of a fifth band, corresponding to the solar line A :
it is somewhat blurred, but can be seen distinctly enough if
a red glass is put between the source of light and the slit in
the spectroscope. This band appeared feebler than the
absorption-bands which correspond to the wave-lengths 628,
577, and 480, but stronger than the absorption-band at 553.
With this relatively slight dispersion, the band A could of
course not be decomposed into lines. And this time too I
was unable to perceive any absorption corresponding to the
solar B.
   The experiments in 1883 made out liquid oxygen to be
a colourless fluid, for but small quantities of it were then
obtained.    Since then I have several times observed that
oxygen, when liquefied in wider tubes about 15 mm. thick,
appears of a bluish colour. During my experiments already
alluded to, in which for the first time a relatively considerable
quantity of liquid oxygen was collected in a glass vessel, its
bluish colour appeared quite distinctly. The oxygen was
prepared from potassium chlorate and manganese dioxide; to
ascertain that it contains no traces of ozone from which the

bluish colour might be derived, it was carefully tested for that
substance. Paper moistened with potassium iodide and starch,
exposed for several hours to the action of the oxygen used,
was not coloured at all; and when the oxygen was made to
pass through a solution of potassium iodide and starch the
result was the same.         It remained for several weeks in an
iron flask, in contact with solid potassium hydroxide, and
was by this means completely purified from carbonic acid,
vapour of water, and chlorine. After these experiments,
there is no doubt that liquid oxygen, seen in layers of about
30 millim., possesses a distinctly bluish colour. This colouris,
moreover, quite in agreement with the absorption spectrum
of oxygen. It was rather strange that a colourless liquid—as
it was hitherto thought to be—should give such a pronounced
absorption spectrum, in which the absorptions in orange,
yellow, and red are preponderant ; but after the bluish
colour of liquefied oxygen was proved, this apparent contra
diction no longer exists.
   I may conclude with a word or two about the colour of
the sky. There exist so many hypotheses on that point, that
I scarcely venture to add one more. But the simplest theory,
in my opinion, would be to ascribe that colour to the principal
component part of our atmosphere, which—at least in a
liquid state—is blue.
              On the Critical Pressure of Hydrogen.
  [These researches were published in Polish, in the Reports of the
Cracow Academy 1891, vol. xxiii. p. 385; a short German abstract
therefrom was printed in the Bullet. Intern of the same Academy. The
following description is taken from the first-named source, and is
explained by figs. 2 and 3.]
   In my former researches, undertaken in 1884 and 1885, I
 showed that hydrogen cannot be liquefied even by employing
 the lowest obtainable temperatures and a high pressure,
 reaching to 190 atm. ; and that it is only during the sudden
 expansion from a high pressure that a greater or less trace
 of liquefaction can for an instant be seen. This depends on
 the temperature of the frigorific medium, as well as on the
initial pressure of expansion. As cooling agents there were
employed –oxygen boiling under atmospheric pressure (t=
 -181°4) and in vacuo, reaching to 9 millim. (t= -211°5);
also air boiling under atmospheric pressure (t= –191°4) and
in vacuo at 10 millim. (t= -220°), as well as nitrogen boiling
under atmospheric pressure (t= — 194°4) and in vacuo at
 60 millim. (t= —213°).

 200                  Prof. C. Olszewski on the
   I also showed that nitrogen, boiling in vacuo at 4 millim.'
 gives the lowest possible temperature, reaching- 225°, but that
it can be used as a cooling agent only as far as -213° for
at lower temperatures, under pressures below 60 millim. Hg,
it solidifies to a snowy opaque mass, which is a bad conductor of
heat. It follows that liquid oxygen and air are the best means
to obtain the lowest temperatures, for neither of them solidifies
at all, even at the lowest pressures, and neither possesses trans
parency. I had already used these cooling agents in my
former attempts to liquefy hydrogen; I then exhausted all
possible means of obtaining the lowest temperatures, without
obtaining the desired results; for the temperature of –220°,
i.e., the lowest which can be produced by means of liquefied
air, proved to be above the critical temperature of hydrogen.
   On repeating my former experiments I had no hope of ob
taining a lower temperature by means of any cooling agent,
but I hoped that the expansion of hydrogen would be more
efficacious, on account of the larger scale on which the experi
ment was made.
   The quantity of the frigorific medium, viz., of liquid air or
oxygen, did not exceed 2–3 cub. centim. under atmospheric
pressure, and became considerably less by the use of the
vacuum ; accordingly, the glass tube which contained hydro
gen was only 2 millim. in internal diameter. The phenomenon
of liquefaction, or rather of sudden ebullition of hydrogen
which appeared in the tube during the expansion, lasted only
a fraction of a second, and required a relatively sudden but
not complete expansion. The hydrogen, cooled by its expan
sion below its critical temperature, was at once heated in so
narrow a tube to the temperature of the surrounding frigorific
medium.
   In the subjoined diagram (fig. 2) a represents the lower
end of the steel cylinder, serving to liquefy oxygen or air;
this cylinder is enclosed in a glass vessel (double, if oxygen
be employed; triple, if liquefied air) which serves to receive
liquid ethylene. The cylinder a is a component part of the
apparatus represented in fig. 1, and is therefore marked with
the same letter; but it was increased for these experiments to
200 cub. centim. in capacity. The glass tube fis destined for
the liquefaction of hydrogen; the external diameter of this
lower and wider part is 11 millim., the internal diameter is
7 millim. Within it I place a short glass tube, with very
thin walls 6 millim. in diameter; it serves to isolate from the
warmer walls of the larger tube the hydrogen which is con
siderably cooled by its expansion. The tube f is placed in a
larger glass tube e, with thin walls, measuring 30 millim. in

  top of the tube f is connected with the manometer b and the
  iron bottle c, containing absolutely pure and dry hydrogen,
  under a pressure of 150 atm. ; the cock l serves to let the
  hydrogen out of the tube f, thus producing the expansion;

  be required to measure the temperature of the hydrogen at

202                 Prof. C. Olszewski on the
the moment of expansion.       I performed the experiment as
follows:—
   By opening the cock d I let the liquid oxygen, contained in
the steel cylinder a, into the vessel e; a part of the oxygen,
which thus returned into the gaseous state, escaped with
violence through the tube i; another was cooled down to its
boiling-point (–181°4 C.) and collected as a bluish liquid in
the tube e, to a height of 6–7 centim, so that the wider part
of the tube f was plunged in liquid oxygen. I afterwards
closed the cock d and joined the tube i to the pump, by slowly
opening a cock, which is not represented in the figure; the
mercury manometer h indicated the pressure of the liquid
oxygen in the vessel e. Liquid oxygen behaves very quietly
in the vessel e under atmospheric pressure, boiling quickly
but uniformly on being pumped : if we do not reach very low
pressures, the oxygen, after cooling according to the lowered
pressure, boils again quietly. But if the pressure falls below
10 millim. (or less), the oxygen boils irregularly, the liquid is
thrown up, and shortly disappears. To avoid this I intro
duced into the vessel e a capillary glass tube o, the lower end
of which reaches to the very bottom of the vessel e, the upper
end is connected with the iron cylinder k, containing dry.
hydrogen under a pressure of several atmospheres. During
the pumping of the ' the cock of the cylinder k is little
by little opened, and a slow stream of hydrogen is let through
the liquid oxygen; by this means the liquid oxygen is con
stantly and easily removed, and it boils quietly, even if the
pressure falls to 4 millim.
   When the manometer h indicated a pressure of 10–4 millim.
I introduced hydrogen into the tube f, by slowly opening the
cylinder c, until the pressure became 140 atm., as indicated
by the manometer b. When the hydrogen in the tube f has
come down to the temperature of the cooling agent, I little by
little produced expansion, by opening the screw-cock l. The
phenomenon of hydrogen ebullition, which was then observed,
was much more marked and much longer than during m
former investigations in the same direction (3, 4). But even
then I could not perceive any meniscus of liquid hydrogen.
   I have remarked in these experiments, that with a slow
expansion the phenomenon of sudden ebullition always appears
under the same pressure, no matter how great the initial
pressure may be, provided that value be not too low. So that
by expansions made, beginning with the pressures of 80, 90,
100, 110, 120, 130, 140 atm., the phenomenon described con
stantly appeared at 20 atm.; but if the initial pressure was 70,
60, and 50 atm., the ebullition appeared at a lower and lower

                       Liquefaction of Gases.                   203
pressure, viz., approximately at 18, 16, and 14 atm. I
repeated the same experiment a good many times, and always
obtained the same results. These experiments bring me to
the conclusion, that the 20 atm. at which the ebullition of
hydrogen always appears represents its critical pressure. If
hydrogen, cooled by means of liquid oxygen, boiling in vacuo,
to the temperature -211°C., which, we may suppose, is
several degrees above the critical temperature of hydrogen, is
submitted to a slow expansion from a high pressure, its
 temperature is lowered to the critical temperature, hitherto
 unknown. If the initial pressure is high enough—in my
 experiments it was above 80 atm.—then, by means of a slow
 expansion, the temperature of hydrogen sinks to its critical
 value, before its critical pressure is reached, and then liquid
 hydrogen will appear the moment we lower the pressure to its
 critical value. But if the initial pressure is too low, a slow
 expansion cools the hydrogen to the critical temperature only
 after the critical pressure has been passed: the lower the
 initial pressure is the greater is the expansion needed to cool the
 hydrogen below its condensing temperature. We may thus
 explain the changing pressures, corresponding to the phe
 nomenon of ebullition or instantaneous liquefaction in the case
 of expansion from an insufficient initial temperature. And if
 the initial pressure is still lower, the instantaneous liquefaction
 will not appear at all.
    To ascertain the truth of this statement I performed two
 series of analogous experiments with gases, the critical
 pressures and temperatures of which are accurately known,
 viz., with oxygen and ethylene. The critical temperature of
 oxygen is, according to my former researches, -118°8 C.,
 its critical pressure is 50.8 atm. In the same apparatus
 which I used for the experiments with hydrogen I cooled
 oxygen by means of ethylene boiling under atmospheric
 pressure (–102°5), then to a temperature 16.3 degrees below
  the critical temperature of oxygen, and subjected it to a
  slow expansion, beginning with different initial pressures,
  from 40 atm. up to 100 atm. The ebullition of oxygen
 always appeared at a pressure of about 51 atm., provided the
 initial pressure was not lower than 80 atm. : at the same
 time there also appeared a meniscus of liquid oxygen. As
 the initial pressure became lower and lower, so did the ebulli
 tion pressure too.
    The critical temperature of ethylene according to Prof.
  Dewar is 10°1, the critical pressure 51 atm. ; my own deter
  minations of the same quantities yielded results agreeing well
  with the above-cited, viz., 10° C. and 51.7 atm.

204                  Prof. C. Olszewski on the
   I made similar experiments with ethylene, using the appa
ratus of Cailletet; one series at a temperature of 17°C.,
another at 27°; then at temperatures, which were first 7°, then
17° higher than the critical temperature of ethylene. During
the first series of experiments, the ebullition of ethylene, and
at the same time the meniscus, appeared constantly in conse
quence of a slow expansion at a pressure of about 51 atm., if
the initial pressure was 70, 80, 90, 100, and 110 atm. During
the second series of experiments the ebullition appeared at the
same pressure, if the initial pressure was 100, 110, 120, and
130 atm. In proportion as the initial pressure was lowered—
in the first series below 70 atm., in the second below 100
atm.—the ebullition pressure was lowered too. I must,
however, mention that in the apparatus of Cailletet, in which
I made the experiments with ethylene, the conditions of ebulli
tion of any gas by expansion are much less advantageous than
in the apparatus described above.
    Hence it follows that the determination of critical pressures
by means of expansion is possible, even if the gases have a
temperature which is several or many degrees higher than
their critical temperature. This dynamical method of deter
mination of critical pressure is really of no advantage if applied
to the other gases, for these pressures may be more easily and
precisely determined by the vanishing of the meniscus; but
with hydrogen it is the sole possible way to determine not
only its critical pressure, but also its critical temperature.
    On repeating these experiments in November 1891 I used
 liquid air, boiling under a pressure of 4–10 millim., as a cooling
agent, and obtained the same results, with the only difference
that the ebullition of hydrogen on expansion appeared still
more distinctly and persisted somewhat longer.
    The reason for which it has not been hitherto possible to
 liquefy hydrogen in a static state, is that there exists no gas
 having a density between those of hydrogen and of nitrogen,
 and which might be for instance 7–10 (H=1). Such a gas

   As my experiments on the liquefaction of hydrogen do
not at all confirm those of M. Pictet, made at Geneva in
1879, I requested Dr. Krzyzanowski to examine whether
the glaring discrepancies between my experiments and M.
Pictet's might not be explained by impurities contained in
the hydrogen he used. And indeed Dr. Krzyzanowski (24)
proved that, if potassium formate be heated with potassium
hydroxide, hydrogen cannot be obtained free from moisture,
even in the most advantageous case, which occurs when the
latter is in excess; and that if these substances are employed
in the proportion given by M. Pictet, that is with potassium
formate in excess of what is required by the calculation of
molecular weights, we get by heating them a sample of
hydrogen containing not only water but also considerable
quantities of carbon monoxide and dioxide. Now these sub
stances, interfering with the purity of the hydrogen experi
mented on by M. Pictet, were doubtless the ground of the
extraordinary results M. Pictet described, and which, though
  laringly improbable, are cited in nearly all chemical manuals.
£          this remark of mine will contribute to a proper
appreciation of M. Pictet's experiments respecting the lique
faction and solidification of hydrogen; perhaps it will suggest
to the author (who has now established a laboratory in Berlin
with the special purpose of obtaining very low temperatures)
that he might, with advantage for science, control and rectify
the results of the work he performed in 1879.

Prof. Witkowski, and were   #          in the Reports of the Cracow
Academy and in the Bulletin International, October 1891 and June 1894.]
   As far back as 1887 I discovered a very remarkable and
powerful selective absorption of light in the liquefied oxygen.

It was desirable to obtain some numerical data as regards the
absorbing power for the several bands. For this purpose we
made use of the spectrophotometer of Glan. The liquid
oxygen was contained in the innermost tube, provided with
a flat bottom, of the apparatus shown in the annexed figure
(fig. 4, taken from the Bulletin International, October 1891).

The thickness of the liquid could be varied to a known degree
by screwing up and down the tube ef, closed at both ends by
plane glass plates, and provided with a millimetre division.

208                 Prof. C. Olszewski on the
 So far as the accuracy of photometric measurements under
such difficult conditions could be relied upon, we found a
proportion of light varying between 84 and 89 per cent,
transmitted by a layer of oxygen 1 millim. in thickness in
the most intense part of the yellow-greenish band (A=577 to
A=570). The corresponding average number for the red
band (A=630 to A=638) was 88 per cent.
    In the same pamphlet we described a method of deter
mining the coefficient of refraction of liquid oxygen and gave
 results for sodium light. The most suitable method for the
purpose proved to be that of total reflexion. The liquid is con
 tained in a thin iron parallelepipedon A (see fig. 5), pro
vided with plane glass windows, and protected by several
varnished pasteboard boxes of similar form containing some
phosphoric anhydride. A double glass plate, composed of
two carefully selected plane bits of glass, separated at the
corners by small pieces of mica (thickness about 0.006 millim.)
and cemented at their obliquely-ground borders by means of
fish-glue, is immersed in the oxygen. The double plate is
rigidly conected with the axis of a divided circle. A similar
arrangement has been employed by Ketteler in some of his
investigations on the refraction and dispersion of water
 (Wiedemann's Annalen, vol. xxxiii.).       It is therefore un
necessary to enter into particulars as regards the mode of
observation and calculation of results.       A first series of
observations gave the value 1'2235 of the coefficient for
sodium light, in very close agreement with a result found
by Messrs. Liveing and Dewar by means of the prism method.
Later determinations of the same constant by myself and
Prof. Witkowski, made with the view of ascertaining the
dispersion of liquid oxygen (Bulletin International, July
1894), yielded a rather smaller result (1.2226) as a mean of
five distinct measurements.      At the same time we found
n=1,2213 for A=670.5, and 1:2236 for the wave-length
535 up. Anomalous dispersion, specially sought for, could
not be detected.
   Besides these researches I have made (partly by myself,
partly in collaboration with Prof. Witkowski) certain hitherto
unpublished experiments concerning the intensity of chemical
energy at low temperatures; I mention them here to com
plete the list of my investigations. They refer chiefly to two
substances, viz. liquid ethylene and oxygen, under the in
fluence of agents which combine with these substances at the
usual or at a higher temperature, Ethylene, boiling under
atmospheric pressure (–102°5 C.) was submitted to the

                      Liquefaction of Gases.                   209
action of chlorine and bromine. The action was feeble, but
in both cases I obtained products of combination (C2H,Cl2
 and C2H4Br2) in considerable quantity.
   The possibility of preparing relatively large quantities of
liquid oxygen in open vessels at atmospheric pressure gave us
an opportunity to examine the chemical properties of this
interesting substance more closely. We ascertained first the
exceedingly feeble chemical affinity of liquid oxygen. A
piece of metallic sodium in contact with it showed no change
in its metallic brilliancy; a hardening of the substance, in
consequence of its very low temperature, being apparently
the only effect produced. This might have been anticipated,
considering that every trace of moisture had been frozen
away. Potassium acted similarly to sodium.
   But when the reaction of oxidation with light and heat
phenomena had already begun, the low temperature (–181°4)
is not able to cool the burning substance to such a degree as
to interrupt the reaction. For instance, a piece of ignited
wood immersed in liquid oxygen takes fire just as in gaseous
oxygen; a steel spring burns and spreads sparks of burning
iron, which in this experiment burst the glass vessel of oxygen,
and the liquid oxygen was consequently spilt on the table,
giving thus the interesting sight of liquid drops rolling and
jumping about in a perfectly spheroidal state.                     -
   In this connexion, as I had (in 1891)large quantities of liquid
oxygen, my friend Prof. Kreutz performed a series of expe
riments on the behaviour of coloured substances at very low
temperatures, and showed that many of them (HgS,            #.
I, &c.) become much brighter at -181°4.
   From this summary of researches, as well as of dates, it
follows that the first apparatus serving to produce large
quantities of the liquefied so-called permanent gases, with the
solitary exception of hydrogen, was constructed by me. This
apparatus can be enlarged at will by increasing its parts, but
without changing anything in its construction, so that it
might be used to obtain liquefied gases in factories should
they at any time prove of practical utility. By uneans of
this apparatus I obtained as large quantities of liquid gases
as I wanted; and they were used for the first time on a large
scale as cooling agents (for instance, in my attempts to liquefy
hydrogen), or as an object of scientific researches (the
absorption spectrum of liquefied oxygen, its coefficient of
refraction, &c.)
   The experiments of Prof. Dewar are merely the repetition,

and confirmation of these researches, most of which were pub
lished several years before his corresponding investigations.
 His work is really original only as to the magnetic properties
of liquid oxygen : that which is not borrowed from my
 researches is a development of ideas struck out by another
 as, for instance, the experiments on electrical resistance at
low temperatures, which were begun by Clausius, continued
by Cailletet and Bouty, and brought ten years ago by my
 former fellow-worker, the late Prof. Wróblewski”, to the
temperature of the freezing-point of nitrogen, then several
 degrees below the temperature attained in the experiments of
 Messrs. Dewar and Fleming, who, it is true, extended their
 examination to various metals, alloys, and non-metals. But
 the execution of these labours meets with no difficulty; for
 the method of getting large quantities of liquefied gases is
 now generally known.
    In the table opposite (p. 210) I have set down the most im
 portant numbers, obtained as stated in my former experiments,
concerning the liquefaction and solidification of gases.
    List of my Researches, of which I have specified the most
          important Results in the foregoing Summary.
   All my researches were at first published in the Polish
language, in the publications of the Cracow Academy of
Sciences; I afterwards published an excerpt of each of them
in French and German. The present list contains only
French and German papers, as being accessible to students of
every nationality. The numbers enclosed in brackets in the
preceding summary have reference to the ordinal numbers of
the following list.

                   XX. Mirrors of Magnetism.
 By SILVANUs P. THOMPSON, F.R.S., and MILEs WALKER".
OU' knowledge of Electric Images is based almost entirely
       upon mathematical deduction. It would be difficult to
satisfactorily demonstrate their properties by experiment.
We are content to take the elegant geometrical proofs that
Lord Kelvin has given us, and corroborate these physically at
points where the conclusions are within reach of experiment.
The subject, therefore, is one of purely theoretical interest,
but so beautifully does it elucidate difficult problems in Elec
trostatics that it remains the continual delight of text-book
writers.
   Magnetic Images, on the other hand (apart from one or
two investigations by the same great master), are entirely
neglected, and yet these are much more likely to be practi
cally utilized in the near future than their electrical analogues.
It may be in questions of dynamo and instrument shielding,
or it may even be in the solution of that commercial problem,
the testing of the magnetic properties of iron en masse.
   The existence of magnetic images is suggested by con
siderations altogether apart from the mathematical.
   If we take a solenoid of wire through which a current is
flowing and place its end against a large plate of iron, we
eliminate the effect of that end upon the distribution of the
field about the coil, and so obtain a field on one side of the
plate of a shape the same as if the coil were continued to double
its length. If we place the coil with its end against a mirror
(fig. 1), we see it reflected in the mirror so that it appears to
be double its real length. Thus the iron plate gives us mag
netically an image of the coil analogous to the optical image
produced by the mirror, geometrically identical indeed with
the optical image, virtual and erect.
   If a large iron plate is placed at each end of the coil the
field will be the same as if the coil were infinitely long. We
know that two mirrors, facing each other, one at each end of
the coil, would give it the appearance of stretching away to
infinity in both directions (fig. 2).                             s
   Of course these optical effects could only be perfectly
obtained if the mirror were a perfect reflector; and to
include all possible points of view it would have to be infi
nitely large. So the magnetic effects could only be perfectly
obtained if the plates were perfectly permeable and infinitely
large. Observe that we are only considering the effect at a
point in front of the mirror and in front of the iron plate.

Behind, that is to say on the side opposite the coil, there is
no effect in either case.

    It was thought interesting to ascertain how far effects of
 this kind could be obtained in practice, using an ordinary
 iron plate somewhat less than that required for the perfect
 case. For this purpose two similar solenoids were wound,

5 centim. long and 4 centim. mean diameter, the winding at
the ends being exposed so that it could be put up close to the
iron. A search-coil of 100 turns, about 14 centim. in dia
meter, was mounted so that it could be fixed at different
positions relatively to one of the solenoids, which was then
placed '" the iron plate* and upon the other solenoid
alternately. A current of constant value was turned on and
off in each position of the solenoid, and the throw on a ballistic
£ in the circuit of the search-coil observed.                        The
  ollowing table, giving the throw of the needle for different
positions of the        £,             shows how perfectly the iron
plate mirrored the magnetism of the solenoid. The dis
crepancy in the figures arises more from errors of observation
than anything else.

  The first position in the above table is the most important,
as the coil is placed in a part of the field that experiences the
greatest change by the presence or absence of the iron plate,
the difference being that between 236 and 129. If the search
coil could have been placed so that its centre was at the very
end of the solenoid, the throw ought to be just one half of
what it would be with the coil continued to double its length.
This was found to be so when the solenoid was placed on the
other solenoid, but could not be tried with the iron as part of
the search-coil protruded.
   The experiment was then made of lifting the solenoid step
by step a little distance from the iron plate, when it was
found that the presence of the iron plate had the effect of
producing an image of the coil receding an equal amount
behind the plate.

   A larger search-coil was placed in different positions out
side the solenoid; and in all positions on which any readable
throw of the needle could be obtained, it was found that the
iron plate gave an effect almost exactly the same as an equal
solenoid in the position of its image.
   In order to try the effect of tilting the solenoid, it was
mounted on a strip of wood hinged to another, the angle
                                 Fig. 4.

placed alternately on the iron plate and against a similar

angle of inclination being the same for both solenoids (fig. 5).

The angle was altered step by step from 0 to 90 degrees, and
in all cases the iron plate produced the same effect as its
image within limits not greater than those shown in the
previous table. It was, however, only when the solenoid
was placed at the end of the hinged strip nearest the iron
plate that readings of any value could be obtained, as small
dislocations in the position of the coil laterally were apt to
produce changes of reading comparable with those due to
 considerable changes in angle. At distances greater than
 5 centim, the iron had very little effect. The search-coil
 during these experiments was moved about to different
 positions both inside and outside the solenoid, preference
 being given to the most sensitive positions.
    Then the effect of differently-shaped solenoids was tried.
 A long narrow one and a wide flat one were used with similar
 effects, so far as they could be measured.
    There is a difference between the magnetic reflexion of an
 iron plate and the optical reflexion of a mirror in the following
 respect: an optical image has those of its lines which are at
 right angles to the mirror reversed while those parallel to the
 mirror are not reversed. For instance, if we hold a magnet
 with its north end pointing from us and towards a mirror,
 the optical image of it will have its North end pointing
 towards us (fig. 6). But in the case of a magnetic image
 this is inversed: the magnetic image has its South end point
 ing towards us. In fact the £ of a North end is a
 South end. If, however, we look at the reflexion of the cur
 rents flowing in the solenoid instead of at the sign of the pole
 of the solenoid, we see that laws of the optical case hold good

218 Dr. S. P. Thompson and Mr. Miles Walker on
for the magnetic case. The image (fig. 7) of a current flowing
in any direction in a plane parallel to the mirror is another
current flowing parallel to the first and towards the same part.
                              Fig. 6.
               |       -
A North pole viewed from the front is equivalent to a laevo
cheiral circulation of current. The image of this pole turned
towards the mirror is, to the spectator, a dextro-cheiral circu
lation, or a South pole. The same is true if, as in fig. 8, the
solenoid has its axis parallel to the plane of the mirror. .
   In order to try some effects with an isolated pole, a solenoid,

2 metres long and 1.5 centim. mean diameter, was uniformly
wound with twelve turns per centimetre of a suitable wire.
When a current of 15 amperes was passed through this a
pole of a strength of about 40 units (C.G.S.), was obtained,
and this might be regarded as an isolated pole at distances
not greater than 30 centim. from it. It was found that
bringing an iron plate within a few centimetres of this pole
produced very nearly the same effect upon the field as would
have been produced by bringing up a pole of opposite sign to
a point at double the distance.

    The field close to the iron plate ought to have been exactly
 twice as strong as if no iron plate were there. This was found
 to be so within the limits of error of observation (about 3 per
 cent.) when the pole was within 6 centim. of the iron plate.
 As the distance was increased the throw of the needle became
 too small to be accurately read, and the field being extremely
 weak the susceptibility of the iron would be very low.
    It was this weakness of the field (for one could not consider
 the pole as a point except at distances exceeding 10 centim.)
 that spoilt some experiments on kaleidoscope effects. One
 can conceive that if the laws of reflexion hold good between
 a magnetic pole and a sheet of iron, it ought to be possible, by
 means of several sheets of iron, to build up a magnetic kaleido
 scope by which the effect of a great number of magnetic poles
 could be produced from a single pole. The idea of a mag
 netic kaleidoscope was suggested by Lord Kelvin many years
 ago, but it is doubtful whether it has ever been successfully
 carried out. If, for instance, two plates of susceptible

220      Dr. S. P. Thompson and Mr. Miles Walker on
material are inclined to each other at
an angle of 60 degrees, and the North             Fig. 11.
pole of a magnet placed evenly between
them, one would expect to get between
the plates exactly the same distribution
of field as if there were six poles, three
norths and three souths, spaced alter
nately and evenly round the line of
intersection of the plates. It may,
however, be said to those who would
care to try this experiment, that they     |N*               °N
must use a point pole of much greater
strength than 40 units, or plates much                ©
more susceptible than iron if they hope               S
to be at all successful.
   The close connexion between the effect of an iron plate
magnetically and that of a mirror optically naturally makes
us ask what would be the effect of a curved plate 7 Would it
give magnified or diminished images like a concave or convex
mirror, and what would be the position of these images with
regard to the object?
    f we take the case of spherical curvature, and consider the
iron as being infinitely susceptible, the answer to these
questions can be determined theoretically from the laws of
magnetic potential. All the formulae relating to electric
images already known are applicable to magnetic images.
   If we consider two points A and B at which are placed
two poles respectively, of the strengths + m1 and –m2, the

necessary to take into account the raising of the potential of the whole

some discussion took place on this point after the reading of this paper, it
may be well to deal further with the matter. The case is then analogous
to the case of an electric charge q brought up to an insulated conduct
ing sphere having no previous charge. Lord Kelvin, in a paper dated
July 7th, 1848, has shown that the effect on external points of the

 of a charge – at B (fig. 14), and a further charge of +  #7  at the centre
O. His reasoning being applicable to the magnetic case, we see that the
image of a North pole at A consists of a doublet having a South pole
situated at B of strength  m; and a North pole also of the strength m:
situated at the centre O. Now any magnetic object such as a solenoid
will have a South pole as well as a £ pole, and if the object is
small compared with the size of the sphere, both North and South may
be taken as equidistant from the centre, and their images at the centre
will therefore neutralize each other, and we have left the image that is
considered in the text. . If the object is large as compared with the
size of the sphere, then in both the magnetic case and the optical case
there is a confusion of images.]                 -                  -

and this is seen to be true from the similarity of the triangles
ACO and COB.
   If we had any number of magnetic points outside the sphere
each would have its virtual image inside the sphere; thus any
form of magnet, such as a solenoid carrying a current, would
also have its image.
   It is easy to see that the experiments above mentioned with
a large iron plate can be explained in this way. For if we
may consider the plate as part of an infinite sphere :

   Now the optical mirror which will give at B, the image of
A, and have its middle-point situated at E (as defined by the
former of these conditions) will not have O for its centre.

 In fact it will be a spherical surface having half the curvature
 or twice the radius. If (fig. 16) the dotted circle FEG be

convex mirror which will give the same position of image as
the magnetic convex mirror shown by the circle CED.
    In conclusion, it may be remarked that the construction of
fig. 14 affords a new and simple graphic method of finding the
position of optical images, by the device of using the auxiliary
circle whose diameter is the radius of the spherical surface.

             The Scientific Basis of Analytical Chemistry.
  Die wissenschaftlichen Grundlagen der Analytischen Chemie. Ele
     mentar dargestellt von W. OSTWALD.           (Leipzig; Wilhelm
     Engelmann. 1894.)
   T has been so long the custom with a certain class of teachers in
     this country to regard analytical chemistry as synonymous with
chemical science that the very title of this book will come as a
 surprise. Prof. Ostwald, in the present little volume of 187 pages,
 has attempted to present the subject of chemical analysis in a
 popular form and in a new way. Whether he has succeeded in
his objects in his own country it is difficult to say, but so far as
 English chemists are concerned the book is certainly not likely to
 achieve popularity: first, because it is not arranged in accordance
 with our examinational notions of chemical analysis; and, secondly,
 because it bases the analytical properties of the elements and their
 compounds on a theory which has not found general acceptance in
 this country, viz. the theory of ionic dissociation. But in calling
 attention to these two points we are really bestowing praise upon
the work; because any novelty of treatment in such a well-worn
 field is to be cordially welcomed, and all attempts to approach the
 subject from a different scientific aspect to that generally adopted
 are bound to help in the “depolarization” of cut and dried dogmas
 which are so baneful to true progress in science.
    Of the two parts into which the book is divided, the first, con
sisting of five chapters, deals with theory, and the second, consisting
 of eight chapters, deals with applications. The theoretical part,
 where concerned with the ordinary operations, is lucidly put
 together, and forms quite pleasant reading as compared with the
 purely cookery-book kind of directions that the student in this
 country is expected to follow. We doubt much whether the
 average “certificated teacher” knows that there is any scientific
 theory behind the processes which he has been drilled into carrying
 out. It is in the fourth chapter, under the heading Die chemische
 Scheidung, that the new theory of solutions is first broached, and
from that part onwards everything connected with the subject is
 treated of from the point of view of ionic dissociation. Whether
this view is accepted or not, it must be conceded that Prof. Ostwald

 226            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 has made out a good case in support of its applicability to the
 ordinary processes of analysis. The key-note is struck on p. 47
 in the following extract, which we paraphrase:—
    “In aqueous solutions of electrolytes the ions are generally
 partly combined and partly uncombined. In neutral salts the
 uncombined portion is by far the greater, and is in fact the more
 in preponderance the more dilute the solution. The properties of
 dilute salt-solutions are consequently determined, not so much by
 the properties of the dissolved salt as such or by the combined ions,
 but rather by the properties of its free ions. Through this con
 ception the analytical chemistry of saline matter (salzartigen Stoffe)
 at once undergoes an enormous simplification: it is not the ana
 lytical properties of salts as a whole, but only those of their ions
 which have to be established. Supposing that 50 anions and
 50 kations are given, these can form with each other 2500 salts;
and supposing these salts to possess individual reactions, the pro
perties of 2500 kinds of matter must be individually enunciated.
But since the properties of the dissolved salts are simply the sums
of the properties of their ions, it follows that the knowledge of
50+50=100 cases is sufficient to predominate over the whole
possible number of 2500 cases. As a matter of fact, analytical
chemistry has long made use of this simplification. It has long
been known, for example, that the reactions of the copper salts
are the same with respect to copper, whether we examine the
sulphate, nitrate, or any other salt; the scientific formulation and
the cause of this behaviour have, however, been reserved for the
dissociation theory.”
   Any polemically disposed chemist might feel inclined to traverse
the last statement, but we have said enough to show that we have
at any rate a work on chemical analysis which can in reality be
called a new work. It is worthy of the most careful study, and
its pages will be found interesting both by veterans and novices;
an opinion which is tantamount to the highest praise that can be
bestowed upon a book devoted to a subject in which there has
been practically no scope for a new departure since the time of
Liebig.

      GENTLEMEN,
   N No. 224 (vol. xxxvii.) of your esteemed Magazine was pub
      lished a paper by Mr. Nagaoka on “Hysteresis attending the
Change of Length by Magnetization in Nickel and Iron.” Since

 and the results I have now obtained agree in general with those
 of Mr. Nagaoka. Some discrepancy between our observations may
 be explained as due to a divergence in the conditions of experi
ment *. The method 1 used consisted in the application of inter
ference-fringes and sensitive lever. Its sensitiveness was nearly
the same as that in the method of Mr. Nagaoka: one division
of the microscope scale corresponding to a change of length
 =11 × 10" cm., Influence of temperature effects was compen
 sated by a peculiar bimetallic suspension of the sensitive lever.
    The results I have obtained are given in the following Table,

XXIII. Some Experiments with Alternating Currents. By
   ALBERT GRIFFITHS, M.Sc., Berkeley Fellow of Owens
    College, Manchester*.
TH' paper embraces experiments on certain actions pro
        duced by an alternating current when it passes through
the coil or coils of a galvanometer, and investigations of a
peculiarity noticed by Lenard, viz., that the resistance of
bismuth in a strong magnetic field, when measured with an
alternating current and a telephone, is greater than when
measured with a steady current and a galvanometer; in
addition there are some theoretical considerations.
   As mentioned by Dr. Schuster in Phil. Mag. vol. xlviii.
1874, p. 340, it is found that if an alternating current and
constant current combined go through the coils of a gal
vanometer, the deflexion of the needle is greater than that
produced by the constant current alone.
   In my experiments, an induction-coil supplied with Kohl
rausch's apparatus for the determination of electrolytic
resistance was used as the source of the alternating current,
the interrupter of which was replaced, initially, by a tuning
fork which gave 128 complete vibrations per second.
   The galvanometer employed was one of Edelmann's : there
is a pair of coils on each side of the needle which can be
              * Communicated by Prof. A. Schuster, F.R.S.
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Wol. 39. No. 238. March 1895.         R

 230               Mr. Albert Griffiths : Some
 placed at various distances from the needle; the coils can
 also be rotated as a whole about a vertical axis passing through
 the centre of the needle.    The needle consists of a steel ring,
 suspended with the plane of the ring vertical.
     'hrystal gave a very complete explanation of the phe
 nomenon in Phil. Mag. p. 401, vol. ii. 1876; his explanation
 depends on the assumption—no doubt correct—that the mag
 netization of a steel needle can be caused to vary by a
 magnetic field, however small.
      uppose that, through any cause, the needle makes an
 angle with the plane of the galvanometer coils: owing to the
 fact that a £ is most readily magnetized lengthwise, that
 component of a magnetic field parallel to the needle produces
 a decided change in the magnetization lengthwise, whilst the
 action of the field in any £ direction is relatively small.
 It is unnecessary to go into details, but it is found, on
 examination, that the field, with lines at right angles to the
 plane of the coils, which tends to increase the angular
 deflexion increases the magnetization of the needle : on the
 other hand, the field which tends to diminish the angular de
 flexion diminishes the magnetization of the needle. Hence in
 the case of alternations the currents that tend to increase the
 deflexion give greater impulses than those in the other direc
 tion, and in consequence the angular deflexion of the needle
 is increased. The same would happen if the needle were not
 magnetized.
    Since the change in the magnetization of the needle will
 vary approximately as the strength of the alternating current,
 and the action on the needle varies as the product of the
 change and the strength of the alternating current, it follows
 that the action on the needle will vary approximately as the
 square of the alternating current. This I proved indirectly
 by using an alternating current of constant strength, and
 placing the coils at various distances from the needle, having
 previously determined the relative sensibilities of the galva
 nometer for the various distances with a steady current.
    Still following Chrystal, it is obvious that if a magnetized
 steel sphere, or any steel body bounded by a surface of revolu
 tion whose axis is that of suspension, be suspended, the super
 imposed magnetization will always be parallel to the lines of
-force in the field, and hence there will be no turning moment
 due to this cause.
    I suspended a magnetized steel sphere in place of the
 ordinary needle, and was surprised to find that when the
 angular displacement of the magnetic axis with respect to the
 coils was in one direction, an alternating current increased

              Experiments with Alternating Currents.          231
the deflexion: when the angular displacement was in the
 other direction, an alternating current diminished the deflexion.
     A magnetized steel ring behaved in a similar manner; in
this case I proved experimentally (indirectly) that the action
 on the needle varied approximately as the square of the
 alternating current; also on resuspending the ring so as to
 make what was previously the lower side the upper one, the
 direction of the deflexion was reversed. An explanation did
not strike me at the time of experimenting, but perhaps the
 true explanation is that, owing either to some defect in
 homogeneity or in geometrical shape, the direction most sus
 ceptible to magnetization was inclined at an angle to the
 magnetic axis. Suppose, for example, that the angle were
 45°: since the angle which the direction most susceptible
...to magnetization makes with the plane of the coils is increased
 by an alternating current, it is obvious that the magnetic axis
 could be rotated 45° in either direction before there was a
 change in the direction of the deflexion produced by the alter
 nating current.
      Although, undoubtedly, the phenomena described above are
 almost entirely due to magnetic causes, it was thought
 advisable to try some experiments with a copper (non
 magnetic) ring.
      It must be mentioned that the Edelmann galvanometer was
 supplied with dampers which consisted of two hollow metal
 cylinders capable of movement to various distances from the
  needle. The copper ring was suspended with a diameter
  vertical and capable of rotation about that diameter; when
 the dampers were pushed in as far as possible, the angle be
  tween the plane of the ring and the plane of the coils was
 increased by an alternating current; when the dampers were
  drawn out, the angle was diminished. These repulsions and
  attractions are no doubt caused by the interactions of the
 original alternating current in the galvanometer coils, and the
 induced currents, of various phases, in the copper ring and
 dampers.
      The copper ring was sawn across, so that the circle was no
 longer complete; the action on the ring of an alternating
  current in the galvanometer coils was now almost negligible.

232               Mr. Albert Griffiths: Some
nating current, and I attributed the imperfections, perhaps
erroneously, to slight irregularities in the make and break.
   The interruptions in the primary circuit were caused by a
platinum point leaving a mercury surface which was covered
 with methylated spirit. The spark seemed to me to be
 an erratic factor, and I endeavoured to get rid of it by
employing a resistance as a shunt across the spark-gap, by
 employing a condenser as a shunt, and in particular by a
 method of Differential Winding, which was only a partial
 success, described by S. P. Thompson in ‘The Electro
 magnet and Electromagnet Mechanism.’
    The method of Differential Winding diminishes the spark
 on break, but certainly does not eliminate it; as the action
 of the arrangement is of some interest, I have given a full
 explanation of its construction and behaviour in Addendum I.
   The device for preventing sparking which acted the best,
and which I think is a new one, consists in the use of electro
lytic cells or small batteries placed as a shunt across the
spark-gap.
   I first used electrolytic cells, the platinum plates of which
were about 1 in. by # in., and dipped in dilute or strong sul
phuric acid.
   The explanation is that the cells polarize, and on making
the gap an E.M.F. is introduced opposed to the E.M.F. of
the battery, so that the current rapidly diminishes, decom
posing the liquid and doing chemical work.
   I may mention, incidentally, that the rapid make and break
of current through the electrolytic cells disintegrated the sur
face of either the positive or negative plates (I did not observe
which) and brought platinum into suspension, in a very finely
divided state, throughout the liquid.
   I tried plates of gas-charcoal in dilute H2SO4; these did
not act so well as the platinum.
   I tried lead plates in dilute H2SO4; these acted quite as
well as the platinum plates, and are of course cheap.
   When the above-mentioned device was employed there was
no trouble with the mercury; in fact the little sparking there
was seemed to purify rather than contaminate the surface.
   Having now had some experience with alternating cur
rents, I was recommended to examine some of Lenard’s
experiments" on the electrical resistance of bismuth in a
magnetic field with constant and alternating currents.
   The telephones and bridge employed were those which are
used for the determination of electrolytic resistances by Kohl
rausch’s method; the bridge-wire is wound on a cylinder.
                 * Wied. Ann. xxxix. p. 619 (1890).

             Experiments with Alternating Currents.                233
To eliminate any possible errors due to the self-induction of
the bridge-wire, the resistance of the standard arm was always
varied until the reading of the bridge was not far from £
middle of the wire.
   I, no longer employed a tuning-fork as interrupter, but
used an apparatus discussed in Addendum II, which enabled
me to obtain any number of breaks per second up to 500.
   To explain the fact, discovered by himself, that a bismuth
wire in a strong magnetic field has apparently a higher
resistance when measured with a telephone and an alternating
current than with a galvanometer and constant current,
Lenard frames the bold hypothesis that it is not the frequency
of by far the greater part of the alternating current that has
to do with the increased resistance, but accidental (so to
speak) oscillations with a frequency of about 10,000.
   With the bismuth spiral in a strong field absolute silence
is never obtained in the telephone, but there is a decided
minimum noise of a nondescript character.
   No differences of resistance could be detected with fre
quencies between 60 and 500.
   It is well known that an alternating current tends to travel
along the surface of a conductor, especially when the con
ductor is magnetic ; the result is that the resistance for an
alternating current is greater than for a steady one.
   Let l be the length of a straight wire, R the resistance to
steady currents, pl2T the frequency of vibration, u the mag
netic permeability for circumferential magnetization, R the
                                               ... p°l°u? .

 Or         -          1 p"l'a'

                        1 p’u’   }
where r = resistance per unit length.
    In the case of a copper wire 1 millim. in diameter, where
 p =1, the increase of resistance with an alternating current
 of frequency 10,000 equals about one tenth. 272 2
    The formula becomes unworkable when               19 #    is large;
 but it seems probable that if a current of 10,000 exists side
 by side with one of 100, the use of sufficient iron wire of
 sufficient diameter would enable us to diminish the strength of

234                Mr. Albert Griffiths : Some
the former considerably, while diminishing the latter to a
much less degree.
    I employed a length of iron wire which had a resistance
equal to 1:845 ohms, l=4675 centim.; taking u = 100, we
get when p=27 x 10,000 —

                               = 250 approx.
 The wire was placed between the secondary of the induction
 coil (which had, as arranged, a resistance of about 24 ohms)
 and the Wheatstone bridge.
    No very appreciable change was produced in the intensity
 of the sound of the telephone when the iron wire was intro
 duced, nor was any change produced in the reading which
 gave the position of minimum sound.                   -
    The use of the telephone, as being too comprehensive in its
 record, seemed to me in some respects unsatisfactory; and I
 thought that possibly a method might be useful which enabled
 the telephone to be replaced by a galvanometer, whilst still
 retaining an alternating current.
     It has already been mentioned that the interruptions were
 produced by means of a vibrating wire, a platinum point
 attached to the wire dipped in and out of mercury; to the
 same vibrating wire was attached, by means of an insulator,
 some platinum wire in the form of an inverted U, the lower
 tips of which just dipped in some mercury contained in
  two little vessels. The telephone was replaced by a galvano
  meter, and the latter was so connected to the bridge that the
 galvanometer-branch was only complete when the platinum
 wire (in the form of an inverted U) dipped into the mercury
 in the two little vessels.
     This arrangement, as was to be expected, gave correct
  results when the resistance of a german-silver wire, for
  example, was determined by means of an alternating current;
  but when the attempt was made to determine the resistance
  of a bismuth spiral in a strong magnetic field, the method
  failed. Matters were sufficiently stable to allow of observa
  tions, but the results obtained varied with the frequencies,
  and even with the same frequency were not constant from
  hour to hour. Since readings could be obtained, and since
  I' of a second is no doubt small in comparison with the
  time the galvanometer-branch was complete, it seems ex
  tremely probable that the action of the bismuth spiral
  depends on some action upon the alternating current of the
  frequency I was endeavouring to employ (about 50). It
  seems likely also that the action of the bismuth is not a
  simple one, i. e. there is perhaps not merely (if at all) an

             Eaperiments with Alternating Currents.           235
increase in resistance, but also an action depending on the
phase of the current.
    It was thought probable that, although the bismuth spiral
had no real self-induction, yet it might have something equi
valent. To test this, two equal resistances were prepared
whose coefficients of self-induction could be varied at pleasure,
for description of which see Addendum III.
   By no means could complete silence be obtained when the
telephone and alternating current were employed; there was
always a decided minimum noise. The minimum noise given
by the telephone was certainly diminished by the introduc
tion of suitable self-induction, the amount required diminish
ing with the strength of the field in which the bismuth was
placed. But here, again, on attempting to measure I found
difficulties; for the amount required varied from time
to time, depending certainly on the state of the telephone
(proved by tampering with the diaphragm), and possibly on
the state of the ears, or on small peculiarities of the current.
   The resistance of the bismuth spiral was determined alone
and in series with an ordinary resistance, the alternating
current and telephone being of course employed; the results
were the same in each case: if the bismuth had behaved as
if it had self-induction, the results would have been different.
   The bismuth spiral was replaced by an ordinary resistance,
and self-induction was introduced until the apparent change
of resistance, measured by the telephone, was equal to that
produced by the action of a magnetic field of certain strength
on the bismuth : the minimum noise was very much greater
than that observed when the bismuth was employed. . . .
   Before making more experiments, I thought it advisable to
make up some theory as a working hypothesis.
   In the first place, it is very probable that the increase of
resistance with a constant current, produced by a strong
magnetie field, is caused by, or accompanied by, a mole
cular or crystalline rearrangement of the bismuth. Again,
it is not unlikely that the passage of a current along the
bismuth may cause or require an additional rearrangement;
and it is possible that an arrangement which has a certain
resistance for one strength of current may not have the same
resistance for another strength. It is not suggested that
different strengths of current may be subject to different
resistances, but that the arrangement for one strength of
current may produce—the previous arrangement still obtain
ing—a different resistance for another strength of current.
The changes in resistance would in this case be of a compli
cated character; I worked on the above assumption, assisted
by mathematics, without obtaining any serviceable results,

236               Mr. Albert Griffiths: Some
  I made another attempt at a theory, which, with the help
of sufficient hypotheses, gives results agreeing to some extent
with the facts.
   For simplicity, initially, the bismuth spiral will not be
considered as forming part of a Wheatstone bridge.
   It is very probable that when the bismuth wire is put in
a magnetic field the ultimate particles, crystals or molecules,
will become magnetized. The stronger the field the stronger
will the magnetization be. If now an alternating current be
sent along the wire, the magnetized particles will take up
forced oscillations.
   Let e=e, cospt represent the E.M.F. acting at the ex
tremity of a bismuth wire.
   For simplicity, let us confine our attention to one particle
of bismuth. Let u = any displacement of the particle caused
by the alternating current; then, approximately, the oscilla
tion of the particle will be represented by

on the degree of magnetization of the particle, on the strength
of the field, and on the ultimate structure of the bismuth.

 This deduction diverges from the observed facts; its chief
 interest lies in the result that, so long as k is great compared
         2-m”
 with "T" , the frequency of the alternating current has

238                  Mr. Albert Griffiths: Some
little influence. The higher the value of k, the lower is the
frequency for which (8) is still true.
    In the preceding it has been assumed that n > p; it seems
impossible to obtain the actual value of n. In general, rapid
oscillations are characteristic of small dimensions; and if the
oscillations were due to mechanical causes, as an hypothesis
I should feel inclined to take n large. The frequency of the
oscillations of a magnetized particle could not depend entirely,
however, on mechanical forces, for it would certainly depend
on the strength of the field and the relative position of the
particle with respect to the field.
    It may be noticed also that ra depends to some extent on p;
and it will be shown later that, if the bismuth spiral formed
one arm of a Wheatstone bridge, the positions of minimum
noise would vary slightly with different frequencies; so that
unless a perfectly harmonic alternating current was employed,
the sound in the neighbourhood of the minimum position
would differ in constitution from the sound corresponding to
the original alternating current.

examination is given below.

    a. galvanometer and an intermittent contact caused by a

            Experiments with Alternating Currents.                241
vibrating wire were employed gave results of little utility.
An objection to the method is that the length of contact and
the position of contact (so to speak) with regard to the phase
of the alternating current are unknown.
   A well-designed alternator would provide a method of ob
taining an alternating current almost perfectly harmonic in
character, and by means of an intermittent contact arranged
by the agency of the axis of the rotating armature the effect
of the bismuth on the alternating current could be studied
very efficiently.
   I £            a small alternator made from a motor, the
character of whose alternating current I do not know.
   To make the tabulated results given later more clear, it
may be mentioned that the wire of the bridge is divided into
1000 parts, and that increase in the reading means increase
in the resistance measured.
   The alternator gave a current with a frequency of about
30 or 40 per second.
   With constant current and permanent contact, the reading
was 489.
   The reading for minimum noise with the telephone was
about 501.
   The readings obtained with an intermittent contact and a
galvanometer are indicated in the table given below. I was
assisted by a friend, and they were taken rapidly.
   What is called the lead is the angle between the point of
intermittent contact and the point of zero current : in other
words, it is the angular distance the coil of the alternator has
advanced beyond the position in which no current is produced
before the galvanometer branch is made complete.

        r changes from + co to - oo.

  VII.   Let pt=210°.                       Reading=491.
VIII.    Let pt=240°.                       Reading=505.

    XI.  Let pt=330°.                       Reading=532.
    The theoretical results indicate a sudden change at 0°,
involving an impossibility of reading for small values of pt
(r must lie between + 1 and 0); later a gradual rise in
reading to 180°, again a sudden change, and a repetition of
the preceding.
    The measurements of the angles of lead are confessedly
rough (they were made with the unassisted eye), theory
would indicate an addition of 5° to each reading. I en
deavoured to make more observations, but owing to difficulties
decided to leave more accurate determinations to a future
time.
    Theory indicates that difficulties might be expected at the
position with which I always started, viz., a lead of about zero.
    I may mention that the telephones I employed were not
nearly so useful with currents of low frequency as with
higher. In fact a current from the alternator, which was none
too powerful for use with the telephones and bridge, heated
the bismuth spiral so as to perceptibly alter its resistance. I
found that in a strong field the resistance of bismuth, as
measured by a telephone, diminishes with increase of tempera
ture: the same is true with a constant current, as, I found
out after making my own experiments in May, was noticed
by Van Aubel" a year or more ago, and later (with more
detail) by Henderson f.
    That the resistance of bismuth in a strong field should
diminish with increase in temperature is what one would expect
if, as surmised, the increase of resistance is due to changes con
nected with the diamagnetism of bismuth. I do not know
of any researches, but it is probable that the susceptibility of
bismuth will diminish (numerically) with increase of tempera
ture: assuming this, we should expect that the effect of an
increase in temperature will be complex in character—that, so
far as the effect of the demagnetization due to rise in tempera
ture is concerned, the resistance will diminish; that, so far as
the ordinary action of heat is concerned, the resistance will

            Experiments with Alternating Currents.             245
increase. In general we might expect a temperature to be
soon reached at which the latter action is greater than the
former.
   I should expect the curves which give the relation between
temperature and resistance, in the case of a steady current, to
be somewhat (to express myself loosely) asymptotic, the
asymptote being the line which gives the relation between
'" and                   resistance when the bismuth is in zero
  C101.
    In addition, taking my theory—which may be applied to
currents of the frequencies under consideration or to those of
10,000 per second as imagined, perhaps correctly, by Lenard—
as a working hypothesis, I have formed the expectation that
the difference between the resistances as measured by tele
phone and galvanometer would diminish with increase of
temperature; this is perhaps worthy of investigation.
    There is another action which may exist,-perhaps also
worthy of research; I have not had the advantage of study
ing the original paper, but Geronza and Finzi" find that an
 alternating current influences the susceptibility of iron, nickel,
 and steel; possibly the susceptibility of bismuth may be
 influenced in like manner, and indirectly affect the resistance.
    I hope at some future time to carry on some experiments
with alternating currents perfectly harmonic in character,
 a telephone responding only to the frequency under considera
 tion, and to endeavour to determine ' is the lowest
 frequency at which a change in resistance is perceptible;
 also to examine whether the shape of the section of the bismuth
 wire is of any importance.
                               Summary.
    The paper contains a few new experiments dealing with
the action of alternating currents when sent through the coils
of a galvanometer.
    A convenient and satisfactory arrangement is described for
diminishing the spark on breaking a galvanic circuit.
    A description is given of experiments, made with the
 bismuth spiral, all of which (and others of which no descrip
 tion is given) gave negative results.
    A theory is elaborated which explains, to a limited extent,
 the fact that in a strong field the resistance of bismuth is
 greater when measured with an alternating than with a
 constant current.

haviour of the method of differential winding for diminishing

of the interrupter which may be useful when it is necessary
to design an interrupter for high frequencies.
    Addendum III. describes the method adopted to compare
self-inductions.
    In conclusion I have to express my thanks to Prof. A.
Schuster for initiating my research and for much friendly
criticism throughout.
                          ADDENDUM I.
    In the method of differential winding two wires of equal
length and diameter are wound into coils side by side, and
their ends so connected that the wires are in parallel arc and
that the equal currents which circulate the coils, when a steady
current is flowing, go in opposite directions. When a steady
 current goes through the arrangement no lines of force are
 produced within the combination coil; one naturally associates
the production of a spark at a break in a coil with lines of
 force, and there is a danger of erroneously assuming that no
 spark due to induction will be formed by causing a break in
 one of the coils. What is, of course, necessary, is that the
 rate of change of the number of lines of force enclosed within
 the coil should equal zero.
    Let us imagine that one coil can be suddenly broken at any
 point, and that the current in the other coil can flow on
 undisturbed : if this happened the lines of force enclosed
 within the combination coil would instantaneously vary from
 zero to a finite number, i.e., the rate of change of the number
 of lines of force would equal infinity and the E.M.F. tending
  to produce a spark across the gap would also equal infinity.
     What actually happens is, probably, somewhat as follows :
  since the self-induction of each coil is equal to the mutual
 induction of the two, on breaking one coil the current in the
  other is suddenly stopped, it then begins immediately to
  increase, and whilst increasing causes, by induction, a spark
  across the gap in the broken coil.
     The spark produced by the break is therefore analogous to
  the “make” spark of an ordinary induction-coil.
     The stoppage of both currents by the break of only one

coil is capable of explanation by means of a mechanical
analogy.
   In the figure, A represents a disk capable of rotation about
a vertical axis; M a heavy body
which is capable of rotation about
a vertical axis XY; C a disk cap
able of rotation about an axis
(variable in position) joining M
to XY; B a disk similar to A.
The disks A, B, and C are supposed
to be of inappreciable mass. If A
and B (corresponding to currents)
rotate with equal velocities in oppo
site directions, the disk C will rotate,
but M (corresponding to induction)
will remain stationary. If, now,
B be suddenly stopped, as M, owing to its inertia, must
instantaneously remain at rest, C will be instantaneously
stopped also, and likewise A. If the motive power of A be
kept continuously applied, it will immediately begin to rotate,
and gradually increase in velocity from zero to its maximum
speed.
   The cause of the production of the spark is also capable of
mathematical treatment.
   For simplicity, let it be assumed that the E.M.F. between
the ends of each coil is kept constant and equal to E.

    The probable relation between is and t when k is great, but
not infinite, is indicated in the figure below.

    The apparatus used as an interrupter is diagrammatically
 sketched below.
     AC represents the vibrating wire, B the battery, D and E
 electromagnets, F a vessel containing mercury, I the induction
  coil. Some cells, consisting of lead plates in dilute sulphuric
  acid, were used as a shunt across the spark-gap; they are not
  shown in the figure, nor are they taken account of in the
  theoretical considerations which are given below.
     It was found experimentally, as one would expect from
  telephony, that initial magnetization by means of subsidiary
  coils increased the amplitude of vibration, at any rate for low
  frequencies.
     It was also found that a piece of iron placed below one of
  the electromagnets increased the amplitude; this is a corre
  sponding device to that used in Auer’s telephone. The
  probable explanation is that the iron produces a strong and
  divergent field in the neighbourhood of the iron wire,

             Evperiments with Alternating Currents.          251
    If there is a strong initial magnetization, we may assume
that the efficient pull on the wire will vary as the current
through the coils.
    Let F=efficient pull,
         i = current,
then Foc i.
    Some rough calculations were made, and the conclusion
was arrived at that the self-induction of the electromagnets
was of the dimensions of 109 in C.G.S. units.
    The resistance of the primary circuit was about 3 x 10"
C.G.S. units.
    Let T=time of vibration,
         n=frequency= T'
    let if=maximum current in the primary circuit, i. e. the
               current just before the break.
    Let it be assumed that the platinum point is in contact with
the mercury for the time 2’
    Let  io=  # where E equals the E.M.F.      and R the resist
ance of the primary circuit.
    The equation which represents the rise in the current after
 contact is made is
                                     – Rt                -

 i = i, x 2541; T= # i = i, x 03; T= " i = x:003;
 T=1000, # = i, x 0015; and that if n >50, formula (2)
 may, with very little error, be taken as correct. It can be
 shown that the average current in the primary circuit varies
 inversely as the frequency.
     The energy given to the vibrating wire in one complete
  oscillation will now be considered.
     Since the current is stronger whilst the wire is rising than
  when descending, the work done on the string by magnetic
  forces when rising must be greater than the work done by the
  string  ' magnetic forces when descending; the spark will
  also prolong the pull upwards.

252                 Mr. Albert Griffiths: Some
   In the following the effect of the spark will be entirely
omitted.
    As a matter of fact, the oscillation of the wire cannot be
perfectly harmonic; nevertheless, let us assume that the
motion of the wire is represented by the equation
                            w=d sin pt,
where d= maximum distance traversed from the middle point,
             2
         w= distance of platinum point below its middle position.
    The work done by the electromagnets on the wire can be
put in the form |Far, taken between the proper limits where
F varies as i, i. e. F=kt, where k varies as      #.
    It is needless to go into details, but the result is that the
resultant work done on the string in one oscillation
                         varies as  #.

 which shows that the energy given to the wire in one oscil
 lation varies inversely as the frequency if the amplitude is
 unaltered.
    When the vibrating wire has settled down, the energy given
 to the wire in each oscillation by magnetic causes must equal
 the energy lost through other causes.
    I. Air resistance, which may be taken to vary as the square
 of the velocity of the string.
     II. Resistance due to induced currents or damping, which
 may be taken to vary as the      '
     III. Other frictional losses, which will be neglected.
     By equating the energy given to the energy lost, and
  dealing only with the losses under (I.), I obtain the result that
                            E varies as n”;
  so that, as 4 cells were used to obtain a frequency of 500, to
  obtain a frequency of 1000 of the same amplitude 32 cells
  would be required.
     If the chief losses come under (II.), then E varies as n”.
     In what follows, the losses under (I.) will alone be considered.
     If n increases, the amplitude diminishes, the relation being
  that d varies as n-.
     The wire ceases to vibrate if i is not sufficiently great; it

is hard to say what decides the cessation of vibration; if the
platinum point acted perfectly, i. e. if the least rise broke
the circuit completely, and the least depression made the
circuit, there would, I think, be no limit to the frequency
obtainable.
   If we assume that it is necessary for the platinum point to
move a certain minimum distance before a break is made in
the circuit, then, for the wire to continue vibrating,
                        E must vary as n”.
   Theory indicates that the frequency obtainable by the appa
 ratus discussed could be raised by increasing E and at the
 same time adding resistance free from induction.
   The preceding discussion applies to the apparatus under
consideration; but the subject can be treated more generally.
   Let it still be assumed that F varies as i; so that we   may
 put F=Ki.

 If T is small, it can be shown that this expression agrees with
 the previously obtained result.

the most efficient result.
   If L=0, W equals 0; if L=oo, W equals zero; so that
there is some value of L between 0 and oo which it is best
to employ.
   The actual problem, which I have not gone into, is more
complicated still; for both K and L depend on the winding:
for precise treatment, a certain type of winding might be
adopted, and K and L. made to depend on some variable
depending on the character of the winding; perhaps expe

by many experimenters during the last sixty years; but no one

has succeeded in determining accurately what function of
the intensity of magnetization or of the induction the stress
really is. In order to show how the methods of experiment
ing have developed, and how they have led to those of the
present investigation, I will describe shortly the chief experi
ments that have so far been made".                      -
    As long ago as 1833 Fechnert made a series of measure
ments of the weight necessary to separate a horseshoe magnet
and its keeper, measuring the current by swinging a mag
netic needle within a coil through which the current passed.
 He found a rough proportionality between the limiting weight
 and the current.
    Somewhat more accurate experiments made in 1839 by
 Lenz and Jacobit showed that this proportionality did not
 exist. In the same year Joules, measuring the magnetizing
 current with an ingenious “current-weigher,” found that for
 small currents the lifting-power of an iron electromagnet
 was proportional to the square of the magnetizing current,
 but that for stronger currents the lifting-power increased
 more slowly and ultimately reached a maximum value of
 140 lb. per square inch; twelve years later ||, however, using
 a more powerful electromagnet, he found the maximum value
 to be 175 lb. per square inch.
    In 1852 Dub" found that the lifting-power was propor
 tional neither to the current nor to the square of the current,
 but to some intermediate function, and for strong currents
 reached a maximum.
    Much more accurate experiments were made in 1870 by
 v. Waltenhofen". Two similar bars of iron with plane ends
 were bent approximately to semicircles and wire wound evenly
 on both. One bar was fixed rigidly in a frame and the other
 one pulled up from it, the necessary force being measured b
 a spring-balance. A third bar and coil, similar to the other
 two but straight, was set up with a compensating-coil in the
 East and West line through a magnetometer-needle. All
  these coils were in circuit with a galvanometer for indicating
 the current.
     The stress between the bent electromagnets could thus be
 compared with the magnetic moment of the straight one, and

256                  Mr. E. Taylor Jones on
with the magnetizing current. With small currents the lifting
power increased more rapidly than the magnetometer-deflex
ion, but with stronger currents more slowly, the corresponding
curve ultimately approaching a horizontal asymptote. Also
the lifting-power was proportional neither to the current nor
to its square, but was represented approximately by a function
of the form b tan" (ac), where c is the current, and a, b
constants.
   The magnetizing forces, however, used in these experi
ments could have been but small, since the straight magnet
was never more than half saturated, and its magnetization
was always nearly proportional to the current.
   The next experiments were made in 1881 by Werner
v. Siemens". The electromagnets were made by cutting an
iron tube in a plane through the axis, and winding both
halves with wire. The interfaces were carefully ground
together. A ballistic galvanometer and secondary coil were
used to measure the induction.             From the total induction
“throw” was subtracted the throw caused by breaking the
current in the coil after the iron was removed. The resulting
differences are therefore proportional to the intensity of
magnetization, not to the induction.
   The result showed that the lifting-power was approximately
proportional to the magnetic moment per unit volume, but
that the ratio somewhat increased as the current was increased.
Similar results were obtained with electromagnets formed by
cutting a circular iron tube in the plane through the greatest
section.
   Siemens believed the above law to be established, and
attributed the deviations to residual magnetism, and to im
perfect contact of magnet and keeper ' to bending, the
imperfect state of the surfaces, and other mechanical causes.
These were the probable causes of much greater errors than
those believed to exist.
   In 1882 Wassmuthf experimented with magnets similar
to those used by v. Waltenhofen. The induction was measured
ballistically, and the ends of the magnets were ground plane
and polished. The magnetic moment per unit volume was
calculated from the induction-current and the results com
pared with a theory given by Stefani, according to which
the stress is proportional to the square of the magnetic
moment per unit volume at the surface of contact. Wassmuth

                     Electromagnetic Stress.                 257
found, however, that the stress agreed better with an ex

                         a + bl  +   al-EcI”
where I is the magnetic moment per unit volume. Wass
muth's experiments are subject to the same objections as
Siemens’, viz., imperfect contact of magnet and keeper due to
bending &c., and, in addition, to the difficulty of ensuring that
the magnets separate at the two places of contact exactly
simultaneously. If separation takes place at one place first,
there will be an immediate diminution of the induction, and
the limiting weights will generally be too small.
   Wassmuth further deduced from Siemens’ numbers an
expression for the lifting-power of the form a+bl”+cI",
which represented the latter’s results fairly well.
   Neither Siemens nor Wassmuth appears to have thought
of comparing his results with the theory given in sections
641–644 of Maxwell's ‘Electricity and Magnetism, which
had been published several years before. Maxwell there
arrives at the expression B*A/87 for the electromagnetic
traction in air between two opposing, plane, infinitely near,
and uniformly and normally magnetized pole-faces each of
area A ; where B is the induction.
   In 1886 Bosanquet” experimented with two straight iron
electromagnets whose ends were ground together. One
electromagnet was fixed vertically, and the other supported
beneath it on the beam of a balance by which its weight was
compensated, this allowing measurements with very small
currents to be made. Weights were placed in a scale-pan
suspended from the lower electromagnet, and the induction
was measured by a small secondary coil near the surface of
contact.
   For low and medium currents the weights supported were
 much greater than those given by Maxwell's theory, the
values being better represented by an expression of the form
aB+bB”; while with high currents the results appear to be
very uncertain, most of the readings widely differing from
the theoretical values. The mean results,           #'      agree
to within about 5 per cent.
   In the same year Bidwellt made a series of measurements
of the tractive force between two bar-magnets, and of the
magnetizing current, but not of the induction, his object

258                     Mr. E. Taylor Jones on
being to measure the induction from the values of the
tractive force, using Maxwell's expression.
    Quite recently an important paper has been published by
 Threlfall", giving an account of experiments made with appa
 ratus essentially similar to Bosanquet’s; but the interfaces of
the electromagnets were carefully ground and polished, and
the tractive force was measured by a spring-balance.
    The results for high inductions do not show better agree
ment than Bosanquet's with Maxwell's theory ; but the
author explains an important source of error which exists
especially in working at low inductions, viz.—that the inter
faces of the magnets do not generally remain in contact until
the stress is completely overcome, but separate at one side
first, thus enclosing a “wedge-shaped gap.” The numbers
given, however, only extend over a range of inductions from
11,000 to 16,000 C.G.S. units. Most £ paper deals with
the case when the bars are separated by layers of non
magnetic substance.
    It was clear, therefore, that more accurate experiments were
necessary to determine whether Maxwell’s expression repre
sents exactly the tractive force, and if so, how apparatus is to
be arranged so as to allow of the accurate measurement of
induction by tractive experiments.
                  Present Experiments. Apparatus.
   The following experiments were begun in October 1893.
The apparatus was devised with a view to realizing as closely
as possible the conditions under which the results could best
be compared with Maxwell's theory, and was prepared and
arranged as follows:–
    A chosen bar of soft German iron was turned accurately to
an ellipsoid of revolution of length 22.57 centim. and least
diameter 1.5 centim. Its shape was tested by measuring its
volume by weighing in air and water, and by calculating the
volume from the above values of the axes.               The two values
agreed to within a tenth per cent. The ellipsoid was after
wards cut through in the equatorial plane, the diminution of
length being measured by observing the distance between two
marks on its surface.
   Two exactly similar magnetizing-coils were made, each
20 centim. long, and having 12 layers of 70 turns each
of 2 millim. aluminium wiret.
   * Phil. Mag. July 1894.
   + Aluminium wire was used that the coils might be as light as pos
sible, it being thought desirable not to use the compensating arrangement
adopted by Bosanquet, as this probably introduced errors due to friction.

   The two halves of the ellipsoid were soldered into tubes
which could be fitted tightly, axially, into the coils, the free
ends projecting by amounts regulated by nuts, N (fig. 1),
       Fig. 1–Longitudinal vertical section of Traction Apparatus.
 running on the tubes. To secure good alignment of the half
 ellipsoids, a small brass ring, R, of 1 millim. width, was made
 to fit tightly on one half and loosely on the other at the
   lane of contact. This ring was afterwards found to be an
 important part of the apparatus, results obtained without it
 being very uncertain.
    To the absence of such a guide in Bosanquet's experiments
 may probably be attributed, to some extent, the uncertainty
 of his results, especially at high inductions.
    One coil was suspended from a tripod stand by two rods
 provided with nuts and screws, by which and two other screws
 (not shown in the diagram) the coil could be raised or lowered,
 levelled, and rigidly fixed. Below this was a platform, P, with

260                    Mr. E. Taylor Jones on
an opening through which passed the lower projecting end of
the tube in the other coil, and to this was attached a hook and
scale-pan.
   The current, obtained from a battery of accumulators, was
measured by a Siemens and Halske's torsion-galvanometer,
£by electrolysis.
  The magnetization was measured in independent experiments
by the magnetometer method.
   The ellipsoid and coils were placed in the magnetic east and
west line east of a delicate magnetometer read by telescope
and scale.
   The intensity of the earth's horizontal field was measured
by the method of Gauss and by the tangent-galvanometer
method, a Kohlrausch's local-variometer being found useful
for measuring its variations.
   The magnetization-curve was first obtained, showing the
relation between I and H, allowance being made, as usual, for
the demagnetizing-force of the ellipsoid calculated from the
expression given in Maxwell’s ‘Electricity and Magnetism”
(Sect. 438). The intensity of magnetization I was calculated
in absolute units from the formula"                                   -

corresponding to any current could be calculated, since
B=H +47If. All precautions were taken to determine the
curve as accurately as possible, the torsion of the magneto
meter-fibre, the exact position of the needle with respect to
the axis of the ellipsoid, the length of a division on the scale,
the effect of the compensating-coil at all parts of the scale (by
deflecting with permanent magnets), and the temperature of
the room during the local-variometer experiments all being
carefully examined. The residual magnetism was very small,
being less than a sixtieth of the total magnetization when
the ellipsoid was strongly magnetized. Each current was

the deflexion corresponding to the mean of the two currents,
which were generally the same*.                               -
    The “lifting ” experiments were then proceeded with :
    The upper coil was first suspended vertically and symme
trically above the opening H, in the platform P (fig. 1), the
lower bar and coil being thus supported (when the current
was made) so that its tube T passed freely through the
opening
    Enough weights were placed in the scale-pan to nearly
overcome the stress, the remainder being slowly poured in in
the form of fine shot until the lower coil fell.           The current
was then read off and the shot weighed.
    This was repeated for a number of currents ranging from
1 to 10 amperes (the corresponding inductions ranging from
6000 to 20,000 C.G.S.); the adjustment of the upper coil
being made before every reading, and the surfaces carefully
cleaned with a soft dry brush.
    The “reversed” readings were also taken, as in the mag
netometer experiments.
    The inductions corresponding to the currents used were
calculated from the magnetization-curve. The inductions and
the square roots of the observed weights were plotted in a
#" along with the straight line representing
 a W.

                          First Experiments.
    The first experiments were made with the contact-surfaces
of the ellipsoid turned truly plane but not polished.
    The curve representing the observed results was at low
inductions    £              above the straight line (the observed
weights    being   greater   than    those given by Maxwell's law),
soon crossing it and remaining below it for high inductions,
the difference increasing with the induction.
    The correction due to the excess of area of the coils over
that of the core was found by removing the cores and sup
porting the lower coil in the same position on a balance.
   * (1) It may be objected that the magnetization in the “lifting”
experiments was not the same as in the magnetometric experiments, on
account of the longitudinal pull existing in the former; but a small cal
culation shows that, with the weights used, this effect was in general
very small, and could, except perhaps at the highest inductions, be
neglected.
   (2) The magnetization-curve was determined both before and after
the ellipsoid was cut, and the demagnetizing-force (which was affected
by the shortening of the ellipsoid after the cutting) calculated in both
cases. The curve for the cut ellipsoid was lower than the other; but
the difference was very slight, especially at high fields.

262                  Mr. E. Taylor Jones on
The current was made, and weights added until the coil
returned to its original position. These added weights mea
sured the total attraction of the coils.     From this must be
subtracted the part corresponding to the area occupied by the
core, since this is already included in B.
   The correction was found to be negligible, never being more
than a sixth per cent. of the attraction of the electromagnets,
and for small currents less than a twentieth per cent.
   Another correction is due to the effect of the surface
distribution of magnetism on the ellipsoid in so far as the
corresponding tubes of force pass through the air. This
correction, which vanishes with ring-magnets and infinitely
long cylinders, was found on calculation to amount to less
than 1% per cent.
   The interfaces of the ellipsoid were then polished by the
firm Hartmann and Braun of Frankfurt. In this process
the surfaces were surrounded with wide “guard-rings” to
keep the edges as sharp as possible. The mirrors showed
a so-called “black polish,” and gave a perfectly clear image
with a 32-magnifying-power telescope and scale at a distance
of 5 metres. It would be hardly possible to obtain on metal
a nearer approach to an absolutely geometrical plane.
   Also in order better to guide the lower coil, the opening in
the platform P (fig. 1) was made smaller, just large enough,
in fact, to allow the tube to pass freely through it. A series
of readings was taken, as before, and these agreed consider
ably better with Maxwell's theory both for low and for high,
but especially for low inductions.
   This I attributed chiefly to the improved guiding of the
lower coil; and it was found that at low inductions, by very
slightly altering the position of the upper coil, a position could
be found in which the tractive force was a minimum, and
that if the applied weights were rather less than this minimum
value the upper coil (never being absolutely rigidly fixed), on
being slowly moved towards the “minimum” position,
suddenly jumped across it, thus showing, so to speak, a pre
ference for positions in which it could support heavier weights
or the actual weight more easily.
   The measurements were therefore made as follows:—The
current being kept constant, shot was poured into the scale
  an in small instalments, the upper coil after each addition
£      carefully moved by hand until the “minimum ” position
(easily observed by the jerk) was found. This was repeated
until the coil fell in this position.
   The explanation of this is given in Threlfall’s paper (l.c.),
in which it is shown that at small inductions the tractive force
is less when the two pole-faces are everywhere in contact

                     JElectromagnetic Stress.                  263
than when they are separated at one side, thus enclosing a
wedge-shaped gap.
   This was the case in the present experiments up to induc
tions of about 14,000 C.G.S.
   For higher inductions the tractive force is greatest when
the surfaces are everywhere in contact, the upper core and
coil therefore assuming naturally the proper position, pro
vided, of course, the screw-adjustment is first sufficiently good.
For inductions up to about 14,000 C.G.S., therefore, the
lower bar was in unstable equilibrium when in good contact
 with the upper, for higher inductions in stable equilibrium;
at about 14,000 the equilibrium was indifferent, and the
nature of the contact was found within wide limits to have
no influence on the Tractive Force.
   As regards the results showing better agreement with the
theory than before at higher inductions, I attribute this to a
better method of testing the screw-adjustment of the upper
coil, and partly, perhaps, to the improved state of the contact
surfaces after polishing.              -
   At this stage the weights were all smaller than those
calculated from Maxwell’s expression, but their square roots
were approximately proportional to the induction for inductions
up to about 14,000 units, being still smaller at higher in
ductions, the deviation from the theoretical values increasing
to about 3 per cent. at B=20,000.
   The uniformity of these results led me to believe that the
errors, if any existed, were not accidental but due to some
cause which acted always in the same way. Accordingly, I
tried the effect of increasing the distance between the coils,
thus leaving a greater part of the core near the plane of
contact unsurrounded with coil-windings. I found that the
effect of increasing this distance by about 2 millim. was very
slight for inductions up to about 14,000 C.G.S., and for
higher inductions was a diminution of Tractive Force of a
few hundred grammes, varying with the induction—differences
of the same order as the differences between the above observed
and calculated values.      I could also increase the Tractive
Force by an amount of the same order by putting between the
coils a few extra turns of wire.  As the actual distance between
the windings of the two coils (including the end-plates and
the space occupied by the small guiding ring) in the above
experiments was about 5 millim., it was clear that the
observed weights were on this account smaller than the
theoretical values; in other words, that the induction, as
calculated from the magnetization-curve, was greater than the
actual induction across the surface of contact.
   This result can be easily explained; for when the induction

264                 Mr. E. Taylor Jones on
is low the permeability of iron is great, and the tubes of
induction pass more readily through the iron; but when the
induction is high and the permeability small the absence of
coil-windings near the surface of contact causes a greater pro
portion of tubes to pass out into the air; in other words,
causes a greater spreading of the tubes. The effect of the
absence of a given number of turnings near the plane of
section might be calculated [see Neumann : “Ueber die Mag
netisirung eines Drehungsellipsoids,” Crelle, Bd. xxxvii.
(1848)], but it was deemed better first to diminish the gap
between the coils as much as possible. With this object the
coils were somewhat altered, the end-plates being altogether
removed and the small guiding ring being let into one of the
coils. The gap-width could then be reduced to zero, but a
width of about 1.5 millim. was necessary in order to examine
the contact of the pole-faces.       The effect of this was to
increase the Tractive Force by several hundred grammes at all
inductions, the increase being greatest at high inductions.
The magnetization-curve was carefully re-determined and the
results calculated out as before.     The attraction of the coils
alone was also remeasured, but found not to have been
appreciably increased by the shortening of the gap.
                          Final Results.
   The results now agreed with Maxwell’s theory to one-half
per cent, for inductions up to 19,000 units, but between 19,000
and 20,000 units the square roots of the observed weights are
rather more than 1 per cent, below the calculated values.
   This difference at high inductions might well be due to the
fact that there was still a gap of 1.5 millim. between the coils,
which would have a spreading effect at high inductions; to
the effect of the stress on the magnetization; or to tempera
ture effects, the coils being considerably heated by a current
 of 10 amperes. A better agreement with the theory was
 therefore hardly to be expected.
   No readings could be taken at inductions below 6000, since
the weight of the lower coil and half-core was sufficient to
 overcome the stress at this induction. The following table
 gives the values of the intensity of magnetization, induction,
 and the square roots of the theoretical and observed Tractive
Forces measured in grammes weight; and the diagram (fig. 2)
 shows the values of the Induction and the square root of the
 observed Tractive Force, the theoretical values being repre

   Fig. 3 represents the magnetization-curve and the de
 magnetizing force of the ellipsoid.
   Each observation was repeated several times, and the mean
value taken as the true value. The weights, however, neVer
differed by more than 1 or 2 per cent. for the same magne
tizing current.
   It appears therefore that the present method of measure
ment has great advantages over the ballistic method used
by Bosanquet and Threlfall, for Bosanquet obtained some
times for '. same induction weights differing by nearly 20
per cent.                                  -
   The apparatus as above described (or any apparatus of the
S. P.  £               “permeameter”* type) may therefore be
used for the accurate measurement of magnetic induction in
uniformly magnetized bars, the essential conditions being that
the contact surfaces are plane, that the upper bar can be
finely adjusted in position and very rigidly fixed, and that
the contact surfaces are as nearly as possible flush with
the ends of the magnetizing-coils, space being left for
the small guiding-ring on one of the bars. The lower bar
must also ' guided, and for this it is sufficient that its
lower end pass freely through a ring properly adjusted in
position.
   A few experiments were made with the half-cores separated
by very thin sheets of silver. Two sheets were used, of thick
nesses 1:5 and 8 hundredths millim. respectively, and it was
found that the introduction of a sheet always caused a diminu
tion of both magnetization and tractive force, greater with the
thicker sheet. No increase similar to that found by Wassmutht
at low inductions was observed.
   In conclusion, I wish to express my obligations to the
late Prof. Kundt and Drs. du Bois and Rubens for the
interest they took in my work, and the help they gave me
in various ways.

XXV. On the Influence of the Dimensions of a Body on the
    Thermal Emission from its Surface. By ALFRED W.
   PoRTER, B.Sc., Demonstrator of Physics, University
    College, London".
IN     discussing the rate at which heat passes outwards from a
       conducting body into the medium in which it is immersed,
it is usually assumed that (for small excesses of temperature of
the body above its surroundings) it may be taken as propor
tional to the excess of temperature. This law is followed, as
far as is known, if the body is in a vacuum and loses heat
simply by radiation between its own and surrounding surfaces.
If, however, it is immersed in a medium, such as air, which
carries away heat by conduction and convection as well as by
radiation, the problem becomes more complicated, and to
assume that the whole effect may be treated as radiation only
does not give results which are even an approximation to those
obtained experimentally. For example, on this assumption
the amount passing outwards from unit area of the surface per
second per unit excess of temperature (i.e. the “emissivity”)
should be independent of the size of the body. Results ob
tained by Péclet from experiments on cylinders and spheres
of different sizes show that this constant depends materiall
upon the sizes of the bodies experimented upon. Péclet's
formulae connecting the rate of emission (exclusive of the
radiation effect) with the radius (r) for 0° C. excess are:—

they are not given in any of the text-books of Physics. They

          Thermal Emission from the Surface of a Body.                  269
Professor Ayrton’s authority, in Everett's ‘Illustrations of the
C.G.S. System of Units’ (1891 edition, p. 133) ".
   Experiments on thin wires by Messrs. Ayrton and Kilgour
have confirmed the fact that the emissivity can be expressed
empirically through a considerable range of radius in the form
given by Péclet ; and experiments on rods which have been
in progress in this Laboratory since 1891, an account of which
was read by Mr. Eumorfopoulos before the Physical Society
on the same day as this paper, lead to the same conclusion.
    It was these that first called my attention to the subject;
and in order to account approximately for them and the
results elsewhere obtained, I propose here to examine the
results of supposing the loss to only in part follow the law of
radiation, the remainder being assumed to follow the law of
conduction.
    The rate of loss due to radiation will be proportional to the
excess of the temperature of the body above that of its
enclosure, and if we reckon temperatures from that of the
 enclosure, we may write the rate due to this cause
                                     h 6,
   * A mistake occurs in Everett as well as in a paper on the same
subject published later by Professor Ayrton and Mr.     '        in the Phil.
Trans. for 1892, in which Everett's statement is quoted. The formulae
are given in Box as
                        421+* for the cylinder
 and                            -    •

in which the units are the pound, foot, and hour, the radius being
however in inches.

                      Cylinder:   [*] x10",
                      sphere      oooooost".
   In Everett, and in Ayrton and Kilgour's paper, the latter appears as
                                         •000.3609

   Further, it is not clear from Everett whether the formula he gives refers
 to air-effect plus radiation or to one of these alone. The specification of
 “blackened sphere” would lead one to suppose that either the total effect
 or else the radiation only is meant, since the air-effect has been shown to
 be independent of the nature of the surface. On reference to Péclet, the
 formula is seen to represent the air-effect alone.

the surface of the body.
   The remainder, which is to include both true conductive
and also convective loss, will be proportional to the tem
perature-gradient in the medium close to the surface of the
body. It may on this assumption be represented by
                               -C

the bounding surface of the body, and c is a positive constant
which will be referred to as the convection-conductivity.
   The total rate of loss is hence
                                       d6

   The expression inside the brackets is the quantity called the
“emissivity” in the usual treatment of the problem. On the
above assumption, far from being a constant, it is seen to be a
thing whose value will vary with every modification of the
*:           by which it is sought to be determined.
    o fix ideas, take the case of a cylindrical rod or wire of
radius “a” heated uniformly at all points and maintained at
constant temperature by mechanism the nature of which is of
no consequence. Let it be surrounded by a coaxal cylindrical
sheath of radius R maintained at a constant temperature, which
will be taken as the zero of temperature, the intervening space
being filled with conducting or pseudo-conducting material.
The differential equation to be satisfied by the temperature in
the medium is

since with the above conditions everything is symmetrical with
regard to, and uniform parallel to, the axis of the cylinder;
and the solution of this which satisfies the boundary con
ditions is
                       _ a log R-log r.

   This, then, is presumably an approximation to a theoretic
formula for the case of experiments like those of Messrs.
Ayrton and Kilgour referred to before; and the accompanying
Table 1. and curves (fig. 1) (pp. 272 & 273) show how closely, by
a suitable choice of constants, it can represent the experimental
values. The constants I determined by the method of least
squares; this I considered it advisable to do, because the
experimental values are not sufficiently precise to enable one
to draw a smooth curve through them with anything like cer
tainty. In particular I may mention that their own empirical
formulae fail to fit in with the experimental values yielded by
the wire of radius 0037; and these values are similarly shunned
by the formulae which I give.
   The first term in each of my formulae should represent the
radiation-constant.         It must be noted, however, that for such
very thin wires radiation forms only a small portion of the
whole emission; and therefore, without having results of
greater accuracy from which to deduce the formulae, it is not
possible to assign the value of this term with definiteness. All
the values for it are, however, higher than those obtained by
observers who have experimented on the emission from
surfaces in vacuo, as the following data show :

  274       Mr. A. W. Porter on the Influence of the
    Péclet's results were derived from experiments on five
 cylinders : only two of them are available for my purpose,
 since the others were either of different material or different
 surface. They were short cylinders of unpolished brass,
 terminated by hemispherical ends, allowance for which was
 made from the experiments on spheres. Péclet, therefore,
 considered his results to apply to infinitely long cylinders.
 Their radii were 5:1 and 6.9 cm. respectively, and measure
 ments were made on them in a cylindrical enclosure 40 cm.
 radius and 100 cm. long. His results are:—

 and the formula which I derive from these is

              e = 0000383 +   a(logo.40-logo a)
    In large cylinders like these radiation plays a more con
 spicuous part, and the value of the first term in my formula
 which represents it is in very good accordance with values
obtained by direct methods. The value of “b” is, however,
very different from that obtained from Ayrton and Kilgour's
experiments; and the conclusion is forced upon one that
although to consider “h” a constant may serve as long as
the enclosure remains the same, it will by no means suffice
to take it the same constant under such widely different
conditions as obtain in these two sets of experiments. The
character of the convective flow is evidently totally different
in the two cases.
   The same conclusion is arrived at by an examination of
results obtained from experiments on spheres. The formula
for a sphere, found by means of the same assumption as
before, is
                                   cR
                        e=h-i- a(R—a).
   Péclet experimented on three spheres in the same enclosure;
and assuming the enclosure to behave like a spherical one of
45 centim. radius, the formula becomes

    It will be observed that the radiation-constant is practically
the same as that derived from his cylinder results”, while the
value of c is rather less.
    Experiments on spheres (both of 2 centim. radius) have
also been made by MacFarlanet and extended by Bottomleyt,
both using the same enclosure, which was of “large dimen
sions” (Bottomley).
    Extrapolation from Péclet's results for a sphere of 2 centim.
radius in his enclosure gives:—
           Using his formula.             Using formula given above.
                •000237.                             '000256
MacFarlane's results for a blackened sphere (Péclet's were dull)
give '000238 for 0° excess. Bottomley’s results give about
'000260 for 0° excess, showing that the formula derived from
Péclet's results is roughly applicable here.
    Bottomley also experimented on the same sphere in a
spherical enclosure of 5 centim. radius. If the formulae
hitherto given in this paper were applicable to this case, the
emissivity ought to increase with decrease of radius of en
closure. Bottomley's results show a marked decrease. The
value at 17° for 0° excess is not more than .00011 after
correcting approximately for temperature.
    Since the true radiation was determined separately it is
possible to find the value of “c” for these experiments,
   * Péclet endeavoured to estimate the radiation independently by means
of a thermopile, and deducted it from the total emission to obtain the air
effect. The value he obtained was only 0000072 for 0° excess, a value
so much smaller than received values that I have ignored it entirely, and
dealt only with the total effect.

  In order to throw light on this question, I have started
experiments, in conjunction with Mr. Eumorfopoulos, on
cylindrical rods in cylindrical enclosures of different radii.
Experiments made so far are as follows:—
   A brass rod 483 centim. radius has soldered on it two
thermoelectric junctions of iron and german-silver at a dis
tance apart of 10 centim, each of which is part of a couple
whose other junction is kept cold in a water-pot. The rod is
heated at one end by steam until the steady state of tempera
ture is attained, and the ratio of the temperatures (reckoning
from enclosure temperature as zero) of the two junctions is
measured successively with different water-jackets embracing
the rod.
   The general arrangement is shown in fig. 2 (p. 277).
Tap-water is passed through the water-jacket at such a rate
that its temperature as it enters is sensibly the same as when
it leaves the jacket. This temperature is read by a ther
mometer, as also are the temperatures of the cold junctions.
Then either the junction at A and its corresponding cold junc
tion, or the junction at B and its corresponding cold junction,
can be connected to a potentiometer, and the thermoelectric
E.M.F. in each case determined.
   The potentiometer was standardized from time to time by a
Clark’s cell which is so connected (switches not shown) that
the same galvanometer does for all three operations.

     The ratio of the thermoelectric E.M.F.'s is approximately
 the same as the ratio of the excess temperatures of the points

 ascertained by standardizing the thermoelectric couples in

must be considered therefore as merely provisional. Take the

         Dimensions of a Body on its Thermal Emission. 279
:047 x 10-*. As their thin wires blocked up the enclosure
less than the thick rod here employed, it is natural that the
value obtained from them £ be greater than that given
above.
   The formula which I have given for a cylinder appears to hold
through a far wider range than that given by Messrs. Ayrton
and Kilgour. Take for example their formula for a wire
at 100°. The emissivity for it can never (for any radius) fall
lower than
                               •00107.
Calculating from my formula we get
                                •00036
for a rod of 483 centim. radius at 100°.         On reduction to
60° it becomes about
                               .00025,
which is much more within sight of the value 000154 which
is obtained from fig. 3. Considering the violent nature of the
extrapolation here made, the agreement is probably as close as
could reasonably be expected.
                             Conclusions.
   i. That the theoretic assumption made in this paper gives
results which are accordant through a wide range of radius of
rod with experimental results obtained under similar con
ditions as regards enclosure: and in this respect is far
superior to the usual assumption which gives no account
whatever of variation of the value of emissivity with radius.
   ii. That if the freedom permitted to convection effects be
varied, as it will be if the enclosure be changed, it is necessary
to consider the convecto-conduction constant as varying with
the changed conditions according to a law which can only be
found by a complete series of experiments made with en
closures of different dimensions.
   iii. I conclude that the enclosing boundary is as important
a factor in determining the value of the emissivity as the size
of the body itself: and that therefore in any collection of
data (such as Everett's) it is very necessary to specify the
exact nature of the enclosure in which the experiments
were conducted; and, further, that all determinations that
have been made of this constant and published with imperfect
description of all the boundaries are of little scientific value.
   Finally, I must express my thanks to Prof. G. C. Foster
for kindly advice and suggestions given from time to time in
connexion with this matter.

XXVI. On the Determination of Thermal Conductivity and

   in Physics, University College, London*.
IF a long metallic bar of uniform cross-section be heated at
      one end, and be left long enough to acquire a steady
state, the distribution of temperature along it is usually
expressed by                             hp
                         u. = uoe"YKs,
where u, is the excess of temperature over surroundings of a
            point on the bar at a distance r from the point
            whose excess of temperature is wo, a being mea
            sured positively along the direction of decreasing
            temperatures;
        h and k are the emissivity and conductivity re
            spectively;
        p is the periphery of the bar, and s the cross-section.
If the bar be of circular cross-section and r its radius, the
above expression reduces to
                                          2h.

 laboratory exercise, to undertake the verification of this

    The method adopted was to heat the ends of two such rods
 in steam until they had acquired the steady state, and then
 by means of two thermoelectric joints (one on each rod) to
 find a series of isothermal points.

   In order to test the trustworthiness of the method employed,
one of the above rods was heated in the middle under the

used as the source of heat, in order to have a greater range of

also in these, no screens were employed, a sheltered part of

   It must be pointed out, however, that with the Bunsen
burner the parts of the rod nearest the flame become visibly
oxidized, this being especially noticeable in the case of the
thicker rod-so much so that the increased emissivity so
obtained can apparently overcome the greater transmission of
heat of the thicker rod. Thus, with the above brass rods,
5 cm. on the thinner rod were found equivalent in this region
to 5.2 cm. on the thicker; and after the heating had con
tinued for some time 3.7 cm. on the thicker rod balanced
5 cm. on the thinner one. The ratio given above, '63, is for
parts of the rods that were not oxidized, and did not become.
so after several days’ heating.

   It will be seen that in every case the rate of fall of
temperature along the thinner of the various pairs of rods
compared is more rapid than would be inferred according to
the usual formula from the distribution of temperature
observed along the thicker rod. Consequently this formula
cannot be legitimately used for the comparison of con
ductivities, unless the radii of the rods compared are equal
and their surfaces in the same condition.
   The only way of escaping from this conclusion is by
 supposing that the thermal conductivity of the smaller of
each pair of rods was less than that of the thicker one.
 Although it seemed very unlikely that this should be so
in the case of every pair, it could not be regarded as im
possible. To settle the matter, it was decided to determine
the absolute conductivity of at least one pair of rods.
   For this purpose Angström's method was adopted, in which
one end of the rod is alternately heated and cooled, and
the alternations of temperature observed at two points
along the rod. Fig. 1 is a diagram of the apparatus used.
CD is the rod, passing into a glass tube E, through which
cold water or steam can be passed as desired.            E is held
up by a clamp, and F is a clamp supporting the rod at the
other end, no other clamps being used for the rod. S1, S2, S3,
S, are brown-paper screens, about 2 ft. high, resting on the
table and open at the top ; S3 is about 1 ft. wide. A and B
are the two points whose temperatures have to be measured.
This was done by fine iron wires passing over the rod at the
required point, and held down by suitable weights. The wires
pass to a key K, through the galvanometer G, to a vessel H
containing cold water. H contains the other junction, and a
thermometer T.      A brass wire connects D to H.           T2 is a
thermometer reading the temperature of the air. Both ther
mometers were divided into fifths and read by a telescope.
   As it was not possible to keep the temperature of the air
constant, allowance had to be made for the change. As the

              of Thermal Conductivity and Emissivity.            285
temperature required is the excess of temperature of the rod
over the air, this was done by merely subtracting         the tem
perature of the air at the given moment from that of the rod
at the same moment.

    Experiment showed that it was possible to move the iron
wire on the rod, and replace it, and obtain the same reading
as previously; thus showing that the resistance of the joint
did not appreciably alter. As the galvanometer was made
somewhat sensitive, its sensitiveness was tested during the
experiments by a Daniell cell passing through a large resist
ance (about 13,000 ohms), the E.M.F. of the Daniell being
compared with that of a Clark cell. Zero readings were also
taken between each deflexion. The readings of the galvano
meter were afterwards standardized, a known difference of
temperature being produced between the two junctions, and
the deflexions observed. The following table gives an example
of a standardization :

   The constants a, b1, 81, &c. are determined by the method
of least squares from the observations made.
   If a, b, 8, &c. and a', b,', 81', &c. are the constants for the
two points A and B respectively, and c the distance between
them, then
                   b = b/e" and 8–8 = q.c
(see Ann. Chim. Phys. lxvii., 1863).
   Hence g and q can be determined, and

   Hence k and h can be determined from each sine term.         In
the experiments as carried out only the first, and perhaps the
third, sine terms are available for these determinations, as the
others are very small, the even terms being especially so.
Besides these, there is the “a” term of the above formula (the
constant term of the Fourier series), which is large, and repre
sents the mean excess of temperature of the rod. From this
term we get
                                        2h.

to later on.
   The rods experimented upon were three brass rods (com
mercial specimens) of roughly $, 3, and $ in. diameter; their
lengths were about 3, 5, and 6 ft. respectively. They were
cleaned, but not polished. The time-period of the alternations,
and the positions of A and B, were chosen so that the cycle of
changes gone through should be as nearly as possible the same
in the three cases.
   The specific heat was determined by heating a portion of

    288         Mr. N. Eumorfopoulos on the Determination
       The mean result 0945 was assumed for all the rods.                           No
   correction was made for change of specific heat with tem
     erature.

290         Mr. N. Eumorfopoulos on the Determination
   As an example of the curve of temperatures obtained, see
fig. 3. At the abscissa marked 0 min. cold water was turned
on, and at 15 min. steam. The points marked are experi
mental points. There are no points marked at 0 and 15 min.
as I had to be in another part of the room at those instants.
It will be noticed that the cold water or the steam (as the case
may be) has done nearly all it can do, before the other is
turned on, especially in the case of A. This can also be seen
from the numbers given below.
   The following are the details for each rod:—
   Rod I. ($ inch).—Diam. = 3377 cm. Density=849.

      It hence appears that the emissivity of a body depends to a
   large extent on the form and dimensions of that body, and
   that the formula for conduction of heat along a rod, as usually
   given in text-books, can only be used in a very restricted
   SenSe.
      It will be noticed that the two emissivities (deduced from the
   “a” term and the sine term) are to one another approximately
   as 1 to 1:2. The ratio appears to be too uniform to be due to
   accidental error of experiment, but the meaning of the two
   values is not quite clear. In order to obtain further informa
   tion, the # inch rod was heated at one end by steam under
   approximately the same conditions as before, and the E.M.F.
   of a german-silver-iron couple at different points on the rod
   determined by the compensation method in the ordinary way.
   A preliminary set was taken, which gave about the same
   results as the following more accurate set (readings were
   taken going down the rod and then going up):—

    The mean temperature of the rod in the experiments by
   ngström’s method was about 27°, and the two emissivities
 found were 000207 and 000242, so that the steady-state
 emissivity comes just about halfway between the two. The
 rod, however, had become somewhat tarnished during the
 summer, and had to be cleaned again, which may or may not
 have made some difference. Further experiments will be
 needed to settle the point conclusively.
    When the last part of the experiments was in progress,
 Mr. A. W. Porter, B.Sc., drew my attention to Messrs. Ayrton
 and Kilgour's paper before the Royal Society on the variation
 of emissivity with the diameter of the wires experimented
 upon. The results obtained corroborate one another, and also
 corroborate results that had been obtained some time ago by
 Péclet, and which are recorded in his Traité de la Chaleur.
 Péclet appears to have carried out a large number of experi
 ments on emissivity, the best account of which is found in the
 3rd edition (not the 4th) in vol. i. and a long note at the end
 of vol. iii. (published in 1860–61).
     In conclusion I must express my obligations to Prof.
 Foster and Mr. Porter for much help given in the course of
 these experiments.

      XXVII. The Clark Cell when Producing a Current.
          To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine,
    GENTLEMEN,
IN     the Philosophical Magazine for September 1894 is a
      paper by Mr. S. Skinner on “The Clark Cell when Pro
ducing a Current.” This paper appears to call for one or two
remarks from me. Mr. Skinner says (p. 272):—“Let a cell of
electromotive force E and internal resistance R have its poles
joined by a wire of resistance r , then, providing R and r are
constant, and there is no polarization, the potential-difference
between the poles will be     1:      If, however, there is po
                                                      7"e
larization, then this potential-difference will be R+ ,, where
e is the value of the electromotive force required to produce
the observed current.”
    The value of – (E-e) is the “electromotive force of polari
zation.” This quantity is studied by Mr. Skinner, and its
evaluation of course involves measurements of R and r.
With regard to r, which appears to have been taken from a
 box for values down to 200 legal ohms, and for 147 legal ohms
from a german-silver coil in a bath of paraffin oil, we are not
given very much information. I would ask, however, whether
in the light of Mr. Griffiths' experience (Phil. Trans. A.
 1893, p. 401), it is safe to assume that the resistance of a coil
 mounted as described, and carrying a current, can be suffi
 ciently ascertained by tests made with only a testing-current.
No one ought to be more alive to this than Mr. Skinner, so
that I will assume his value of r to have been sufficiently
known. With regard to “R,” however, the case is different.
 Its value was measured by Professor Macgregor's method
 (Trans. Roy. Soc. Canada, iii. 1882, p. 22, referred to as
“ by means of the commutator used by Mr. T. C. Fitz
patrick”), in which alternating intermittent currents are fed
 into a Wheatstone bridge, and commutated for the benefit
 of a galvanometer. The measurements were not made while
 the cell under examination was yielding a current for polari
 zation observations: consequently the value assigned to
 –(E-e) rests on the assumption that the resistance of the
 cell, while yielding a considerable current (.01 ampere) for
 polarization experiments, was the same as the resistance it
 exhibited while under test by alternating and intermittent
 currents. This assumption I consider to be wholly illegiti
 mate, and to vitiate every     £"2
                                      given by Mr. Skinner for

296        The Clark Cell when Producing a Current.
the value of -(E-e). In the present state of our informa
tion we are not entitled to make any assumption whatever on
this question.
   On page 277 Mr. Skinner gives a curve showing the
behaviour of a Clark cell when continuously short-circuited
so as to yield about .01 ampere. The drop of P.D. is shown
in this curve to increase continuously. From this it appears
to be inferred (conclusion “b”, page 278) that “the electro
motive force of polarization slowly increases when the current
is maintained;” and further on (page 279) Mr. Skinner says:—
“In the experiments of Threlfall the sign of the term de
pending on time was found to be negative. In some of my
earlier experiments it appeared to be negative, but this was
traced to irregularity in the working of the compensator; and
the effect has always been positive since the Clark cells have
been used in the place of the Leclanché.”
   Now Mr. Pollock and I specially guarded ourselves in the
paper referred to from any statement whatever as to the
“electromotive force of polarization,” having the fear of
Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ayrton very properly before
our eyes. Secondly, we fortunately have all our notes intact,
and find that we kept a much better watch on the compen
sator than Mr. Skinner appears to have done; and there is
no doubt whatever that, in the case we examined, the P.D.
drop diminished with time, and this was to be explained
neither by change of compensator nor by heating of short
circuiting resistance. We cannot ask the Editors to afford
space for the voluminous numerical evidence to exhibit this
rather unimportant fact; but we satisfied ourselves on this
point in 1888, and since Mr. Skinner’s paper appeared have
gone into the matter again and find it to be as we stated in
our paper. As a matter of fact our cells were not made up
quite in the same way as Mr. Skinner’s, and the zincs were
wrapped in parchment-paper, the resistance of which may,
not improbably, have varied considerably. In instituting his
comparison Mr. Skinner apparently overlooked this point,
and this leads me to think that he did not refer to our paper
very carefully, though probably as carefully as it deserved.
We are the more inclined to this view from the statement
appearing in §8, “Conclusion,” page 278, that “From the
magnitudes of the quantities found in these experiments, it
follows that small currents of approximately known value
can be obtained by the use of large Clark cells of small
internal resistance, which may be neglected in comparison
with the large external resistance.” Seeing that the primary
 object of our work was to discover whether such a proposition
                                ---

                 On Rapid Electrical Oscillations.           297
is true or not, that the greater part of our paper is taken up
by a discussion as to the limits within which this proposition
is true, that our results (much more numerous than Mr.
Skinner's) are illustrated by two sheets of curves (plates xii.
& xiii.), and, finally, that a method of determining high
specific resistances based on this property of Clark cells has
been in use almost daily in our laboratory since the paper
was written in 1888, and was described by us (Phil. Mag.
1889, vol. xxviii. p. 470)—considering all this, I say that
Mr. Skinner's unconditioned statement of his conclusion
appears to me to be somewhat inadequate.
    There is yet another point. On page 273, and referring
to the measurement of the resistance of his cells, Mr. Skinner
says:—“However, following Mr. Fitzpatrick’s method, tests
were specially made for polarization by varying the ratio of
the arms and by varying the speed of the commutator.” So
far as varying the speed of the commutator goes, this method
was described to all intents and purposes by Kohlrausch in
 Pogg. Ann., Jubelband, p. 290, in Wiedemann's Electricität,
 vol. i. p. 476, and, I think, in Professor Chrystal’s article in
 the Encyclopaedia Britannica. It is therefore a mistake to
 ascribe it to Mr. Fitzpatrick.

    GENTLEMEN,
 Ta' have been various estimations of the above quan
        tity, but the results resting upon experimental data are
 few. A late paper by Ignaz Klemencic in Wied. Ann. der
 Physik und Chemie, No. 12, 1894, contains the following
 values of the permeability in case of oscillations of 1,000,000
 per second:–
               Soft iron   .  .   .  .  u=118,
               Steel    .  .   .  .  .   u = 106 to 115.
    In a paper in the Philosophical Magazine for November
 1894, on “Wave-Lengths of Electricity on Iron Wires,” I

298                     Professor Dewar on the
obtained as a bye-result the average approximate value
                                 Au =385.
A recalculation of this value, however, shows an arithmetical
error, which multiplies the value by 4, so that the true ap
proximate value yielded by the data is u =96, ranging between
the values 107 and 83.5, the extremes of the three values.
These are lower than the results given by Klemencic, but in
my experiments the rate of oscillation was much higher.
    In this connexion it is interesting to note that Mr. Oliver
 Heaviside, in his ‘Electrical Papers, vol. i. p. 361, “Waves
of Magnetic Force,” remarks that u is eminently variable,
but that a fair average value is u= 100. This assumption
 seems confirmed both from Klemencic’s results and my own.
                           I am, Gentlemen,                 -

               XXIX. On the Liquefaction of Gases.
                          By Prof. J. DEwAR".
IN      the Philosophical Magazine for last month Professor
       Olszewski has made serious allegations regarding my
relations to his alleged discoveries. # is usually assumed
that if a scientific man has a grievance on some question of
priority, he speaks out boldly at or about the time when
his discovery is being appropriated. It seems, however, that
Professor Olszewski prefers to nurse his complaints for four
years and then to bring them out simultaneously in two
English scientific journals. The result, I am afraid, will be
grievously disappointing. Personally I am delighted to see
an English edition of Professor Olszewski’s papers. There
is, however, one serious omission which I trust the Editors
of the Philosophical Magazine may remove before long. We
want in this country a reprint of the splendid papers of
the late Professor Wroblewski.          Until this is done it will be
impossible for the scientific public to decide on many of
Professor Olszewski's claims for priority. Now let me turn
to the Professor's treatment of myself. The following are
the deliberate statements made by him in his paper “On the
Liquefaction of Gases,” Philosophical Magazine, February
1895 :—
                   * Communicated by the Author.
                                      / ;

                       Liquefaction of Gases.                 299
    “But in his last experiments and lectures respecting the
 liquefaction of considerable quantities of oxygen and air and
 their employment as cooling agents, Professor Dewar has
 thought fit not to make any mention of my labours in the
 same field, which had been published several years before
 Professor Dewar went over them again. In the number for
 June 1890 of the Bulletin International de l'Académie de
 Cracovie, I have described an apparatus serving to liquefy a
 greater quantity of oxygen or air in a steel cylinder, from
 which it can be poured out into an open glass vessel, and used
 as a frigorific agent. It is entitled ‘K. Olszewski. Transvase
 ment de l'oxygène liquide;’ and a brief report on the subject
 is contained in the Belblåtter of Wiedemann, vol xv. p. 29,
 under the title ‘K. Olszewski.          Ueber das Giessen des
 flüssigen Sauerstoffs. That my labours should have thus
been passed over in silence is all the more astonishing,
 because as soon as the above-mentioned Bulletin was printed
I sent a proof of it to Professor Dewar; I also forwarded
him proofs of my other researches, knowing that they interest
him.”. . . .
   “From this summary of researches, as well as of dates, it
follows that the first apparatus serving to produce large
quantities of the liquefied so-called permanent gases, with
the solitary exception of hydrogen, was constructed by me.
This apparatus can be enlarged at will by increasing its parts,
but without changing anything in its construction, so that it
might be used to obtain liquefied gases in factories should
they at any time prove of practical utility. By means of this
apparatus I obtained as large quantities of liquid gases as
I wanted; and they were used for the first time on a large
scale as cooling agents (for instance, in my attempts to liquefy
hydrogen), or as an object of scientific researches (the absorp
tion spectrum of liquefied oxygen, its coefficient of refraction,
&c.).
   “The experiments of Professor Dewar are merely the
repetition and confirmation of these researches, most of which
were published several years before his corresponding investi
gations. His work is really original only as to the magnetic
properties of liquid oxygen : that which is not borrowed from
my researches is a development of ideas struck out by another
—as, for instance, the experiments on electrical resistance at
low temperatures, which were begun by Clausius, continued
by Cailletet and Bouty, and brought ten years ago by my
former fellow-worker, the late Professor Wroblewski, to the
temperature of the freezing-point of nitrogen, then several
degrees below the temperature attained in the experiments of

300       Professor Dewar on the Liquefaction of Gases.
Messrs. Dewar and Fleming, who, it is true, extended their
examination to various metals, alloys, and non-metals. But
the execution of these labours meets with no difficulty; for
the method of getting large quantities of liquefied gases is
now generally known.”
   Let us see what Professor Olszewski said in that paper
entitled “Transvasement de l'oxygène liquide,” June 1890.
    “A flask of wrought iron, 5 litres in capacity (such as is
used to hold liquid carbon dioxide), containing oxygen under
a pressure of 80 atm., is joined by a narrow copper tube to
the upper end of a steel cylinder tested at a pressure of
 200 atm. This cylinder, having a capacity of 30–100 cubic
 centim., according to the quantity of oxygen which we wish
 to liquefy at a time, is immersed in liquid ethylene, of which
 the temperature may easily be lowered to –140°C. by means
 of an air-pump. The lower end of the cylinder is joined by
 a narrow copper tube to a little stopcock, through which the
 oxygen, liquefied in the cylinder, can be poured down into
 an open glass vessel kept cool by the surrounding air.”
    In other words, replace the glass tube in my apparatus of
 1884 by a small steel cylinder and attach to its lower end a
 narrow copper tube with a stopcock, and the Olszewski appa
 ratus of 1890 would result.     As a matter of fact Pictet had used
 the same principle in the year 1878, and to take credit for
 originality in repeating his device seems a little absurd. Now
 on the 11th of June, 1886, I delivered a lecture on “Recent
 Researches on Meteorites,” and the report in the ‘Proceedings
 of the Royal Institution’ contains a sectional drawing of an
 apparatus (reproduced on the other page) solely constructed
 of copper, together with a valve for drawing off liquid oxygen,
 entirely different in type from the plan Olszewski adopted in
 1890. I may mention that the plan of the apparatus was repro
 duced immediately after the delivery of the lecture both in
 England and America. The section is confined to the refrige
 rator, all the accessories of liquefied and compressed gas-bottles,
 compression and exhaust gauges, &c. having been omitted.
 From this plan of the refrigerator, any person so desiring
 could increase its capacity so as to work on a larger scale. The
drawing shows the apparatus arranged for the special ex
 periment of ejecting liquid oxygen into a vacuum-chamber,
but it is clear the apparatus discharged more easily into an
ordinary open vessel. It is the form of apparatus that is
 in dispute, not the result of any particular experiment. The
 special object for which it was in use in this lecture was
 to cool a piece of Meteorite before insertion into an Electric

  302                   Professor Dewar on the
  Furnace. The following extract from the lecture will explain
  how the subject was introduced:—
     “Meteorites, no doubt, have an exceedingly low tempera
  ture before they enter the earth's atmosphere, and the ques
  tion had been raised as to what chemical reactions could take
  place under such conditions. It resulted from Professor
  Dewar's investigations that at a temperature of about
   -130° C. liquid oxygen had no chemical action upon
  hydrogen, potassium, sodium, phosphorus, hydriodic acid,
  or sulphydric acid. It would appear, therefore, that as the
  absolute zero is approached even the strongest chemical
  affinities are inactive.
     “The lecturer exhibited at work the apparatus by which he
 had recently succeeded in solidifying oxygen”. The apparatus
 is illustrated in the accompanying diagram [p. 301], where a
 copper tube is seen passing through a vessel kept constantly
 full of ether and solid carbonic acid; ethylene is sent through
 this tube, and is liquefied by the intense cold; it is then con
 veyed by the tube, through an indiarubber stopper, into the
 lower vessel; the outer one is filled with ether and solid
 carbonic acid. A continuous copper tube about 45 feet long,
 conveying oxygen, passes through the outer vessel, and then
 through that containing the liquid ethylene; the latter
 evaporates through the space between the two vessels, and
 thus intense cold is produced, whereby oxygen is liquefied in
 the tube to the extent occasionally of 22 cubic centimetres at
 one time. The temperature at which this is effected is about
 -130°C., at a pressure of 75 atmospheres, but less pressure
 will suffice. When the oxygen is known to be liquid, by
 means of a gauge near the oxygen inlet, the valve A is
 opened, and £       £       oxygen rushes into a vacuum in the
 central glass tube below ; some liquid ethylene at the bottom
of the next tube, outwards, is also caused to evaporate into a
vacuum at the same moment, and instantly some of the liquid
oxygen in the central tube becomes solid, owing to the intense
cold of the double evaporation. The outer glass vessel serves
to keep moisture from settling on the sides of the ethylene
tube. By means of the electric lantern and a lens, an image
of this part of the apparatus was projected upon the screen,
this being the first time that the experiment had been shown
on a large scale in public.
    “Performing this experiment the temperature reached was
a little below 200°C., that is only 50° or 70° above the
   * The white material taken for solid oxygen in 1886 was due to gaseous
impurity.

                       Liquefaction of Gases.               303
absolute zero of temperature, and in the experiment about
5 lbs. of solid ethylene were employed.”
   This I declare to be the first apparatus (Pictet's excluded)
made wholly of metal, being an arrangement of copper coils in
which liquid oxygen was made and decanted or transferred
from the vessel in which it was liquefied to another by means
of a valve and thereby rendered of use as a cooling agent. In
support of this assertion I call as a witness Professor Charles
Olszewski himself, who states in the Philosophical Magazine,
February 1895, p. 189:-—“In 1883, and for several years
following, I liquefied the gases in a strong glass tube.” There
is no suggestion made that a steel cylinder and valve was
used by Olszewski till the year 1890, whereas four years
in advance I had used a much safer and better form of
apparatus. Have I ever suggested that Professor Olszewski
was anticipated, or attempted to raise any question of priority?
   With regard to another case of priority that is claimed, I
find that MM. Charles Olszewski and Auguste Witkowski,
Membres Correspondants, présentent leur mémoire “Pro
priétés optiques de l'oxygène liquide,” on the 3rd of October
1892, and, on referring to the paper, it is dated the 15th
July 1892, and the following footnote is added:–
   “Avant la publication denotre communication MM. Liveing
et Dewar ont fait connaitre (Phil. Mag, août 1892) les
résultats de leurs recherches sur la réfraction des gaz
liquéfiés.”
   But Professor Olszewski is not satisfied by a reference to
published papers, he includes unpublished ones as well, in
order to include the study of chemical action at low tempera
tures as having been originated by him.           The following
extracts from a well-known Continental Journal of what I
had done in 1885 may induce him to produce his priority
claim in a definite shape. . I challenge him to produce any
reference to antecedent work in this subject.

  dissolvant de l’ozone est un mélange de tétrafluoride de
 silicum et de pétrole de Russie. Ces solutions d'ozone sont
 sans action sur le mercure ou l'argent métalliques.”
     Prof. Olszewski says:—“The experiments of Prof. Dewar
 are merely the repetition and confirmation of these researches.”
 Reviewing the work I have been engaged upon during
the last few years, either by myself or in consort with
 Profs. Liveing or Fleming, the following subjects have been
taken in hand and so far developed with regard to the pro
 perties of matter at low temperatures :
    Construction of Apparatus for the production of Liquid
Air and other Gases in quantity—High Vacua—Vacuum
Wessels for Storage and Manipulation of Liquid Gases—
Cooling by Sponge of Liquid Air-Solid Air–Radiation at
Low Temperatures—Thermal Transparency—Refractive In
dices—Spectroscopy—Electric Conductivity—Thermo-Elec
tric Properties—Latent and Specific Heats—Capillarity—
Chemical Action—Magnetic Properties—Breaking-Stress of
Metals—Solid Matter and Argon in Liquid Air-Phosphor
escence and Photographic Action-Liquefaction of Hydrogen,
&c. With the exception of the determination of the refrac
tive indices of liquid oxygen my work has had nothing in
common with that of Prof. Olszewski.
    Now Prof. Olszewski says he has anticipated all this
pioneering work. On referring to his list of papers given in
the Philosophical Magazine for last month, I find that since
the year 1890 he has confined his attention to the refractive
indices of liquid oxygen and an attempt to corroborate
Wroblewski’s determination of the         critical  constants of

                   Motices respecting New Books.                   305
hydrogen. No one knows better than myself that the fringe
of the subject only is touched. When the investigator has
the means of examining the general properties of matter
under new conditions, surely in our time he does not claim
originality for the selection of the order in which he attacks
the many problems ready to hand? The fact is the claims
 set forward by Prof. Olszewski are fantastic and unfounded.
   Professor Olszewski has done good work in the deter
mination of the pressure and temperature relations of the
liquid gases, but in future it is to be hoped he will modify
his claim for general priority in everything relating to Low
Temperature Research.

              XXX. Notices respecting New Books.
Select Methods in Chemical Analysis (chiefly Inorganic).            By
   WILLIAM CROOKES, F.R.S. &c.          3rd edition, rewritten and
   enlarged. (London: Longmans, Green, & Co., 1894.)
    HE subject of chemical analysis is capable of being regarded
      from two points of view—first as a means of training students
in exactness of work, neatness, cleanliness, carefulness, and so forth,
and in the next place as a practical branch of science which the
working chemist is constantly obliged to resort to in order to
ascertain the composition of some kind of matter. This book by
Mr. Crookes, which has now reached its third edition, appeals to
the latter rather than to the former class of readers.      It has in
fact from the time of its appearance occupied a unique position
among kindred works, and the new edition will be welcomed by
working chemists with the same gratitude that its predecessors
were received with when the author first enriched our chemical
literature with a compilation of such real practical value. In
speaking of the work as a compilation, we have no desire to detract
from its merits. To expect the author of a book on chemical
analysis to originate all the processes described would be simply
absurd, but, although confessedly a compilation, there is one
feature that lifts the present work quite above the level of
such productions. A quotation from the preface will explain our
statement:—
   “The author has merely given such methods as have been proved
in his own laboratory. Others—possibly no less efficient—have
been passed over because he cannot vouch personally for their
value. A main object has been to bring into notice a number of
little-known expedients and precautions which prevent mistakes,
insure accuracy, or economise time.”
   The user of this book therefore may rest assured that all the

 306                Notices respecting New Books.
 processes described have received the approval of one of the most
 skilful masters of chemical analysis in this country.
    Taking it for granted that the work has, by virtue of its merits,
 established for itself such a position that any further commendation
 on the part of a reviewer would be superfluous, we have only to
 point out now wherein the present edition differs from the former
 one which was published eight years ago. In order to justify the
 title of the work and to keep to its spirit, many of the older and
 now well-known methods of estimation have been omitted.            In
 fact, these methods have passed from the “select” stage, and,
 having undergone the test of experience, are now embodied in all
 works on analysis, so that the working chemist may be assumed to
 know all about them or (what comes to the same thing) where to
 find them when wanted.       Other processes have, we are told, been
left out for the opposite reason—because they have not stood the
 ordeal of experience, but have been supplanted by better ones.
The ordinary volumetric processes have also been omitted be
cause there are special works, such as that by Sutton, dealing
with this subject. Only in certain cases are titration methods
described, and then because of their selectness.         For a similar
reason the ordinary pyrological methods of analysis no longer find
place in the volume, but the reader is referred to special treatises
on assaying, of which there are several well-known ones.
   The effect of all this expurgation, however, has not been to
diminish the size of the book, because a large amount of new matter
has been added, partly in the form of new processes which have
been discovered since the last edition, but more particularly in the
form of descriptions of the electrolytic methods of estimating
metals, which have been so thoroughly worked out of late by
Dr. Classen. This part of the work, which will be found parti
cularly useful to English chemists, confessedly owes its origin to
Classen's book, many of the illustrations of apparatus having been
taken from this source. Altogether the volume extends with its
index to 718 pages, and is divided into sixteen chapters. Of these
the first deals with the alkaline metals; the second with the alkaline
earths; the third with the rare earths (on which the author is the
chief living authority); the fourth with chromium, vanadium,
uranium, tungsten, and molybdenum; the fifth with zinc, aluminium,
gallium, and iron; the sixth with manganese, nickel, and cobalt; the
seventh with silver, mercury, and copper; the eighth with cadmium,
gallium, lead, thallium, indium, bismuth; the ninth with antimony,
tin, arsenic, selenium, and tellurium; the tenth with gold and the
platinum metals; the eleventh with sulphur, phosphorus, and
nitrogen; the twelfth with the halogens and cyanogen; and the
thirteenth with carbon, silicon, and boron. In the fourteenth chapter
the electrolytic method and certain special methods of gas-analysis
are described. Chapter xv. is devoted to certain miscellaneous
processes and what in laboratory terms would be called “practical
dodges.” The concluding chapter contains sets of useful tables.

    The general scope of the work will be inferred from the fore
going account of its contents. The classification of the elements
may appear somewhat arbitrary, but there are good analytical
reasons for adopting this arrangement. The details of description
have all the lucidity and exactness which we are accustomed to
find in Mr. Crookes' writings. Although nearly a quarter of a
century has elapsed since the appearance of the first edition, there
is no falling off in power of treatment anywhere manifest in the
pages of the present volume, the completion of which is a matter
of congratulation both for the veteran author and the chemical
world.
A Few Chapters in Astronomy. By CLAUDIUs KENNEDY, M.A.
    (Crown 8vo, 150 pp., 40 illustrations. London: Taylor & Francis,
    1894.)
THE idea of this book is a very good one. Its object is to elucidate
more fully certain points which are merely touched on or only
 imperfectly explained in works on Astronomy and Mechanics. In
 the first Chapter we have an explanation of an optical illusion which
 is frequently noticed, even by casual observers, but of which the
 reason is not generally understood. This is the fact that a line

 Moon does not seem to pass through the Sun, as of course it really
 does, but some distance above it.    A similar illusion is seen in the
 apparent downward curvature of meteor-tracks, and the apparent
 curvature (in some cases) of a comet's tail when very long, as in
 the Great Comet of 1882. The second Chapter deals with the
 effect of the Earth's rotation on moving bodies, such as bodies
 falling from a height, the flight of migrating birds, &c. The third
 Chapter explains the effect of the Earth's rotation on projectiles.
 The subject is very fully worked out, and in a very interesting
 manner. In Chapter IV. an explanation is given of the principle
 of Foucault's pendulum, a subject which is not sufficiently explained
 in ordinary text-books on Astronomy, especially with reference to
 places between the equator and the poles. Chapter V. contains an
 investigation of the position of high tide considered on dynamical
  principles—a subject which is very imperfectly dealt with in most
 works on Astronomy. In Chapter VI. we have a description of
 various forms of the “Horizontal Pendulum,” an instrument which
 is not generally known, and which was devised for the purpose of
  detecting by direct observation the Moon's differential tidal force.
  Although sound in theory, this instrument does not seem to be
  capable of giving any definite results in practice; for, as Mr. Ken
  nedy says, “in most cases, at least, a gentle breeze pressing on the
  side of a house would make the whole basement floor tilt to leeward
 through an angle considerably greater than the greatest change in the
  vertical by the Moon's tidal force.”
     Chapters VII. and VIII. deal with the Moon's Wariation and

 308           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 Parallactic Equality, subjects which are not sufficiently developed
 in Astronomical treatises. The author clearly explains some points
 in these lunar irregularities which the student may find a diffi
 culty in thoroughly understanding, and clears up some apparent
 paradoxes with which the subject is beset.
    On the whole, this little work will be found of great assistance
 to students of mathematical astronomy, and we can strongly
 recommend it to their attention.                        J. E. GoRE.

            AN EXPERIMENT WITH SOLID CARBONIC ACID.
                          BY PROF. K. PRYTZ.
 IN'D          by the interesting account by Prof. Bleekrode (Phil.
       Mag. xxxviii. pp. 81–89, 1894) of his experiments with solid
carbonic acid, I wish to describe an experiment which I have made.
A quantity of solid carbonic acid being compressed in a wooden
 cylinder, I cut the block of the substance in pieces small enough
to be put into a stout glass tube r 1.5 centim. wide.
When the tube was filled with the pieces of carbonic
 acid,
 cock hit being
           was connected
                open. On with     a manometer
                            closing                  the /
                                     the cock theM,index    t   no
                                                                   M
 of the manometer rises slowly until the pressure is
as much as 5 atm. The index then stands completely
still for a tolerably long time; at the same time we
see pieces of carbonic acid sink down on melting:
only when the whole is melted, and consequently            |
fills the bottom of the tube, does the index suddenly
rise again, and now much faster than before.                  7
   When the index has reached 10 atm. the cock is
opened a little: the melted carbonic acid then
evaporates quickly, the pressure diminishes, the index
goes back to 5 atm. : there it suddenly stops again,
and is stationary until the carbonic acid is again
solid, whereupon it slowly goes back to 1 atm.
   The experiment is very instructive. It shows better than any
other that I know of the fixity and the identity of the melting
and solidifying points: it shows that solid carbonic acid only
melts under pressure, and it indicates the great difference between
the solid and the liquid carbonic acid in respect of conductivity -
for heat.
   I usually place the glass tube in water; the transparent ice
crust then formed shows the cold inside the tube.

    A series of wave-trains generated by an oscillator O were
allowed to propagate themselves along a double-wire circuit
LL'about 100 metres in length. At the middle of the circuit
the wires were run through, a jar containing a certain depth
AB of distilled water, alcohol, or a very dilute electrolyte.

 The intensity of the ray transmitted by this slightly absorbent
 layer was determined by an electrometer E placed at a quarter
 wave-length (2.25 metres) from the closed end of the circuit.
 This intensity varied periodically with the thickness of the
layer, as in the analogous case of a ray of light and a “thin
  late.”
   The layer AB was v.hat Boltzmann has termed a “con
ducting dielectric,” i.e. both its conducting and dielectric
properties were of importance. The theory of a non-con
ducting plate is much simpler: a problem equivalent to it has
recently been treated by Dr. E. H. Barton *, to whose work
I shall have several occasions to refer. In the more complex
problem I have assumed, we have simply a plane-fronted
damped wave-train travelling through an insulating medium
and falling at normal incidence on an infinite slab of con
ducting dielectric. The magnetic permeability of both the
plate and the surrounding medium are taken as unity.
   The theoretical transmission-curve obtained on these assump
tions does not agree well with the experimental one, the
divergence being the same in sign and order of magnitude
as that noticed by Dr. Barton in his case. We have in fact
idealized the experimental facts too far in endeavouring to
simplify the analysis: the electrolyte was not at all infinite in
extent, and at least one important correction is obviously
necessary (section VI.). The experiments can only be re
garded as a very rough illustration of the problem, and as
giving the raison d'être of this paper.
   The general results obtained seem to be of considerable
interest. The intensities of the reflected rays, the phase
changes, and so on, for damped wave-trains reflected from
such a plate differ from those for steady rays in some cases
very considerably.

    VI. Discussion of an Experimental Case and a Correction.
    This section is independent of the rest of the paper, being
devoted to the discussion of a correction necessary in the
*'''           case mentioned at the beginning.
     t has been stated already in the introduction that the
theory, sections IV. & V., does not give numerical results agree
ing closely with the experimental ones. For all the values of
B2/8, I tried the calculated points lay continually below the
experimental determinations. Dr. Barton found exactly the
same peculiarity in his analogous experiments, and suggested
that it might be due to the coursing of the wave-trains back
wards and forwards along the wire circuit between the
oscillator and the closed end. Working from this idea he
arrived at a correction formula *, which, however, is not
immediately applicable to our case. The following analysis
is equivalent to Dr. Barton’s though differing in method.
    Let ABC (fig. 5) represent our circuit, B being the electro
lyte, A the  .#            the closed end.

nesses of the electrolyte, we shall have by substituting their
values in (8) a pair of simultaneous equations for the deter
mination of e and Y.
   This process  .#    led to impossibilities for all values of
A1/8, and the log. dec. of the wave-train that were tried.
Either ex became greater than unity or negative, or e--x
became negative.
   It may be noted that this correction did not work very
successfully in Dr. Barton's case either.       His method of
applying it was, however, different: having formed an ex
perimental estimate of the rate of decrease of the total energy

          Wave-trains through a Conducting. Dielectric.             337
of a wave-train by its passage along the imperfectly conducting
wires, he assumed that there was perfect reflexion at both
ends of the circuit, and thence calculated the correction to be
applied to the experimental curve. The corrected curve ob
tained in this way lay below the calculated curve. Takin
two points at random on his curves, I tried to calculate ex #
e+x by my method. The results were again impossible.
   It must be remembered that in both these cases more than
one of the constants of the theoretical curve were simple
  uesses, y and 82/81 in my case were both only approximately
  nown. In     ''      to make things square by the correction
of (8), we may have been attempting the impossible and
rightly got irrational results. I need not dwell at greater
length on this point: possible causes of error are numerous.
The non-agreement of experimental results with the equations
does not of course prove the wrongness of the latter, but only
the wrongness of their application to the case.
   I am compelled to admit that, considering the positions of
the maxima in my experimental curves are dependent on the
phase-changes and on the correction we have been discussing
—possibly also on other uneliminated disturbances—no great
weight can be attached to the accuracy of the values of the
dielectric constants for water, alcohol, &c., deduced on the
assumption that such corrections were negligible *.
  VII. The Numerical Value of some of the previous Results.
   When the expressions in sections II. and III. had been
obtained, the question at once arose, how far the values of b, c,
f, k, y', and so on might be practically affected by possible
variations in the rate of damping of the incident ray.               In
working with ordinary oscillators are changes likely to become
important or to remain quite negligible P. In working with
light are differences likely to be appreciable between flashes
and steady rays?
   As regards oscillator wave-trains, the damping should
certainly be taken into account. The second question, how
ever, must, I think, be answered in the negative, for the simple
reason that one cannot get a quick enough flashf. Even an
electric spark lasts for thousands or millions of the vibrations
of violet light: the rays from it would be practically steady,
not damped.

     than for the damped ray.
        Experimental evidence for these results would be very
     interesting; but, so far as I am aware, there is none what
     ever. In cases where X was taken between 80° and 90°, the

XXXIII. On the Objective Reality of Combination Tones. By
   A. W. RüCKER, M.A., F.R.S., and E. EDSER, A.R.C.S.*
Th:         question of the objective existence of combination
        tones has been keenly disputed. At first they were
regarded as produced within the ear itself. Von Helmholtz
in part adopted this view, and gave a theoretical explanation
of the way in which the construction of the ear might lend
itself to such a result. (“Sensations of Tone, App. XII.)
He also believed that they existed objectively when the
     * Communicated by the Physical Society: read March 22, 1895.

342            Prof. Rücker and Mr. Edser on the
amplitudes of the vibrations of the notes which give rise to
them are so great that powers higher than the first have to
be considered. He supported this view by mathematical
demonstrations, and stated (‘Sensations of Tone, transl. by
A. Ellis, p. 157) that he had proved their objective existence
by making membranes and resonators to respond to combina
tional tones produced by the siren and harmonium. These
views and statements have been adversely criticised by König,
 Bosanquet, and Preyer. A very lucid account of the con
troversy was given by the late Mr. Ellis in his translation of
 the Tonempfindungen, and the net result of the impression
 produced in his mind is shown by two notes on pages 156
 and 157. He there states that the result of Mr. Bosanquet's
 and Prof. Preyer's experiments is to show that the combina
 tional tones are produced in the ear itself, and that it is
 probable that the apparent reinforcement of the resonators
 noticed by Helmholtz arose from imperfect blocking of both
 ears when using them.
    These statements were unqualified, and no condition was
 made as to the way in which the combination-tones were pro
 duced. Helmholtz, for reasons which we need not recount,
 regarded the siren as the best instrument for producing
 objective combination-tones; and we recently determined to
 submit the question of their existence, which seemed to be
 decided against him, to another experimental test.
    In this paper we give the result of our investigations, as
 far as they have at present been carried out. We do not
 regard them as complete, but they at all events prove that
 when the conditions under which we experimented are fulfilled,
 there can be no doubt that difference and summation-tones
 are produced which are capable of disturbing resonating
 bodies.
    The resonator employed in the first instance was a tuning
 fork. It is well known that this instrument is relatively diffi
 cult to excite by resonance, and it was therefore necessary to
 use an extremely delicate method of detecting whether it was
 set in motion. For this purpose a mirror attached to one of
 the prongs was made one of a system by which Michelson’s
 interference-bands were produced. A movement of the
 prong amounting to half a wave-length of light (say 1/80,000
 of an inch) would alter the length of the path of one of the
 interfering rays by a wave-length. A periodic vibration of
 this amplitude would cause the band to disappear.
    It is therefore evident that an extremely minute movement
 could be detected. It was at first open to question whether
 the apparatus would not be so sensitive to accidental dis

             Oljective Reality of Combination Tones.        343
turbances as to be untrustworthy. This difficulty has, how
ever, been entirely overcome.
   A plan of the apparatus is shown in fig. 1. The shank of
the tuning-fork, F, is imbedded in a mass of lead. One of
                              Fig. 1.
|                      @
the prongs carries a mirror, M. To the other is attached a
square of wood, W, of larger area but of the same weight as
the mirror. A Lissajous’ figure (an ellipse) was formed by
reflexion from the mirror and from a small square of silvered
  lass attached to one of König's large forks adjusted to give
the C of 64 complete vibrations per second, and the pitch of F
was adjusted until only one beat occurred in two minutes. The
pitch was thus very accurately known. A double siren, S,
was placed between a large       k'.     resonator tuned to 64
vibrations and a wooden cone or pyramid, C. The end of
the cone was placed about half an inch from W, which was
rather larger than the narrow end of the cone. The sensi
tiveness of the apparatus depended in part upon the distance
between W and C. If the distance was too large, the sen
 sitiveness was diminished. If it was too small, the instrument
 was unduly affected by chance puffs of air even when not
 periodic in character.
    A source of light, L, was used to form a system of inter
 ference-bands by means of the half-silvered mirror MI, and
 the two mirrors M and M2.            The two interfering rays
 travelled over the paths LM1M2M1B and LM1MM1B respec
 tively. The distances MM1 and M1M, were approximately
 equal; and since when soda-light was used a change in the
 length of either of the paths of #x 589 up would cause a
 dark band to shift into the position previously occupied by
 the next bright band, and since, further, any movement of M
 altered the length of the path of the ray by twice its own
 magnitude, it is evident that a movement of 3 x 589 uu, or,
 say, of one hundred thousandth of an inch, could be easily
 detected.
    The fork F and the mirrors M, MI, and M2 rested on a
square stone, which was suspended by wires and india-rubber

344             Prof. Rücker and Mr. Edser on the
door-fasteners from a heavily weighted beam, which itsel
rested on india-rubber balls placed at a convenient height on
a double pair of wooden “steps.” With these precautions it
was found that the bands remained tolerably steady even by
day when persons were moving about the building, and when
the traffic on the frost-bound road produced considerable mecha
nical vibrations. Even under these conditions, we have satisfied
all who have seen the apparatus of the reality of the pheno
mena. The experiments on which we rely, however, were
made on several occasions between midnight and 2 or 3 A.M.
The bands were then absolutely clear and steady. They were
undisturbed for many minutes at a time when the bellows
 were being worked and the siren was sounding loudly. It
 was only when a note of 64 vibrations per second was directly
 or indirectly produced that they vanished, and there could
 be no possible doubt or mistake as to whether the disturbance
 was or was not produced by the sound or combination of
 sounds under investigation.
     Up to the present we have used the fork above described
only. It was chosen because it was fairly stiff, and as re
 movable metal mirrors for the production of Lissajous’
 figures were attached to its prongs, it was possible to replace
 them by the glass mirror and square of wood without altering
 its  '.      It would be quite possible to use properly made
 forks of higher pitch as resonators, and the steadiness of the
 bands at night is so remarkable, that we believe that if the
 apparatus were set up in the country, on a stone isolated from
 the rest of the room, the degree of sensitiveness we have
 attained could be far surpassed.
                          Tuning the Siren.
     Three methods were used for determining when the siren
 was producing the required notes. When one of these was
 fairly high, the beats given by it and a standard fork were
 noticed, and the note could thus be kept hovering about the
 required pitch for a considerable time. Although with the
 aid of König’s large forks we could apply this method to
 vibration-frequencies of 48 per second '' upwards, it was
 difficult when the notes were very low to recognize the beats
 with sufficient certainty.
     The prongs of various tuning-forks were therefore furnished
  with two pieces of tin-foil, which opened and closed a slit
  made in them twice in every complete vibration. They were
  also compared with a standard by the aid of a revolvin
  cylinder, and were adjusted by weights to the require
  frequencies. These were so selected as to make one of the

             Objective Reality of Combination Tones.         345
circles of holes on the siren appear stationary when viewed
through the slit, if the velocity of rotation was such that the
desired note or notes would be given by the same or other
circles of holes. An observer watching the siren through the
slit and pressing lightly on the axis with a straw, was able to
adjust its speed so that the required combination of sounds
was produced for several, and in some cases for many seconds
at a time.
   We have also projected the image of the row of holes on a
screen, the cone of light passing at its narrowest part through
the slit in the tinfoil screens carried by the auxiliary fork.
When the upper siren was to be used, two semicircles of light
mirror-glass were laid on the disk of the lower siren to which
the two halves of a paper cog-wheel were fastened. The
image of the cogs could thus be projected.
   The third method of determining the speed of the siren
depended on the use of an instrument first devised by
Lord Rayleigh in 1880. A mass of air enclosed in a tube is
excited by resonance, and the fact of the excitation is indicated
by a light mirror set where the motion is greatest, and inclined
at 45° to the direction of the air-currents.      In accordance
with the general law that a lamina tends to place itself per
pendicular to the direction of a stream, the mirror moves
when the air vibrates. In the original apparatus the amount
of the movement was controlled by magnets. Since that
date Professor Boys has modified the instrument by substi
tuting a quartz-thread suspension for a silk fibre, and using
the torsion of the thread instead of the directing force of the
magnets. He exhibited the apparatus during a lecture
delivered before the British Association in Leeds. It may be
called a mirror-resonator.
   Professor Boys has been good enough to make two of these
instruments for us, and it was decided that one of them should
respond to 161 vibrations per second. The movement of the
spot of light reflected from the mirror informed us when
the siren was giving this note, and this fact was utilized
in one of the experiments.
                  Sensitiveness of the Apparatus.
   The results were in general improved by laying a small
strip of dry blotting-paper upon the prongs. Mere accidental
disturbances died out more quickly, and the vibrations of the
 fork diminished more rapidly, when the notes which had pro
 duced them ceased to sound.
    A forced movement could be produced in the fork by

346            Prof. Rücker and Mr. Edser on the
blowing directly down the collecting cone, but a small
organ-pipe could be sounded, or a König’s fork bowed near
the opening without producing the least effect if the frequency
of the note produced was not near 64 per second. In like
manner many notes of two reed wind-instruments, somewhat
similar in construction to the harmonium, were sounded
simultaneously so that the room echoed with discordant
sound, yet without producing the least effect on the steadiness
of the bands.
   On the other hand, when one of König's forks tuned to 64
vibrations was touched with the india-rubber covered handle
of a gimlet, or was struck with a piece of gas-tubing so lightly
that an observer with his ear close to the fork could not
detect the fundamental note, the bands instantly disappeared.
   It was therefore evident that the apparatus could respond
to a vibration which was quite inaudible to a person standing
by the resonating fork.
   When the König fork was weighted so as to give 63.5
vibrations per second, the bands appeared and disappeared at
regular intervals of two seconds, thus corresponding to the
beats between the exciting and resonating £ The bands
 were not disturbed when the beats exceeded 2 or 3 per second
 unless the exciting fork was bowed very violently. In the
 experiments with fainter tones, the resonating fork was only
 disturbed when the frequency of the exciting note agreed very
 exactly with its own.
   As the speed of the siren was gradually increased from
 rest the bands always disappeared two or three times, the
disturbance being no doubt caused by the upper partials as
the vibration-frequency passed, in turn, the values 16, 21.3,
 and 32 per second. No exact measurement was made of the
 corresponding frequencies, as there could be no question as to
 whether the partials were produced or as to whether the
 apparatus could detect them. No such disappearance occurred
 when the note was higher than C, except in the case of
 certain spurious effects referred to below.             -
    All the experiments were performed several times on each
 occasion, and on two occasions at least. The bands were
 sometimes produced by soda-light, and watched by an ob
 server through a telescope.
    Sometimes the electric light was used. The bands could
then be projected on a screen side by side with the image
 of the holes or cogs. In this way information as to the
note produced and as to the behaviour of the bands was
simultaneously conveyed to all who watched the experiments,

              Objective Reality of Combination Tones.       347
                            Precautions.
   It will not be thought remarkable that so delicate an appa
ratus requires careful use.
   In the first place, it was necessary to be sure that the
disturbance ascribed to the joint action of two notes was
not produced by one or both of them when acting alone. In
all cases, therefore, in which it was possible to determine the
pitch of both notes separately, each note was sounded alone
and carried slowly past the particular pitch at which the
existence of a combination-tone was to be investigated. In
general, no effect was produced; but after the apparatus
had been in use for some little time, we were troubled by the
fact that two notes which did not differ much from 256 and
320 vibrations respectively disturbed the bands when they
were produced separately.
   That these effects were spurious was evident from two facts.
Firstly, the same notes had previously been sounded for a
long time with the special object of determining whether
they produced any effect, and had produced none. Secondly,
the disturbances were evidently forced. When the fork has
been disturbed by a vibration of frequency 64, it continues to
oscillate for several seconds after the disturbing note has
ceased. The bands alternately appear and disappear several
times before the final state of rest is attained.    In the case
of a “spurious” effect, the bands reappear instantaneously
with absolute clearness the moment the disturbing note
ceases, thereby indicating a forced vibration. It was, how
ever, a more difficult task to discover the cause than to de
termine the character of these disturbances. Finally, it was
found that since the apparatus was first set up some cracks
had opened in the wooden pyramidal collector. A tap on the
side of this will disturb the bands; and when one of the
cracked sides was loaded with weights the disturbance due to
the 320 note was much reduced.        The cracks were then cut
out, the defects made good; and since that time this dis
turbance has entirely ceased.
   The effect produced by the 256 note was due to another
 cause. When the pyramid was removed, the open ends of
 the resonance-boxes of various tuning-forks (256, 320, 384)
were held near the square of wood which was attached to the
fork F. It was found that the 256 fork was the only one which
affected the bands, and that it only produced any result when
 the sounding-box was held near that part of the wood which
projected beyond the end of the prong. It was therefore

348            Prof. Rücker and Mr. Edser on the
 evident that the two ribs attached to this were not sufficient
 to prevent a certain flapping of the projecting part, and that
this responded to a note of about 256 vibrations. The end of
the collecting pyramid was then shifted a little so that the
waves of sound impinged only on the more rigid part of the
wooden square, and the spurious effect immediately and
completely disappeared.
    Of the notes which caused these troubles, the lower one was
 decidedly lower than the c of 256; the other corresponded
very accurately with the e' of 320. The fact that both these
numbers are multiples of 64 may legitimately give rise to the
doubt whether the fork F can be set in motion by disturbances
which are multiples of its own frequency.
   Even if it be admitted that such forced vibrations would
be especially easy to produce, we must insist—(1) that we
can distinguish (as above described) between forced and
natural vibrations; (2) that when the apparatus was pro
perly arranged such notes could be      ''         by the siren
for long intervals of time without the least effect on the
bands; (3) that two tuning-forks, of 256 and 320 vibrations
respectively, have been placed within the wooden pyramid
with their sounding-boxes resting on and supported by, the
lower side, yet no effect was produced on the bands even
when they were both sounding loudly at the same time;
 (4) that one of König’s large forks, with a frequency of 128,
was placed in front of the collecting cone and produced no
effect when sounding loudly, though the slightest tap on
the 64 fork caused the bands to vanish for many seconds;
(5) that the 320 and 384 forks produced no effect when the
pyramid was removed and they were held as above described
close to the receiving prong of the fork; (6) and, lastly, that
in two out of the £ experiments on the difference-tones,
and in all those in which the interference apparatus was used
to detect summation tones, the frequencies of the notes em
ployed were neither multiples nor sub-multiples of 64.
   As in all the above experiments the resonator was in
position, they also sufficed to prove that tones of 64 vibra
tions were not manufactured in it by the primary notes when
acting  £
   If the objection is raised that, although neither note
disturbed the bands when sounded alone, the effect might be
due to the double disturbance produced by the two sounds,
we think it sufficient to answer that we have always carried
the two notes above the pitch at which the difference-tone
might be expected to affect the instrument, then lowered the
pitch again till the notes were too flat, and repeated this

             Objective Reality of Combination Tones.          349
operation several times. The disturbances were only pro
duced when the pitch was nearly, or very nearly, correct.
As soon as a few beats per second were heard the bands
became visible.
   Having thus described the various tests which were applied
to the apparatus, we may proceed to describe the experiments
without dwelling further on the necessary precautions. It is
sufficient to say once for all that they were adopted in each
CaS6.
   The main object of the enquiry was to obtain evidence as
to the objective reality of the combination-tones, and for this
":        the following experiments were arranged.
     ach box of the siren had four circles of holes which could
 be used separately or together. The number of openings in
 the upper box were 9, 12, 15, and 16, and in the lower 8, 10,
 12, and 18. It will be convenient to refer to these as the
 9 row of holes, and so on.
                           Experiment I.
   The 12 and 15 rows of holes in the upper box were opened,
 and the pitch was raised until the upper note gave slow beats
 with a fork of 320 vibrations per second. £ lower note
 was then the C of 256 vibrations.     The difference or beat tone
 of 64 vibrations affected the instrument powerfully. The ex
 periment was tried both by night and by day. It was diffi
 cult to keep the siren exactly at the true pitch, but when the
 beats were very slow the bands continually disappeared,
 sometimes for many seconds at a time, then appeared for a
 moment and then disappeared again. As soon as the pitch
 was lost by a few beats per second, the bands remained steady
 and clearly visible.
    The experiment was repeated with the 9 and 12 rows of
 holes. W' the upper note was C of 256 vibrations, the
 lower note was 192 vibrations.       The difference-tone of 64
 vibrations affected the fork very powerfully.
    The experiment was also modified by opening the 10 and
 12 rows of holes. When the notes corresponded to 320 and
 384 vibrations respectively, the bands disappeared as before.
                          Experiment II.
    In experiment I. the frequencies of the difference-tone and
 of König's first lower beat-tone were identical. The experi
 ment was therefore varied by using 8 and 18 rows of holes.
 The frequency of the difference-tone was thus proportional
 to 10, while that of König's lower beat-tone would be
 18–2 x 8=2. When the siren was revolving at the rate of

350           Prof. Rücker and Mr. Edser on the
64 revolutions per second, the two notes corresponded to
 51-2 and 1152 vibrations per second, the difference-tone
being 64.
   The pitch was determined on different occasions by dif
ferent methods. Firstly, by noting the beats between the
higher note and a König's fork adjusted to 115:2 complete
vibrations per second, and secondly, by watching the row of
eight holes through a slit carried by a fork which gave 25.5
vibrations per second.
   The effect was rather feebler than in the last experiment,
but there was absolutely no doubt as to the objective reality
of the difference-tone. The bands regularly disappeared
when the required pitch was obtained, and reappeared when
it was lost.
   Again the 15 and 9 rows of holes were used. The differ
ence-tone is thus proportional to 6, and König’s beat-tone to
9 x 2–15 = 3.    When the rate of revolution was 10-6 the
two notes were 160 and 96 respectively. In this experiment
the mirror-resonator which responds to 161 vibrations was
employed to determine the rate of the siren. The bands and
the spot of light were sometimes watched together: on
another occasion one observer who could not see the bands
raised his hand whenever the spot of light moved. The
bands invariably disappeared at the instant that this signal
was made.
                       Experiment III.
   The next experiment was directed to determine the objective
reality of König's lower beat-tone when the interval was
greater than an octave. The 8 and 18 rows of holes being
kept open as before, the speed was increased until the lower
note was that of 256 vibrations. The upper note was then
576, and König’s lower beat-tone was of 576–2 x 256=64
vibrations.
   We lay less stress on negative than on positive results;
but we tried for a long time on two occasions to get
evidence of the objective character of the note, but entirely
failed. The pitch was determined by the beats with a
256 fork.
                       Experiment IV.
   We next turn to observations on the summation-tone.
The 8 and 10 rows of holes were opened, so that when the
cover made 3:55 revolutions per second the summation-tone
would be that of 18 x 3.5=64 vibrations.

            Objective Reality of Combination Tones.         351
  The pitch of the notes given by the siren was again
determined in different ways on different occasions. The
summation-tone being produced in the lower box, the 15 row
in the upper box was also opened, thus producing a note of
15 x 3.5=53.3 vibrations per second. The required speed
was determined by making the beats vanish between this
note and a König's fork tuned to give 53.3 vibrations. With
this method it was difficult to keep the speed constant for a
length of time sufficient to disturb the resonating fork appre
ciably. When the pitch was altered very slowly the bands
disappeared just as the right note was reached, and did not
disappear at any other time during the experiment.
   On another occasion the 9 and 12 rows of holes were
opened, so that the summation-tone of 64 vibrations would be
given when the siren made 3.05 revolutions per second. The
18 row of holes was watched through a fork of 27:2 vibrations,
so that 54-4 views would be obtained while a hole moved over
18x 3.05–54.9 intervals. Hence the right pitch was obtained
when the holes moved slowly forwards. The bands invariably
disappeared when this state of things was attained.
   On a third occasion the lower cover of the siren was covered
with a thin piece of silvered glass as above described, carrying
a concentric circle of black paper, the edge of which was
divided into 18 equidistant cogs. An image of these was
  roduced on a screen by a lens, and made intermittent by
the 27-vibrations fork.     The disturbance due to the sum
mation-tone was again and again made evident when the
images of the cogs appeared to be moving slowly. In the
intervals the bands were beautifully steady.
   The earlier of these experiments were performed before, and
the later ones after, the apparatus had been taken down and
set up again in another room. They left in the minds of those
who saw them no shadow of doubt as to the objective reality
of a note corresponding in frequency with the summation
tone.
    We now turn to experiments intended to throw light on
the cause of the production of this note.
                          Experiment W.
   It has been suggested that the summation-tone may be the
 difference-tone of partials.     König (Acoustique, p. 127)
 remarks that it may occasion some surprise that the particular
 harmonics whose difference-tone corresponds to the summa
 tion-tone should be especially prominent; but he points out

 352            Prof. Rücker and Mr. Edser on the
 that in some cases the difference-tones of the lower harmonics
 correspond either to the fundamentals or to some of their upper
 partials. In the case of the fourth (3:4), however, König
 remarks that the 5th partials would give a difference-tone (5)
 which could be distinguished from the lower partials, and that
the difference-tone of the 7th partials would give the summa
tion-tone. Now we have already proved (Exp. IV.) that the
summation tone produced by two notes separated by the
 interval of a fourth (9:12) is objective; and if this is : to
 the difference-tone of the 7th partials, there seems to be no
 reason why the difference-tone of the 5th partials should not
 be objective also, and probably more intense.
    We therefore ircreased the velocity of revolution to 4.27
  er second, the 9 and 12 rows of holes being opened as before.
  he frequencies of the two notes were thus 38.43 and 51.24.
The pitch was determined by keeping the 12 holes nearly
stationary when viewed 51 times a second by aid of the 25.5
fork.    The first difference-tone was 12.81, and the difference
tone of the 5th partials was 64.05. When the speed corre
sponding to this difference-tone was attained there were occa
sional flickers of the bands, so that it is possible that it has
an objective existence. But, on the other hand, the effect
was less than that produced by the summation-tone. The
bands never disappeared for any considerable length of time,
as they did when the fork responded to the summation-tone,
and the experiment left no doubt in our minds that the greater
effect was produced by the summation-tone.
                          Experiment VI.
   The same point was also investigated in another way. If
the summation-tone of two notes of frequencies p and q
corresponds to the difference-tone of the nth partial, we
must have
                        (p+q) = n(p-q),
where n is an integer. If, however, the 9 and 16 rows of
holes were opened,
                      p+q=25, p-q=7;
so that the summation-tone could not be produced by partials
of the same order. The 10th partial of the higher note
beating with the 15th of the lower note (160–135=25)
would indeed have the same frequency as the summation-tone,
but it appears to us absurd to suppose that so improbable a
combination should produce appreciable results. It is true that
lower partials may give beat-tones near to the summation-tone.

             Objective Reality of Combination Tones.         353
Thus 5 x 16–6x9 =26. But if we are to assume that any .
pair of partials can thus produce objective tones, the number
of combinations will be so great that the fork ought to have
been disturbed frequently when the note of the siren was being
raised to the required pitch. As a matter of fact, when once
the C of 64 vibrations was passed, so that all the partials were
higher than the pitch of the resonating fork, no such disturb
ances were ever observed except when the difference- or
summation-tone of the primaries was produced. Putting,
therefore, all such fantastic combinations aside, the experiment
may be regarded as a test whether the summation-tone can be
#"
Order.
           when it cannot be due to two partials of the same
   When the velocity of revolution was 2.56 per second, the
16 and 9 holes gave notes of 40.96 and 23:04 vibrations. The
sum of these is 64. The 12 holes were viewed through a slit
alternately closed and opened by a fork of 15 vibrations per
second, and when the holes appeared to move slowly the
summation-tone caused the bands to disappear.
   In this experiment, however, the third partial of the lower
note corresponds to 69.12 vibrations, and we thought it
desirable to make sure that the disturbance attributed to the
summation-tone was not in reality due to this partial. This
was the more important, because the difference in the speeds
of the siren when the summation-tone and the partial in
question corresponded to 64 vibrations was very small.
   Thus, when the speed was 2.56 revolutions per second
each of the 12 holes would advance through 30.72 intervals
in a second, and since the fork gave 30 views per second the
holes would appear to move slowly forwards.
   When the speed was 2.37 revolutions per second the
third partial of the lower note (9 row of holes) would be
3 x 9 x 2.37 =64, and each hole of the 12 rows would advance
through 28.44 intervals—that is, would appear to recede
through 1:56 intervals per second. Thus the partial would
be most efficient in promoting disturbance when the holes
appeared to go backward with moderate speed.
    he question to be answered was whether these two dis
turbances could be confused with each other.
   When care was taken to keep the pressure in the wind
chest the same whether one or both sets of holes were opened,
the effect of the partial produced by the 9 set of holes could
hardly be detected. The bands were shaken a little when
the row of 12 holes appeared to move backwards, but they
did not disappear; whereas they were completely wiped out
by the summation-tone when the two notes were sounded.

   354           Prof. Rücker and Mr. Edser on the
.     When the pressure on the wind-chest was increased, the
   rate of revolution being nevertheless maintained constant by
   pressing lightly on the axle of the siren with a straw, the
   effect of the partial was more marked, but it was always
   produced when the holes appeared to move backwards.
      On the other hand, when both notes were sounded together
   and when the pitch was gradually reduced to the desired
   point, the disturbance always began when the holes moved
   slowly forwards. If the pitch fell very slowly it was possible
   to note a reduction of the disturbance, followed by an increase
   when the holes appeared to move backwards.
      We thus convinced ourselves that the effects of the two
   sources of disturbance could be distinguished, and that the
   supposed summation-tone was not due to the partial of the
   lower note.                                                    -
                          Experiment VII.
     We have also succeeded in demonstrating the reality of
  the summation-tone with a mirror-resonator constructed by
   Professor Boys to respond to a vibration-frequency of 576.
      The rows of 15 and 12 holes being opened, notes of 320
   and 256 vibrations were produced. When they were sounded
   separately, the mirror moved slightly. When they were
   sounded together, the spot of light was driven off the scale
   when the upper note coincided with that of a 320-vibration
   fork, but immediately returned when this pitch was lost.
      The experiment was varied by using the 16 and 12 rows,
  and also the 16 and 9 rows. The summation-tone corresponds
  to 576 vibrations when the upper note is of 329:15 and 360
  vibrations in these two cases respectively. The 320-fork
  was used, and the disturbance occurred in the one case
  when the pitch of the note was nearly the same as before,
  and in the other when it was about a tone higher.
     We attach great importance to this corroboration of our
  results by an instrument of a totally different construction
  from that first employed.
     The attempt to obtain proof of the existence of a difference
  tone by means of the mirror-resonator of 161 vibrations has
  not been successful.    The instrument is much less affected
  by the note to which it responds than is that which answers
 to 576 vibrations, even when that note is produced directly
 by the siren. It is, therefore, perhaps not wonderful that
 it gives no reliable evidence of the existence of a difference
 tone.
     We now sum up the results we have obtained in two tables.

   We have tried several times to obtain indications of com
bination-tones when the primary notes were produced b
tuning-forks. Two of König's large forks adjusted to 48
and 112 vibrations produced no effect when bowed simulta
neously before the collector, and, as has been stated, smaller
forks giving 256 and 320 vibrations have been placed inside
the collector when sounding loudly. No effect whatever was
produced, and there can be no doubt that if objective com
bination-tones are produced in such cases they are very much
less intense than those generated by the siren.
   Experiments have been made with reeds and with organ
pipes, but up to the present with uncertain results in the first
case and negative results in the second. We hope to inves
tigate these cases further.

356      On the Objective Reality of Combination Tones.
   We have made several attempts to detect combination
tones of higher orders, such as 2p-H q and 2p-q, but without
SuCCeSS.
                            Conclusion.
   We may in conclusion refer to some of the suggestions
which have been made to account for the combination-tones
by theories other than those of Helmholtz.                 -
   König's suggestion that they are the beat-tones of upper
partials has been discussed and shown to be inadequate to
explain the facts of observation.
   Again, it has been argued that the summation-tone is the
beat-note between the second partial of the higher note (the
octave) and the beat-tone of the two primaries. It follows as
a matter of algebra that such an explanation must always be
numerically correct, for 2a-(a-b)=a+b, and our experi
ments throw no new light on the matter. It appears to us,
however, that since propinquity between the sources of sound,
causing a violent disturbance, is favourable to the production
of combination-tones, while it is not necessary for the pro
duction of beats, the facts of experiment are in this case also
in favour of von Helmholtz's views.
   A still more subtle objection has been taken by Terquem
(Annales d’Ecole Normale, 1870, p. 356). When two rows
of holes are open in the siren, there may be occasions on
which all the holes of both rows are opened simultaneously
and others on which only one row is in action at one time.
Terquem attempts to calculate the effects of irregularities
such as these, but in the first place he specifically refrains
from attacking the theory of Helmholtz; secondly, he does
not apply calculation to the siren of Helmholtz; thirdly, he
points out that the relatively large size of the holes in that
instrument would reduce the effects he predicts; and, lastly,
he admits that his results require confirmation by experiment.
Putting these points aside, however, his theory leads to the
conclusion that the two notes which we have been regarding
as fundamental are reinforced harmonics in a series of which
the fundamental note corresponds to the greatest common
measure of these frequencies. Both the summation and the
tlifference tone must be included in such a series; but
Terquem's theory gives no reason why they should have such
exceptional importance as experiment proves that they have.
 Lastly, as he expressly repudiates the idea that partials have
an objective existence (loc. cit. p. 274), and includes the com
bination-tones in a series of partials, the experiments described
by us must on this point be regarded as opposed to his views.

                  On Electric Energy-Distribution.               357
   We think, then, that our experiments prove that von Helm
holtz was correct in stating that the siren produces two
objective notes the frequencies of which are respectively equal
to the sum and difference of the frequencies of the funda
mentals, and that our observations are also more or less
opposed to the theories by which König, Appun, and Terquem
have sought to account for the production of these notes.
   We believe that the method we have devised is capable of
greater sensitiveness. It can be extended by employing
forks of different pitches, and it is quite possible that less
massive forks may enable us to detect effects which have
hitherto escaped us. We therefore refrain from any wide
generalizations until a wider foundation of experiment has
been laid.
   P.S.—Since the above was written Prof. S. P. Thompson has
drawn our attention to a paper by O. Lummer, published in 1886
(Verh, phys. Gesell. Berlin, 1886, No. 9, p. 66), which had escaped
our notice, as it is not abstracted in the Beiblätter. Herr Lummer
obtained evidence of the objective character of the summation-tone
by means of the microphone.
XXXIV. Energy Movements in the Medium separating
   Electrified or Gravitating Particles. By H. N. ALLEN,
   University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Neb.
1. TNARADAY and Maxwell have shown that it is possible
           to look on the potential energy of electric separation
as residing in the surrounding dielectric, and that each of
the cells, bounded by the walls of a tube of force and two
neighbouring equipotential surfaces, can be looked upon as
containing a certain definite amount of energy.
   This energy-distribution is not in general permanent, and
can only be regarded as a step towards some simpler ar
rangement. Thus a positive and a negative electrified body
suspended in space, and acted on only by the electrical
forces between them, are never in equilibrium until they are
in actual contact. The energy-distribution in the dielectric
changes constantly as they approach. Poynting has shown f
how energy is transferred from one point to another in an
electromagnetic field; and we are quite accustomed to think
of energy as flowing from dynamo to motor through the
aether, or from primary to secondary in an alternating-current
transformer.

of the consequences of Maxwell's suggestion with regard to
energy-distribution. The changes needed in the theory in
order to apply it to gravitation are also indicated.
   2. If two equal charges of positive and negative electricity
 +M and – M are separated by a distancel, the equation to
the curve in which the equipotential surface V intersects the
plane of the paper is
                -.  M     =E,----     M        =V,        .   (1)
             My"+(#l-w)” Vy" + (#!-Ha!)"
the origin being the point midway between the particles, and
the X-axis being the line joining this point to the positive
particle.
    3. The number of tubes of force proceeding from a charge
 M has sometimes been taken as M but more generally as
4T.M. For graphical methods the former plan seems most
convenient, and in order to avoid confusion it is proposed that
the resulting tubes should be called “tubes of polarization,
while the smaller tubes retain the name “tubes of induction.”
The polarization, as defined by J. J. Thomson in his ‘Recent
 Researches in Electricity and Magnetism, is measured by
 the number of these polarization tubes which pass through a
square centimetre perpendicular to their direction.
    Using Maxwell's method of drawing the boundary lines
between the tubes of polarization, the equation to the n" line
in the case mentioned above will be
               'l'-."             #1-#"         2–%            .*

where the straight line drawn from the positive to the nega
tive particle is called zero, and that drawn in the opposite
direction M.
    4. The point of intersection of the equipotential surface V,
the line of force n, and the plane of the paper lies on the
 curves (1) and (2). If, then, l in these equations be regarded
 as a variable parameter, they will together represent the
 curve along which the corner of an energy-cell moves, when
 the two particles come together. To plot this curve, the
 equipotential surfaces and lines of force might be drawn for
 a number of different distances between the particles, and
 corresponding points of intersection joined.
    The path of the energy-cell can be obtained with less
 labour from measures made on a single diagram, drawn to
 represent the lines of force and equipotential surfaces about
 the two  R.'       when these are separated by a given dis
 tance. This is done by taking advantage of the following
properties of these lines:—         -           -

       1. When the distance between the particles is changed,
    corresponding tubes of polarization in the two diagrams are
    similar to one another.                                 -        -
       2. The equipotential surfaces in the two diagrams are also
    similar to one another. If, however, the distance between
    the particles changes from l to al, the equipotential surface
    V changes to a similar surface, on which the potential is .        -
       If then, the n" line of force cuts the equipotential sur
    face V at the point x, y in the first diagram, the n" line will
    cut the equipotential surface w at the point aw, ay in the
    second diagram.                     Cl
       Thus, in the case where M=12 and l = 10 the coordinates
    of the following intersections, among others, were found by
    measurement on a carefully prepared diagram.

       If the diagram were enlarged in the ratio of 4 to 1, the
    coordinates of the point corresponding to the intersection
    of 7 and 4 would be 44 and 4y or 21.4 and 9:12.
|      The potential at this point would be       v='=1.
       Thus we have found the coordinates of the point of inter
    section of the line of force 7 and the equipotential surface 1,
    when the distance between the particles is 40 centim.
       In the same way, and by means of the same original
    diagram, the point of intersection can be found for a number
    of other distances, and the path which it follows, when the
    two particles approach one another, can be plotted as in fig. 1.
       In this figure the first of the numbers in brackets attached
    to each curve gives the number of the equipotential surface,
    and the second that of the intersecting line of force. The
    numbers along the curves show the distance of the particles
    from the centre of gravity, when the energy-cell is at the
    point marked on the curve.
 #.    It will be seen that the energy-cells move in more or less
    parabolic curves towards the centre of gravity of the two
    particles, and that during this process they are constantly
    approaching the two particles; so that, if these are not infi
    nitely small, energy must be constantly passing into them
    from the aether.                                          -
       Maxwell has shown that in all cases the number of energy
    cells in the aether is twice the potential energy of the system.
    So that, if we suppose each        #     to contain half a unit of
                                    2

when the bodies approach, and as being absorbed by the
moving bodies, so that their potential energy is converted
into kinetic. A conductor moves in such a way that the
absorbed energy is a maximum.
   Fig. 1 also illustrates the rotation of the energy-cell as the
particles approach. If on any one of the energy-paths, as

for instance (' , 7), the direction of the line of force (indi
cated by a dotted line) cutting it at different points be
noticed, it will be seen that this direction constantly changes
as the particles approach, so that the tangent to the line of
force rotates about the point of intersection. The velocity

         of the different energy-cells is indicated by crosses along the
         curves, at such points that, when the two particles come
        together from an infinite distance apart, the cells move from
        cross to cross in equal intervals of time. The same time is
        taken in moving from the cross marked 10 to the origin.
           5. In fig 2 the paths of the energy-cells are shown when
        two equal like particles repel one another.     It will be noticed
                                       Fig. 2.

        that, as the particles move apart, the energy in each half of
        the field follows the motion of the particle in that half, and
        at the same time moves nearer to the central line.
           It is clear that the result will be that energy will flow from
        the dielectric into the particle as it moves away, and being
        lost as potential energy will reappear as energy of motion.
        Even when the particles are an infinite distance apart there
        will still be a number of energy-cells in the aether, that is, the
        particles will still possess potential energy.
           This is explained by supposing that every polarization tube
        must begin and end somewhere. In this case we may sup
        pose that though A and B are an infinite distance apart, '.
        negative particle C is again an infinite distance beyond A,
        and the negative particle D an infinite distance beyond B, so
        that the tubes from A end in C, and those from B in D.
        Then, after B and A have been repelled to a great distance
        from one another and all the potential energy due to their
        original nearness has been exhausted, there will still remain
        the energy due to the separation of D from B and of A
        from C.

 make it fit in with the observed facts of gravitation.
     The energy diagram for two gravitational particles is the
 same as that for two like electrified particles. The polari
 zation tubes go off to infinity, and do not, as far as we know,
 end on negative gravitational matter.
     The properties of the cells between the polarization tubes
 and the equipotential surfaces are exactly opposite in the two
 cases of electricity and gravitation.

    The electrical energy-cells are constantly tending to con
 tract both in length and section, but so that the area of the
section always bears a constant ratio to the length of the cell.
The gravitational energy-cells, on the other hand, constantly
                              Fig. 3.
tend to expand, the same ratio holding between area and
length as in the former case. While each electrical cell con
tains according to Maxwell's theory half a unit of energy,
the gravitational cells must be supposed to contain half a
unit less of energy than the same volume of undisturbed

364        Mr. H. N. Allen on Energy Movements in the
 aether.    The gravitational cells are negative energy-cells.
 This expansion of the negative energy-cells implies a kind of
 contraction of the energy of the gravitational aether. In the
 case of electricity the final state is reached when the energy
 density is everywhere zero, all the energy having passed into
 the particles; in the case of gravitation when the density is
 uniform over a series of concentric shells, being a maximum
 at an infinite distance from ponderable matter.
    8. Fig.2 shows the path of the negative energy-cells, when
two equal gravitational particles come together from an infinite
 distance apart. It can be seen that the cells retreat from the
 particles as these approach one another. There will be a
 greater number of negative cells in the aether when the par
 ticles are in contact than when they are at a distance. This
is merely another way of saying that (positive) energy has
passed from the aether into the particles.
    The instantaneous position of the lines of energy-flow, for a
given position of the moving gravitational particles, is some
thing like fig. 2, the motion being away from the median
 plane and towards the line joining the two particles. The
 flow of energy is on the whole in the direction opposite to
the motion of the particle. The potential energy absorbed
by two gravitational particles, when they fall together, comes
from the space between them.
    The increase in the number of negative energy-cells, when
two gravitating masses approach, is equal to twice the gain
in kinetic, or loss in potential energy. The proof is the same
as in the case of static electricity, due regard being paid to
the signs of the quantities involved.
    Thus the theory may be advanced that each of these nega
tive energy-cells contains half a unit less of energy than the
same volume of aether in which no such cells exist.           An
increase in number of these cells corresponds to a flow of
energy from the gravitational aether into matter, where it is
converted into kinetic energy.
    Some difficulty may arise in special cases on account of
the fact that in the case of gravitation the attracting mass
has a volume distribution, instead of being confined to a
surface like static electricity on a conductor. Each unit         C
mass sends out a tube of polarization, whether it is on the
surface or not, and a considerable proportion of the energy
cells exist inside the surface.
   In the case of a single homogeneous sphere, at a distance
from all other bodies, one sixth of the negative energy-cells
are within the surface.
   It is clear, then, that in general the energy is not removed

           Medium separating Electrified Particles.         3.65
from the aether at the instant the negative cell passes out
through the surface, but perhaps rather at the instant that it
comes out from the molecule. In other words, energy may
be regarded as flowing in through the surface, but is only
absorbed and converted into kinetic energy when it passes
into a molecule.                                         -
   9. Maxwell has calculated the enormous pressure along the
lines of force and the equal tension at right angles to them
required, according to his theory, to account for the attraction
of the earth by the sun. A minimum value for the amount
of energy in one cubic centimetre of gravitational aether
can be calculated by finding the negative energy-density
on the surface of the sun considered as a body of uniform
density.                                              4
   The volume of the energy-cells at any point is ''.
   The intensity of the gravitational field on the surface of
the sun is H. = 72’ where M is the mass and r the radius of
this body. If p is the density of the sun the volume of an
energy-cell is
                   4Tr'      47"         9
                    M* T (#Tpr’) T 470'r'
The amount of energy lacking in each of these cells is half a
unit. Hence one cubic centimetre of aether lacks #7p'ra
units. These are static units of energy. One dyne equals
1:544 x 10' static units of force, therefore one erg equals
1:544 x 10' static units of energy.      Take r as 6370000 x
100 x 110 centim, and p as 1:39. Then the density of nega
tive energy at the surface of the sun will be
       2 T X 1-39” X 6372 x 1102 x 10'2
       9          1:54.4 x 10'          ergs per c.c.
                  = 4:289 x 10" ergs per c.c.
                  = 42.89 x 10" joules per c.c.
                   = 16 horse-power hours per c.c.
   This would seem to mean that, at a distance from all gravi
tating matter, a cubic centimetre of aether contains at least
this amount of energy.
   10. That the theory may require an even greater energy
density than this is seen as follows. Suppose the energy
of the gravitational aether to be due to vortex filaments or
tubes of directed energy interlacing in every direction.
Take at any point three axes at right angles to one another.

 366             On Electric Energy-Distribution.
The irregular distribution can be replaced in imagination by
six equal sets of filaments parallel to the positive and negative
directions of these three axes.
   In space at a great distance from gravitational matter each
of these sets of filaments will contain the same amount of
energy. Let 6a be the amount of energy in one cubic centi
metre of free aether. Let the positive direction of the X
axis at a point correspond with the positive direction of the
gravitational line of force at that point. Let b be the volume
of the gravitational energy-cell. Then five sets of filaments
in the cell may contain 5ab units of energy, and the sixth,
 which has the direction of the X-axis, ab–1 units. Alto
gether the cell will contain 6ab-1 units, while the same
volume at a distance from gravitational matter will contain
6ab units of energy.
   This would require the existence of 96 or say 100 horse
power hours in every cubic centimetre.
   11. It is an interesting question whether this theory of
energy-distribution in gravitational aether is or is not the
simplest and most probable. That other distributions are
conceivable appears' evident. For example, the aether along
the straight line joining the centres of two bodies might be
regarded as a stretched elastic cord, the laws of contraction
being of course quite different from those which hold for
ordinary elastic bodies.
   Another explanation which seems possible in the case of
two gravitational particles is as follows. In the energy dia
gram for two equal electrified particles with opposite sign,
suppose each infinitesimal tube of polarization to be divided
into two equal tubes with opposite directions. If they are
regarded as vortex filaments, each vortex will work in with
its neighbours rotating the other way, like one friction
pulley on another.
   Then it is clear that there is no way in which we can
regard the two particles as opposed in sign, and yet if each
of the two sets of vortex filaments acts as electrostatic tubes
always act, the particles will be attracted together.
   The energy-flow in this case will be as indicated in fig. 1,
and the distribution of energy-density as in fig. 3. It has
not been found possible to map the energy field in this manner
for three or more particles. Indeed, the difficulties are such
that it seems improbable that this method can be applied.
   12. In conclusion it may be well to notice again the as
sumption on which this paper is based: that the energy-cells
preserve their identity, and carry the same energy with them
throughout their path. It is not clear that this is necessarily

   true. It may be that energy passes from the potential into
   the kinetic form in the aether itself, and not merely on the
   surface of the molecules. Kinetic energy may consist of the
   motion of the whole system of energy-cells. This would lead
   us very near the theory which regards the molecule as being
   nothing but the mathematical centre from which forces pro

   extension.                                                                  -

                many fascinations. No student of mathematical physics,

   § 1. A"'            a year ago several instruments for deter
                mining the coefficients of a Fourier Series
   expressing the equation to a given curve were described
   before this Society by Professor Henricit. One of them,
   Professor Henrici's shifting-table analyser, used a planimeter
   as the integrator; an arrangement that seemed to me very
   noteworthy from the point of view of simplicity and cheap
   ness. The analyser I am going to describe also uses a
   planimeter: consequently it can also only give the value of
   one coefficient at a time.
      § 2. Let PQR be the curve to be analysed.                  Let the base
   PR range from a = -l to a E + l, and the equation to the
   curve in terms of a Fourier Series be

These are the integrals which any harmonic analyser has to
evaluate.
   Now suppose we have a circular disk, centre K (fig. 1),
constrained to keep in contact with a straight line XX
parallel to PR, and capable of rolling along XX without
slip. Further, let XX be capable of motion in the plane in
a vertical but not a horizontal direction, so that every point
fixed in it describes a perpendicular to PR. Then we can
make the point K trace out any arbitrary curve by moving
XX and rolling the disk along it.
   Bring K over P, and then mark any point D on the
horizontal diameter at a distance r from the centre (not
necessarily inside the disk). Starting from P carry K right
round PQR and back to P again by the motion just
described. Supposing the circumference of the disk to be an
aliquot part of PR, say 2l/n, let us find the area of the curve
traced out by D during this operation. As the disk turns
through an angle 2nt in rolling along a length 2l of XX,         4.
it will turn through n'Tayl in a distance v ; so if a., y be the
coordinates of K at some point on its journey, the corre
sponding coordinates of D will be

where, to fix the sign, we have assumed D to lie initially to
the left of K and XX to lie above the disk, as in the figure.
    Hence the area traced out by D is

            + 7". COS nT \sin n6 de-r' sin n6 d (cos nô).
The last two integrals vanish on taking them round a closed
curve. Nothing is added to either of the first two by con
tinuing the integration from R back to P, as y is then zero.
Therefore, calling the area of the whole curve PQR a, we
have

Similarly, if D had been initially on the vertical instead of on
the horizontal diameter, and below K, we should have had

Care must be taken with regard to the sign on the right-hand
side if any other initial position of disk and line be assumed
than that dealt with above.
    § 3. These two equations contain the whole theory of my
instrument; they show how to construct a curve the area of
which gives the required coefficients. The geometrical
mechanism seems to me to be somewhat interesting, and to
be possibly capable of generalization by the use of noncircular
disks.
    The area of the D-curve (in dealing with a material
instrument) might be obtained in two ways. We might put
a pencil through the disk at D, draw the curve, and integrate
 it afterwards: or we might attach the pointer of an integrator
to D and let the integrating go on simultaneously with the
following of the curve.
    It is the latter alternative that I have adopted. The former
method would have some advantages, but would be slow and
would lead to mechanical difficulties.

370               Mr. G. U. Yule on a Simple
   §4. The first analyser on this principle was made for me
last summer by Mr. James Hicks. Though suffering from
sundry defects (due entirely to my own design) it proved a
really useful and workable analyser, but required too much
care and patience in use. The construction has now been
entirely revised. The present instrument, designed by Mr.
Horace Darwin and made by the Cambridge Scientific
Instrument Company, is the final outcome. For several
suggestions I am indebted to Professor Karl Pearson.
   The ruler XX of fig. 1 is a rolling parallel ruler with a
rack cut along its front edge (fig. 2). The weight of the
                              Fig. 2.

rack is counterbalanced by a block projecting from the back
of the rule. Normally this block swings just clear of the
paper, but it may be held down when one wants to keep the
ruler still.                                          -    . . .
    Corresponding to the disk of fig. 1 we have a series of
toothed wheels; the number of teeth in the successive sizes
being 240, 120, 80, and so on. Four of these disks have
 actually been made; they would probably be workable up to
the sixth. The analyser is intended to work to a base-length
 of 30 centim.; the rack being cut 8 teeth to a centimetre.
The ruler itself is made longer for the sake of stability.      -
    The largest disk is the simplest. It is a flat disk of brass
with teeth cut round the edge. Three windows are cut
through it. One, in the centre, is glazed, and the centre of

                 Form of Harmonic Analyser.                371
the glass is marked (on the side next the paper) with a black
dot, the “tracing dot.” The two remaining windows are
provided with reference marks that give with the centre dot
a base-line for setting the disk in any desired position. ... A
small conical hole is made in the top of the disk, on a radius
perpendicular to its base-line at a distance 10/T centimetres
from the centre. This hole serves to receive the tracing
point of an ordinary Amsler planimeter, which performs the
integration. The smaller disks are built up in three layers
a flat bottom plate, the toothed wheel, and a projecting crank,
in the top of which is the planimeter hole. This hole is
outside the circumference of the toothed wheel, so a crank or
some such device is necessary. The crank swings clear
above the rack when the wheel is in gear. The windows are
arranged as in the first disk.                 -
   § 5. The ordinary pattern Amsler planimeter with an arm
about 16 centim. long does very well, but the tracer must be
made vertically adjustable. The alteration is easily made
without risk of damage. The planimeter remains of course
available for its ordinary purposes, and for the determination
of the absolute term.
   The travel of the ruler is limited in two ways: first by the
“reach” of the planimeter, secondly by the risk of running the
reading wheel into the rack. Curves to be analysed must
 consequently be drawn to a moderate scale, but the per
 missible magnitude varies with the type of curve. If the
type be anything like (1) of fig. 3 (sine type), 10 centim.
                               Fig. 3.
 amplitudes can be taken in comfortably; but if the type be
 that of (2) in the same figure, a considerably smaller scale

372                Mr. G. U. Yule on a Simple
must be used.       In cases of physical curves (e.g. E.M.F.
curves of alternators, conduction-of-heat curves) one is
generally free to choose the limits of the period so as to
bring the curve to the desired type.
   The accuracy of the instrument will be measured by the
accuracy of the planimeter. This cannot be fairly stated in
percentages, as an error of unity in the vernier reading is
never difficult, and may be anything per cent. in a small
total. I strongly recommend drawing curves on cardboard;
it is much more favourable to the planimeter than drawing
paper. The following tests may be taken as typical of the
results that are obtained with care : the curves were drawn
on card : —
(1) Actual curve,                                              -
    3:13 + 4-60 cos 6+ 1.82 cos 26+ 39 cos 36 + 045 cos 46.

        6:37 sin 6–3, 18 sin 20+2:12 sin 36-1:59 sin 46.

       6:39 sin 6–3.20 sin 26 + 2.11 sin 36–1.58 sin 46.
   The units are centimetres.
   § 6. So much for the accuracy and range of the instrument.
   To get any desired coefficient, the ruler is set with its edge
parallel to the curve-base and with the proper disk in gear.
Ruler and disk are then adjusted till the tracing-dot stands
over the point P (fig. 1), and the base-line of the disk is
either vertical or horizontal according as a sine or cosine
term is wanted. The planimeter-point is finally dropped
into the hole provided for it, and the tracing-dot carried com
pletely round the curve. The resulting planimeter reading
will be the area of the curve plus or minus 10 n times the
desired coefficient.
   Both hands must be used in guiding the disk, as rack and
disk have to be held together while the latter is turned. The
 operator forms, in fact, an essential link of our mechanism
which without him is unconstrained.      It is this liberal use of
the operator that enables me to dispense with slides, carriages,
 and other expensive things, and thus gain in simplicity.
    $ 7. This analyser arose from a simple form of step-by-step
 integrator or “adder” which may be worth a brief descrip
tion. The instrument is shown diagrammatically in fig. 4: it
was made from materials at hand and I describe it as made.

   Mark off along the base of the curve to be analysed a

Suppose the pointer P of the planimeter to rest initially at
the zero of the scale, and the tracer T attached to the set
square to stand over the origin of the curve. Pull the card
forward, carry T to the top of yi, and then shift P to 6° on the
scale. Pull the card forward again, carry T to the top of y2,
and then shift P to 12°.       Continue this procedure right on
to the end of the curve.

   Thus the planimeter-reading after this procedure gives us
the first cosine coefficient.     £ not enter at length into
the mode of getting the others. For the second coefficient
one would have to shift the tracer P 12° at a time instead of
 6°, and so on.
    In my case I actually used steps of 6°, as above; and there
were three scales on EFG going by steps of 6°, 12°, and 18°
respectively for the first three terms, the separation of the
scales helping to avoid confusion. The results were good : for
example, in one test the actual coefficients were 482, 1:09, '009:
the instrument gave 4'86, 1:08, '01. The chief objection to
 such a non-automatic integrator is of course that one is liable
to forget to shift the planimeter pointer at some stage of the
 proceedings. The chief advantage is that your curve need
 not be drawn to any particular base-length. Whatever the
 base, it is only necessary to divide it into the proper number
 of equal parts, and erect the ordinates at the centres of these
 elements.
    Suppose we wished to make the arrangement automatic.
 We might substitute for the harmonic motion of P along SS a
 circular motion round the centre of SS. This merely amounts
 to giving P another harmonic motion (perpendicular to SS),
 a proceeding which adds nothing to the planimeter-reading
 if the integration be continued completely round the curve.
    But this is not an easy motion to obtain mechanically. The
 difficulty is obviated at once if we remove the card A B CD
 altogether and fix the pole of the planimeter in the drawing
 board. If we give P the same circular motion as before we
 have the “disk” analyser, which I described in the first
 part of this paper. The area of the curve analysed is added
 to the integral given by the planimeter, but that is all.
    Evidently in the instrument of fig. 4 we have only taken
 a special case in making the scales scales of sines. We might
 have used scales graduated proportionally to w” and got
 moments. Any other integral could be obtained approxi
 mately if a proper scale could be drawn.

      XXXVI. The Clark Cell when producing a Current.
          To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
    GENTLEMEN,
 IN the     Philosophical Magazine for March 1895 you have
      published a letter from Professor Threlfall criticising my
experiments on the Clark cell when producing a current. I
should like to reply to some points in it.
    Professor Threlfall quotes my definition of the quantity
 which I have called the polarization of the cell. The method
 of determining this quantity depended on measuring sepa
rately the resistance of the contents of the cell treated as an
 electrolyte and of the wire through which the cell was used to
maintain a current. Knowing the current, I calculated the
E.M.F. required to maintain it in an equivalent wholly
metallic circuit having a resistance equal to the sum of these
two values.    The difference between this E.M.F. and that of
the cell at rest I tabulated as the polarization with varying
current-density. This point was considered very carefully by
me at the time, and it appeared that the resistance of the con
tents of the cell could only be changed through unequal
migration of ions and electrolytic endosmose. Now the effect of
these two causes would be permanent when the cell was again
placed on open circuit; and so if measurements, taken before
and after the cell was used did not show any wide divergence,
it is legitimate to assume that whilst the current was flowing
the resistance would lie somewhere between these two values.
This is the reason which led me to adopt this method of
statement of results.
   The actual measurement of the resistance of the cell showed,
as I expected, very little change. The testing-current was
of the order of 007 ampere.
   The temperature of the 147 ohm wire through which the
current of approximately .01 ampere was maintained could
not have been far different from that of the oil-bath.         A
current of this magnitude would only produce 12.6 gram
Centigrade thermal units in one hour; and as the wire
(20 grams) was openly wound “on an ebonite frame,” it does
not seem likely that it would have been much hotter than the
oil. It would require a rise of 10°C. to produce a change of
'6 ohm. The case is not at all comparable with Mr. Griffiths',
where current up to an ampere was used. Besides, it must
be remembered that any possible error in the resistance of
this wire would have very little influence on the magnitude
of the quantity which I have  :

 376        The Clark Cell when producing a Current.
    My results when the current was maintained indicate that
 the potential-difference at the electrodes became less. In my
 earliest experiments, when two Leclanché cells were used in
 the potentiometer circuit, I found an effect similar to that
 observed by Professor Threlfall. This is stated in my paper,
 § 5 and § 7, and as such a result was not expected and did
 not for many reasons seem to be connected with the Clark
 cell, I placed large Clark cells in the place of the Leclanchés.
    The considerations which led me to make this change may
 be shortly summarized. Firstly, the comparison of the size
of the plates in the two cells is greatly in favour of the large
 Clark, and also the soluble depolarizer in that cell would cause
more efficient depolarization.     Secondly, I have frequently
observed when using the potentiometer that the same value
may be obtained for the potential-difference of a short
circuited Clark before and after an interval during which the
Clark has been on open circuit, provided no large plug change
has been made during the interval. On the other hand, a
large plug change, such as testing the E.M.F. of the cell with
its poles open will lead to a new value when its poles are
again closed. Thirdly, when determining the absolute value
# the E.M.F. of the Clark cell with Mr. Glazebrook (Phil.
Trans. 1892), we thought it safer to avoid large plug altera
tions, and so abandoned this process to adopt one in which a
mercurial rheostat in the main circuit could be varied so as to
maintain the electrodes of the standard resistance at a constant
difference of potential. With this alteration my experiments
became regular; seven sets were obtained (one lasted 16
hours), and I was satisfied that the original irregularity was
due to the Leclanchés. The average of four sets is given in
my paper. If I were to repeat these measurements I should
now use one large accumulator and a wire rheostat for that
  art of the potentiometer where alterations of resistance would
£ to be made, and thus avoid all rapid plug changes.         This
arrangement would, I am sure, give better results.
    My object in referring to Mr. Fitzpatrick’s paper in the
easily accessible B.A. Reports was to avoid a lengthy descrip
tion of an apparatus which is in continuous use in the
Cavendish Laboratory.        In his paper Mr. Fitzpatrick has
made the proper references to Macgregor's and Professor
Kohlrausch's well-known work.

XXXVII. On some Evperiments with Alternating Currents.
   By A. SADowsky, University Professor in Turiew (Dorpat),
   Russia".
         To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
   GENTLEMEN,
IN No. 238 (vol. xxxix., 1895) of your valuable               Magazine
      Mr. Griffiths has published a paper on “Some Experi
ments with Alternating Currents,” in which he describes
some experiments with Lenard’s bismuth spiral. I was inves
tigating the same subject in 1892–1893, and obtained the
following results, agreeing well with those of Mr. Griffiths.
   (1) With the bismuth spiral in a strong field absolute
silence in the telephone is never obtained, but only a minimum
of sound.
   (2) The superficial distribution of alternating currents is
without influence on the resistance.
   (3) The resistance of bismuth depends on the phase of the
current.
   The following results are similar to those of Mr. Griffiths,
but do not coincide with them in every respect:—
   (1) The bismuth spirals have something like the self
induction, but not equivalent to it; I have tried the hypothesis
                                       X di
                          r=r (1+ #)
where ro is the resistance for a constant current,
       i the current,
        X a constant positive coefficient, and
       r apparent resistance (measured with a Wheatstone
               ridge and telephone).
   Under this hypothesis r must be always > r, which does
not agree with the experiments of Lenard, Zahn, and myself.
   (2) I have observed the difference of resistance with fre
quency 500 without field to be as stated by Messrs. Lenard
and Zahn; the resistance with a constant current was greater
(0.1 per cent.).
   In addition to the above, I have found the following:—
   (1) M. Lenard’s statement that the difference of resistance
is due to the currents of great frequency, i. e. 10,000, is
erroneous. Let ordinates of the curve A B C D represent the

three parts AB, BC, CD, such that AB = BC; - C, D (ap
proximately), and measure the resistance with the currents

 p1, p.2, p.3, I have obtained experimentally :

                               p1 > p2 > p3.
    Taking p, as unity, the following figures are obtained for
 four spirals:—

                      1:0030                  0.9940            *
                      1.0036                  0.9943
    If we take the currents represented by the curves figs. 2 and 3
 and measure the same pi, p.2, p.3, we obtain as above,
                                p1 > 02 > p3;
 but the differences p1-p2 and p3-p3 are much smaller than
 with the current ABCD.
     My method of experimenting for obtaining the data for pi,
  ps, and ps was similar to that of Mr. Griffiths. The alter
  nating current was supplied by a small magneto-electric
  machine set in motion by an electromotor. This current was
  sent through a Wheatstone bridge, in one branch of which
  was placed a bismuth spiral. The galvanometer branch
  contained an automatic double intermittent contact (rotated
  by the magneto-electric machine supplying the alternating

current), by which it was possible to complete the circuit of
the galyanometer for the parts of the current AB or BC, and
BC or CD, and thus to compare immediately p, with p, and
P2 with O3.
   In the first part of my investigation I measured without
field the resistance of a bismuth spiral with a telephone, and

electromotor; the frequency of interruption varied between 92

between 0.12 and 0.27 per cent.

THIS     new edition of an important geological work has been
      “largely rewritten” by the Author, and contains two new
chapters on the “Glacial Phenomena of North America,” by
Professor T. C. Chamberlin.              -
  As a systematic account of the visible results of ice-action on a
large scale in this part of the World, and of the probable history
of the origin, progress, and end of this period of glaciation, we
have here a valuable repertory of facts and opinions recorded by
many geological enquirers and grouped by one who has studied
the subject for almost a life-time. Formerly one of the members
of the Geological Survey engaged in mapping the geology of
Scotland, and now holding the Chair of Geology at Edinburgh,
Professor James Geikie has naturally taken up one of the most
interesting groups of geological features in that country as a

special study. The nature, characters, and distribution of the
#     (boulder-clay) and erratics, striated rock-surfaces, rock
basins, kaims and escars, beds of arctic shells, and the local alter
nations of sands, gravels, clays, and lignites with the till, have
readily attracted the attention of geologists, and the consideration
of their probable origin fully occupies the philosophic mind and
feeds the scientific imagination. As similar natural features
abound in other parts of the world, scientists of many sorts,
having concluded that ice must have been the chief agent con
cerned with these phenomena, have carefully observed its various
physical conditions, and have invented many hypotheses about its
movements and their results. The compilation of these facts and
opinions, here offered by the Author, is naturally affected by his
own predilections and conscientious beliefs, which occasionally
lead him to oppose or ignore some even late researches on ice
fields and superficial drifts.
   The “List of Authors quoted or referred to ” (about 580) at
pages 832–838 indicates the wide extent of the literature to be
dealt with ; and Prof. J. Geikie intimates with truth that the list
does not exhaust what has been published about the facts and
inferences relating to glacial phenomena and the former existence
of wide-spread and intense action of Ice on some parts of the
Earth's surface.
   In the first (1874) and second (1878) editions of this book,
“The Great Ice-Age and its relation to the Antiquity of Man,”
Scotland supplied, as now, the typical facts and phenomena of a
Glacial region, with its subsequent (Post-glacial) conditions; and,
as great changes of climate seemed to be involved in that geo
logical history, these were considered on the basis then regarded
as the best available. Clearer recognition of leading facts, and
their more perfect explanation, have much modified the hypotheses
that were then received as good and useful; and the Author
in this, the Third Edition, endeavours to give his opinion clearly
on the results both of the new and extended examinations of the
physical phenomena, and of many criticisms on the one hand, and
helpful suggestions on the other.
   In the order of the subject-matters of the book, the glacial
deposits seen in Scotland come first, with the boulder-clay, its
composition, relative position, special characters, and local features.
Various modes of its origin, hypothetically advanced, whether by
violent aqueous agency, or by the mediation of glaciers and ice
bergs, are dealt with ; and a careful account is given of glaciers,
and of the modes and results of their action on the surface of the
ground.
   Chapter IV. is devoted to icy Greenland and its supposed
constitution of separate islands; and treats of Arctic glaciers,
with icebergs, foot-ice, and sea-ice, and the littoral accumulations
of earthy and stony débris. These are illustrative of much of
the ice-work which has modified the surface of Scotland.
   The glacial origin of the Till being accepted, there follows a

consideration of the probable modes and processes of ice-action
in producing its clay and stones, and in grinding, rounding,
polishing, and scoring the latter (Chapters W. and WI.). Doubtless
the glacier, as is well known, could do all this; but it is very
doubtful indeed if the boulder-clay was a persistent floor of any
glacier; or that the stones were not all derived from the frozen
rocks of the valley giving off their débris from the sides to its
surface.     No ice could tear solid blocks from the floor.   Water
running beneath the glacier carries along abundant mud and sand
amidst the grinding pebbles of the so-called “moraine profonde;”
and, though some layers are lodged in hollows and quiet recesses,
the rest passes on towards the glacier's foot, wherever that may
be, in river, fiord, or open sea. These considerations, as to
whether it was a persistent bed on the glacier's floor (quite
impossible), or accumulated at its foot by water, with or without
icebergs and ice-floes, necessarily affect the explanation of the
local occurrences and disposition of the Boulder-clay, also of its
 recurrence after the existence of a land-surface, and of its occa
 sional fossil shells and other organisms.
    The physical evidences of ancient ice-sheets (“mers de glace”)
 affecting Scandinavia and the British Isles, and regarded as
 having been more or less conterminous or continuous, are enlarged
 upon, and Pl. IX., opposite page 437, delineates the supposed
 greatest extent of this glaciation. Whether, however, this con
 dition existed over the European area uniformly at one and the same
 time, and how thick the main ice-sheet may have been, are points
 not yet proved to the satisfaction of all. In this, as in some
 other cases, the Author prefers to collate and use the ideas and
 statements supporting his views, without reference to contrary
 opinions.
     Stratified and unstratified beds associated with the Scottish
 Till form the text of Chapters VII. to XIII. At page 89 allusion
 is made to “gravel, sand, silt, mud, brick-clay, and peat” that
 underlie the lower till, and to similar beds lying upon it and
 covered by the upper till. Some such deposits contain freshwater
  fossils, and in some others there are marine shells.   These “beds
  below and in the till” are stated (p. 192) to indicate pauses in its
  formation (though the lowest, being beneath, would seem to have
  been formed previously ), and to have been due to ordinary
  water-action. They are often of great interest, and have been
  carefully examined by the geologists of Scotland wherever met
  with in exposures, diggings, and borings. From them much has
  been gathered as to the probable changes of fauna and flora under
  different successive climates (“recurrent cold and warm periods”);
  also of the former varying lines of rivers and lakes, and of the
  conditions and features of the country during the formation of
  these “glacial” and “interglacial” deposits.
      Chapters XIV. to XVII. treat of glacial deposits overlying the
  till of Scotland, and their origin. These are the asar (escars) and
  kames, ridges, mounds, and terraces of gravel and sand, due to

the material of moraines of probably decaying glaciers having been
shifted and arranged by strong streams of water running there
from ; hence they are said to have been formed by fluvio-glacial
agency. Scattered blocks (“erratic”), brought from a distance
and left on the melting of the ice, and morainic accumulations
left in mountain-valleys, come in the same category as the above.
   Lakes and rock-basins occupy Chapters XVIII. and XIX.
Several modes of origin are known for lakes, and some are briefly
mentioned here. For lakes in the supposed ice-ploughed hollows
                                                                      *
in solid rock, a favourite subject with his friend the late Sir
Andrew Ramsay, Prof. J. Geikie advances all the evidence he can,
ignoring what has been brought forward and published to the
 contrary.
   Chapters XX. and XXI. explain that other superficial deposits
 later in age than the “upper till” were brought about by the
 existence of “district ice-sheets and local glaciers,” belonging to
 Dr. J. Geikie's “third glacial epoch” (p. 283). These, he thinks,
 succeeded “interglacial” conditions, and were locally coincident
with some shelly deposits on the sea-board, especially along the
Firths of the Clyde and Forth. It is to this period that the
Author now refers the origin of the “parallel roads of Glenroy”
 by the intervention of the great western ice crossing the neigh
bouring valleys lower down and thereby causing lakes, as first
suggested by Agassiz, and subsequently defined by Jamieson and
Prestwich (p. 283).
   Later formations, either within, or just subsequent to the
Glacial Period are noted in Chapters XXII. & XXIII., as peat
bogs, raised beaches, sand-dunes, river-terraces, and old lake-beds,
bearing recognizable evidence of their relative age, contemporary
with a partial submergence of the land; and with a cold climate,
destructive of the forests and giving rise to some highland glaciers.
A repetition of the foregoing or similar conditions; and then the
last elevation of the land, and the arrival of the present state of
things, constitute part of the eleven successive changes, from the
“lower till” to the existing land and sea, succinctly enumerated
at page 325, so far as Scotland is concerned.
   We are now led to the consideration of glacial phenomena met
with (1) in England and Ireland; (2) Northern Europe; (3)
Central Europe; (4) the Alps, and other parts of Europe, in
Chapters XXIV. to XXXVI. This last chapter enumerating five
glacial epochs, each with its interglacial epoch, brings us to
present or, rather, prehistoric times, and comprises long periods
during which Man has existed in this part of the World.
   The last or “present” epoch (p. 612) was “marked in Britain by
the retreat of the sea to its present level, and by the return of
milder and drier conditions, and the final disappearance of
permanent snow-fields.”
   The Author arranges the “glacial succession” in the British
Islands as follows (beginning with the lowest) —

         feet.
   The contemporary European formations for each of the eleven
above-mentioned epochs follow at pages 614 and 615.
   In arriving at his conclusions as to the succession of the
“Glacial” deposits, and as to the conditions under which they were
probably formed, the Author has evidently been specially influenced
by his belief that the main agents have been enormous “ice
sheets” and their supposititious “ground moraines,” of great
thickness and consistency; and not separate glaciers, icebergs,
ice-floes, and coast-ice, making and distributing mud and sand with
gravel and boulders, and helping to make up the full score of
striae. For the changes of climate accounting for the coming and
going of the seemingly probable arctic and temperate conditions,
indicated by the glacial and non-glacial phenomena, the Author
favours the astronomical (Croll and Ball) hypothesis.
   Prof. Geikie argues assiduously and plausibly on all these
points, without allowing full weight to published objections. An
ideal moraine profonde, such as would suit a widely continuous and
thick “boulder-clay,” would far exceed the limited dimensions
   * See above, p. 881, for some remarks on the moraines profondes, sup
posititious as far as the great boulder-clays are concerned,

 and conditions of the movable mixture of mud, sand, and stones,
  that grind and are ground on a glacier's floor, until they find exit
  at the terminal moraine, or are taken off by icebergs to form
  submarine till.   If the maxima, or even the existence, of ice
  sheet periods are to be calculated according to the extent and
  thickness of such supposed boulder-clay floors (hundreds of feet
  thick), the calculations must be erroneous: whilst doubtless the
  distribution, by river, lake, and sea, of the clay and stones
  resulting from the grinding work of the glaciers simply and
  satisfactorily meets many of the geological requirements.              *
     A very large amount of instructive geological detail, obtained
  by personal research and from a variety of sources, is arranged
  systematically in treating of stratified and other formations whose
  origin was in any way associated with periods of extreme cold and
  with milder intermediate times,—for Scotland (as we have seen)
  in Chapters II. to XXIII.; for England in Chapters XXIV. to
  XXVII.; and for Ireland in Chapter XXVIII. The amount of
 information collected for Europe (Northern, Middle, Alpine,
  and Western) in Chapters XXIX. to XXXVI. is extensive, and
  is carefully arranged; resulting (pages 607–615) in the Author's
 determination of six glacial epochs, each with its sequent interglacial
 period; the last of the latter exists at present time.
     He supports this frequency of climatal changes by reference to
 his interpretation of successive glacial and non-glacial deposits,
 and the concomitant topographical modifications in the outlines,
 heights, and depths of land and water. These being more
 numerous and complicated than they were thought to be when his          3.
 earlier editions were published.
     A careful study of the many published accounts of the nature,
 extent, and origin of the Loess or Lehm is given in Chapter
 XXXVIII. This Pleistocene deposit is described as a fluvio
 glacial inundation-deposit, largely modified and rearranged by
 wind, snow, and dust-storms, and naturally containing multi
 tudinous mammalian bones, many land-shells, and other rarer
 fossil remains. It necessarily constitutes an important link among
 the results of the dying ice-age, and the gradual disappearance of
the glaciers.
    The advent of a cold climate was indicated for Europe in the
Pliocene times; and the maximum of cold occurred in the “Second
Glacial Epoch.” Then the alternating cold and temperate periods
successively declined in importance. Palaeolithic Man is regarded
 (p. 689) as having appeared in Europe in Pleistocene times,
probably not before the “Second Interglacial Epoch’” (Elephas            f
antiquus stage); and, surviving the “Third Glacial Epoch,” he
probably retired to Southern France, and to Switzerland and the
country of the Danube.
    Respecting the relative chronology of the Glacial Epoch and the
appearance of European Man, it may be well to note that Dr. Croll
at first suggested that the beginning of the Glacial Period may

                   Motices respecting New Books.                 385
have been about 1,000,000 years ago, and that it may have lasted
about 2,000,000 years; afterwards he approximately fixed the
incoming of that Period at 240,000 years ago, and its termination
about 160,000 years afterwards (80,000 years ago). Prof. Prest
wich considers that Palaeolithic Man, that is, the man of the Walley
drifts, appeared in Western Europe probably not longer ago than
about 20,000 or 30,000 years, and disappeared about 10,000 or
more years ago. He was probably preceded by the Plateau or
Eolithic Man (referred to in the footnote at page 640), before
the time of extreme glaciation; and he was certainly succeeded,
with some intervening lapse of time (page 619), by the Neolithic
Man.
   Before taking up the subject of glacial phenomena in Asia,
Australia, and North and South America, in Chapters XL. to XLII.,
Prof. Geikie gives two interesting chapters on Cave-deposits,
Walley-drifts, and the Loess of Central Europe. The last of these
has been already referred to. The first involves a consideration of
the two Stone Periods (old and new), and evidences of human work
and occupation in England and France. For the Walley-drifts
M. Ladrière's results are given in detail, in preference to Prof.
Prestwich's work; and, though the latter is not lost sight of, the
treatment is one-sided (pp. 629–637), brief references being made
to Prestwich's elaborate memoirs explanatory of river-gravels, and
a full account given of M. Ladrière's paper illustrative of views
which appear somewhat artificial. So also we should like to have
seen further references to Prestwich’s work and views on the
Pliocene Crags and the associated Pleistocene Beds of the Eastern
Counties, besides the useful notes derived from Mr. Clement
Reid's excellent memoir (pp. 329–336); and, with reference (in
the footnote at p. 603) to the “rubble-drift,” we may observe
that the Author should have remembered that Prestwich limited
its range to 1000 feet in England only, and gave several cases
where it exceeds 1500 and 2000 feet on the Continent.            His
name also might with advantage have been given (at p. 392) at
the same time as Mr. A. Collinette's. Prof. Bonney's researches
on ice-work and its results seem to have altogether escaped notice.
It may be that, with the multiplicity of facts and inferences
 athered for assimilation whilst preparing a voluminous work, an
Author can scarcely avoid handling some subjects and some
writers less carefully and judiciously than others. Prof. Geikie
seems to be aware of this; and apologises in his Preface for any
such inadvertencies and shortcomings.
   Professor Chamberlin's two Chapters on the Glacial phenomena
of North America (pages 724–775) give a concise and clear account
of the enormously extensive glacial drifts covering nearly one half
of the country. The great ice-field of Greenland, as now, lay
formerly to the north-east; and on the mainland glaciers were
formed on the high grounds of Canada and Labrador, spreading
and coalescing into the great so-called Laurentide ice-sheet. On

the west side of the Rocky Mountains and Cordilleras confluent
glaciers were another centre for the formation and dispersion of
“drift.” The glacial deposits of North America, numerous,
extensive, and thick, overlapping one another, reach southwards
to the coast of New York and New Jersey, and over-ride the
States that lie north of the Ohio and Missouri.
    The till, drumlins, escars, kames, sand-plains, glacio-fluvial

                  , SILVERING GLASS IN THE COLD.
              BY MM. AUGUSTE AND LOUIS LUMIERE.
    OR silvering glass in the cold, a number of methods have been
      described which appear open to the objection of being very
complicated, and of requiring very minute precautions.
   In investigating the properties of formic aldehyde, we have
observed that this substance gives with ammoniacal solutions of
silver nitrate, adherent mirrors which can be readily polished.
By working under suitable conditions, we have observed that the
greater part of the silver contained in the solutions is deposited on
the glass, thus avoiding residues and diminishing the cost.
   After numerous trials we have arrived at the following method.
   100 cubic centim. are taken of a 10-per cent. solution of silver
nitrate to which ammonia is added drop by drop, so as just to
redissolve the precipitate formed at first. Care must be taken to
avoid an excess of ammonia, which would hinder the formation of
the deposit. The volume of the solution is made up to a litre by
distilled water, and we thus obtain what we shall call A.
   On the other hand, commercial formaldehyde of 40 per cent. is
diluted with distilled water so as to form a 1-per cent solution.
Owing to its dilution this solution, B, may be kept for some time.
   The surface of the glass is carefully polished by rubbing it with
chamois covered with rouge, and two volumes of A are rapidly
mixed with one volume of B, and the mixture is rapidly poured
over the glass to be coated.
   In five or six minutes, at the temperature of 15° to 19°, all the
silver in the solution is deposited in a brilliant layer which is
washed with water.      It is then dried, and varnished if the surface
in contact with the glass is to be the reflecting surface, or
polished with the ordinary precautions where the layer itself is
to be used as in astronomical instruments.—Journal de Physique,
 January 1895.
             ION THE   GLOW-DISCHARGE.       BY A. HERZ.
   The results of this research are summed up by the author as
 follows:—
   1. The potential gradient v in the positive unstratified glow
light with constant current diminishes as the current i increases,
 and the value of this decrease is given with sufficient accuracy by
the equation
                             v=vo-b(i—i.).
    The value b, that is the decrease of the gradients for unit
 increase of the current strength, decreases as the width of the tube
 in the clear increases, and for the same width has almost the
 same value for nitrogen and for hydrogen.

     2. The potential gradient in question decreases as the clear
  width of the tube increases; and
     3. Increases as the pressure increases, but more slowly than in
  proportion to the pressure.
     4. For nitrogen quite free from oxygen it is, for pressures
 between 4 and 8 mm., 1:4 times as much as hydrogen.

   Art. 3. The Prize Committee has at its disposal a sum of four
thousand five hundred francs, of which a first prize, of no less
than three thousand francs, will be awarded and minor prizes for
the remaining sum.
    Art. 4. The work to which the first prize is awarded remains
the property of Schnyder von Wartensee's Foundation, which has
to arrange with the author regarding its publication.

XL. Tests of Glow-Lamps, and Description of the Measuring
   Instruments Employed. By Prof. W. E. AYRTON, F.R.S.,
    and E. A. MEDLEY".
     HE conditions under which the glow-lamp can be most
       economically used have attracted considerable attention
since a paper entitled “The Most Economical Potential
Difference to employ with Incandescent Lamps” was read
before the Physical Society in February 1885 f by Professor
Perry and one of the authors of the present communication.
In this paper they stated that it was well known, from experi
ments made by their students in 1880, and from results
published in 1881 by Lord Kelvin, then Sir William Thomson,
as well as from subsequent experiments, that the light obtained
from an incandescent lamp increased much more rapidly
than the power expended in it; or, that the number of
candles produced per watt of power expended in the lamp
increased as the filament became hotter. But it was pointed
out in the paper in question that such experiments by them
selves gave no idea of the commercial value of any particular
 glow-lamp, because they afforded no indication of its life
when run at different efficiencies, and it was known that the
length of time a filament would last was the less the higher
its temperature.
    They then proceeded to show that the cost of lighting per
hour per candle could be divided into two parts, viz., the cost

390             Prof. Ayrton and Mr. Medley on
as to lamp renewals and the cost as to power, the first being
equal to the price of a lamp divided by the product of its life
into its candle-power, and the second to the price of one watt
hour multiplied by the watts per candle. So that, if L(v),
C(v), and W(v) were the life in hours, the candle-power, and
the watts per candle respectively expressed as functions of the
pressure in volts kept constantly on the lamp, and if p were
the price of a lamp and H the price of one watt-hour, then the
cost per hour per candle equalled
                         p                    -
                    L(v) x C(v) + Hx W(v),
and the value of v which made this expression a minimum,
they showed, was the proper P.D. to employ with the par
 ticular type of lamp.
    The authors gave two methods of solving this problem
defined by their equation of cost—the one a graphical method,
and the other an analytical one. The graphical method con
 sisted in drawing curves from the best experimental results
then available to represent L(v), C(v), and W(v) respectively
 in terms of v, and from these three curves finding the values
 of L(v), C(t), and W(v) for many values of v, then, by sub
 stitution in the cost equation, data were obtained from which a
 last curve showing the relation between potential difference
 and cost per hour per candle could be drawn.
    The curves on p. 45, Proc. Phys. Soc. vol. vii. 1885*, showed
 the results obtained when this method was applied to the case
 of 16 C.P. 100-volt Edison lamps, using as experimental data
 the results of tests, made at the Finsbury Technical College,
 on the relations between candles, volts, and watts, and the
 values of the life of this type of lamp when run at different
 pressures, as published by M. Foussat.
    The curve AAA showed the cost per candle for lamp
 renewals during 560 hours when the price of a new lamp
 was five shillings; BBB the cost per candle for power during
 the same period, one horse-power for 560 hours being reckoned
 at £5, and CCC gave the total cost per candle for 560 hours.
 The ordinate of this latter curve had a minimum at about
 101.4 volts.
    With the analytical method, on the other hand, empirical
 equations were first found to represent as nearly as possible
 the experimental results. Thus it was found that
                          1
                                  = 100.07545 v -11697
 and                L(v) + C(v)

                     Tests of Glow-Lamps.                   391
therefore the total cost per hour per candle equalled
           p10"-n" + H(3.7+10"-om").
   From this equation, using the same values for the price of
lamps and power as before, it was shown that to make the
cost a minimum the P.D. maintained between the lamp
terminals should be 101.1; a result in close agreement with
that obtained graphically.
   At the next meeting of the Physical Society a paper was
read by Dr. Fleming", in which he considered what proportion
the cost of lamp renewals should bear to the cost of power in
order that the total cost should be a minimum.     As the result
of the examination of various experiments, he showed that for
any particular type of lamp the average life could be ex
pressed as an exponential function of either the watts per
candle, or of the candle-power, or of the P.D.; that is, he
showed, for the lamps with which he was dealing, that
                             A     B      1
                      L= Wa T C8 T v
where L was the life, W the watts per candle, C the candle
power, v the P.D., and A, B, 2, 8, and y constants for any
particular type of lamp. Then, by substitution in the cost
equation already referred to, he obtained the result that for
maximum economy the cost of power must be to the cost of
renewals as a
               A-1
                 8
                     to unity.   The values for x and 8 he gave
for Edison lamps as 64 and 4 respectively; so that he finally
arrived at the result that, whatever the price of lamps, or of
electrical energy, the pressure used must be such that the
annual cost of renewals should be about 17 per cent. of the
total annual cost.
   In April 1888, in a paper read before the American Institute
of Electrical Engineers, Mr. Howell gave numerous examples
of the application of Ayrton and Perry's graphical method to
the finding of the efficiency at which various types of lamps
should be run to obtain maximum economy for various prices
of lamps and power.
   He gave a curve showing the results of his tests of Edison
lamps when run at different efficiencies, but the lamps he
used were so abnormally good, compared with any with which
we are acquainted, that his experiments have no practical
value. For example, his lamps run at 4:5 watts a candle
lasted, he says, nearly 12,000 hours.
   Further, Mr. Howell’s paper can hardly be said to have

392             Prof. Ayrton and Mr. Medley on .
advanced the matter beyond the point at which it was left
by the considerations contained in the paper on “The Most
Economical Potential Difference, &c.,” read before this Society
in 1885; for he took no account of the changes which more
recent experiments had shown to occur in lamps during their
life, and which render any results obtained by methods that
disregard these changes useless for practical purposes.
    Numerous experimenters had found out that there was a
serious diminution in the light emitted by a lamp as it grew
old, and also a very considerable rise in the watts consumed
per candle. Further, there was evidence to show that the
shape of the curve between candle-power and time was not the
same for different pressures; so that it had come to be recog
nized that, in order to determine the P.D. at which lamps
should be run, it was useless to make a comparison merely
between the efficiency of lamps when new and the number of
hours they will last at various voltages.
    Moreover, this falling-off in the quality of a lamp as it ages
led people to consider another point, viz., Might it not be
possible, in consequence of this deterioration, for a lamp to be
economically dead before the filament had actually broken?
 For the increased cost of the current required, compared
with the light given out, might more than overbalance the
 expense of replacing the lamp with a new and, therefore, more
 brilliant one.
    Before describing the results which we have obtained re
 garding this interesting question of the existence of a point,
 called by the Americans the “smashing point,” beyond which
 a lamp cannot be economically used, it will be well to shortly
 indicate the general conclusions to which previous experimen
 ters have been led from tests on the modern glow-lamp.
    In November 1892 Mr. Feldman published a table compiled
 from the results of tests made by Prof. Thomas and Messrs.
 Martin and Hassler in America, by M. Haubtmann in
 France, and from some of his own measurements, which con
 tained mean values for more than 500 lamps taken from 28
 different factories and representing 49 different types. He
 divided the lamps into five groups according to their initial
 efficiencies, and gave for each group the average candle-power
 in per cent. of the initial candle-power and the average watts
  per candle at every hundred hours in the lives of the lamps.
  The curves in figs. 1 and 2 are drawn from the figures given
  in this table, fig. 1 showing the candle-power and fig, 2 the
  watts per candle as the lamps grow old. The numbers I., II.,
  III., IV., and W. on the curves refer to the initial efficiencies

   seen from the table on fig. 1, the curves marked I. are drawn
   from results obtained from lamps which initially required
   from 2 to 2.5 watts per candle; for curves marked II, the
   initial consumption was 2.5 to 3 watts per candle; for curves
   III. from 3 to 3-5; for curves IV. from 3.5 to 4; and for
   curves V. above 4 watts per candle.
       These curves show that the fall in candle-power varied
    from 40 to 65 per cent. in 1200 hours, or, rejecting lamps
    having as low an initial consumption as from 2 to 2.5 watts
    per candle, Mr. Feldman's curves would lead us to expect
    that the candle-power of an average lamp would fall about
    40 per cent. in 1000 hours.

    of Professor Thomas’ tests made in 1892 on 127 lamps of 13
    American makes, it can be seen that the average American
    lamp of that date dropped about 43 per cent. in candle
    power in 1000 hours, the watts per candle in the same time
    rising from 42 to 6.9. The curves marked M on the same
    figure show the results obtained from the best make of lamp
    tested by Professor Thomas; the average of the 10 lamps
    tested showed a drop of 30 per cent. in candle-power in 1000
    hours, and a rise from 4:8 to 6:1 in watts per candle.
        In September 1892 M. Haubtmann published tests on

                      Tests of Glow-Lamps.                     395
many European makes of lamps. The curves in fig. 4 show
the results he obtained from testing twenty 16 C.P. Edison

Swan lamps, ten at 102 and ten at 110 volts. Those run at
 102 volts showed a drop of about 30 per cent. in candle-power
in 1000 hours, the watts per candle rising in the same time
from 3.27 to 44; the lamps run at 110 volts in 1000 hours
dropped 28 per cent. in candle-power and rose from 3:35 to
4:58 watts per candle.
   If, now, in the light of the knowledge obtained from these
experiments, we look at the equation of cost quoted in the
beginning of this paper, we see that some changes must be made
in it before it expresses the truth. As originally given it
was:—Cost per hour per candle equals
                     —"—
                                  +H x W(v);
                     L(v) x C(v)
but, as neither the candle-power nor the watts per candle
remain constant throughout the life of the lamp, L(v) x C(v)
does not give the total candle-hours obtained during the
lamp's life, and neither does H x W(v) give the true cost of
power per hour per candle. The equation must, therefore, be
written:—Cost per hour per candle equals                        -
       —"—
       total candle-Hours." H x average watts per candle.

396                Prof. Ayrton and Mr. Medley on
   Exactly what these changes in the equation mean will be
best shown by working out the results for a particular type
of lamp, and for this purpose we have chosen the American
make tested by Professor Thomas, the life curves of which are
shown marked M in fig. 3.
    It is clear, from these curves, that knowing the initial
candle-power, in this case about 12:5, we can calculate at
any time during the life of a lamp the total candle-hours
 obtained and the average watts consumed per candle during
 that time, and by substituting these quantities in the equation
 of cost we can find the cost per hour per candle averaged over
 the number of hours considered.

                       Tests of Glow-Lamps.                  397
In calculating the figures from which the bottom curve is
plotted, we have taken the cost of a new lamp as one shilling,
and the price of a Board of Trade unit as 43d, and, as seen,
the ordinate of this curve reaches a minimum at about 600
hours, when the cost per hour per candle has dropped to
0.0235 pence. Beyond this point the curve begins to ascend;
that is, when a new lamp costs one shilling, and a kilowatt
hour 4'd., and lamps whose life-histories are truly represented
by the curves M in fig. 3 are employed, the cost of obtaining
light is least if the lamps are used for 600 hours only, because
after that time their diminished quality more than overbalances
the cost of renewing.
   A change in the price of lamps does not much affect the
economical life, as is shown on fig. 5 by the middle curve,
which we have calculated for the same price of power but
on the assumption that a new lamp costs two shillings. The
ordinate of this curve has a minimum value at 650 hours
instead of at 600 hours, when a new lamp was supposed to
cost one shilling only.
   The higher the price paid for energy the more important
does this question of economical life become, and the sooner
is it necessary to discard lamps, because the cost of renewals
bears a less proportion to the total cost. This is illustrated
in fig. 5 by the top curve, to obtain which we have assumed
that the cost of energy was 9d. a unit, and the price of a new
lamp one shilling. £ the minimum point falls to 430
hours instead of being at 600, at which it stood when the
price of the Board of Trade unit was taken as 43d.
   When cost curves, like those in fig. 5, are drawn for a
worse type of lamp, the minimum point becomes more sharply
defined and is reached earlier. It might be urged, however,
that all such curves merely indicate for how many hours
lamps should be used in order that the price paid for the
light may be a minimum, but that, if at the end of that time
 the light given out by the lamps is sufficient for the purpose
for which they are intended, surely it would be folly to
discard them. The answer to this is, that the lamps employed
 were of too high candle-power for the necessary illumination,
 and what should be done is to throw away the nominally
 higher candle-power lamps that have deteriorated and replace
 them with new lower candle-power lamps.
   When, therefore, the special investigation which forms the
subject of this paper was commenced at the end of 1892,
there was good reason for expecting, first, that with any type

398            Prof. Ayrton and Mr. Medley on
of glow-lamp a certain number of hours could be experi
mentally determined at the end of which it would be economical
to discard lamps even when the price of a Board of Trade
unit was as low as 43d.; secondly, that it was only economical
to run lamps at the pressure marked on them for one particular
price of electric energy.
   As Edison-Swan lamps were the only lamps that could be
legally used in this country in 1892, and as a pressure
of 100 volts was one very commonly employed for electric
lighting, we decided to experimentally find out what was the
most economical pressure to maintain between the terminals
of nominal 100-volt 8-candle lamps of this make, and what
was the length of their economic lives for different prices of
a Board of Trade unit.
   As it is well known that the lives of filaments are consider
ably affected by the steadiness of the pressure between their
terminals, it was decided to run the lamps from a battery
of storage-cells, and to arrange that the pressure when on the
lamps £ not vary by as much as one tenth per cent.
The capacity, however, of the cells at the Central Technical
College which could be entirely set on one side for this
investigation and used for running 100-volt lamps from five
o'clock every evening to nine or ten o’clock the next morn
ing for five nights of the week, only allowed of nine 8 C.P.
lamps being dealt with at a time. The nine lamps were
divided into three groups, each containing three lamps, and
a perfectly constant, but different P.D. was maintained
between the terminals of the lamps in each group.
   When our experiments were begun it was known that the
price of lamps would fall in the autumn of 1893, therefore it
was considered hardly probable that any economy would be
gained by running the lamps at less than their normal
pressure. Hence we decided to run the three groups at 100,
 102, and 104 volts respectively. The tests,     £         SOOIl
proved that no economy could be gained by running these
lamps at as high a pressure as that of 104 volts, and so the
group running at that pressure was changed for one running
at 101 volts.
   The pressure of the storage-cells which supplied the lamps
with current diminished, of course, during the night, so that
it was necessary to introduce between the cells and the lamps
a variable resistance which could be altered to keep the
pressure on the lamps constant within one tenth per cent,
and to avoid constant attention it was also necessary that
this resistance should be automatically controlled.
   As no automatic regulator could be purchased which would

keep the pressure throughout the night within one tenth per
cent. of the desired value, it was necessary to construct such
an instrument.
   The apparatus which we employed for this purpose resembled
generally the one described in a paper on “The Working
Efficiency of Secondary Cells” by Messrs. C. G. Lamb, E. W.
Smith, M. W. Woods, and one of the authors of the present
communication, see Journ. Inst. Elect. Eng. vol. xix. 1890.
   A variable resistance, consisting of four platinoid wires
winding on and off a brass roller, was placed in the main
circuit between the cells and the lamps. This resistance was
geared to a permanent magnet Gramme-motor, the electrical
connexions of which are shown in fig. 6. d ef was a battery
                               #
of five storage-cells to the centre e of which one brush of the
motor m was connected, the other brush being joined to the
middle cup b of a three-way mercury switch a b c. The two
outer cups a and c of this switch were connected with the two
ends d and f of the battery.
   It is clear from the figure that the motor revolved one way
or the other according as a and b or b and c were connected.
   A “set up ’’ d’Arsonval galvanometer in series with a
resistance was placed across the two points in the main
circuit between which it was desired that the pressure should
remain constant. To the coil of this galvanometer was
attached a pointer ending in a platinum tip which worked
between two platinum contacts. The phosphor-bronze strip
by which the coil of the d'Arsonval was suspended was twisted
several times, so that when the pressure on the lamps was
correct the tip of the pointer rested midway between the
contacts. If, however, the pressure rose by one tenth of a
volt the pointer was deflected and made to touch one of the

contacts, and so to complete the circuit of an electromagnet :
this, by closing one side of the mercury switch (fig. 6), started
the motor, which increased the resistance in the main circuit
until the pressure was correct again.
   Exactly the opposite happened if the pressure fell, the
pointer touched the other contact, the other side of the mercury
switch was closed, and the motor working in the reverse
direction reduced the resistance between the cells and the lamps.
   The pointer was kept from sticking to its contacts by a
light wooden hammer which tapped the case of the galvano
meter when the motor revolved.
   By means of this apparatus it was possible to keep the
pressure constant to within at least one tenth per cent.
   For many nights the action of this regulator was watched
pending the arrival of a recording voltmeter, but the recording
voltmeter not being forthcoming, and staying up all night,
even for four times a week, interfering much with our work
during the day, we decided to construct an automatic check
on the automatic regulator.
   In series with the first galvanometer was placed a second
working in exactly the same way, but with its contacts so far
apart that its pointer only touched them for a rise or fall of
half a volt in the pressure on the lamps. When for any
reason such an alteration took place, the pointer of this second
galvanometer, by touching one of its contacts, completed the
circuit of an electromagnet; this attracted a piece of soft iron
which opened a mercury switch and put out the lamps, and
at the same time by stopping a clock indicated the time at
which the irregularity took place.
   Besides acting as a check on the regulating apparatus, this
automatic cut-out worked whenever the pressure rose on a
lamp breaking, and so made it possible to tell the exact life
of the broken filament.
   The lamps being tested were arranged in the special stand
shown in fig. 7. The circular plate A, which could be turned
on the centre pillar B, was divided into six compartments by
the radial divisions shown, and the nine lamps simultaneously
tested were placed in three of these compartments, which
were coloured a dead black inside.      The whole was covered
up with an outer tin case, drawn in broken lines, which was
fixed to the uprights C, D, E, F, and had an opening in front
through which any one of the groups of lamps could be seen
when turned into position.
  When photometric measurements were not being made, the
top of the case was left open to let out the heat.
  The arrangements for       £           the current and for
bringing it to the lamps are sketched in fig. 8. M and N

402            Prof. Ayrton and Mr. Medley on
are the main terminals of the lamp-stand, corresponding with
M and N in fig. 7. From M the current, after passing
through the resistances e and d, for the two groups run at
lower pressures, went through the lamps and reached the
terminal N by means of the copper springs a, b, and c.
   When, however, a group of lamps was turned into position
for photometric measurements its copper springs c (J and K
in fig. 7a) were separated by a piece of brass L backed with
insulation (R in fig. 7a), and so the current of the group
was diverted through a thick wide strip of mangamin, this
strip being shunted with an Ayrton and Mather d’Arsonval
galvanometer, A, in series with a resistance R, as seen in
fig. 8.
  "T', combination of galvanometer, resistance R, and man
ganin strip was calibrated by direct comparison with a
Kelvin balance, and the resistance R was so adjusted that
one ampere produced a deflexion of 500 divisions, each of
about a millimetre in length. Variations of current during
the experiments could be read to 50'oo of an ampere if
required, and the current was known accurately in Board of
Trade amperes to TT'wo of an ampere.
   The results of frequent comparisons between an ampere
as read off on the direct-reading transparent scale and an
ampere as measured with the Kelvin balance, which was also
screwed down permanently in position, never showed a dif
ference as large as 1 part in 1500 between September 1893
and August 1894.
   The positive and negative terminals of each group of lamps
were connected respectively with two squares of brass a, a
(fig. 7) let into the slate bed on which the group was
mounted. Two brass springs, G, H, permanently connected
with an Ayrton and Mather reflecting electrostatic voltmeter,
the motion of the needle of which was damped by moving in
a magnetic field, pressed on the brass squares a, a of which
ever group of lamps was brought to the front of the stand.
   The zero of the voltmeter was so arranged that the tran
sparent scale, which was direct-reading, was nearly uniformly
divided from 50 to 120 volts, each division of about 1.5 milli
metre representing 0:2 volt, so that it was easy to read the
deflexion to within 2 parts in 10,000.
   The electrostatic voltmeter was frequently calibrated, and
the maximum change in sensibility between July 1893 and
August 1894 did not exceed 0.2 per cent. This change,
although small, is fully accounted for by the variation in the
zero, since the instrument did not possess the delicate zero
adjustment of the later specimens of this type of voltmeter.

                       Tests of Glow-Lamps.                    403
   The standard of light we used was a two candle-power
Methven screen fed with pentaned gas, and against this a ten
candle-power Bernstein glow-lamp was standardized to give
five candles, the Bernstein lamp being employed for the
actual comparison with the Edison-Swan lamps.
   One of the objects of employing this Bernstein lamp was
to test whether or no a convenient and trustworthy standard
of light could be obtained by using a low-voltage lamp with
its filament at a comparatively low temperature. From this
point of view, however, the results were not very satisfactory,
as at the end of some sixty hours of life the lamp had
blackened heavily. This secondary standard was of course
tested very frequently—as a rule, every time it was used.
    For the last few hundred hours of our tests an 8 C.P.
100-volt Edison-Swan lamp running at five candles was used
as an intermediate standard of light, and after the first few
hours it gave very fair results, the current required to pro
duce exactly five candles dropping in almost a straight line
from 0.3893 to 0.3867 ampere in two hundred hours. It is
probable, for reasons which will be shortly apparent, that an
even better result would have been obtained if the lamp had
been run for some fifty hours at its normal brilliancy before
it was used as a standard of light.
    For measuring the light a Lummer-Brodham photometer
was used, and proved itself a very convenient instrument.
The lamp-stand was fixed at the end of a three-metre photo
 meter bench, the actual distance between the standard and
the Edison-Swan lamps being 319.5 centims.
    Some difficulty was found at first in measuring the candle
power owing to the very considerable difference in colour
 between the lights being compared. This difficulty was con
 siderably reduced by fixing the Bernstein lamp to the spring
 frame £ in fig. 9, where A is the lamp, S, S are steel
 springs, and W, W are leaden weights.
    When measurements of the candle-power were being taken,
 the Bernstein lamp was set gently swinging backwards and
 forwards in the direction of the       £ and       the effect thus
 easily produced was found to be an improvement on that
 usually obtained by moving the photometer first a little on one
 side, and then a little on the other, of the neutral point. After
 some practice the use of this contrivance enabled us to make
measurements of the candle-power which did not differ from
 each other by more than 0.3 per cent.
    The first point noticed after starting the tests was that
 candle-power, current, and candles per watt all rose as the
 lives of the lamps increased; and as we were not prepared,

404            Prof. Ayrton and Mr. Medley on
from the published accounts of experiments previously made
on glow-lamps, to expect any such result, we thought it
                            Fig. 9.
might be due to some error in our measurements. We
therefore made a number of tests to satisfy ourselves that
this was not the case.
   A current nearly twice as large as the maximum required
to be measured was sent through the manganin strip for
several hours, but the deflexion of the d’Arsonval galva
nometer for a given current was not altered, so that the
effect was certainly not due to the heating of the strip or
galvanometer-coil.
   As the voltmeter was connected with the terminals of the
lamp sockets and not with the terminals of the lamps them
selves, we tested whether any resistance was introduced by
the sockets, or whether any alteration occurred when they
got warm after the lamps had been glowing for some hours.

                      Tests of Glow-Lamps.                 405
An old lamp was taken and wires soldered to its terminals,
and also to the terminals of the socket into which it was
screwed, and, by measuring as nearly simultaneously as
possible the pressures on the lamp and on the socket terminals
under various conditions as to heat and position of lamp, we
proved that the resistance of the socket and contacts was
never perceptible.
   There seemed, therefore, no reason to doubt the results
already obtained; but as the accuracy with which the candle
power could be measured had increased with practice and
with the introduction of the swinging frame, we decided after
110 hours of testing to start again with new lamps.
   The results obtained in these preliminary tests are shown
in fig. 10a, the curves in fig. 10 being those obtained from
the lamps subsequently tested.
   These curves show the variation of light and current with
time for four groups of lamps between the terminals of which
perfectly constant £ of 100, 101, 102, and 104 volts were
maintained respectively, the full lines representing candle
power and the dotted lines current. The breaks in the curves
connected by vertical lines indicate the times at which a
lamp broke and was replaced by a new one, so that each
s' always consisted of three lamps.
   All these curves show that the light given out by these
Edison-Swan lamps was greater after they had been glowing
for some time than it was when the lamps were new; #. that
even just before the filament of one lamp in a group broke,
the total light given out by the group of three was greater
than when the lamps were new. This is a totally different
result from that obtained in earlier tests, as illustrated in
figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4, which showed that a considerable deterio
ration in candle-power always took place after lamps had
been running for some time. Further, while the globes of
earlier lamps were always much blackened, even after a run
of a few hundred hours, and so became comparatively useless
long before the filament broke, the Edison-Swan lamps which
we have been testing showed hardly any blackening, even
when the filaments lasted for over 1300 hours.
   The highness of the average candle-power of Edison-Swan
lamps marked 100–8 after they have been run for some
time at 100 volts, is corroborated by the figures in the
following table, which gives the results of the measure
ments of the candle-power and the watts per candle of eleven
8-candle 100-volt lamps which had been run from the mains
of the Notting-Hill Electric Lighting Co. As these lamps
had been ' in different rooms of a dwelling-house, it was

   In these lamps, as in the others we tested, the blackening
of the bulbs was very slight indeed. Since the above mea
surements were made, the two lamps whose candle-powers
were 11:9 and 11:25 have broken after about another hundred
hours of life without, as far as could be judged, any dimi
nution in their light or any increase in the £         of their
bulbs.
   Moreover, although the rise of candle-power seen in figs.
10 and 10 a was always accompanied with a rise in current,
yet, as the rise in candle-power was proportionally much
greater than the rise in current for the lamps we tested, as
will be seen from figs. 10 and 10 a, where one division re
presents 50 per cent. change in the light, but only 4 per cent.
change in the current, the consumption of power per candle
was actually less after the lamp had run for 50 hours than
it was at the beginning, and the power per candle did not
rise seriously during the whole life of a lamp.
   Examining the results for the group run at 100 volts, we
see that in the first 124 hours the candle-power rose from
26:3 to 35, or by 33.1 per cent, the current in the same time
rising from 1.261 to 1:335 amperes, or by 5.87 per cent., so
that during these first hours the watts per candle dropped
from 4'79 to 3-82.
   During the 1820 hours of running, three lamps broke in
this group, their lives being 572,957, and 1167 hours; the
three still unbroken at the end of the tests had been run for
1248,863, and 653 hours respectively.
   Over the first 500 hours the average consumption of energy
with the lamps run at 100 volts was at the rate of 4.0 watts
per candle, over the second 500 hours 4:36 watts per candle,
over the third 500 hours 4:55 watts per candle, and over the
whole run the average efficiency was 0.23 candle per watt,
corresponding with 4:35 watts per candle.
   The candle-power of the three lamps run at 101 volts rose
in the first 150 hours from 26.5 to 30.6, that is by 15.5 per
cent., the current rose from 1:27 to 1:33, or by 4.72 per cent.,
the watts per candle in the same time falling from 4.80
to 4-32. T' average watts per candle over the whole run of
1340 hours of this group were 4.68, corresponding with an
efficiency of 0.215 candle per watt.
   In the group at 102 volts which was run for 1820 hours
six lamps broke, their lives being 242, 372, 516, 570, 516,
and 786 hours respectively in the order of breaking; the three
lamps unbroken at the end of the tests had run for 1148,898,
and 772 hours respectively.

                           Tests of Glow-Lamps.             409
was from 30:6 to 35, or a rise in 120 hours of 14.4 per cent,
the current in the same time rose from 1:26 to 1:31 amperes,
or by 3.97 per cent, so that the watts per candle diminished
from 4:22 to 3-82.
   The average consumption of energy during the first 500
hours was at the rate of 3.9 watts per candle, during the
second 500 hours 4:06 watts per candle, during the third 500
hours 4-2 watts per candle, and over the whole run the
average was 4:12 watts per candle, corresponding with an
efficiency of 0.243 candle per watt.
   Turning to the group run at 104 volts, the curves show
that the breakages were very frequent. Altogether five
lamps broke, their lives being 94, 175, 210, 242, and 254
hours; the three lamps left unbroken at the end of the test
had been run for 165, 222, and 364 hours.
   The initial rise in candle-power was from 33.8 to 40.5
candles, that is 19.8 per cent.; and the current rose from
1.264 to 1:307 amperes, or by 3.4 per cent.
   Over the whole run the average watts per candle, for the
lamps run at 104 volts, were 3.6, corresponding with an
efficiency of 0.278 candle per watt.                      -
   It is known from preceding tests (see the ‘Electrician,'
July 15th, 1892, for example) that the light given out by a
new glow-lamp varies approximately as the seventh power of
the pressure when the pressure is something like the normal
pressure for the lamp. Now, as the groups of lamps that we
tested at 100, 102, and 104 volts respectively were selected
so that each group gave practically £ same light initially
when tested at the same pressure of 100 volts, it was to be
expected that the three groups run at the three different
pressures would follow the law for the light given out by the
same lamp when used at different pressures.
   And this is practically the case, for if Lloo, Llo2, and Lio,
be the number of candles emitted by the three groups of three
lamps each, we see from the curves on fig. 10 that at the start
               L100=26.3, Lio2=30.6, L104=32.5   ; -

Hence the light is roughly as the seventh power of the pres
sure at the start.
   But after the lamps have been glowing for 100 hours this
relationship no longer holds, for after 100 hours from the
start we see from the curves on fig. 10 that
                L100=339, Lio2=341, L101=39.8,

            so that the light varies only as something like the fourth
            power of the pressure.
                    On the other hand, if we consider the results of the pre
            liminary tests recorded in fig. 10a, we have at the start
                                                     Lion= 24:8, Lice= 28-7, Lios= 30,-
            so that

             so that
                                                      L 102             Lio.
                                                             = 1:15, Lloo.." = 1.31.

                     In this case, then, the law of the seventh power holds roughly
             not only for the light given out by the three groups at the
             start but also at the end of the first 100 hours' run.

                       Tests of Glow-Lamps.                     411
   Although, as already stated, the number of lamps that could
be supplied with power every night at the Central Technical
College was limited to nine, and although, therefore, the total
number dealt with in the investigation was small, the curves
on figs. 10 and 10a, and the results given in the preceding
table, are quite sufficient to enable us to arrive at the following
results:—
   (1) When a group of Edison-Swan lamps marked 100–8
        are run at 100 volts, and each lamp, as its filament
        breaks, is replaced by a new Edison-Swan 100-8 lamp,
        it may be expected that the light given out by the
        group will never be as small as it was at the beginning,
        when all the lamps in the group were new. This im
        portant result is brought about by the deterioration
        of the lamps with long-lived filaments being com
         pensated by the great rise in the light given out by
        each new lamp when put in place of one whose fila
        ment has broken.
   (2) An Edison-Swan lamp marked 100–8 when run at
         100 volts will give an average illumination during its
         whole life of about 10 candles, and will absorb an
         average power of about 4:3 watts per candle, so that
         such a lamp must be regarded as a 43-watt lamp, and
         not a 30-watt lamp as is not unfrequently stated, this
         difference in power being about 43 per cent. .
   (3) An Edison-Swan lamp marked 100–8 may, when
         run at 100 volts, emit during a large portion of its life
         a light of as much as 11.7 candles, and absorb a power
         of about 44.6 watts, which is about 44 per cent. greater
         than the nominal 30 watts.
    These last two facts are of great importance to dynamo
 constructors, when specifying, as is frequently done, the
 number of lamps of a given type to which a given dynamo
 can supply current to without becoming too hot. For if, in
 making such a calculation, it be assumed that an Edison
 Swan 8-candle-power lamp absorbs the nominal 30 watts,
 that is 3.75 watts a candle instead of the 44.6 watts which
 our tests show that such a lamp actually absorbs during a long
 portion of its life, the current will be 44 per cent. greater,
 and the rate of heating of the dynamo 108 per cent. greater,
 than was anticipated.
    (4) Groups of new Edison-Swan lamps marked 100–8, if
          selected so as to give the same light at 100 volts, will,
          when new, emit a light which is roughly proportional
          to the seventh power of the pressure applied to them.
          But after a run of 100 hours, this rule connecting light
          and pressure may, or may not, hold.

  412              Prof. Ayrton and Mr. Medley on
      The rise in candle-power with time, which occurred during
   the early part of the life of all the Edison-Swan lamps which
   we tested, may be noticed also in the collection of curves
   published by Mr. Feldman in the ‘Electrician, Nov. 29th,
    1892(fig. 11). But there are certain very important differ
   ences between the results recorded by these curves and those

   which we have obtained. These differences are shortly as
   follows:—                                            -
      (1) The greatest rise of light emitted by the lamps as re
           corded in Mr. Feldman's curves was 14 per cent. In
           our experiments this maximum rise was 45 per cent.
      (2) In spite of the first rise in the candle-power as shown
           in Mr. Feldman's curves (fig. 11), the candle-power at
           the end of the life of the lamps was in all cases much
           less than it was when the lamps were new. Whereas

                           Tests of Glow-Lamps.                           413
           with the lamps which we tested at 100, 101, and 102
           volts the light given out by a group was never as low
           as it was at the beginning when the lamps were new.
      (3) In spite of the first rise in candle-power recorded in
           the curves on fig. 11, it was only for the lamps whose
           behaviour was recorded in curves P and Z that the
           power expended per candle diminished at first with
           time.    And even in the case of these two sets the
           power expended per candle increased again, and was
           greater when the filaments broke than it was when
           the lamps were new. Whereas in our tests the power
           expended per candle not only diminished considerably
           during the early life of the lamp, but it never rose
           again as high as it was when the lamps were new.
      Although, then, the rise in candle-power during the early
   part of the life of a glow-lamp is apparently not an absolutely
   new fact, the magnitude of the rise and the effects resulting from
   it were, in the older lamps, so trifling that no special attention
   seems to have been devoted to this important subject in the
   former reports of tests of lamps. Indeed, even in a prominent
   book connected with glow-lamps which has quite recently
   been brought out in this country, no mention whatever is
   made of the fact in question. And yet, as we have already
   shown, and as will become more apparent from what follows,
   this remarkable rise in the candle-power during the earlier
   part of the life of an Edison-Swan lamp has a very important
   effect on the economy of lighting with glow-lamps.
      The next point toconsider is the way in which the cost of
   lighting with the modern 100–8 Edison-Swan lamps depends
   on the pressure at which they are run, and on the cost of
   a Board of Trade unit. The curves on figs. 12 and 13 give
   the cost of obtaining light with the various groups of lamps,
   including the cost of replacing lamps with broken filaments,
   calculated day by day from our tests as the experiment
   went on.
      The ordinates of the curves show the cost of 100 candle-hours
   at any time during the test, time being measured horizon
   tally, and the values of the ordinates have been calculated from
   the following formula:—
      Total cost per candle per 100 hours at the end of any
   number of hours t equals
100 x Board of Trade units used during time t X Price of one Board of Trade unit
                          Total Candle-hours during time t

 416             Prof. Ayrton and Mr. Medley on
    The price of a kilowatt-hour we took as 43d in fig. 12, and
 as 9d. in fig. 13, the cost of a new lamp being taken as 1s. 9d.
 in both sets of curves.
    Of course, it will be seen from the formula quoted above,
 that whenever a lamp breaks and a new one is put in its
place, there must be a sudden, though temporary, rise in the
 cost per candle-hour due to the cost of the new lamp; but
this rise becomes less marked as the number of lamps included
in the calculations increases, and would have become inappre
 ciable if the tests could have been carried on for a sufficient
length of time.
    The first three lamps to break in both the 102 and the
 104 volt groups were replaced by the lamps which we had
previously run at 102 and 104 volts respectively for 110 hours;
and in calculating the cost-curves we have added in the watt
hours and the candle-hours due to these previous runs; we
have also added to the abscissae of the curves the 110 hours.
    On examining the total-cost curves on figs. 12 and 13, it is
at once apparent that they nowhere show any such rise in
the cost of producing light, as was seen in the similar curves
for American lamps (fig. 5). The curves in fig. 12, for
which the price of a Board-of-Trade unit was taken as 43d.,
do not turn up at any point, not even for the three lamps run
at 101 volts, which lasted unbroken for over 1300 hours.
    In fig. 13, however, for drawing the curves on which the
price of a Board-of-Trade unit has been taken at 9d., there
are slight indications of the curves turning up : for example,
the curve for the 100-volt group rises a little at 850 hours, at
which time the lives of the three lamps being tested were
850, 850, and 278 hours; and, again, at about 1600 hours,
when the lives of the three living lamps were 1028, 643, and
433 hours, the cost per candle-hour rises a little. In the
group run at 101 volts the cost of lighting began to rise a
little after the lamps had been lit for 1100 hours; and in the
102-volt £ the curve (fig. 13) turns up a little at 1700
hours, at which time the ages of the lamps alight were 928,
678, and 552 hours. But at no one of these points is there
a sufficient rise to indicate that a time has been reached when
it would be good economy to discard lamps.
   The remaining total cost curve on fig. 13, viz. that for the
group of lamps run at 104 volts, when the price of the Board
of Trade unit is taken at 9d., does not show any indication
of a minimum point.
   Hence, generally, we may conclude that when the modern
Edison-Swan 8     £ 100-volt lamps such as we have been
testing, costing 1s. 9d. per lamp, are supplied with energy

                      Tests of Glow-Lamps.                  417
costing 9d per Board of Trade unit, no economy will be
gained by discarding the lamps before the filaments break.
   This important result is of course due to the fact, already
pointed out, that there is no marked decrease in the candle
power of the lamps during their lives.
   Owing to the extent to which the individual lamps varied
among themselves, it is difficult to say which of the four
pressures at which we tested lamps would be the most
economical to use. The three lamps tested at 101 volts seem
to have been quite abnormal, their efficiency being very low,
and, as a consequence, their lives very long.
   With a Board of Trade unit costing 43d, the lamps tested
at 100 volts gave the cheapest light, and as they do not seem
to have been above the average in quality this result may
probably be safely taken as correct.

there does not seem much to choose between the total cost of
producing light with the three pressures of 100, 102, and 104
volts, excepting that the use of 104 volts would introduce an
extra expense arising from the labour of frequently replacing
broken lamps.
   The two conclusions, then, to which we are led by a study
of these total-cost curves on figs. 12 and 13 are:—
    1. The modern Edison-Swan 8 C.P. 100-volt lamps such
        as we tested should not be discarded until the filaments
        break.
   2. No marked economy can be gained by over-running this
        type of lamp.
      *        Addition made January 25, 1895.
   The question arises—what is the cause of the marked rise
in candle-power which occurred with all the lamps tested by
us during 1893 and 1894? In the early summer of 1894,
when our tests were approaching completion, Mr. Howell, in
 contributing to a discussion at the American Institute of
Electrical Engineers, stated that such a rise in candle-power
 was due to the vacuum of the lamp improving during the
early part of its life. Therefore, after we had stopped the
main investigation, we made some experiments to test the
validity of Mr. Howell’s explanation.
   We applied the induction-coil vacuum-test to some dozen
Edison-Swan lamps when quite new, and again after they
had been run for about 80 hours at their normal pressure
of 100 volts. In every case we found that the vacuum had

4.1.8          Prof. Ayrton and Mr. Medley on
apparently improved; for using a spark of about 8 millimetres
in length, the lamps when new were entirely filled with a
bright blue glow accompanied with some bright white patches
on the glass; whereas, after a run of about 80 hours at a
pressure of 100 volts, this phosphorescent effect with the
8 millimetre spark was either entirely absent, or consisted of
only a faint nebulous glow which did not fill the lamp-bulb,
and there was very little light on the surface of the glass.
   Thus it appeared as if Mr. Howell’s explanation of the
great increase in the light given out by a glow-lamp during
the early portion of its life was correct.
    But this conclusion which we arrived at last year has been
modified by tests that we have been carrying out on Edison
Swan glow-lamps purchased since our paper was sent in to
the Physical Society in November 1894. £ we find that, -
while the induction-coil vacuum-test applied to these lamps
when they are new, and after a run of 80 hours at the normal
pressure of 100 volts, shows that the vacuum apparently
improves,—this improvement in the vacuum is not accom
panied with the great rise in candle-power which we found
with all the Edison-Swan lamps purchased in 1892 and 1893,
the tests of which form the subject of this paper. And yet
the lamps are all marked in the same way, “100 E.F. 8,”
and they all look alike.
   In the case of a set of these Edison-Swan lamps, purchased
on January 21, 1895, not merely were the current and the
light periodically measured, but the induction-coil vacuum
test was applied at intervals during the 80 hours' run; and
it was found that the change in the phosphorescent appear
ance of the lamp, and the consequent apparent increase in
the vacuum, was produced slowly and not suddenly on the
first application of the pressure of 100 volts.               -
    The following are the results of the tests of this batch of six
lamps. The light was measured with a Harcourt-Pentane
 Standard, the potential difference with the Ayrton and Mather
reflecting electrostatic voltmeter, and the current with the
strip of manganin shunted with the Ayrton and Mather.
moving    £                    this voltmeter and the ammeter
combination being the same as those employed with all the
lamps tested previously. But both instruments were carefully
calibrated on January of this year, to make quite certain that
the different behaviour of these newer lamps was not merely
an apparent one produeed by some change having occurred
in the sensibilities of the measuring-instruments.
    The insulation of the lamp-holders was carefully cleaned
and the contact-surfaces scraped before these tests were made.

420            Prof. Ayrton and Mr. Medley on                     t
   From these tests it is seen that, in the case of lamps
Nos. XI. and XIV, there was practically no change either in
the light or in the power absorbed during the first 80 hours
of the running at the constant pressure of 100 volts; and
that in the case of the remainder of this batch of lamps the
increase in the light and in the power absorbed was compa
ratively small, the greatest change being with lamp No. XI.,
where the light rose by about 11 per cent. and the power by
about 4 per cent. This is a very different result from that
obtained with the Edison-Swan lamps previously tested, and
run at a constant pressure of 100 volts, for there the total
light given out by the three lamps together rose by 35 per
cent. in the first 100 hours of running, and the power by
7:55 per cent.
   Since, then, as already stated, the vacuum, when tested
periodically with the induction-coil, appeared to improve
steadily with each of the six lamps Nos. IX. to XIV. during
the run of 80 hours, it would appear that improvement in the
vacuum was not the sole cause, as stated by Mr. Howell, for the
great rise in the candle-power such as we observed with all
the Edison-Swan lamps which we tested in 1893 and 1894.
   It is possible that this rise in candle-power may have been
due to a change in the surface of the filament causing the
emissivity for heat to decrease, since that would raise the light
emitted, as well as the number of candles per watt. Whether
such a change in the heat-emissivity of the filament occurs
with time we have not yet found out.
   Another point of difference between this batch of six lamps
Nos. IX, to XIV. and those which we tested during the main
part of our investigation, is the relative inefficiency of these
six lamps. For in no single test at any time during the 80
hours run with these six lamps were the watts per candle less
than 4:25, and in many cases they were over 5; while with
lamp No. XIII. the watts per candle, as seen in the last
table, were as high as 5:15 after this lamp had been run for
13 hours 50 minutes. It is possible, then, that when in the
body of the paper we spoke of the group of three lamps
which we ran at a constant pressure of 101 volts as being
“quite abnormal,” because the average watts per candle
required with this group during the run of 1340 hours were
as high as 4'68, we ought rather to have spoken of the
various other groups of lamps which we ran at the constant
pressures of 100, 102, and 104 volts respectively as being
abnormally good Edison-Swan lamps.
   At any rate it is clear that it is at present impossible to
state the most economical potential difference to employ with

                      Tests of Glow-Lamps.                   421
any Edison-Swan lamps marked “100 E.F. 8;” since batches
of lamps so marked, and therefore nominally the same, really
require very different potential differences to be employed to
obtain maximum economy with a given price of lamp and of
a kilowatt-hour.
   It may, however, be concluded, from the curves shown in
figs. 12 and 13, that the most economical potential difference
to employ with any Edison-Swan lamps marked “100 E.F.8,”
such as have been obtainable in the open market since 1892,
is the potential difference that will cause the lamp during a
large portion of its life to have an efficiency of about 0.25
candle per watt, corresponding with 4 watts per candle.
   The value of this potential difference for any batch of these
lamps may be determined approximately in the following
way. From our tests, already referred to, of eleven Edison
Swan lamps, marked “100 E.F. 8,” which had been used in
a house for some 200 or 300 hours, we found that the relation
between candle-power and pressure was given by
           Candle-power = a x (volts)”,
where a is a constant.       Also we found that the relation
between candle-power and watts for these lamps was given by
           Candle-power = b x (watts)”,
where b is a constant.    Therefore
                    Volts = c x (watts per candle)",
where c is a constant.
   Hence if one has a batch of Edison-Swan lamps marked
“100 E.F. 8,” whose efficiency is, say, 0.222 candle per watt,
corresponding with 4.5 watts per candle, when a pressure of
100 volts is applied to them, it would be probably most
economical to run them at about 103 volts, since this is the
pressure which the last equation tells us will be necessary
to raise the efficiency of such lamps to 0.25 candle per watt.
   From what precedes, it follows that, since the average
efficiency of the 100 E.F. 8 Edison-Swan appears to be less
than 0.25 candle per watt, the opinion expressed by one of
us in an article entitled “New Lamps for Old,” published in
the ‘Electrician’ for September 29, 1893, was correct, viz.
that it would be economical to overrun Edison-Swan lamps
by applying a pressure about 3 per cent. higher than the
marked pressure. And that the reason why this conclusion
was apparently negatived by the results of the tests which we
carried out during the winter of 1893 and a large portion of
1894, was because the various groups of lamps which we ran

 422             Drs. Korteweg and de Vries on the
 at the constant pressures of 100, 102, and 104 volts respec
 tively consisted of specially good specimens.
    In applying the rule that the economical potential differ
 ence is about the one which causes the lamp to produce 0:25
 candle per watt, it is important, however, to examine 8-candle
 100-volt Edison-Swan lamps when bought to see whether
 they are really marked “100 E.F. 8.” For while the result
 of various purchases of 8-candle 100-volt Edison-Swan lamps
 during the past three years has always resulted in lamps
 marked “100 E.F. 8” being sent us, although the marking
 on the lamps was never specified by us, a recent batch of
 lamps that we have received contained among them certain
 lamps marked “100 B. 8,” which not only differed in the
 marking but also in the filament being of a simple horse-shoe
shape, and not with a loop at the top as in the case of the
other lamps. And, on testing these Edison-Swan B lamps,
we were surprised to find that with no one of them, when run
at 100 volts, did the watts per candle exceed 3.9, and in some
cases the watts per candle were as low as 3.01. We have
not, however, had these B lamps for a sufficiently long time
in our possession to be able to express any opinion about their
life-history.
XLI. On the Change of Form of Long Waves advancing in a
   Rectangular Canal, and on a New Type of Long Stationary
    Waves. By Dr. D. J. KoRTEWEG, Professor of Mathematics
   in the University of Amsterdam, and Dr. G. DE WRIES".
                            INTRODUCTION.
IN     such excellent treatises on hydrodynamics as those of
      Lamb and Basset, we find that even when friction is
neglected long waves in a rectangular canal must necessarily
change their form as they advance, becoming steeper in front
and less steep behindt.            Yet since the investigations of
de Boussinesq #, Lord Rayleigh $, and St. Venant | on the
solitary wave, there has been some cause to doubt the truth
of this assertion. Indeed, if the reasons adduced were really
decisive, it is difficult to see why the solitary wave should

make an exception*; but even Lord Rayleigh and McCowan f,
who have successfully and thoroughly treated the theory of
this wave, do not directly contradict the statement in question.
They are, as it seems to us, inclined to the opinion that the
solitary wave is only stationary to a certain approximation.
   It is the desire to settle this question definitively which has
led us into the somewhat tedious calculations which are to be
found at the end of our paper. We believe, indeed, that from
them the conclusion may be drawn, that in a frictionless liquid
there may exist absolutely stationary waves and that the form
of their surface and the motion of the liquid below it may be
expressed by means of rapidly convergent series. But, in
order that these lengthy calculations might not obscure other
results, which were obtained in a        £ way, we have
postponed them to the last part of our paper.
   First, then, we investigate the deformation of a system
of waves of arbitrary shape but moving in one direction only,
i.e. we consider one of the two systems of waves, starting in
opposite directions in consequence of any disturbance, after
their complete separation from each other. By adding to the
motion of the fluid a uniform motion with velocity equal
and opposite to the velocity of propagation of the waves, we
may reduce the surface of such a system to approximate, but
not perfect, rest.
   If, then, l-i- m (n being a small quantity), represent the
elevation of the surface above the bottom at a horizontal dis
tance a from the origin of coordinates, we have succeeded in
deducing the equation
 where a is a small but arbitrary constant, which is in close
connexion with the exact velocity of the uniform motion given
 to the liquid, and where       •="—#         depends upon the depth
 l of the liquid, upon the capillary tension T at its surface, and
 upon its density p.
    On assuming      #   =0 we of course obtain the differential
   * ''       the theory of the solitary wave is duly discussed in the
treatise of Basset, the inconsistency of his result with the doctrine of
the necessary change of form of long waves seems not to have sufficiently
attracted the attention of the author.                                 *

of the solitary wave is included as a particular case in the
general solution of this equation. But, in referring to this
kind of wave, we have to notice the result that, taking
capillarity into account, a negative wave will become the sta
tionary one, when the depth of the liquid is small enough.
    On proceeding then to the general solution, a new type of
long stationary wave is detected, the shape of the surface
 being determined by the equation
              =h     *V:#(              d. M=         T
    We propose to attach to this type of wave the name of
 cnoidal waves (in analogy with sinusoidal waves). For k=0
 they become identical with the solitary wave.                 For large
 values of k they bear more and more resemblance to sinusoidal
 waves, though their general aspect differs in this respect, that
 their elevations are narrower than their hollows; at least
 when the liquid is not too shallow, in which latter case this
 peculiar feature is reversed by the influence of capillarity.                4.
    For very large values of k these cnoidal waves coincide
with the train of oscillatory waves of unchanging shape dis
covered by Stokes”, which therefore in the theory of long
waves f constitutes a particular case of the cnoidal form.
 Indeed the equation: obtained by Stokes, when written in
our notation, becomes

 be a small fraction. Now, when capillarity is neglected, the

Sir G. Stokes has given the first two terms.
   After some more discussion about these cnoidal waves, con
cerning their velocity of propagation and the motion of the
particles of fluid below their surface, we proceed to a closer
examination of the deformation of long waves. To this effect
we apply the equation for  # to various types of non-stationary
waves, and it will appear that, though sinusoidal waves be
come steeper in front when advancing, other types of waves
may behave otherwise.
                    I. The Formula for    #.
   In our investigations (in accordance with the method used
by Lord Rayleigh, Phil. Mag. 1876, vol. i. p. 257, whose
paper has been of great influence on our researches), we start
from the supposition that the horizontal and vertical u and v
of the fluid may be expressed by rapidly convergent series of
the form
                      u=f+yfi +y^f, + . . .
                      v=ybi +y°b2+ . . .
where y represents the height of a particle above the bottom
of the canal, and where J, J1, ... b1, b, ... are functions of a
and t. Of course the validity of this assumption must be
proved later on by the fact that series of this description can
be found satisfying all the conditions of the problem.
   From one of these conditions, viz., the incompressibility of
the liquid, which is expressed by        # + # =0,      we may
deduce

  which set of equations satisfies for the interior of the fluid all
  the conditions of the problem, whilst at the same time it is
  easy to see that for long Waves these series are rapidly con

  slowly with 4, and therefore the successive differential

  decrease.

 solitary wave.
    In the first place we now will endeavour to calculate the
 velocity of propagation. For the solitary wave this is simple
 enough. . If we consider that the liquid at infinity is brought

 is added to the motion expressed by (21) and (22), it is clear
 that this velocity, with reversed sign, must be taken for the
 velocity of propagation of the solitary wave.
. . But for a train of oscillatory waves Sir G. Stokes has
 shown" that various definitions of this velocity may be given,
 leading at the higher order of approximation to different
 values.    It seemed to us most rational to define it as the
 velocity of propagation of the wave-form when the horizontal
 momentum of the liquid has been reduced to zero by the
 addition of a uniform motion. This definition corresponds
 to the second one of Sir G. Stokes. According to it, we have
 to solve the equation

  This last equation has a simple geometrical meaning. It
designates those particles E (fig. 1) whose height above the
bottom of the channel is equal to the height where the surface
of the liquid would stand when the waves were flattened.
Therefore for a first     £                 we may say that the
various particles of the fluid change the direction of their
horizontal motion at the very moment when one of these
points E is passing over them.                                -

           IV. Deformation of Non-Stationary Waves.
   In order to study the deformation of non-stationary waves,
 we will now apply our formula (12) to various types of waves.
   Solitary Waves.—As a first example we choose a solitary
 wave whose surface is given by
                             m=h sech” pa. . . . . . . (31)
   According to (12), the deformation of this wave is expressed
 by

 But before we are able to draw any conclusion from this
 expression, it is necessary to separate the two parts of        #,    of

which the first is due to a true change of form of the wave
surface, whilst the second may be attributed to a small
advancing motion of the wave, which is left after the addition
of the uniform motion with velocity go=vgl. To this effect
we have still at our disposal the quantity a, whose close con
nexion with the uniform motion, which we have added in
order to make the wave nearly stationary, has been indicated
above.
    One of the best ways to obtain the desired separation is
certainly to make stationary the highest point of the wave,
and this is effected by fulfilling the condition
                         2(x+2ap") = 3(4ap”—h),

    In discussing this equation (33), we see at once that a
solitary wave (31) is stationary when h=4ap”; and this is in
accordance with the equation (17) of the stationary solitary
 wave which we have obtained above. When h > 4ap”, the
 change of form of the wave, calculated from (33), is shown
 by the dotted line in fig. 2.

 h 44ap” the figure would show the opposite change of form,
 when, contrary to the opinion expressed by Airy and others,
 the wave becomes less steep in front and steeper behind.

 wave has been made stationary        #   the application of a positive velocity

    If, now, we take account of the fact that, as may easily
  be inferred from (31), the wave-surface becomes steeper in
  proportion as p is increased, we are then justified in saying
  that a solitary wave which is steeper than the stationary one,
  corresponding to the same height, becomes less steep in front
  and steeper behind, but that its behaviour is exactly opposite
  when it is less steep than the stationary one.

 case h-4gM*p*>0.
                               Fig. 3.
    When h-4a M*p°=0, the waves are stationary in accord
ance with (20), whilst for h-4aM'p°40 they become steeper
behind; and this last result, since p is inversely proportional
to the wave-length, may be stated by saying that cnoidal
waves become less steep in front and steeper behind when,
for a given modulus and a given height, their length is smaller
than the one required for the stationary wave of this modulus
and height.                                           .
   In proportion as M is taken smaller the cnoidal waves
more and more resemble sinusoidal waves. They would take
the sinusoidal form for M=0, but then an infinitely small wave
length would be required for the stationary case. For this
reason sinusoidal waves may always be considered as cnoidal
waves whose length is too large to be stationary, that is, they
are always becoming steeper in front.

         VI. Calculation of the Equation of the Surface.
    We will now show how for the equation of the surface of a
 stationary train of waves a more correct expression than (20)
 can be deduced. For this purpose we have to integrate
 the differential equation (39), or rather we have to prove that
a series can be given which solves this equation to any desired

where hi and ki have values which are slightly different from
those of h and k in (39); then these values and the coefficients
a, S, &c., of a series

may be determined in such a way” that this series (62)
satisfies the equation (39).
    Indeed, substituting (62) in (39) and taking into account
 (61), equation (39) reduces to
 (x +28m1 +3 yma” + ...)*(hi-m,)(ki + m1)
    = (x + 8m1 + yn,” + ...)(h-ami-8m,”-ymi"+ ...) (k+ xml

 and it is only necessary to equalize the coefficients of the
corresponding terms of both members of this equation.                •
    If we retain all terms to the fourth order, we find in this
 way, after some reductions:—
         ahiki- hk=0     -  -   -   -  -                          (63)

   To a first approximation these equations are satisfied by
taking
            h1=h; k1=k; a = 1; 8=b; y=b°+}c . . (68)
   If then we substitute in (63), (64), (65), and (66)
             h1=h +e, k1=k+a, a = 1 + x1, 8=b+/81
where a1 and 8 are quantities of the first, e and a of the
second order, we find from these equations by second approxi
mation:—
  * The coefficient a in (61) might also have been chosen      '
different in value from a in (39), but this would only have introduced
an unnecessary indeterminateness in the solution,

e=-bhk; a=bhk; a = -b(h-k); 81=(-20°4-#6)(h-k). . (69)
   Substituting as a third approximation :
     hl=h-bhk+el; k1=k+bhk+a1, a = 1-b(h-k) + x2,
we obtain finally,                                            -
e1=}chk(—h +2k); al=}chk(2h-k); a > (b?–3c)(h”—hk+k”).(70)
    Hence the equation of the surface of the waves is, including
all terms of the third order:—
m=[1-b(h-k) + (5°-3c)(h”—hk+k”)]:m1 +[b+(-25°

             XLII. The Tin-Chromic Chloride Cell.
                      By S. SKINNER, M.A."
A CELL consisting          of a tin and platinum couple in a
       solution of the green chromic chloride was described
by W. E. Case in the Proc. R. S. 1886, p. 345. The tin is
dissolved by the chromic chloride at a high temperature only,
and when the solution is cooled the tin is precipitated. The
chemical changes are represented by the following state
ment :-                                                         - -
                Criol, Sn==SnCl,+2CrCl,
: As the reaction is reversed on cooling, the cell has the
interesting feature that at the end of a hot and cold cycle it
is in the same chemical condition as it was at the commence
ment. It thus offers a method of deriving electrical energy
directly from heat. The author of the account gives a curve
of electromotive force, and finds that it is zero at 60° F., and
increases to about 3 volt at 200°F. I shall show that the
E.M.F. is not zero at the ordinary temperature, but is about
# volt; however, the cell will not give any current at these
temperatures on account of polarization. It appears that
the curve given by Mr. Case is not an E.M.F. curve, but one
which was probably obtained by using a wire voltmeter, and
therefore really represents the current the cell is capable of
producing.
   The tin is precipitated in small crystals from the cooling
solution of CrCl3 and SnCl2, and does not then form a satis
factory electrode. I have therefore arranged the cell with an
amalgam of tin in place of the solid rod. The precipitated
crystals fall into the mercury and dissolve so as to reconstitute
a suitable electrode. My construction of the cell is very
much like that of a Clark cell.
   A test-tube with a platinum wire through the base has
fluid amalgam in it, and this is covered with a solution of
pure Cr2Cl3, made by dissolving violet sublimed Cr2Cls in
water with the aid of a fragment of tinfoil. A platinum plate
and wire form the positive pole of the cell.
   Connecting, such a cell at 15° C. with a galvanometer,
there is a sudden deflexion which very rapidly becomes less
until some small steady value is reached. On warming the
cell the deflexion increases until it is relatively large. These
observations show that the cell cannot produce a continuous

                         ---     Tin amalgam.
     If the E.M.F. of the cell be measured on a potentiometer,
  or by means of a ballistic galvanometer and condenser, by
  either of which methods the cell is not called on to produce a
  current, it is found that the E.M.F. at all temperatures is
  approximately volt, and that the E.M.F. is slightly less at
  the boiling-point of water than at the ordinary temperature.
     The explanation of the results is not difficult. The cell
  polarizes very rapidly at low temperatures, and the opposing
  E.M.F. of polarization increases so rapidly and so largely
  that almost at the moment of connexion the effective      F'.
, becomes zero.    The cell behaves like a condenser which is
  connected to a battery through a very high resistance. Such
  a condenser would discharge itself when its plates were con
  nected, but when they were isolated again it would slowly
  become charged by the battery through the high resistance.
     At the high temperature #. polarization is very largely
  reduced, and the cell will produce a continuous current.
     Another interesting feature of the cell is that it may be
  used as the mechanism of a heat-engine for the production of
  work, and we can trace in it the complete cycle of Carnot.
  Let the cell be placed in a hot chamber, and work may be
  derived from it until all the Cr2Cl6 or the tin is used.   Then
  let the cell be placed in a cold chamber, it will give up heat,
  and becomes restored to its original chemical condition.

   These results showed that the cell had polarized, and was
 only slowly recovering its electromotive force.
    When a solution of the green chromic chloride at the ordi
 nary temperature has silver nitrate added to it, only two
 thirds of the chlorine is precipitated. This, according to the
 theory of ionisation, indicates that only two atoms out of
 three act as negative ions, the other atom apparently being
part of the positive ion. On the other hand, if a solution of
chromic chloride near 100° be treated with silver nitrate, the
whole of the chlorine may be precipitated. This indicates
that at the higher temperature all the chlorine atoms behave
as negative ions.
   Taking this into account, the Grotthus chain representing

                  Some Acoustical Experiments.                  447
the action of the cell about 15° must be as follows:—
              Pt i CICrCl     CICrCl, CICrCl, Sn,
becoming, after connexion,
              Pt,CICr | Cl,CICr | Cl,CICr | Cl:Sn.
   This view of the action leaves the ion ClCr polarizing the
cell.   Now if a   £ acts so as to remove this ion, the
cell will go on producing a current. The excess of chromic
chloride might perform this function, forming with this ion
chromous chloride :
                     CrCl 4-CrCl3=2CrCl3.
The behaviour of the cell shows that this does not take place
readily.                                                  •
   A similar view of the action in the cell at about 100° indi
cates the presence of chromium ions as the polarizing agent.
At this temperature there is not much polarization; so that
it appears the following chemical change takes place readily:
                      Cr + 2CrCl3=3CrCl2.

                I. Subjective Lowering of Pitch.
1.  A     YEAR or two ago, in the physical laboratory of
           Bedford College, London, the professor, Mr. Wo
mack, called my attention to the fact that a tuning-fork which
was being used by a student appeared to rise perceptibly in
pitch as the vibration died away. It then occurred to me
that the effect observed might be a subjective one : that one
result of increasing the intensity of a musical note without
changing its frequency, might be to depress the pitch as esti
mated by ear. To determine this point I have made experi
ments upon   ''      and on others whose perception of musical
intervals was known to be reliable.
   2. Let a tuning-fork mounted on a resonance-box be
strongly excited by bowing, and immediately let the open end
of the resonance-box be brought very close to one ear, the
other ear being preferably closed. After a second or so, let
the fork and box be moved away from the ear and held at

448                 Dr. C. W. Burton on some
subjective depression of pitch accompanying increase of
loudness without change of frequency, the fork will appear to
be lower in pitch when close to the ear and higher when
further away, the effect becoming less marked as the vibration
gradually dies down. This is what observation shows to be
actually the case, and it is evidently nothing of the nature of a
Doppler effect with which we are here concerned. In the
first place, the motion of the fork from one position to the
other may be made quite slow; and in the second place, the
difference of pitch is observed, not between the fork approach
ing and the fork receding, but between the nearer and further
positions of the fork.
   3. In some of these observations a fork giving the note d'
(256 complete vibrations per second) has been used, the effect
with forks of higher pitch being less marked. When the
vibration was made as strong as possible by means of bowing,
the lowering of pitch was found to amount to a full semitone
(15: 16). Mr. Womack, Prof. Ramsay, and Dr. G. F.
McCleary, who repeated the experiment, all agreed pretty
nearly with my estimate: in each case the greatest apparent
flattening observed was as much as a semitone.
   With a large fork giving c (one octave lower) the effect was
more striking. In this case the fork with its resonance-box was
too unwieldy to be moved bodily to and fro, so it was allowed
to stand on a table while the observer’s head was lowered so as
to bring one ear opposite to the opening of the resonance-box
at a distance of a few inches.     £ the fork was heard with
great intensity, while on raising the head through half a metre
or so the loudness was greatly diminished. Here the lowerin
of pitch due to the greatest intensity of vibration which #
could excite in the fork amounted usually to a minor third
(5 : 6) or even more.      Thus, repeating the experiment on
different days, I have estimated the interval sometimes as
rather more and sometimes as rather less than a minor third.
Mr. Womack heard something between a minor and a major
third ; Professor Ramsay a full tone; Dr. McCleary more
than a minor third.
   4. Before saying more concerning the observations, it will
be convenient to mention a physiological theory by which I
have attempted to account for the observed effects. Helm
holtz's discussion of the vibration of the basilar membrane in
the cochlea is applicable only to infinitesimal amplitudes, in
asmuch as all his equations of motion are linear, and though
the introduction of terms of higher order would have made
the investigation very lengthy and an exact solution im
possible, it is not difficult to see on general grounds what

                       Acoustical Experiments.                      449
modification of the sense of pitch is to be expected from
increased loudness. If the basilar membrane may be regarded
as being stretched with a finite tension in the direction of its
breadth, and as having no appreciable tension in the perpen
dicular direction, then Helmholtz shows that it will be
vibrationally equivalent to a series of strings stretched side
by side and unconnected with one another. For shortness, I
shall speak of the membrane as if it actually consisted of such
separate strings, and thus, following Helmholtz’s theory, we
are to suppose that a disturbance of given period reaching
the ear excites the strongest resonance in those strings whose
natural period is most nearly the same. Now when a string
is vibrating freely with finite amplitude, the period of its
vibrations is shorter than if the amplitude were infinitesimal;
and we are accordingly led to enquire whether a periodic
force of considerable intensity would not excite the maximum
resonance in those strings whose natural period for some finite
vibration-amplitude was most nearly the same.
    5. As sufficiently representative of our case we may take a
 system with one degree of freedom, in which the positional
 force contains a term proportional to the cube of the displace
 ment from equilibrium, as well as one proportional to the
 first power”, the equation of motion being accordingly
 written
                               --    •               2

 where F is the external force impressed on the system, a is
 the displacement from the equilibrium position, and m, k, h, a
 are real constants.
    If we take F to be a simple harmonic function of the time
 whose character has been maintained long enough for the
 whole motion to have become periodic, the value of a will be
 expansible in a Fourier's series in which the constant coeffi
 cients have to be determined. But the expressions thus ob
 tained are very unwieldy; and it will therefore be more con
 venient to treat a instead of F as a simple harmonic function
 of the time. It is not easy to say definitely which assump
 tion corresponds most nearly with the actual case, and from
 what follows I think it will be evident enough that whichever
 case we consider the general conclusions would be much the
 Salme.
    * Terms of even degree would imply that the free vibrations were not
 symmetrical with respect to the equilibrium position, and would there
 fore be absent in the case of a stretched string, which we have supposed
 to agree pretty nearly with the physiological case.

which diminishes continually as p” increases. Hence in
general terms we may say that to produce a given amplitude
of velocity requires the least amplitude of impressed periodic
force when the periodic time of the force is somewhat shorter
than would be the natural period of the system for infinitesimal
vibrations if the frictional term were abolished.       And return
ing to the case of our strings, we may infer that a similar
result will hold good. Hence a force of given finite ampli
tude will excite in a given string the greatest amplitude of
velocity when the period of the force is somewhat shorter
than the “natural” period of the string, and hence when a
periodic disturbance of finite amplitude reaches the ear, the
string whose resonance is excited most strongly will have a
“natural” period longer than the period of the disturbance.
   7. For example, let the note c be sounded with very small
intensity, and let that part of the basilar membrane which
responds most strongly be called the c-string. If then the
same note c is made to sound close to the ear with considerable
intensity, the strongest resonance will be excited no longer
in the c-string, but in some string of longer natural period,
such as the Bb-string. Now according to Helmholtz's theory

                       Acoustical Experiments.                       451
of sound-perception our estimate of pitch depends entirely on
localization of the most strongly agitated portion of the basilar
membrane, so that in the case just considered, when the note
c was made to change from a very small to a very much
greater intensity, we should expect to hear not only an in
crease of loudness, but also a lowering of pitch.
   8. At the same time it is not to be supposed that the
agitation of the “c-string” is lessened when the intensity of
the note c is augmented. The effect must necessarily be in
the other direction, so that such a note powerfully sounded
close to the ear must perceptibly excite a tract of the basilar
membrane corresponding to a considerable range of pitch (the
place of maximum disturbance being probably not far from
the middle of this range).
   9. We must even suppose that an increase in the intensity
of a note without change of frequency causes the “range of
stimulation ” (as we may call it) to extend to patches a little
higher than before, as well as to those a good deal lower.
   10. In connexion with $8 it may be remarked that, when
the ear is kept close to the resonant cavity of a strongly
vibrating c-fork, the impression of pitch obtained is far from
being very definite. One pitch or another within an appre
ciable range may be heard by a mere effort of attention. On
the other hand, a more definite impression is obtained on
alternating between smaller and greater intensities of the
same note. Thus, on raising or lowering the head, as men
tioned in § 3, the interval between the soft note and the loud
note may appear at first to be about a minor third, when the
fork is sounding strongly. As the amplitude of vibration dies
down, the interval diminishes, and it is possible to say pretty
definitely when it is just a whole tone, and when it is only a
semitone; until, as the note in either position of the head
becomes nearly inaudible, the apparent difference of pitch is
obliterated.
    11. If the orifice of the ear remote from the fork is left
open, the sound reaching that ear will be less intense than is
heard by the other ear, and the corresponding pitch will be
higher. Though of course beats are entirely absent", it might
be thought that two distinct pitches would be heard simulta
neously, but this requires a distinct effort of attention. The
 general impression is of a pitch intermediate between those
which would be heard by the two ears separately, so that on
   * In the discussion Prof. S. P. Thompson suggested that, if the
observations were valid, beats should occur between the notes heard
by the two ears; but a consideration of the physical conditions will show
that nothing of this kind is to be expected.

452                 Some Acoustical Experiments.
closing the further ear a distinct lowering of pitch takes place.
 For this reason the effects described in § 3 are most marked
when the less stimulated ear is kept closed.
    12. I have not yet mentioned an effect noticed by an ob
server in whom hearing with one ear was not normal. With
the less sensitive ear the usual effect was reversed; that is, on
bringing the ear close to the resonance-cavity of the c-fork,
the pitch, instead of falling, appeared to rise by about a semitone.
Even taking § 9 into account, this result seems rather ano
malous.
    13. Though variations of pitch accompanying variations of
loudness must frequently have been observed, the physiological
influences at work do not appear to have been suspected *.
And yet these subjective influences must be by no means
 negligible in the case of wind-instrument players; and even
 from players of stringed instruments I think I have heard
that it is easier to judge of another player's intonation than
to be quite certain about one's own. On the other hand, as
regards the tuning of the intervals of consonant chords, it
must be remembered that the actual criterion is usually the
 obliteration of beats, so that on this point the judgment is not
disturbed by a small subjective uncertainty in the estimation
of pitch. I have also convinced myself that, when harmonic
 upper partials are present, the sense of tonality is largely
dependent upon them; and harmonics from their higher
pitch and generally feebler intensity will suffer less subjective
repression of pitch than the fundamental.
       II. Objective Demonstration of Combination-Tones.
    14. When two notes differing in frequency are powerfully
sounded in the neighbourhood of one another, secondary tones
are produced, of which the most prominent have frequencies
respectively equal to the sum and difference of the frequencies
of the parent tones. It has been maintained by some writers
that these secondary tones are purely subjective, and have no
existence external to the ear, and the following experiment
was designed to show that in some cases at least the first
 difference-tone has a real physical existence. If the vibration
of the air external to the ear has really a component of the
frequency in question, we must suppose this component to
have arisen from a failure of the principle of superposition,
that is, from the circumstance that as the parent vibrations
   * For example, Lord Rayleigh mentions (“Theory of Sound, 2nd ed.
vol. i. § 67) that “tuning-forks rise a little, though very little, in pitch
as the vibration dies away.”

 are of considerable amplitude, the equations of motion cannot
 be regarded as sensibly linear ; and accordingly it is to be
 expected that if two sources of sound are brought closer to
 gether, the intensity of the difference-tone will increase. I
 have used two stopped organ-pipes of white metal giving the
 notes e' and g’, the difference-tone being consequently C. The
 pipes are connected to a well-weighted organ-bellows by
 flexible rubber tubes, and the distance between them can be
 varied at will from a few feet to a couple of inches (the walls
 of the two pipes being then in contact). It is best for the
 listener to be stationed in a distant room, so that the sound
 which reaches him is only of moderate intensity, while the
 comparatively small distances through which the pipes are
 moved does not appreciably affect the sounds which they indi
 vidually send to his ear. The bellows being filled, the sound
 ing pipes are held alternately far apart and near together,
 and each time, as they nearly approach one another, the dif
 ference-tone C1 is heard to boom out with greatly increased
intensity. From this, I would suggest, we are to infer that
the difference-tone has a real objective existence.
    (Further experiments have not confirmed this result. Even
 Prof. Rücker's very sensitive arrangement of interference
 bands failed to show any objective difference-tone from the
 two organ-pipes, suitably tuned. An attempt will be made
to deal with the subject more fully in a subsequent paper.)

      GENTLEMEN,                                April 3, 1895.
   N 1888 I communicated to the February No. of the Phil.
     Mag. a short paper on glacier motion. Since then I have
had an opportunity of examining, in company with Mr. G.
Fletcher, F.G.S., the structure of some of the largest Swiss
and Norwegian glaciers. The results of our investigation
are given in a paper printed in the April number of the
Geological Magazine for the current year.
   In it we show that the small granular particles of ice
resulting from the partial melting and refreezing of the snow,
and also the minute crystal particles collected during frosty
sunless days, in course of time, when they have become
welded by pressure into a compact mass, undergo a striking
change. The greater number of the granules and crystalline
particles disappear, the molecules composing them going to
build up a comparatively small number of large crystalline

quite clear why some of the grains should increase in size
and others disappear, the transference of the molecules from
crystal to crystal offers no difficulty. . . . .22
   Since this was written I have been led to think that the
known laws regulating surface-tension phenomena perhaps
afford an explanation for the disappearance of the smaller
granules and the growth of the larger ones.
    Glacier-ice consists of a kind of conglomerate formed of
glacier-grains. These grains have very irregular outlines

      Kinetic Interpretation of the Dissipation Function.        455
    Between each grain and its neighbours there is a true
surface, the tension of which probably depends in some
measure upon the relationship of their axes to each other.
    Now we know that a by no means unimportant portion of
the energy of a solid body depends upon its surface area;
and I would suggest also that it depends in some measure
upon the surfaces separating the crystal units, of which it is
composed, from each other, even when they are of similar
composition.
   In a block of glacier-ice, therefore, or in a block of granite,
the total energy depends, not only upon its temperature and
volume, but also upon the energy of the surface-tensions of
its component grains, whether they be similar or dissimilar
in composition.
   Now it is an important theorem of Dynamics that, for the
stable equilibrium of a system, the potential energy of the
whole must be a minimum. For instance, when immiscible
liquids are intimately mixed, work is done in increasing their
surface-energy, and the energy thus rendered potential serves
to again separate them. Glacier-ice is in much the same
condition. Its potential energy is always tending to a
minimum, a condition which can only be reached by the
disappearance of the interfaces between the crystal-grains.
Being viscous, it is unable to do more than delay the dis
appearance of the interfaces, and the grains would continue
to grow larger and larger with the lapse of time were it not
for the fact that they are broken in the production of the
ribboned or veined structure.
    For the same reason masses of all liquids possessing struc
ture, whatever their viscosities may be, eventually become
single crystalline particles.

        From this it appears that the direction of that transformation
        of energy the rate of which is F depends on the nature of the
        mutual action between molecules. Molar energy will become
        converted into molecular energy if molecular interaction is
        such as to tend to diminish the absolute values of the terms
        p-p$*, png and similar terms; i.e. such as to tend gradually
        to calm the disturbance existing : F is then always a positive
        quantity and the opposite transformation of molecular energy
        into molar energy is impossible. That this is precisely what
        is realised in all fluids in Nature, as attested by the phe
        nomenon of viscosity, cannot, however, be deduced from
        Kinematical Theory. We have ascertained, as it were, the
        path of change of the molar energy, but we are unable to say
        why one of the two possible directions of change is always
        selected.
           If now we suppose the following equations to be given:

        to the law of force between molecules; Poisson, Sir G. G.
        Stokes, and others have given them in the ordinary Theory of

    the term F to an irreversible phenomenon. Indeed the
    conversion of molar energy into molecular energy which
    goes on, of whatever kind the existing disturbance may be,
    is irreversible.   We have thus before us an example of
     Dissipation of Energy in a purely dynamical system.

           questions in spectroscopy by the publication of the
   researches of Pringsheim, Paschen, and Smithells has led me
   recently to undertake a series of observations on the visible
                     * Communicated by the Author,

                 the Radiation of Heated Gases.             461
radiations of certain elementary substances, particularly iodine
and sodium, when their vapours are subjected to external
heating. The important article published in the Philoso
phical Magazine (March 1894), by Prof. Smithells, may be
said to have furnished the main incentive in this work, as it
likewise determined the direction followed in the experiments.
    I am further indebted to Prof. Smithells, to whom I sub
mitted a statement of my results, for valuable advice and
criticism, which has enabled me to anticipate certain
objections that might have been raised to my conclusions.
    The experiments were undertaken primarily with a view to
obtaining a closer personal acquaintance with what I may
call the “spectroscopic behaviour” of heated gases. I had
no idea that they would lead to results which could throw
any new light on the questions discussed in Prof. Smithells
paper. Nevertheless, after continuing the experiments in a
somewhat desultory fashion for some six months, and with
very simple appliances, certain facts have presented them
 selves in a prominent way, which, so far as I can discover,
 have not been sufficiently noticed by previous workers, and
 which would appear to lend a strong support to the view there
 advocated, namely, that the luminosity of gases in flames
may be directly due to high temperature, and that external
heating is in itself sufficient to make a gas emit visible rays.
    The fact that iodine vapour can be easily made incan
 descent by external heating was noticed by Salet (Spectro
 scopie, p. 173); and in the article above mentioned Prof.
 Smithells concludes that this luminosity can only be due to
 heat, and that chemical action plays no part in the phe
 nomenon. It seemed, therefore, of interest to determine,
 first, the character of this iodine emission, and then to dis
 cover whether the property of glowing by mere heating was
 peculiar to iodine, or was # in greater or less degree by
 other allied elements when vaporized, particularly by those
 which exhibit strong absorptive properties on light. After
 having thus gained some experience with the less easily
 oxidizable metalloids, I proposed finally to approach the
 question of the radiation of heated metallic vapours, to
 determine whether or not their characteristic spectra can be
 produced by mere heating.
     It will perhaps be worth while at the outset to describe
 briefly a few simple experiments made to determine whether
 the iodine glow is affected in any way by the nature of the
 gas in which it is heated. I will describe them as nearly as
 possible in the order in which they were performed.
     Eaperiment I.—A little iodine was placed near the closed
 end of a piece of hard glass tube of about 7 mm. bore, the
          -

  462           Mr. J. Evershed’s Experiments on
  other end being open to the atmosphere. This was suspended
  horizontally, and a Bunsen flame brought under the central
 part; when about 5 or 6 cm. of the ' had become nearly
 red-hot, the flame was held for a few seconds under the part
 containing the iodine, which immediately volatilized, fillin
 the whole tube with coloured vapour. A bright reddis
 glow then appeared in the heated portion of the tube.
     Exp. II.—Iodine was heated in a tube as in I. but closed to
 the atmosphere, and in which air was replaced by nitrogen.
 No difference was seen in the emission of light.
    Exp. III.—The same as II, excepting that hydrogen was
 substituted for nitrogen. In this case also theglowing appeared,
 the same as before, but it could not be maintained as combina
 tion took place between the hydrogen and iodine, and the
 colourless hydriodic acid formed emitted no light.
    Exp. IV.-In CO2 the same result was obtained as in
nitrogen.
    Exp. W.—A thickglass tube containing iodine was exhausted
with an air-pump until the pressure fell to about 20 mm. It
was then heated so as to expel the remaining air by yolatilizing
a portion of the iodine, and then sealed off. The whole length
of the exhausted tube was next warmed up until the density
of the iodine vapour was sufficient to give the usual deep
violet colour.    '.   strongly heating a short section of the
tube at this stage, the usual    £                glow appeared
exactly as in the other experiments.
    These preliminary experiments, therefore, as far as they go,
entirely favour the view that the glowing is determined by
heat alone, and not by chemical “luminescence.” For the
  henomenon appears to be quite independent of the gas in
which the iodine is heated, and in Ill., where chemical com
bination actually occurs, the light, instead of being intensified,
is extinguished.
    To determine the character of the light, things were
arranged as in I, the glowing tube being observed with a
spectroscope, having a lens in front to throw an image of the
hot part of the tube across the slit of the instrument. Before
heating the iodine a faint streaky spectrum, due to glowing
opaque particles in the glass, was all that could be seen; but
immediately the iodine was vaporized a bright spectrum
shone out. This appeared perfectly continuous, and similar
to that given by a red-hot iron wire, with which it was
directly compared. No sign of resolution into lines could be
made out even with a highly dispersive train of five prisms.
    Next a ray of white light from the flame of a paraffin lamp
was made to pass through the glowing tube and enter the spec
troscope, after having suffered absorption by the heated vapour.

                 the Radiation of Heated Gases.             463
The dark bands, characteristic of cooler iodine vapour, were
seen to be unchanged, and there was no sign of any continuous
absorption. Thus at the temperature of the experiment
iodine emits a continuous spectrum, and does not emit only
those rays which it absorbs.
    The question whether iodine is the only element having
this property of glowing with a continuous spectrum at com
paratively low   '             was next investigated. A series
of experiments with the allied element bromine immediately
showed that this was not so, for the vapour of this substance
was also found to glow brightly under similar circumstances.
    The bromine glow seems indeed to be quite as conspicuous
as that of iodine: the spectrum also was found to be perfectly
continuous.
    It was then thought that chlorine, being also a coloured gas
and allied to the others, would probably be found to emit
 light in the same way. Accordingly arrangements were
 made for generating and thoroughly drying this gas and
heating it in a glass tube, as in the foregoing experiments.
 The first attempts to see the glow were made, as before, from
 outside the tube; but they led to negative, or, at the most,
 very doubtful results. A very slight alteration in the mode of
 viewing the heated gas soon, however, revealed a distinct and
 unmistakable, though faint, luminosity. The experiment was
 arranged in the following way :-Chlorine from a generating
 flask, after being freed from HCl and dried by passing slowly
 through a long tube of calcium chloride, was led into a
 straight piece of combustion-tube of about 7 mm. bore,
 heated strongly in the middle. This tube connected on to a
 larger glass tube containing a total-reflexion prism placed in
 line with the central axis of the heated tube : this enabled
 one to observe the heated gas “end on ” without the interpo
 sition of the red-hot glass, and a dark background was
 obtained by covering up the further end of the combustion
 tube with opaque material.
     In this '', observations were made, first, with common air
  only passed through the apparatus, and afterwards with dried
  chlorine, about 5 cm. of the tube being kept meanwhile at
  the highest temperature attainable with an ordinary Bunsen
  burner. With air, the centre of the tube remained perfectly
  dark, and no trace of glowing solid matter in the form of dust
  could be seen. With chlorine, on the other hand, a faint
    reenish glow gradually filled up the previously dark central
  £ of the tube, appearing first on the lower or hottest part.
  The light, although brighter on the lower side, appeared per
  fectly uniform in texture so to speak, unlike the glow
  produced by incandescent solid particles, which can be seen

 464             Mr. J. Evershed’s Experiments on
 under certain circumstances as wreaths and streaky clouds
 moving with the convection-currents in the tube *.
     Being satisfied by repeated trials that the glow was really
 due to incandescent chlorine, an endeavour was made to
 determine the spectroscopic character of the light. It
 seemed almost hopeless to observe the spectrum directly, al
 though with a spectroscope of very low dispersion and wide
 slit the spectrum appeared to be continuous; but it could
 only be traced between the positions of D and F of the solar
 spectrum, probably owing to the greater sensitiveness of the
 eye to that region. An indirect method was, however, de
 vised. The depth of the layer of cool chlorine traversed by
 the light from the hot gas was, in the first instance, about
 20 cm., that being the distance between the prism and the
 hot part of the tube. The absorbing effect of this thickness
 of gas was tested by varying the distance, heating the
 tube successively at 15 and 30 cm. from the prism. If the
 spectrum of the light emitted consisted of lines or bands cor
 responding to the absorption-lines of chlorine, there should
 be a marked increase of absorption after traversing 30 cm. as
 compared with 15 cm. But no difference was perceptible in
 the intensity of the glow whatever the distance traversed,
 showing that the cool gas exercises very little absorption on
the light coming from the hot.
    The inference, therefore, is that chlorine, like iodine and
bromine, emits other rays than those absorbed, and probably
 shines with continuous light; the selective absorption of the
 cool gas merely giving the glow a greenish tint.
    There seems no reason to doubt that the luminosity of
 chlorine, as of its allied elements, is directly due to the
heating, and that chemical changes are not concerned in the
phenomenon.
    The Sulphur Group.—Similar results have been obtained
with sulphur and selenium. The glowing may be observed
either “end on ” in a red-hot porcelain tube filled with hy
drogen or nitrogen, or the element may be simply sealed in
a hard glass tube in air. If a small portion of the tube be
then heated strongly, a faint glow can be seen while distil
lation is going on, and the heated space is filled with vapour.
    Phosphorus.—Experiments with this substance have so far
led to negative results. After all the phosphorescence due to
traces of oxygen has disappeared from the tube, the vapour
appears to give no light.
   * The glowing of heated chlorine may be more conveniently observed
in a porcelain tube connected with a T-tube having a glass plate ce
mented in one end of the T.    If the Bunsen is concentrated on the tube
by means of a fire-clay arch placed over it, the glow uniformly illuminates
the bore of the tube.                                                     -

                  the Radiation of Heated Gases.               465
    Arsenic.—The vapour of this substance glows distinctly
when heated in nitrogen. In hydrogen also the glow is dis
tinct, but fainter than in nitrogen.
    To sum up, then, it appears that besides iodine, the vapours
of bromine, chlorine, sulphur, selenium, and arsenic can all
be made more or less incandescent by heating to the tempe
rature at which glass combustion-tube softens, and the light
emitted by each of these glowing vapours appears to give a
perfectly continuous spectrum; whilst the corresponding
absorption spectra are selective. Thus there is no such close
relation between emission and absorption as is implied by
 Kirchhoff's law of radiating bodies. There seems, however,
 to be a general relation between the total absorbing and
 radiating power for the visible rays: those vapours which are
 highly coloured and absorb strongly in the visible spectrum
 also radiate conspicuously in that part of the spectrum, whilst
 colourless non-absorbing vapours, such as phosphorus, emit
 no perceptible light when heated.
      hat the glowing in these cases in no way differs from the
 glowing of heated solids seems, to say the least, extremely
 probable, for there is no evidence whatever that chemical
 changes accompany the luminosity; and there is besides the
 fact that when direct combination does occur between the
 vapour and the gas in which it is heated, as in the case of
 iodine in hydrogen, and possibly also arsenic in hydrogen,
  there is no £ effect at all.
     It may be questioned, however, whether molecular disso
 ciation may not be concerned in the radiation, or alternate
 dissociation and reaggregation of the atoms of the molecules,
  For, according to the kinetic theory, at a given temperature
  and pressure the vapours may contain a certain proportion of
  free atoms distributed among the more complex molecular
  groups, but the individuality of these uncombined atoms will
  continually change whilst the proportion remains the same,
  for there will be a constant reaction or interchange going on
  between the atoms and the molecules. The emission of light
  may be supposed to depend on this act of union or disunion
  of the atoms, the radiant energy being indirectly derived from
  the heat supplied to the system to maintain the temperature.
     Thus in the case of the diatomic gases iodine, bromine,
  and chlorine, a proportion of the molecules I2, Br, Cl, may
  dissociate into 21, 2Br, 2Gl, and sulphur vapour may similarly
  dissociate from So to 3S, and so on.          From recent determi
  nations of the vapour densities of the halogens, it appears
   that iodine begins to dissociate between 600° and 700°C., at
   a pressure of 1 atmosphere". Chlorine, on the other hand,
              * Crafts and Meier, Ber, deut. chem. Ges. xiii.

466              Mr. J. Evershed's Experiments on
remains at a normal density corresponding to Cl2 between
about 200° and 1200°C. * With regard to the former element,
the temperature at which dissociation commences (say 600°)
is not much above that at which the glowing is first seen, and
as in most of the experiments the iodine or bromine vapour
is largely diluted with a neutral gas, so that the partial pres
sure is a good deal less than one atmosphere, it might well be
supposed that dissociation was going on even at the lowest
temperature at which the glow can be seen. But in the case of
chlorine dissociation begins at some 500° above the temperature
of my experiments (assumed at about 700°) : moreover, there
is no dilution of gas, which is observed at the atmospheric
pressure, so there can be no question of dissociation here; or
at any rate, as there is no independent evidence of it, we have
no more right to assume it as a cause of the luminosity than
we have in the case of glowing solids.
    But, apart from the fact that chlorine can be made incan
descent although it is not dissociating, it appears to me that
the general relation mentioned above between radiation and ab
sorption of the visible rays, and the fact that the intensity of
the glowing of the more absorptive vapours (the others being
too difficult to observe) appears to closely follow that of a
solid raised simultaneously through the same range of tempe
raturet, gives strong support to the view that there is no
essential difference between gases and solids in the manner
in which they radiate, at any rate under the conditions of the
foregoing experiments. If dissociation were concerned, say,
in the case of glowing iodine, one would expect the intensity
of the light to rapidly increase when the temperature is made
 to approach the actual temperature of dissociation, where the
 maximum interaction of the atoms occurs.              It should in fact
increase in a much greater ratio than in the case of a glowing
 solid.    But I have failed to detect any evidence of such rela
tive increase on the part of eitheriodine or any other glowing
 gas. Further, a decrease of density (by exhaustion or dilu
tion) will facilitate dissociation, and thus should tend to
counteract the reduction of luminosity due to a smaller
number of molecules concerned. But no such effect is in
fact to be seen under these conditions.
   * J. M. Crafts, ibid. xvi.; also Jahn, ibid. xv.
   t The radiation from iodine may be easily compared with that of a
solid at the same temperature, by placing a small piece of carbon inside
the heated portion of the glass tube described in exp. I. Also when the
glass contains opaque particles, these are seen to glow with the same
intensity as the iodine, whatever the temperature, when the vapour is of
sufficient density to give the maximum luminosity.

external heating, I next tried what could be done with

hypothesis, to give the best chance of success at the very
moderate temperatures I could command with a single large
Bunsen flame.
   The form of apparatus used in the earlier experiments was
designed with a view to excluding, as far as possible, from
the tube in which the sodium was to be heated any gaseous
substances that might be expected to react chemically with
the vapour of the metal: the emission phenomena produced
under these conditions being then compared with that pro
duced when traces of oxygen or moisture were purposely
allowed to remain in the neutral gas in which the sodium was
volatilized. In the diagram (Plate VII. fig. 1) A and B are
two similar gas-holders; a rubber tube leads from A to a
couple of wash-bottles S', S', containing strong sulphuric
acid; from S" a long tube of hard glass, P, containing a
little phosphorus leads into the drying-tube C, which is
packed with calcium oxide and calcium chloride—the former
to remove carbonic acid, and the latter traces of water which
may remain in the gas used after passing the sulphuric-acid
bottles. The drying-tube connects on to #. porcelain heating
tube H through a metal T-piece, one end of the T having a
 glass plate carefully cemented in so that one may look along
the inside of the heating-tube, to which the T is connected by
 rubber tube tightened with wire, both connexions being also
buried in sealing-wax. At the other end of H, which is covered
in the centre by a fireclay arch, is a second T of glass, one limb
connecting with a glass gland or stuffing-box, G, with pierced
rubber ends, and filled with mercury. A long steel rod passes
through the gland, the end being flattened to a spoon-shape;
this can be pushed along to the centre of H, or drawn out
past the entrance of the side tube of the T. This side tube
is closed by a perforated rubber stopper, through which a
small glass tube passes bearing a small reflecting prism
cemented to the end, which is thus closed up; but in order
 to allow of the escape of the gases, so that a current may be
 set up in the apparatus, a hole is blown in the side of this
 tube near the prism. The outer end of the tube is connected
by rubber tubing to another wash-bottle S" containing sul
phuric acid, and from this again a tube leads to the gas
holder B. Thus the entire apparatus forms a closed circuit
 and has no inlet or outlet. £ gas-holders have each a

 468            Mr. J. Evershed’s Experiments on
 Y-tube attached, one branch of the Y leading to the appa
 ratus and the other connecting A with B by means of a
 rubber tube carrying a clip. The S at the foot of the diagram
 is a small direct-vision spectroscope, and L is a lens focussing
 the central parts of the tube H on to the slit of the instru
 ment; both are attached to a strip of hard wood movable
horizontally about an axis placed between the lens and the
slit. This enables one to instantly push aside the spectro
scope into the position shown by dotted lines and observe the
glowing tube directly.
    To observe the sodium-spectrum, one fills the gas-holder A
with some indifferent gas containing no oxygen, or only a trace
of that element, such as nitrogen or hydrogen, or ordinary
coal-gas. When full it is disconnected with the gas-generator
or gas-main, as the case may be, and connexion is made with
the apparatus. Next, weights are put on A until sufficient
pressure is obtained to drive a current of gas through the
wash-bottles, drying-tube, &c. into B. Then the Bunsen is
lighted under the porcelain tube, which it presently heats up
to a bright incandescence for about two inches of its length.
After sufficient dry gas has passed through, and all trace of
moisture has gone, the current is stopped by closing the
stopcock on A, and a small pellet of sodium is dropped into
the steel spoon through the side tube of the glass T, the
stopper with the inner tube and prism being removed for this
purpose and quickly replaced. The current is then restarted,
to drive away any oxygen that may have diffused in by the
operation, and at the same time the tube P is gently heated
by a spirit-lamp flame until a small faintly luminous flame is
seen, indicating combination of the last traces of oxygen with
the phosphorus. After this has gone on a sufficient length of
time, and the apparatus may be considered to be free from
oxygen, water, and carbonic acid, the stopcock on A is again
closed and the steel spoon carrying the sodium is pushed
into the hot part of the tube H, turned over, the sodium shaken
out, and the spoon again withdrawn past the entrance of the side
tube. Now the tube carrying the prism is pushed down into
line with the tube H, and the white flame of a paraffin-lamp
is placed close alongside the glass T, so that a ray of white
light can be made to traverse the glowing vapour in H. One
may now observe at will the absorption or emission spectrum
of the glowing sodium by the simple operation of turning the
lamp-flame up or down.                         -
    The experiments actually performed with this apparatus
may be thus briefly described:–
   I. With the porcelain tube strongly heated, a slow current
of coal-gas, not specially freed from oxygen, was allowed to

                   the Radiation of Heated Gases.                469
circulate in the apparatus, no sodium being admitted. A
distinct and fine sodium line was visible in the spectroscope,
which increased in brightness when a little air was mixed
with the gas, but which gradually faded to invisibility when
the phosphorus tube was heated so as to eliminate oxygen.
   The explanation of this result appears to be simple enough.
The trace of oxygen remaining in the coal-gas combines with
the hydrogen £ it reaches the hot part of the tube, and
the “flame” so formed (which, however, is not visible as
such, except when a large quantity of O is present) becomes
tinted by the salts of sodium, which in excessively minute
quantity are known to be driven off from the porcelain at a
red heat, just in the same way as the Bunsen flame outside is
tinted. This fine double D line, therefore, may not be the
result of heat alone, since it is developed as a consequence of
chemical reactions.
   II. A pellet of clean sodium was placed in the steel spoon,
and the gas—coal-gas—allowed to circulate, the phosphorus
being heated. The line seen in Experiment I. was watched,
and some time after it had quite disappeared the current was
stopped and the sodium pushed into the hot part of the tube.
Instantly the central bore of the porcelain was filled with
light, '. in the spectroscope was found to be perfectly
continuous, but crossed by a very wide black line at D.
Gradually the continuous spectrum faded, and as it became
fainter the dark D line was seen to be bordered with a fringe
of light on each side; and as the vapour became less dense,
owing to the distillation of the sodium into cooler parts of the
tube, the D line went through the changes represented in
fig. 3, in the order a, b, c, d, finally persisting as a rather
wide bright line in which a very fine dark line could
usually be made out". But at any stage of the experiment,
the dark central line could easily be extinguished by allowing
a gentle current of gas to push back the cooler absorbing
layer into the hotter regions. Now the question to be decided
was whether this broad bright, hazy D line was or was not
the result of chemical activity.
   III. In this experiment the phosphorus tube and the
drying-tube were cut out of the circuit, the gas-holder A
being connected directly with the heating-tube. With the
current of gas stopped, the D line appeared as in the last
experiment, but observations were somewhat impeded by
opaque clouds of oxide which hung about the cooler parts
  * The dispersion of the spectroscope employed in all the sodium
experiments being insufficient to separate the two components of the
D line, it is evident that when this line appeared widened the two
were really fused into one broad band.

470            Mr. J. Evershed’s Experiments on
of the tube. When, however, a slow current of the undried
gas was allowed to impinge on the sodium vapour, by partly
opening the stopcock A, the absorption-line vanished and an
intensely brilliant but fine line appeared in its place in the
centre of the broad but relatively faint emission-line. This
sharply-defined narrow line resembled the ordinary D line
seen in flames. It was brighter than the continuous spectrum
of the glowing sides of the tube, on which it appeared to be
superposed.
   IV. Atmospheric nitrogen was substituted for coal-gas in
the gas-holders, and was freed from traces of oxygen and dried
before entering the heating-tube by passing over heated
phosphorus and through a tube of CaCl2. The phenomena
observed on volatilizing the sodium in this gas were in every
way the same as in coal-gas. It was subsequently found that
the same results could be obtained with unpurified nitrogen, or
even with common air, the sodium itself effecting the purifica
tion almost immediately on vaporizing, producing at the
same time a brilliant flash—in the spectroscope a brilliant
but sharply-defined and narrow D line—and clouds of oxide;
afterwards showing the broad hazy emission-line and the
central black absorption-line, when all the oxygen in the tube
had been consumed and the oxide had subsided.
   These results appear to me to show that impurities in the
neutral gases used are not concerned in the production of the
broad hazy emission-line, for when traces of these, particularly
oxygen and moisture, are known to be present and are allowed
to impinge on the sodium vapour, a line is seen which is fine
and  '       showing that the region of chemical action is only a
surface-layer of no great density, whilst the fainter but broad
and diffuse D line, always seen when the vapour is undisturbed,
evidently originates at a great depth where the vapour-density
is considerable and in a region protected from chemical action
by the outer relatively cool layers giving the absorption-line.
   While this central region of the vapour may be considered
to be well protected by the outer layers from impurities in
the neutral gas employed, there still remains the possibility
that the porcelain tube itself reacts with the sodium through
out its heated part, thus furnishing a continual supply of
chemical energy; and some support is given to this view of
the case from the fact that the bright line cannot be maintained
as a wide line indefinitely without a continual addition of
fresh sodium, also the tube becomes much corroded, black
silicon being deposited inside: thus proving a reaction between
the silicates of the porcelain and the sodium.
   In the experiments which follow, the effect of such reactions
between the tube and the sodium is eliminated by the use of

                 the Radiation of Heated Gases.             471
iron tubes in place of porcelain. The first trials were made
with a short piece of iron tube about 6 cm. long and 8 mm.
bore, £ at the ends and fitted between two hard glass
tubes of the same diameter, the joints being ground to fit.
This made good joints when the iron became red-hot and the
glass in contact with it was softened and pressed up tight;
but although satisfactory results were obtained in two or
three experiments, constant trouble was experienced in the
cracking of the glass while cooling. Finally the glass
was discarded and a long iron tube prepared (a piece of
ordinary 3-inch hydraulic tube). In order to diminish as far
as possible the loss of heat by conduction, so as to maintain
a high temperature for about 8 cm. in the central part, a
number of deep necks were cut in the metal, as shown in
fig. 2, and around these necks a thick ring of asbestos-packing
was wound and a fire-clay arch placed over all. Thus the
Bunsen flame could be concentrated entirely on the central
piece of the tube and the temperature could be maintained
inside the tube above the fusing-point of fluor-spar and
aluminium, but not reaching that of silver. The rubber
connexions between the ends of the iron tube and the two
T-pieces gave trouble at first, but subsequently it was found
that when buried in a thick layer of plaster of Paris they
were completely protected from destruction by heat, the large
surface afforded by the plaster of Paris forming an effectual
radiator and preventing the ends from becoming too hot.
    Experiment W.—With the iron tube at a bright red heat,
the sodium was tipped out from the steel spoon as before,
in an atmosphere of carefully dried coal-gas. Now, if in the
previous experiments the D radiation was due to chemical
action taking place between the sodium and the oxygen
compounds of the porcelain, one ought in this experiment to
find, if not an entire suppression of the bright line, at least
a striking difference in the radiation. No such difference
was, however, to be observed, the intensity remaining pre
cisely the same as before and the sequence of phenomena
closely resembling that shown in fig. 3. The various phases
there shown were, however, prolonged almost indefinitely in
time, as the sodium never became used up as before, and the
 distillation into cooler parts of the tube proceeded so slowly
that it was necessary to allow a gentle current of gas to drive
 away the denser vapour giving a continuous spectrum before
 the D line itself could be studied. Also throughout the
 experiment the dark absorption-line was more intense than
 in porcelain, and it could easily be observed after six hours
 of continuous heating, when even the emission-line had
 become    relatively narrow. This naturally follows from the

472             Mr. J. Evershed's Experiments on
consideration that in the iron the temperature-gradient on each
side of the central red-hot part of the tube is much less steep
than is the case when porcelain or glass is used, and con
sequently there is a much greater thickness of relatively cool
 vapour through which the emission-line is seen.
    Under the conditions of these experiments, therefore, the
 bright D line appears to be quite uninfluenced either by the
 nature of the neutral gases used and the impurities they may
 contain, or by the material of which the heating-tube is
 composed: iron giving exactly the same results as porcelain.
 It would hardly be safe, however, at this stage of the inquiry
 to infer that chemical reactions are not concerned in the pro
 duction of the light; for it would be argued that, as iron
 becomes slightly porous at a red heat, oxygen, or at any rate
 some of the gaseous constituents of the Bunsen flame, might
 find their way into the tube by diffusion from outside, and in
 this way maintain a continual reaction with the sodium vapour.
    In order to diminish the possibility of this diffusion inwards
 affecting the results, a constant pressure of a few millimetres
 above atmospheric pressure is maintained within the tube,
 and if gases diffuse in at all it must be in opposition to the
 outward diffusing hydrogen. It has been pointed out to me,
 however, by Prof. Smithells that in dealing with the D line
 we are dealing with a reaction that is sensitive to *
 of a grain of sodium. It is only necessary to suppose, therefore,
 an equivalent amount of oxygen or other reacting body to be
 continually present in the tube to determine the D radiation.
    While £ not prepared to deny the possibility of such
 minute traces of oxygen or other bodies constantly finding
 their way into the middle of the sodium vapour, I consider
 that any reactions so caused could under no circumstances
 produce the broad ill-defined line actually observed. At the
 most a fine double D line would be seen similar to that of a
 flame tinted with a salt of sodium, where the density of
 the reacting molecules is not great. , Moreover, if reacting
 bodies were diffusing in from outside the tube—the absorbing
 layer of the sodium vapour itself forming an effectual barrier
 in other directions—the action would be greatest in an annular
 region in contact with the sides of the tube where the in
 coming molecules first encountered the sodium. This should
 cause a brightening or widening of the D line at each end *.
  But there is no such inequality seen: the line is quite uniform
 in width and brightness throughout its length; showing that
 if chemical reactions are producing the light, the reacting
    * The D line with the optical arrangement employed represents a
 section of the space inside the hot part of the tube,           -

                 the Radiation of Heated Gases.                473
molecules mnst be uniformly distributed throughout the
mass of vapour.
    The most telling argument, however, and one which, taken
alone, appears to me to prove beyond a doubt that the D
radiation under these conditions is the direct result of the
heating, is that derived from a comparison between the
emission and absorption spectra.
    To effect this comparison, the lamp and reflecting prism
previously described are brought into operation, and a beam
of white light is made to traverse one side of the heated tube,
 so that one portion of the slit of the spectroscope is illuminated
 by transmitted white light, whilst another contiguous portion
 is illuminated by the D radiation alone. Under these cir
 cumstances the absorption and emission spectra appear side
 by side in the field of view, and may be readily compared.
    Figs. 3 and 4 show the corresponding phases of these spectra
  (denoted by letters of the alphabet). It will be noticed that
 the emission-line or band in c, d, and e is represented as of
 the same width as the absorption-band. Careful observa
 tion under various conditions as to density shows that,
 excepting for the dark line in the centre, the bright D line is
 in every respect the exact counterpart of the absorption-line,
 whether the broad hazy band of the dense vapour is studied,
 or the relatively narrow line seen with more attenuated vapour.
    Assuming, then, that the width of both absorption and
 emission lines is determined by the molecular density of the
 absorbing and emitting vapour, it follows that in the densest
 region every molecule that is concerned in the absorption is
 also concerned in the radiation. In other words, practically
 every molecule in the hot part of the tube contributes its
  share to the radiation. But it is surely impossible to sup
  pose that every molecule, or even a large proportion of the
 molecules, is continually undergoing chemical change. The
 supply of oxygen or other reacting bodies—supposing they
 do gain access to the sodium—will never be equal to even a
 small fraction of the demand; also, if oxidation is proceeding,
 one would expect to find traces of oxide forming after several
  hours. But the heating may be continued for six hours at
 the least without touching the apparatus, and at the end of
 this time the D line, with its central absorption-line, is seen
 as clearly as at the beginning, there being no trace of any
  opaque clouds of oxide such as are always seen when traces
  of oxygen are known to be present in the tube.
     There seems no possible alternative, therefore, to the obvious
  and simple explanation which ascribes the radiation to heat
  alone. If it were assumed that there exists diffused through
 out the sodium vapour some substance capable of setting up

474            Mr. J. Evershed's Experiments on
chemical reactions, it might indeed be imagined that a kind
of cyclical process of alternate combination and dissociation
takes place, the energy supplying the radiation being derived
indirectly from the heated walls of the tube: these alternate
changes being determined by differences of temperature in
the reacting molecules, the cooler combining and the hotter
dissociating, or vice versa. But it is practically certain that
under the conditions of these experiments there must always,
be a large excess of sodium molecules over any others likely
to produce such reactions, unless, indeed, hydrogen or nitrogen
were to behave in this way towards sodium, and the spectro
scopic evidence, as just explained, implies that all the free
sodium molecules are concerned in the radiation.
   Or perhaps it may be further argued in support of the
“chemical” origin of the radiation, that the sodium molecule
is itself undergoing alternate dissociation and recombination.
The reasons already given against this view in the case of
iodine apply even more forcibly in this instance. Thus, if the
radiation were due to such action, the intensity should follow
the curve representing the change of relative vapour-density
with temperature, rising to a maximum at the turning-point
in this curve—indicating the greatest interaction between the
atoms and the molecules—but falling away to zero when the
point of complete dissociation is reached. Now the most
reliable recent determinations of the vapour-density of sodium
indicate that at about the temperature of melting cast-iron
the vapour is entirely monatomic * : therefore, if we assume
that at the lowest temperature of my experiments the
atoms are more or less aggregated, the relative intensity of
the D line, compared with the continuous spectrum of the
glowing sides of the tube, should change as the temperature
is increased,—it should get brighter or fainter according
as the actual temperature of dissociation is above or below
the initial temperature of my experiments; and it should
cease altogether if the temperature be raised to the point
where the vapour becomes entirely monatomic.
   But as a matter of fact there is no such change of relative
intensity. As the temperature is increased from the point
where the radiation begins to be seen, the D line follows
strictly the continuous spectrum of the glowing tube; from
the lowest to the highest temperature (a range of some 300 C.
degrees), the gaseous radiation increases in intensity exactly
in correspondence with the radiation from the solid, always
keeping the same intensity (so far as the eye can judge) as
the spectrum of the glowing tube.

                 Origin of the Continuous Spectrum.
    There remains to be considered the continuous light seen
 when the sodium is first volatilized, and before the broad
  Demission-line appears (fig. 3, a). After a number of ex
 periments, made under various conditions as to the purity of
 the coal-gas or nitrogen employed and density of the sodium
 vapour, I conclude that this radiation is really due to free
 sodium, and that it always appears when the vapour is above
 a certain density. It is well known that dense sodium vapour
 gives a remarkable banded absorption-spectrum". In the
 experiment alluded to, I have studied the continuous emission
 spectrum in relation to this banded absorption, and find that
 they are intimately connected: thus, when the sodium is first
 volatilized and a bright glow fills the tube, the vapour appears a
 splendid violet colour by transmitted light; it is in fact opaque
 to all rays except the violet; gradually, however, green rays
 begin to be transmitted (fig. 4, a), then red (fig. 4, b); the dark
 space between the green and the violet is now seen to be made
 up of a large number of black lines (close together with the low
 dispersion employed), these rapidly decrease in intensity as
 the vapour diffuses along the tube and becomes less dense,
 while the black band blotting out the yellow assumes the
 usual appearance of the wide D absorption-band f. The
 continuous emission glow persists through these progressive
 changes in the absorption, but becomes gradually fainter,
 and as the last traces of the absorption-lines in the blue dis
 appear it fades away almost entirely, leaving behind, so to
 speak, the broad bright emission-band at D, the exact reverse of
 the absorption-band, except for the black line filling up the
 centre, due to relatively cool vapourin the nearer part of the tube.
    It seems, therefore, that dense sodium vapour, like iodine
 and other coloured vapours giving banded absorption-spectra,
 emits when in this state light of all wave-lengths, and that
 the change to discontinuous emission is determined by a
 reduction of density. There are indications, however, that
 at higher temperatures the continuous light would give place
 to bands corresponding with the absorption-bands, just as
 iodine is said to give a banded emission spectrum when heated
   * Wide Roscoe & Schuster, Proc. Roy Soc. xxii. p. 362.
   t. A curious phenomenon may be seen when a current or gust of gas
is allowed to drive the dense vapour along the tube. The colour of the
vapour seen by transmitted light suddenly changes from green to a
splendid ruby-red. This is not due to a change in the character of the
absorption-spectrum, but may be explained as an effect of refraction:
the sodium vapour, being blown out more in the centre than along the
sides of the tube, acts like a prism, refracting the blue and green rays
radially from the centre, the red alone—being least deviated-passing
out at the end of the tube. This effect is more obvious with hydrogen
than with nitrogen.                                   -

 the highest temperature attainable with this apparatus, it is
 seen not to fade equally in all parts of the spectrum, -a stage
 is reached (see fig. 3, b) when, in addition to the Demission
 line, a green line appears in the place of a conspicuous absorp
 tion-line, and a faint glow remains in the blue corresponding
 to the absorption-bands in that region (figs. 3–4, b).

 ON THE ROTATIONAL COEFFICIENTS OF THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY
                 IN CRYSTALS.      BY M. CHARLES SORET.
    The method used has been pointed out in a previous note
 (Archives de Genève, 1893, xxix. p. 355).
    Heating by the method of Jannettaz a point on a face not
 perpendicular to the axis of rotation in a crystal in which the
coefficients in question are not zero, isotherms should be obtained
 which are not symmetrical in reference to that diameter which
 coincides with the projection of the axis of rotation.
    The crystals were mounted and centred at the end of a vertical
 axis provided with screw motions for setting the face horizontal.
 A small platinum sphere heated by an electrical current is applied
against this face at a point A on the prolongation of the vertical axis.
    Isotherms were obtained in the usual way, taking care to turn
the crystal steadily and regularly during the heating so that this
was symmetrical about the point A. This point, the intersection
of the face investigated and the axis of rotation, was thus without
any possible error in the centre of heating.                               -
    After obtaining the isotherm it was examined, without touching
the adjustment, by means of an eyepiece with a micrometric scale.
The crystal being first placed with its rotational axis in the plane
of incidence, a rotation of 180° about A should modify the points
of intersection of the micrometer and the isotherm, if this was
symmetrical as regards the centre of heating.
   Now no appreciable disymmetry could be observed any more
than by the other methods previously employed. Small variations,
evidently accidental, alter the direction from one observation to
another on the same crystal, amounting to #5 to #5 of the diameter
of the curves. Irregularities of the same order were observed on
isotropic plates and on faces of crystals, in which no constant
deformation of the isotherms could be foreseen.
   The researches were made on crystals of dolomite of Binn (face
of the prism), and of Traverselle (face of the rhombohedron): on
crystals of erythrite and on apatite of the Pfitschthal (face of the
prism). The existence of coefficients of rotation in the crystals
appears therefore more and more improbable.—From the Archives
de Genève, communicated by the Author.                - *               -

   XLVIII. On the Scale-Value of the late Dr. Joule's
       Thermometers. By ARTHUR SCHUSTER, F.R.S.*
                         [Plates W. & VI.]
IN order to bring      the results of Joule's researches on the
      mechanical equivalent of heat into relation with more
modern experiments on the same subject, it is necessary to
determine the scale-value of Joule's thermometers in terms
of some easily reproducible standard.
   We possess already a comparison by Joule himself of his
thermometer with one used by Rowland, who has corrected
Joule’s result to the scale of his own air-thermometer.
   Some doubt may still exist, however, as to the true scale
value of these instruments, partly owing to the fact that we
have no information how the comparison between Joule's and
Rowland’s thermometers was conducted, and partly because
we do not know to what degree of accuracy Rowland’s air
thermometer would agree with that of the Bureau International
des Poids et Mesures, which for the present must be con
sidered as the standard.
   The historical importance of the instruments used by
Joule seemed to make it desirable therefore to subject them
to a more extended investigation. The request which I made
to Mr. B. A. Joule to allow me the use for a short time of his
late father's thermometers was met by a most ready compliance,

478         Prof. A. Schuster on the Scale-Value of
and I beg to offer him my best thanks for the opportunity
which he has given me of examining these interesting relics.
    The two thermometers which I had at my disposal were
those called A and D in Joule’s published papers; they were
made and calibrated by Dancer in 1844. The thermometer
D includes both the freezing- and boiling-point, while A only
reaches to a little above 30°C.
    In order to show to what extent Joule trusted these instru
 ments, I quote the passages in his papers in which he refers
 to them :—
    “My thermometers were constructed by a method very
 similar to that employed by Regnault and Pierre. The
 calibre of the tube was first measured in every part by
 passing a short column of mercury along it. The surface of
 the glass having then been covered with a thin film of bees
 wax, the portions of tube previously measured were each
 divided into the same number of parts by a machine con
 structed for the purpose. The divisions were then etched by
 means of the vapour of fluoric acid. Two thermometers
 were employed in the present research, in one of which the
 value of each space was * , in the other * of a degree
 Centigrade. A practised eye can easily estimate the tenth
 part of each of these spaces; consequently I could by these
 thermometers observe a difference of temperature not greater
 than 0° 005.” (Phil. Mag. [4] vol. iii. p. 481; Collected
 Works, vol. i. p. 214.)          -           -
     “The thermometers employed had their tubes calibrated
 and graduated according to the method first indicated by
 Regnault. Two of them, which I shall designate by A and B,
 were constructed by Mr. Dancer of Manchester; the third,
 designated by C, was made by M. Fastré of Paris. The
 graduation of these instruments was so correct, that when
 compared together their indications coincided to about T'o
 of a degree Fahr. I also possessed another exact instrument
 made by Mr. Dancer, the scale of which embraced both the
 freezing- and boiling-points. The latter point in this standard
 thermometer was obtained, in the usual manner, by immers
 ing the bulb and stem in the steam arising from a considerable
  quantity of pure water in rapid ebullition. During the trial
  the barometer stood at 29.94 inches, and the temperature of
 the air was 50°, so that the observed point required very little
  correction to reduce it to 0.760 metre and 0°C., the pressure
 used in France, and I believe the Continent generally, for
  determining the boiling-point, and which has been employed
  by me on account of the number of accurate thermometrical

              the late Dr. Joule's Thermometers.            479
researches which have been constructed on that basis.       The
values of the scales of the thermometers A and B were
ascertained by plunging them along with the standard in large
volumes of water kept constantly at various temperatures.
The value of the scales of thermometer C was determined by
comparison with A. It was thus found that the number of
divisions corresponding to 1°Fahr. in the thermometers A,
B, and C were 12,951, 9:829, and 11.647 respectively. And
since constant practice had enabled me to read off with the
naked eye to #0 of a division, it followed that 7'o of a degree
Fahr. was an appreciable temperature.” (Phil. Trans. 1850,
pt. i.; Collected Works, vol. i. p. 302.)
   On the Centigrade scale the figures given in the last
quotation would be 23:312, 17.692, 20.965. This allows us
to identify the second thermometer of the first quotation with
the one called A in all subsequent papers.
   “The thermometer used to indicate the temperature of the
calorimeter was the same which I employed in my former
experiments. Those designated A and D were calibrated
with great care. I have recently compared them together at
50 different temperatures between 32° and 80° Fahr., the
result being that, if the less sensitive was assumed to be
correct, the other, or A, nowhere appeared more than 0°.023
in error; but taking averages for each consecutive 10°, this
error amounted to no more than 0°008.” (Phil. Trans.
1878, part ii.; Collected Works, vol. i. p. 636.)
                 Description of the Thermometers.
   The two thermometers which I had at my disposal were
those called A and D.      The form and size of their bulb and
the width of the stem are shown in figs. 1 and 2, the former
representing in natural size. the bulb and beginning of the
stem of the thermometer A, and the latter that of D. The
diameters of the two stems are 0.7 centim. (A) and 0.75
centim. (D). The length of the stems 87 centim. (A) and
86 centim. (D). The volumes of the bulbs may be calculated
approximately from their shape, and are found to be 4.9
cub. centim. and 3.8 cub. centim. respectively.
   As the thermometer A was the one always employed in
calorimetric measurements, it is this instrument which is of
chief interest to us now. From the pressure coefficients of the
thermometer, we may approximately calculate the thickness of
the glass walls of the bulb, in the manner indicated by
Guillaume.     The calculation can be carried out if the bulb is
cylindrical or spherical, and '' strictly be applied to such
                               2 K2

480         Prof. A. Schuster on the Scale-Value of
a shape as that shown in fig. 1. But I find that, assuming
the bulb to be cylindrical, the pressure-coefficient gives a

 thickness of 0.09", while on the assumption that it is spherical
 the calculated thickness of glass is 0.076, so that the result is
 almost the same, and we are not probably far wrong in taking
 '08 as the approximate thickness. Taking account of this
 value and the external volume, I find the volume of mercury
 to be about 4 cub. centim., and from the length of one degree
 of the stem obtain the radius of the bore approximately as
 '009. These numbers do not lay claim to any accuracy, but
 they are sufficient to give us an idea of the principal quantities
 involved in the construction of this thermometer.
    As the thermometer was calibrated before graduation, the
 distance between the divisions will give us some idea as to
 the regularity of the bore. In Table 1. the first column gives
 the division of the thermometer, and the second, in millimetres,
 the corresponding distance from the centre of the reservoir,
 the third column gives the differences between the numbers
 of the second, and the numbers of this column are therefore
 inversely proportional to the mean area of the bore at different
 points of the thermometer.

   To calculate the pressure correction we require the dis
tances from the centre of the bulb, but there must of course be
some uncertainty as to the point which is chosen as centre.
The figures in the third column were obtained by direct
measurement and are not affected by the same uncertainty.
It will be seen that the bore is conical, gradually diminishing
in diameter.       The mean cross-sections near the two ends of
the tube differ by about 20 per cent.
   In addition to the differences in the length of division
intended to correct for the changes in the bore, there are also
not inconsiderable inequalities which are evidently due to
faults of graduation. These irregularities are quite visible
with the naked eye, two successive intervals differing occa
sionally by as much as the tenth part of their own                 i:
Owing to this fact the error of a single reading of this
thermometer A may amount to 0°004 C. quite independently
of the general errors of calibration. It must be remembered
of course that at the time the thermometers were made such
a quantity was not considered to be of any importance, so
that the divisions were sufficiently accurate for the purposes
for which they were originally intended.

482          Prof. A. Schuster on the Scale-Value of
                     The Fundamental Points.
    As regards the thermometer D, Joule has supplied us with
the following information :
    “The freezing-point of the standard D had risen from 133
divisions of its scale in 1844 to 15:14 in 1877.       I think it
probable that the boiling-point of this thermometer, if kept
 constantly at this temperature, would in the course of time
 fall as much.    The five careful determinations of this boiling
 point referred to 30 bar. and 60° are respectively 706, 706:4,
 706, 705.9, and 706:15-mean 706-09.           Subtracting 1:84,
 704:25 will be the probable ultimate reading, from which if
 we take 15:14 we shall have 689-11 as the range between the
 fixed points cleared from the effects of imperfect elasticity of
 the glass. Mr. E. Hodgkinson has pointed out (Brit. Assoc.
 Report, 1843, p. 23) that the ‘set’ of imperfectly elastic
 bodies is proportional to the square of the force applied,
 therefore the effect of imperfect elasticity in the glass of the
 thermometers will be insensible for the small ranges used in
 the experiments, and the factor 3:3822 for reducing the
 indications of D to those of A may be confidently relied on.
    “We have therefore
                          180
                                     = 0°.07723
                    689-11 x 3.3822
as the most probable value of one division of A. In m
 former papers the number was taken as 0°.077214, which is
 so near that I shall continue to use it, trusting by long
 continued observations of the fixed points to give it ultimatel
 greater accuracy, and also, by experiments above       £
 to state it in terms of the absolute interval between these
 points.” (Phil. Trans. 1878, part ii.; Collected Works, vol. i.
 p. It  will be noticed that the actually observed difference
     636.)
 between the freezing- and boiling-point is 690-95 divisions,
 but that Joule somewhat arbitrarily reduced this by 1.84
 divisions, thus altering the fundamental interval by over a
 quarter per cent. It seems curious that no one should have
 directed his attention to this point, which to all appearance
 causes an error in the scale-value of his thermometer, and
 would make his equivalent come out too low by .0027 of its
 own value.
    If we collect together the scale-values of the thermometer
 A, given by Joule in different places, we find:—

   It will be seen that the last value nearly agrees with the
first; the point to be explained therefore is the high value of
the second number. It is possible that a correction similar
to that of the last paper was already then applied, and as we
have reason to believe that a great part of the change of zero
took place in the first four years, we may account for certainly
half the difference in this way. The point is not now of great
importance, because the scale-value of A must be obtained
quite independently of Joule’s assumed interval for his
standard. Joule's own value depended not only on that
interval but also on the correct calibration of his standard.
From the method of calibration employed, an error quite as
large as that caused by the wrong value of the boiling-point
might easily be introduced. Nevertheless a re-determination
of the distance between boiling- and freezing-points seemed
to me to be of interest, especially as the depression of the
zero might give some indication as to the nature of the glass
of which the thermometer is made.
   When the thermometer came into my possession there
was a large bubble of air in the bulb, and the mercury in
the stem broke into pieces when attempts were made to
drive the bubble into the upper reservoir. I finally suc
ceeded, however, in removing it, but the experiments on the
boiling-point were always a little difficult as the mercury
when placed in steam had a great tendency to distil into the
upper parts of the stem. In order to see that the thread was
continuous the thermometer had to be inverted occasionally,
the mercury running into the reservoir, and small pellets
sometimes remained there on re-inverting, so that no value
is to be attached to the actual position of the zero points
observed; though the quantity of mercury separated was
always so small that the distance between the freezing- and
boiling-points could not be affected. Table II. gives the
observations made:—                                              * *

   The agreement, between the experiments, excepting the
second, is better than could have been expected, and accident
must have played some part in giving these practically
identical numbers.      The first and third determinations were
made by myself, the fourth by Mr. J. R. Ashworth, the
second by another observer, and there must be some error in
it which could not afterwards be traced.                 The intervals are
given in 2 columns-(a) is the interval calculated on the old
method of taking the freezing-point first, while (b) is that
now generally employed, the reading at the boiling-point
being compared, with the reading at the freezing-point
taken immediately afterwards. The difference between the
number so obtained and Joule's interval (690-95) gives the
depression of zero as 53, agreeing fairly well with that found
directly by the above experiments. The interval (a) is also
seen to agree with Joule's value. The time the thermometer
was kept exposed to the temperature of boiling water varied
from a quarter of an hour to several hours. In the first
three experiments the depression seemed to increase with the
time of exposure, but in the last experiment that time was
only about fifteen minutes, i.e. shorter than in the other
cases; the large depression may be due to a diminution of the
column by distillation.
   It appears, therefore, that the depression of the zero is less
than 0°-1. It approaches that observed in Jena or French
hard-glass thermometers, and is considerably smaller than
that found with modern English glass.
   The Thermometer A.—This thermometer does not include
the boiling-point, but its freezing-point is of interest, as it is

                   the late Dr. Joule's Thermometers.                 485
  probably unique in having been watched for a period of over
  50 years. Joule furnishes us with data showing the gradual
  rise of the zero from April 1844 to March 4, 1873 (Collected
  Works, vol. i. p. 558). In the communication he presented
  to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, he
  refers the rise to the first observed zero without giving the
  actual readings, so that this short paper does not allow us to
  judge how far the present zero is above that of 1873. For
  tunately, we can indirectly supply the deficiency. For in his
  comparison with Rowland's thermometer (Proc. Amer. Acad.
- vol. xvi. p. 38) the reading of the zero is stated to be 22.62.
   Rowland's thermometer was sent to Joule in the summer of
   1879, and the results were communicated to the American
  Academy in March 1880. The comparison must have been
   made at an intermediate date, and can therefore be identified,
   for in the above-mentioned communication only one com
   parison is mentioned between January 1877 and December
   1882, and that one in November 1879, when the zero stood
   12.92 divisions above that of the first observation. Taking
   the original zero to be 9:7, the complete series now is as
   follows :

       I have taken a considerable number of readings of the
   zero-point since the beginning of the year 1892. They vary
   of course with the temperature to which the thermometer was
   exposed. The determinations were made in an apparatus
   similar to that described by Guillaume, the thermometer being
   immersed in a mixture of scraped ice and distilled water. Great
   care must be exercised in the readings, for, owing to the large
   size of the bulb and the long time taken by the thermometer
   to reach a steady state, the results are easily vitiated by an
   accumulation of water.            No correction was made for the
   pressure due to the surrounding mixture, as probably Joule
   took no account of that pressure, nor would the correction be
    significant for our purpose. The readings are arranged in

   The first observation of the second series does not fit in
very well with the others, but if it is remembered that a tenth
part of a division means only 0°004, the general agreement
must be considered satisfactory, and the first series, which is
perhaps the one in which the greatest care was exercised,
shows the gradual lowering of the freezing-point very
decidedly. The numbers show that the changes of zero are
no longer appreciable. I have added to Table III, those of
my observations which were taken after the thermometer had
been exposed to about 17°.
                     The Pressure Correction.
   As the chief object of this investigation was to find the
scale-value of the thermometer A under the conditions holding
in Joule’s experiment, the most natural manner of proceeding
would have been to compare it in the vertical position with
some standard instrument. Owing to the great length of the
thermometer it was not found possible, however, without
much inconvenience to construct a vessel into which it
 could entirely be plunged vertically, and if only partially
 immersed the uncertain stem corrections would take away

              the late Dr. Joule's Thermometers.           487
considerably from the accuracy of the comparison. After a
few trials which gave no satisfactory results, it was resolved
to carry out the comparisons in a horizontal position and to
determine independently the correction which has to be
applied in order to reduce the readings to the vertical. This
correction owes its origin to the expansion of the thermometer
bulb through the internal pressure of the mercury column.
It is determined by measuring the effect of eaternal pressure.
If the addition of an external pressure p produces a rise of
the column of mercury equal to p8 degrees, and an equal
internal pressure produces a fall p8, then two equal pressures
p applied from both sides would produce a rise equal to
£           but this rise may be calculated in another way. A
  ydrostatic pressure p will alter the volume of the vessel by
pic, but the apparent contents of the vessel as measured by
the mercury thread will only diminish by p(k, -km) where
k, and km are the coefficients of cubical compression of glass
and mercury respectively.
   We thus obtain the equation
               Ai=8. + (k,n-kg)
                 =640,000131-#'+'. centim. of mercury
   This equation is deduced by Guillaume for the case of
thermometers with cylindrical bulbs, but, as is shown by the
preceding deduction, it holds quite generally.
   The apparatus used for the determination of the pressure
corrections is shown in Pl. W. fig. 3, and, as will be seen, is
 almost identical with that described in Guillaume’s book. The
thermometer is suspended in a long glass tube T, into which
sufficient mercury is introduced to cover the bulb ; the rest
of the tube is filled with glycerine in order to reduce the
air-space as much as possible. Side tubes, with stop-cocks
A and B, are led into the upper end of T-one communicates
with the outer air, the other with a pressure-gauge, a Win
chester quart vessel K, and a water-pump. If the cocks
A and B are closed and the pump set to work, it will gradually
exhaust the vessel K, and when the pressure is sufficiently
reduced B is suddenly opened. Owing to the large volume
of K, compared to the air-space in T, the pressure-gauge
remains sensibly unaltered, and the reduction of pressure can
at once be observed on the thermometer, which is read off by
a kathetometer telescope. The pressure can be restored to
the atmospheric pressure by closing B and opening A.

488           Prof. A. Schuster on the Scale-Value of
   I have found it convenient to proceed in the observations
rather differently from the manner indicated by Guillaume.
The tube T is placed in a calorimeter containing about a litre
and a half of water, and that again is surrounded in an outer
jacket. The latter is filled with water about 2° above that in
the calorimeter, so that the thermometer is kept slowly rising.
The air-space in T being exhausted, a few observations are
taken at measured intervals of time, air is suddenly admitted,
and a further series of readings are taken, as in the following
example:—

         14.            22            164:20
   Taking the arithmetical mean between the first seven ob
servations, it is found that the average temperature corre
 sponding to the time 17" was 159:139, and by combining
 the observations in pairs in the usual fashion we deduce the
average rate of rise per interval as 108. Hence
                    159:139 + 4 x 10:8 = 159:571
gives the calculated reading at 2" 19", but after the
seventh reading the air was admitted, so that the last seven
observations were taken at full atmospheric pressure. The
reduction being made in exactly the same fashion, another
reading is deduced for the time 2" 19", viz., 163.583.
The difference betwen the two gave 4.012 divisions of the
thermometer as the effect of a change of pressure of 72.6 centim.
A number of observations of a similar character were taken
and are collected in Table IV. They were always so com
bined that the observation at atmospheric pressure followed
that at reduced pressure. Otherwise a fall of the thermometer

               the late Dr. Joule's Thermometers,                     489
would have taken place, and owing to the sticking of the
thread the first few observations would have been uncertain.

    The observation which is quoted in full above is the one
which shows greater irregularities in the rise than the others,
and it gave the result (0548) which differs most from the
mean. Part of the discrepancies between the different ob
servations is no doubt due to the irregularities in the
graduation of this thermometer, but the result is sufficiently
accurate for the purpose for which it is intended.
    Reduced to degrees, the final results are as follows:–
                                                       In degrees per cm.

    Knowing the distance of any scale-division from the centre
 of the reservoir, we may calculate the corresponding pressure
 correction. A table was calculated once for all, giving in
 this way the differences between the readings of the ther
 mometer in the horizontal and vertical positions for every 50
 divisions.     The numbers are given in the last column of
 Table I. It will be noticed that an error of 1 per cent, in
 the pressure correction would cause a difference of less than
 0°002 on a range of over 30°, which difference of course
 would be quite inappreciable.
    Some experiments were made to find how much the
 thermometer A lagged behind when placed in water the
 temperature of which was uniformly rising. They were
 carried out according to the manner described by Thiesen”,
 and gave sufficiently consistent results showing the time
 constant to be 12".

490          Prof. A. Schuster on the Scale-Value of
     The Apparatus used in the Comparison of Thermometers.
    The comparison of the thermometers was carried out in a
bath made of sheet-iron having a length of 114 centim. and
width and depth of 20 centim. This bath was placed for pro
 tection inside a wooden box, on the bottom of which it rested
upon two ribs covered with guttapercha, so that the inner
vessel was practically insulated thermally. The wooden box K
 is shown in Pl. VI. fig. 4, placed on two stools and in front of
 a table T.   A frame FF fitted into the bottom of the bath and
 carried 38 turns of No. 21 nickel wire, the ends of the wire
being brought to binding-screws placed at two of the corners
of the outer box. With a suitable electric current passing
through the wire, the temperature of the water in the bath
could either be kept constant or increasing at a desired rate
within a range from 1° to 15° above the temperature of the
room. The whole of the interior of the bath, also the frame,
and wire were coated with white paint. A tank of water of
this kind containing over 40 litres cannot with any reasonable
amount of stirring be kept at a sufficiently uniform tempera
ture. The bulbs of the thermometers were therefore placed
into a small copper box B, within which the stirring was
 much more efficient.    The box was 15 centim. in breadth
and 10 centim. deep, and was rigidly suspended from a
wooden cross-bar resting on the side of the case. Vertically
down the centre of the box passed a spindle carrying a double
3-bladed screw-paddle; one of these paddles was fixed just
below the bottom of the box, and the other just inside the
box, as shown in the figure. There was a further paddle at
the other end of the bath, the power being supplied by two
Cuttriss motors. The stirring was sufficient to secure a very
approximately uniform temperature all over the bath. The
box B sheltered the thermometers from outside radiation,
and protected them against jets of hot water coming from the
heated water, the paddle below the box being specially intended
to prevent irregular heating of the box. The water inside B
was thoroughly stirred, a mere rotation of the water being
prevented by oblique diaphragms fixed to the sides. One
further precaution was found advisable. Owing to evapora
tion and radiation the water lost heat at its upper surface, and
the thermometers had to be protected against an inflow of cold
water through the opening through which the spindle passed.
This was done by a horizontal disk H fixed to the spindle, and
by covering the whole box as far as possible with asbestos.
The thermometer bulbs passed through a window W 3.3
centim. wide, cut into one side of B, and a sliding shutter of

              the late Dr. Joule’s Thermometers.               491
thin brass served to close the window partially so that there
was only very little, if any, circulation of water between the
inside and the outside of the box.
   The thermometers were read by a small microscope M
which could be moved parallel to itself along the upper edges
of the outer vessel. The microscope was mounted so that it
also had a free motion at right angles to the length of the
box. This double motion allowed it to be moved quickly
above the ends of the threads of any two thermometers to be
compared. Latterly two microscopes were used, one for each
of the thermometers. The water was covered by a sheet of
glass, which kept the surface calm in spite of the disturbance
set up by the stirring. The thermometers were supported in
triangular grooves cut into two adjustable brass uprights P, P.
Care was always taken to set them horizontally by first
placing a straight edge across the uprights and levelling.
This horizontal position is not necessary when the thermo
 meters are transparent, so that their divisions can be read
 either from the front or from the back, as errors of parallax
 are thus eliminated.       But when this cannot be done the
 reading microscope must be placed at right angles to the
 thermometer, and then it is most convenient to have one ver
 tical and the other horizontal. The optic axis of M was put
 into the vertical position by keeping at a proper distance in
 the bath a horizontal glass-scale silvered at the back. When
 the adjustment is correct the two images of the division
 which is in the centre of the field of view should cover each
 other, otherwise there is parallax. As the object of the ad
justment is to avoid parallax in the reading of the thermo
 meters, this method answers very well if the glass-scale is
 about 2 millim thick. It is instructive to notice how great
 the danger of error due to parallax is when sufficient care is
 not taken to read only in the centre of the field of view.
            The Method of Comparison and Reduction.
    Two observers were found necessary to carry out a satis
 factory comparison, one calling out the time at regular in
 tervals and taking the notes, the other reading the thermometer.
 An example will show the method adopted.
    On June 20, 1893, a comparison was made between Joule A
 and a Tonnelot Standard No. 4929. Both thermometers were
 kept in the bath at a temperature of 18° for several hours,
 '      their
 follows:–
                freezing-point was determined and found as

temperature of which was slowly rising without the use of an
electric current. The thermometers being replaced in the
bath, readings were taken alternately every quarter minute,

the divisions behind. The numbers obtained were as follows:–

494         Prof. A. Schuster on the Scale-Value of
the actual temperature on the French hard-glass mercury
scale as determined by the Tonnelot. The second column
gives the corresponding readings of “Joule A.” As Joule,
in his work, assumed a fixed zero of his thermometer, we
must reduce the observations here also in the same way.
   Any convenient position may be assumed as zero, as the
scale-value which is to be deduced from the observations will
only depend on the differences of readings, so that the zero
is really eliminated. But it is convenient to take as zero that
corresponding to the average temperature of the air, which
in our case was about 23:33. The third column gives, there
 fore, the numbers obtained by subtracting 23:33 from the
 readings given in the second column. If Joule's scale-value
 is correct these figures should, when multiplied by his factor,
 give the temperature as determined by a thermometer made of
 glass having the composition of these thermometers. Joule's
 reducing factor is 0.077214, which for the Centigrade scale -
 becomes '042897.      For convenience of calculation I have
 taken it as 0429. The fourth column gives the numbers so
 reduced. Columns W. and VI. give the corrections to the
 vertical position and the corrected readings. The last column
 gives the differences between the temperatures as determined
 by the Tonnelot and Joule's thermometer respectively. These
 numbers show no very marked increase or diminution between
 the temperatures of 10° and 30°. If the numbers in column VI.
 were constant throughout, it would mean that the two ther
 mometers read alike as regards differences of temperature.
    In order to obtain the greatest possible information from
 the numbers obtained they were reduced by the method of
 least squares, all comparisons below 13° and above 22° being
 left out of account as lying outside the range within which
 Joule worked. If T represents the reading on the Joule
  thermometer, TT that on the Tonnelot, and we wish to form
  an equation
                          TT-T =a+b TT
  wemay do so,substituting for TT–T, the numberin column VI.,
  and for TT those in column I.      The constants a and b were
  thus found to be
                a=0.0081, b=0.000933+.00068.
     If we denote by tT and t, intervals on the two thermometers
  we finally find
                        t;=tt (1 –0.00093)   -

                the late Dr. Joule's Thermometers.             495
 The result of this calculation, therefore, would be that the
 scale of the Joule thermometer is about one part in a thou
 sand smaller than that of the Tonnelot, the difference being
 due either to a difference in the glass or to faulty cali
 bration.
    In order to compare the observed differences in the read
 ings of the two thermometers with the values calculated from
 the most probable scale-value of the Joule, I have added
 columns VIII. and IX., the former giving the calculated
 value of TT-Ti, and the latter the difference 8 which is either
 due to errors of observation or to irregular errors of gradua
tion of one or other of the thermometers. Although the
 obvious fault in this respect shown by the Joule prepares us
for occasional differences of about 0°:01, I was not, for several
reasons, satisfied with the results of this series of comparisons.
The apparatus had not reached its final form during these
experiments, the stirring was not as good, and the thermo
meter had not yet been protected against the inflow of cold
water through the opening in the roof of the inner box. A
great difficulty was also found in comparing together directly
the Joule thermometer, which was rather sluggish in its
motion, with the Tonnelot, which answered very quickly the
smallest change of temperature. Unless care was taken, there
fore, to make the rise exceedingly uniform errors were easily
made. Additional uncertainty was introduced by the frequent
redeterminations of the zero of the Tonnelot. The probable
error of the calculated coefficient was too great to allow me
to be satisfied with its value.
   A second series of experiments was therefore decided upon,
and as in a joint research in the equivalent of heat I had
occasion, together with Mr. Gannon, to determine with con
siderable accuracy the scale-value of a Baudin thermometer
graduated directly to a 50th of a degree, I made use of the
latter in the second series.                -
   The experiments were made exactly in the same way as
before, the Joule being directly compared with the Baudin,
and zero readings being dispensed with.           The results are
embodied in   £ VI.        The first column gives the tempera
tures according to the Joule thermometer, the coefficient
'0429 being again used, and the readings being converted to
the vertical position. The second column gives the reading
according to the Baudin thermometer, after the proper cali
bration correction had been applied and the reading also
reduced to the vertical position. The third column gives the
difference between the numbers in the two first.                 -

     The figures of this table were reduced in the same way as
those of the first series of measurements.          If we write
                            Ta-T = a +bTB,
we find by the method of least squares
                          a = -0017,
                          b= +.00092 + 00022.
     The values of TB-T, calculated by this formula are entered
into the fourth column of Table WI. The differences 8 between
the calculated and observed values, which are also given, are
seen to be as small as can be expected, never rising to more
than 0°006. This series having yielded a satisfactory com
parison, we must reduce the scale-values obtained by applying
the scale-correction of the Baudin thermometer. Denoting
 the intervals as read off by the thermometers by the small
letter t, the above reductions give
                            t; = ta(1-'00092).
     A small correction is necessitated by the fact that a slight

               the late Dr. Joule’s Thermometers.            497
 error was discovered in the pressure-coefficient of the Baudin
 thermometer after all the above reductions had been made.
 The corrected interval equation becomes
                        t; = ta(1-'00084).
   The comparison between the Baudin and Tonnelot thermo
meters made by Mr. Gannon and myself had given
                      tr–tR = - 00089te.
 Hence, by combining the last two equations,
                      t = tr(1+:00005).
This comparison would therefore show that the Joule and
Tonnelot thermometers read exactly alike.
   In all these measurements the Baudin and Joule were always
read like calorimeter thermometers, without regard to the
change of the freezing-point, while the Tonnelot was referred
in every case to its proper zero. The equality of the scale
value of the two thermometers does not hold when they are
both read in the same way, but the same interval read on the
Tonnelot would be about one part in a thousand smaller than
if read on A.
   We may combine the results of the two series of com
parisons by giving each weights inversely proportional to the
probable error of the quantity denoted by b.
   We therefore find as the most probable value for t,
                        t; = ti(1-00027).
   Without attaching undue importance to this number, we
may say that it represents the relation between the Tonnelot
standard and Joule's thermometer as accurately as the divi
sions and calibration of the latter will allow us to judge. The
number seems certainly not to be in error by more than one
part in a thousand, and probably by less.
   The transition to the nitrogen and hydrogen scale may now
be made. Using Chappuis' experimental investigation on the
French hard-glass thermometers, it is found that a temperature
of 16° 5, to which Joule’s last equivalent determination refers
the interval on the Tonnelot thermometer, is to be diminished
by 00268 or 00305°, according as we want to obtain the
interval on the nitrogen or hydrogen scale. Thus writing
                       ts= tr(1-'00268),
                       tR = tr(1-'00305),
we find                t, = ts(1+.0024),
                       t; = tit(1+ 0028).

    There is a marked difference between the results of this
investigation and that deduced by Rowland * from the com
parison of Joule's thermometers with his Baudin No. 6166.
Tables VII. (referring to the first of the above series of
comparisons) and VIII. (to the second) are intended to bring
out this difference.

are as follows :
    Column I. TT or the reading on the Tonnelot thermo
                   meter.
        , II. Tr–T, or the corresponding difference in the

                    Tonnelot scale.

         -          scale as interpolated between the numbers

                    Thermométrie.

                    Joule and Chappuis nitrogen-scale.

                    the Joule and Rowland’s air-thermometers.
        , WI. The difference 8 between the numbers given in
                    Columns IV. and W.
    A word of explanation is necessary as to how the numbers
 of Column. V. have been obtained. Rowland gives in his
   aper the difference in the readings between Joule A and what
 £ calls the “perfect” air-thermometer at a great        number of
 points, none of them corresponding of course exactly to those
 of Column I., for which they are here required. I have taken
 the average between the value given for the temperature which
 lies nearest to that of Column I. and the two which lie imme
 diately above and below it. The figures alter sufficiently
 slowly         thussufficient
          and with
 the numbers         found as regularity   to allow
                               substantially         us to consider
                                               correct.         C.
    We may deal more simply with the numbers obtained in
 the second series. The comparison between the Tonnelot and
 the Baudin thermometer already referred to gave, for the
 connexion between the two, the equation
                    Tr–Te=-0194-00089T.
 Combining with this the experimental connexion between the
 Joule and Baudin,

    The two series of measurements agree in showing a differ
 ence of nearly 0°05, which must be either due to a real
 difference between Rowland’s “perfect” air-thermometer and
 that of Chappuis, or to some error in one or other of the
 comparisons.
        e have no information at all as to how Joule proceeded
 in comparing together his thermometer with that of Rowland.
 The numbers furnished by Joule are obviously not those

500     Scale-Value of the late Dr. Joule's Thermometers.
obtained directly by experiment, as they are given to the
thousandth part of a division. Joule probably only gave the
mean between a certain number of successive observations
ranging over several divisions of his scale.      He would in this
way eliminate the errors of division, and the regularity in the
difference between his and Rowland’s thermometer shows that
some such process must have been adopted. There are certain
corrections also no doubt applied by Joule, such as that due to
the emergent stem, about which it would be necessary to have
further information, before any definite conclusions can be
drawn.
    The important question as to a possible difference in the
 air-thermometers of Rowland and Chappuis can only be set at
 rest by a direct comparison of one of Rowland’s thermometers
 with one compared at the Bureau International des Poids et
 Mesures.
    But as regards the main point of the present investigation,
 this question does not arise. We are only concerned with
 Joule's thermometer, and the comparison between it and the
 Paris standard.
    The relation between the intervals obtained by combining
 the two series of comparison was found to be, in terms of the
 Tonnelot nitrogen and hydrogen scales,
                        t; = r(1-'00027)
                           = th(1+.0024)
                           = tit(1+ 0028).
    Joule's final value for the equivalent of heat therefore
 reduces as follows:--
 Joule’s value for a temperature 61°69 F. (16°5 C.). 772.65
 On the scale of the French hard-glass thermometer. 772.44
  On the scale of the nitrogen thermometer of the
    Bureau International des Poids et Mesures         .   .  774.51
 On the scale of the hydrogen thermometer of the
    Bureau International des Poids et Mesures         .   .  774-81
     Rowland applies a small correction to Joule’s value of the
  heat-capacity of his calorimeter. This would raise the equi
  valent by 2. Taking account of this, and considering that
  Joule's thermometer was never intended to measure tem
  peratures nearer than one part in a thousand, and is not
  graduated sufficiently well to allow the decimal place to be
  determined with any certainty, we may state it as the result
  of this investigation that
     Joule’s equivalent of heat resulting from his own investigations

         On the Kinetic Energy of the Motion of Heat.             501
and reduced to the nitrogen thermometer of the Bureau Inter
national des Poids et Mesures is to the nearest unit 775 foot
pounds at the sea-level and the latitude of Greenwich. The
number refers to a pound of water weighed in vacuo at a
temperature of 61°.7 F. (16°5 C.).
   The equivalent reduced to ergs becomes 4,173 x 10".
   It is not necessary to discuss the older observations of Joule,
or to modify his numbers by attaching weights to his experi
ments different from those which he gave to them himself.
The result of Joule's last paper, as reduced by himself, should
be taken as his final judgment. Rowland’s value at 16° 5 is
4,186 x 107, but the results of this paper open out the pos
sibility that this number might have to be reduced somewhat
when referred to the Paris air-thermometer.            It seems most
probable that the correct value of the equivalent lies some
where between Joule’s value and that of Rowland. The higher
values obtained by Mr. Griffiths and myself and Gannon by
the electrical method are not easily accounted for, but for the
present they cannot in my opinion be put into competition with
the direct determinations of Joule and Rowland.              The dis
crepancy no doubt will be cleared up. In the meantime
a comparison between one of Rowland's thermometers and
the Paris standard would be of great interest.
XLIX. On the Kinetic Energy of the Motion of Heat and
   the corresponding Dissipation Function.           By Dr. LADISLAs
   NATANsoN, Professor of Natural Philosophy, University of
    Cracow”.
1. IN     the following the fundamental assumptions of the
         former paper (“On the Kinetic Interpretation of the
Dissipation Function”) will be adopted. A fluid medium is
considered which is supposed to consist of a multitude of
moving molecules. Let u, v, w be the components of the
“molar” velocity, i.e. of the mean velocity of the molecules
within an element da dy dz; and let #, m, # be the components
of the individual velocity of any given molecule in that
 element. We will employ the        :            to denote the density
                         §
 of the medium ; and to denote any property of a molecule
which depends on the values of (u +%), (v + n), and (w-H £).
 Let Q indicate the mean value of Q for all molecules within

502         Dr. L. Natanson on the Kinetic Energy
an element, and X, Y, Z the components of acceleration due
to external forces at the point (w, y, z). We will write d'Q/dt
the total or actual variation of Q; and by 80/8t we will
represent such variation of Q as can be due to the mutual
interference between molecules.       Then (Maxwell, “On the
Dynamical Theory of Gases,” Scientific Papers, ii. p. 26),

   If we give to Q in this equation consecutively such signifi
cations as are consistent with definition and then eliminate
terms including X, Y, Z and 8/8t, a set of propositions will
be obtained, constituting what may be called a Kinematical
Theory of Fluids, a theory of rather high degree of gene
rality which must not be confounded with special molecular
theories of usually very hypothetical character. It is with
Hydrodynamics that the kinematical theory seems to be most
intimately connected, the fundamental hydrodynamical equa
tions (or possibly some generalizations thereof) being simple
deductions from the equations of that theory.

   what generalized definition of “Kinetic Energy.” Suppose
   C (a vector) to represent any current or fluv, and let q be its
   velocity. We define then the kinetic energy per unit volume
   to be the scalar product                         -
                  #S(Cq)=}(C'g'4-C"q"+C"q"), . . . (33)
   C, C", and C" being the components of C, and q', q", and q"
   the components of q . Thus, if C means an ordinary flux of
   matter, of density p, then C=pq, and the “kinetic energy.”
   of matter, i.e. the kinetic energy in the case of a matter-flux,
   is found as usually given. But we are now enabled to form
   an idea of “kinetic energy” in other cases as well. Thus in
   the case we are dealing with, the motion of a molecule
   through space may be said to be equivalent to a “molecular
   current” of the quantity Q carried about by the molecule;
   and then #Q, n(), and &Q will be the values of the compo
 – nents of that current. From (33) we conclude that the
    kinetic energy of such a molecular current of Q is
                          #(*****)0, . . . . . . (34)

                        #N((#-F#-F#)Q), . . . . . (35)
  N being the number of molecules per unit volume. Calling
  now M the mass of a molecule, let us consider the flux of the
  quantity Q=}|M(#4-m”-- ?) : we see that (35) becomes
  equal to A as defined by (28); A therefore represents the
  total kinetic energy of molecular currents of (ordinary)
  molecular energy in unit volume, i. e. the kinetic energy of
  the motion of heat-energy in unit volume, and WAdwdy d:
  represents the same quantity for the total fluid. The idea of
  “molecular currents” is likely to conserve a definite meaning
  even when the idea of “molecules” will be found to be
   superseded. '
      5. The energy of motion of the heat-energy is susceptible
   of several kinds of variation, from various sources, to which
   the consecutive terms of the right-hand side of (32) refer.
   The first term represents the loss by convection across the
   surface; the second the gain due to viscosity; the third
   expresses the reversible effect of the mean pressure doing
   work.    The fourth term relates to the communication of heat
   through the surface, since # prx, pry, and ' pre are the values
   of the total component fluxes of energy. In order to find the
   meaning of the fifth term, let us substitute for the differential
   coefficients values from (12) and two other equations which
   can be written down from symmetry; then that term will be

    and represents therefore the source of variation due to inter
    action between molecules.      This we shall call the “interior”
    source of variation, whereas the foregoing will be described
    as “exterior” sourees: in fact the “interior” source remains.
    active even in a fluid at rest when contained in a surface
    impermeable to heat. We now see that the direction of the
    interior variation depends on the nature of the mutual action
    between molecules. Since the quantities (pr.)", (pry)", and
    (pr.)” are positive, the energy of the motion of heat-energy
    will be always decreasing if molecular interaction is such as
    to tend to diminish the absolute values of pr, pry, and pr. ;
    in the opposite case that energy will be always increasing.
    That it is the first case only that is realized in all fluids in
    Nature, as attested by the   £            of conduction of heat,
    cannot be deduced from Kinematical Theory. We have
    ascertained, as it were, the path of change of the energy of

of the two possible directions of change is invariably selected.
   6. It may be well to point out that the problem here dis
cussed bears distinct analogy to the problem of our former
paper, where the Dissipation Function F represented what
may now be called the “interior” variation of molar fluid
energy and was seen to depend on the effect of molecular
interaction on the values of

simply to prove that the u's and the v's have constant and
equal values: the results indeed given at the end of § 2 of
the former paper, and likewise the well-known equations of
motion of viscous fluids, can then be easily deduced. The
common value of the u’s and the v's is the coefficient of
viscosity and is positive if the mutual action between mole

 Rayleigh's Dissipation Function F in Viscosity; and we
 therefore propose to call this expression “the Dissipation
 Function of Conduction.”
    In his great paper “On the Dynamical Theory of Gases,”
 Maxwell practically confined himself to the case of a force
 between molecules varying inversely as the fifth power of
 their distance. It may, we think, be legitimately assumed
 that the Theory of Matter will progress in the future without
 the aid of any such hypothesis. Whatever may be the law
 of molecular force, whatever may even be the opinion we
 hold as to the existence of molecules, we shall be justified in
 seeking to find a general law of subsidence of disturbances
in fluids or possibly in all bodies—a general Law of Relaxation

   The subsidence of disturbances, to which we alluded, forms
a characteristic feature of phenomena which are going on in
matter, as contrasted with those of which the aether is the
seat. Now this property of gradually calming every kind of
disturbance (which seems to be a £i property of
matter) is in formal contrast with another property attributed
to matter, i.e. with inertia. It seems therefore legitimate to
suppose that it is with the properties of the aether that we are
ultimately concerned in ordinary dynamics; and if we adopt
the well-known doctrine which asserts that matter may consist
in some kind of disturbance in the aether, we shall find nothing
to surprise us in such an assumption.

L. The Heat of Combination of Substances in the Liquid
   and Solid Condition. By SPENCER UMFREVILLE PICKERING
   F.R.S.*
IF     it were found that the heat of formation of a solid
      hydrate, or analogous compound, from its solid con
stituents were the same as that evolved when these constituents
were mixed in the liquid condition, we should have a strong
argument in favour of the view that the same substance was
formed in the two cases—that the liquid mixture, just as
much as the solid hydrate, consisted of a definite compound.
The only instance in which sufficient data exist for the
calculation of the heat of formation in the two conditions
gives results indicating that this may be the case: taking the
author's values for the monohydrate of sulphuric acid, it is
found that solid water and solid sulphuric acid in combining
to form the solid monohydrate evolve 6533 cal. at 17°9,
whereas the liquid constituents in combining to form the
liquid hydrated acid at the same temperature evolve 6667 cal.,
practically the same amount of heat.
    The present determinations were made in order to see
whether a similar equality held good in other cases. The
results obtained, however, have been of an entirely negative
 character, and show that the equality found in the case of
 sulphuric acid is, probably, accidental.
    Negative results, however, do not in any way prove that
 the mixed liquids do not contain, or consist of, the compound
 known in the solid condition, for the actions concerned are
 complex, and the quantity which is measured as the heat of
 combination represents, in reality, the difference between this
 quantity and several others.
    Thus, suppose, for the sake of argument, that the same
 amount of combination       occurs when the substances      are
 brought together in either of the two conditions: and let C
 represent the heat of combination of the molecules a and b to
  form ab. Then we have, when the substances are all liquids,
  the splitting up of the liquid aggregates into the molecules
 a and b, va and v, and the aggregation of the molecules
  of the compound into the liquid condition, so that the heat
  measured on mixing the liquids will be
                      H=C-va-v, + va.
  When the substances are in the solid condition, we shall have
  similarly the heats of conversion of the solids into the mole
  cular condition, or, since the action may be regarded as
                    * Communicated by the Author.

            The Heat of Combination of Substances.            511
taking place in the two stages, we shall have, first, the con
version of the solids into the liquids (heat of fusion = f'), and
subsequently the conversion of these liquids into the molecular
condition; the heat measured in this case will be
              H' = C-va-v, + va, -f, -f, +Jas.
H will be equal to H' only if f, +f, = f', ; i. e. if the heat of
fusion of the compound is equal to the sum of those of its
constituents.
   The fact that with hydrates and analogous compounds the
chemical combination is of a comparatively feeble character
rendered it not improbable that # might be the case; but
there is no reason why it should necessarily be so, and the
question can only be settled by direct experiment.
   The present determinations show that it is not so. The
above argument, as has been said, applies to a case where the
amount of combination is supposed to be as great in the
liquid as in the solid condition,-that is, where the heat of
fusion of the compound, f, represents nothing but the mere
change from the solid to the liquid condition (true heat of
fusion). If, however, the compound undergoes partial dis
sociation on fusion, this dissociation will (generally) involve
absorption of heat, and its apparent heat of fusion will be
greater than its true heat of fusion. The present determi
nations, however, show that the observed heat of fusion of the
compound is generally smaller than the sum of those of its
constituents, and, a fortiori, the true heat of fusion of the
compound must be smaller still; therefore, the assumption
that f, +f, = f', is untenable, and no conclusions can be
drawn as to the amount of dissociation occurring on melting
the compound from the measurement of H and H'.
    The heat of combination of two substances in the liquid
 condition was determined by dissolving each of them, and
also the compound, separately in a solvent. D being the heat
of dissolution, the heat of combination is
                         Da+D,-Da'.
    When, as was generally the case, one of the constituents
 (say a) was identical with the solvent, Da=0.
    With solids similar determinations were made; and where
the solvent is identical with one of the reagents, D, is the
 heat of fusion of the substance a.
    As it was not possible to make the determinations in both
 conditions directly with each substance, the heat of dissolu
 tion in the one condition had to be calculated from that
 observed in the other by means of the heat of fusion. The
                               2 M2

512     Mr. S. U. Pickering on the Heat of Combination
heats of fusion of the substances had therefore to be deter
mined, and to reduce these to the temperature used in the
heats of dissolution determinations, the heat-capacity both in
the liquid and solid conditions had also to be determined. A
description of the method used and of the calculations will
be found in the Proc. Roy. Soc. xlix. p. 11 : it will be suf
ficient to state here that the substance is heated in a platinum
bottle containing a thermometer to the required temperature,
and then plunged into the calorimeter.
   Table I. of the present communication gives the experi
mental details and Table II. the results. Table III. gives
the values for the heat of dissolution—firstly, those obtained
by direct experiment on the substance in the one condition,
and, secondly, those calculated for it in the other condition,
as deduced from the former by means of the heat of fusion.
   The heat-capacity is calculated from the equation
                    C-(?-?)W-(t-t')w'        ?
                              (t-t')w
and the molecular heat of dissolution from the equation
                       D.- ("-t)WM :
                         *        20     s
where t' and t are the final and initial temperatures of the
calorimeter, W the water-equivalent of the calorimeter and
its contents, T the initial temperature of the substance when
introduced into the calorimeter, w its weight, and M its
molecular weight, w being the water-equivalent of the pla
tinum bottle containing it.
   Considerable difficulty was experienced in finding sub
stances suitable for the present investigation. In order that
the heat of fusion may be satisfactorily determined, it is
necessary that the compound and both of its constituents
should melt between temperatures of 0° and not much above
 100°. Several substances other than those here mentioned
were examined and found unsuitable.
   Monohydrate of Sulphuric Acid.—The necessary data have
already been given in the Trans. Chem. Soc. 1890, p. 112,
and the Proc. Roy. Soc. xlix. p. 18: a very slight alteration
 in them has been made in consequence of round values for
the atomic weights having been used in the present work.
   Hewhydrate of Pinacone.—To prepare the anhydrous from
the hydrated pinacone supplied by Messrs. Kahlbaum, frac
tional distillation was found to be unsatisfactory, and dehy
dration by treatment of the ethereal solution with potassium
 carbonate was adopted. The hydrated substance does not
 appear to be by any means insoluble in ether, as is stated, and

        of Substances in the Liquid and Solid Condition.       513
indeed it is improbable that any hydrate would be insoluble
in a liquid which dissolves both the anhydrous substance and
water. The melting-points of the anhydrous and hydrated
substance were 40°48 and 45°42 respectively : Linnemann
 gives 35°–38° and 46°5.                                      -
   Anhydrous pinacone superfuses considerably, and in the
 case of the experiments Nos. 32 and 33, in which the liquid
substance was taken at an initial temperature of 44°, it did
not solidify till after it had attained the temperature of the
calorimeter: the heat evolved when it did solidify was noted
separately, and gave the two supplementary measurements
entered in the footnote to Table II.
    Octohydrate of Tin Tetrabromide.—The tetrachloride of tin
forms a tetrahydrate; but as the anhydrous substance was
found not to solidify till -34°15, it was not a suitable
substance for the present investigation. The tetrabromide,
which solidifies at the higher temperature of 29°36, was
               Fig. 1.—Freezing-points of SnBr, solutions.

                             Per cent. SnRr.
therefore examined in order to ascertain whether it also
formed a hydrate. The results of a series of freezing-points
of mixtures of it with water are given in Table IV. and fig. 1.

514 Mr. S. U. Pickering on the Heat of Combination
   The freezing-point of the tetrabromide is no doubt lowered
by the addition of water, and probably very rapidly so, for
with 23 per cent. of added water no crystallization was
obtained at –70°; but with this amount of water, and also
with amounts up to 24 per cent, mutual solution is not com
plete, the liquids being always cloudy. When the water is
increased to about 26 per cent, the liquid is clear at high
temperatures, and generally becomes cloudy on cooling (it
did not do so in the experiment at 73.4 p. c. SnBr.); and the
more the added water is increased the lower is the tempera
ture which the solution will stand without becoming cloudy.
Hard, well-defined, transparent crystals were obtained from
solutions containing 73.6 to 66.7 per cent. of the tetrabromide;
but with the strongest of these solutions the liquid was turbid
when solidification occurred, and the observations were diffi
cult and doubtful. From solutions containing less than 56
per cent of the bromide, water crystallizes. On plotting out
the results from 73.6 to 66.7 per cent. they form the interme
 diate curve shown in fig. 1, which on a more open scale is
 found to indicate a maximum at a strength of 75.0 per cent.
 of the bromide, and at a temperature of 19°; that is, some
 what beyond the point at which the determinations become
 impossible owing to the cloudiness and dissociation of the
 solution. This indicated that the hydrate was probably an
 octohydrate, which contains 75:261 per cent. To establish
 this more satifactorily, a quantity of a 73-per-cent. solution
 was allowed to deposit a few crystals, and these after being
 drained were analysed and gave the values
    Sn, 20.662, Br, 35.011, H2O (by difference), 24:327,
 theory for SnBr, 8H2O requiring
            Sn, 20:334, Br, 34,926, H20, 24.739.
    This octohydrate, as may be inferred from what has been
 said above, cannot be melted without becoming decomposed
 and cloudy; but if heated to a higher temperature till clear,
 and then cooled without stirring, it may generally be cooled
 to atmospheric temperatures and crystallized without decom
 posing. By repeatedly crystallizing in this way a sample
 was prepared for the determinations. The crystals them
 selves, however, on being kept for any length of time, or on
 being scratched, generally become cloudy and dissociated.
    The heat-capacity and heat of fusion determinations with
 this substance could not be made in the ordinary manner, as
 it would have been impossible to see whether, on cooling in
 the platinum bottle, it had decomposed or not. Fortunately
 jt easily superfuses, and by taking advantage of this property

        of Substances in the Liquid and Solid Condition. 515
it was found possible to determine its heat of dissolution both
in the solid and liquid condition at the same temperature,
and from these the heat of fusion may be deduced. The sub
stance in these determinations was enclosed in a glass bulb,
which was broken under the surface of the water.             The
results, as will be seen, are not very concordant. This may
be due to the fact that the samples used were different pre
  arations, and may have been of different degrees of purity.
  he same preparation, however, was used in the first-quoted
determination with the solid and in the first with the liquid,
and similarly with the two second determinations, and these
two pairs are concordant in the values which they give for
the heat of fusion, 10,230 cal. according to the first deter
minations, 10,176 cal. according to the second.
   The anhydrous tetrabromide used was not satisfactorily
pure. The commercial sample obtained was found, in spite
of special care having been taken in its preparation, to con
tain a considerable amount of dibromide, for, on melting it,
globules of the latter separated. After twelve fractionations
by crystallizing, a sample was obtained with 8 per cent. of
the dibromide, but further fractionation did not appear to
reduce the amount of this impurity: indeed the formation of
the dibromide seems to occur spontaneously in the tetra
bromide, for it was often noticed that a specimen which was
perfectly clear and free from any visible globules of the
dibromide, would, on being melted again, leave particles of the
latter adhering to the glass; yet in no case was the presence
of bromine indicated either by colour or smell. When water
is added to the tetrabromide, visible traces of bromine are
liberated.
   The values obtained for the heat of dissolution of the
anhydrous salt are not very concordant, but this may be
due to the different proportions of water used in the two
determinations.
   Hemiheptahydrate of Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH,3}H2O).—
The heat of formation of this hydrate (for a description of which
see Trans. Chem. Soc. 1893, p. 893) from the monohydrate and
water was determined. This does not constitute an unexcep
tionable instance; for one of the constituents itself being a
hydrate, and not a simple compound, the results are com
plicated by the fact that the heat of fusion of this constituent
may not represent its true heat of fusion, but may include
some heat absorption due to partial dissociation on melting.
    In dealing with the monohydrate it was found that after
it had solidified in the platinum bottle containing the ther
mometer, it was necessary to heat it very slowly indeed to
remelt it, so as to avoid breaking the bulb of the thermometer

-516        On the Heat of Combination of Substances.
 by unequal expansion.      Two thermometers were destroyed
 by heating too rapidly.
    Compound of Benzene and Azobenzene.—The values for
 benzene will be found in the Proc. Roy. Soc. loc. cit. The
 solvent used in determining the heat of dissolution was
 benzene.
    On calculating the results, the heat of combination, both in
 the liquid and solid condition, was found to be negative. It
 appears very improbable, however, that this should be a
 correct result in a case where we have direct combination
 occurring in the absence of a solvent, and without the forma
 tion of any secondary products: in every case, except one
 doubtful one, where the heat of formation of a hydrate has
 been measured, the value is a positive quantity (see Chem.
 Soc. Trans. 1887, p. 77). The explanation here may be that
 the measurement of the heat of fusion of benzene and of the
 compound is at fault: in both cases the heat-capacity in the
 solid condition is greater than that in the liquid condition,
 which is exceptional and which is generally taken to imply
 that the heat absorbed in fusion is absorbed gradually over an
 appreciable range of temperature, and not all at the ordinary
fusing-point, so that the heat of fusion as measured at the
 fusing-point itself is too low, and the heat-capacity of the
 solid as measured in its neighbourhood is too high.
    Compounds of Naphthalene with Metadinitrobenzene and
 with Dinitrobenzene.—These compounds, and several others of
 a similar character, were obtained by Hepp (Annalen, ccxv.
 p. 379) by mixing solutions in benzene of the two constituents
 and crystallizing. The presence of any solvent appeared,
 however, to be superfluous, and preparations of them were
 made by mixing the substances in the proper proportions
 when liquid. It seemed desirable, however, to obtain more
evidence than that heretofore existing as to the substances
formed being really definite compounds. Series of freezing
point determinations were, therefore, made, the results of
which are given in Table W. and figs, 2 and 3. These prove
the definite existence of the compounds in question: we have
a figure made up of three curves (fig. 2), the first one
representing the lowering of the freezing-point of dinitro
benzene by naphthalene, the last the lowering of the freezing
point of naphthalene by dinitrobenzene; the intermediate
one is evidently an independent curve with two branches and
represents, therefore, the crystallization of some third sub
stance; the maximum of this curve is situated at 57 per cent.
of dinitrobenzene, which agrees well with equimolecular pro
 portions, these requiring 56.7 per cent.
   The results in the case of dinitrotoluene are similar, except

518 Mr. S. U. Pickering on the Heat of Combination
that the range of strength over which the compound crys
tallizes is considerably greater. Here the maximum of the
curve is at about 59.5 per cent., equimolecular proportions
requiring 58.7 per cent.
   In the heat of dissolution determinations it was necessary
to use a solvent—benzene—which was not one of the con
stituents of the compounds, a slight modification in the
ordinary procedure was therefore necessary. Since the
heat of formation of the compound AB is given by the
difference between the heat of dissolution of AB and of A and
B separately, the calorimetric liquid must have the same
composition at the end of each of the determinations or the
reactions will not be comparable, the heat of dissolution A
must be determined in a solvent containing already a corre
sponding proportion of B; similarly with the heat of dissolution
of B. An equivalent proportion of naphthalene was, there
fore, added to the benzene before determining the heat of
dissolution of nitrobenzene or nitrotoluene in it, and equivalent
proportions of either of the latter added before determining
that of the naphthalene. In the table will also be found the
values for the heat of dissolution of the various constituents
in pure benzene, although these are not of any service for the
present calculations.
   The values for the heat-capacity and heat of fusion of
naphthalene have already been given in the Proc. Roy. Soc.
loc. cit.
   Table II. contains also values for the heat of fusion and
heat-capacity of aluminium bromide. These were determined
because it was thought that the hydrate with 12H2O would
prove a suitable instance for investigation, since Roozeboom
states that it melts at a few degrees above 100°*. It was found,
however, that in melting it partially decomposed, forming
some less fusible compound, for the liquid was always cloudy,
and would not become clear even on boiling. Whatever the
substance is which thus separates, it appears to enter into
combination again on cooling, for the addition of a little
water forms a clear solution, no basic salt or alumina bein
apparently present. This behaviour was observed both wit
a preparation made by the author and with one made by
Messrs. Kahlbaum.
                          Results Obtained.
   The values for the apparent heat of combination in the two
conditions are given in Table VI., arranged in the order of
magnitude of the heat of combination per molecule of water,
or analogous constituent. The values for the heat of dissolu

this statement.            -

       of Substances in the Liquid and Solid Condition. 519
tion which give the heat of combination are contained in the
first two columns. The latter, of course, apply to the
temperatures at which the heat of dissolution was determined,
and this varies in different cases from 19° to 15°.
   We may conclude with a fair degree of confidence that,
even in the case of the most stable compound investigated, its
constituents are dissociated to a certain extent in the liquid
condition, and, therefore, that the heat evolved on mixing the
liquids should be less than that evolved on combining the
solids, but, it will be seen, that in the first four instances
the reverse is the case, the apparent heat of combination
of the liquids is the greater of the two quantities, and we
must therefore conclude that this apparent heat of combi
nation is not the true heat of combination, and that the
hypothesis on which it was taken to be the true heat of com
bination—namely, that the heat of fusion of the compound is
equal to the sum of that of its constituents—is incorrect (see
p. 510). In order to account for the apparent heat of com
bination of the solids (H') being less than that of the liquids
(H), it is necessary, as will be seen from the equations given
on pp. 510,511, that the heat of fusion of the compound should
be less than the sum of those of its constituents, and this is the
direction in which we should naturally expect inequality, if any
such exist: for when two substances have expended some of
their residual affinity in combining with each other, they will
have a smaller supply available with which to combine with
themselves, when they form aggregates on passing into the
solid condition, and their heat of fusion when combined will,
therefore, be less than when uncombined. The only one of
the seven substances examined in which the heat of com
bination in the liquid form is considerably less than that in
the solid is the hydrate of pinacone: this does not, of course,
necessarily imply that it is an exception as to the heat of
 fusion of the compound being less than the sum of those of
its constituents, but simply that the hydrate may be dis
sociated to a very large extent on fusion.
    The other two exceptional instances are exceptional also as
 regards the negative value for the heat of their formation.
 In the case of benzene combining with azobenzene this has
 already been mentioned, and a probable explanation of it
 has been offered : a similar fact is noticed in the case of
 the compound of naphthalene with dinitrobenzene where there
 are no grounds for suggesting a similar explanation, but the
 values in this case are so small that the heat of combination
 might well be a positive quantity within the limits of experi
 mental error, the values given depending, as they do, on so
 many different measurements.

  LI. On Helmholtz’s Electrochemical Theory, and some
      Conclusions deduced from the same. By F. RICHARZ.
            To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
       GENTLEMEN,
     ROFESSOR G. JoHNSTONE STONEY, in his paper on
         the “Electron,” or Atom of Electricity, in the Philo
 sophical Magazine of October 1894, very rightly draws
 attention to the fact that he expressed himself first, with
 regard to Faraday's law, at the Belfast Meeting of the
 British Association in August 1874, as follows:—“For each
chemical bond which is ruptured within an electrolyte a
certain quantity of electricity traverses the electrolyte, which
is the same in all cases.”
   Professor G. J. Stoney calls this smallest quantity of elec
tricity the “Electron,” and estimates it at 3 x 10-" of the
C.G.S. electrostatic unit of electricity.
   In this view, therefore, he anticipated Helmholtz in his
Faraday Lecture in April 1881. Helmholtz, however, then
propounded further the hypothesis that, “in the case also of
non-electrolytes, the “Valencies’ are charged with the same
atoms of electricity.” Helmholtz explains, moreover, the
grounds for the supposition that the attraction between the
electrons is the most essential and the greatest part of che
mical force. The old electrochemical theory of Berzelius
acquired herewith an entirely new form through Helmholtz
in respect of the quantity of the atom charges, and deserves
therefore the title of “Helmholtz’s Electro-chemical Theory.”
   Without knowing Prof. G. Johnstone        £         calculation
of the “Electron,” # also, in a paper “Ueber die electrischen
Kräfte der Atome,” read before the Niederrheinische Gesell
schaft für Naturkunde on the 1st Dec. 1890 and 12th Jan.
1891*, calculated the electron, and first attached thereto cal
culations fitted to decide whether “the forces operating in
the atoms of a molecule have the same order of magnitude as
the electrostatic attraction of the valency-charges.”
   That this is the case I had then already proved, in respect
to the dissociation heat N2O, into 2NO2, and I, into 21.
   I have further assumed that both atoms of a molecule
revolve round each other with a constant velocity, which is
given by Boltzmann’s kinetic theory of polyatomic gases.

The equation that the centrifugal force is equal to the force
of attraction gives for the latter a value nearly equal to that
of the attraction of two “electrons” on each other. Further,
I put forward at the same time the hypothesis that radiation
is caused by the oscillations of the valency-charges. This
supposition was not new, as I have since found. His own
£          in his book, ‘Theorie der electrischen und optischen
  rscheinungen in bewegten Körpern, Leiden, 1895, page 5,
called my attention to the fact that Prof. H. A. Lorentz as
early as 1878 attributed light-waves to electrical particles,
which are joined to the atoms and which are also assumed in
electrolysis [Verh. d. kgl. Akad. v. Wetenschappen, 18 Deel,
Amsterdam, 1879; notice especially the conclusion, page 112].
Professor Hertz, as he told me, was of a similar opinion;
however, he was not attached to the electrochemical theory
of Helmholtz, but to the opinion of Victor Meyer and Riecke
(Berliner Chem. Ber. xxi. p. 946, 1888). But Lorentz's
electromagnetic theory of refraction is, like Helmholtz’s
theory of Dispersion (1892), independent of the size of the
valency-charges. From this quantity, the “electron,” I have,
in my paper mentioned above of the 12th Jan. 1891, calcu
lated that the period of rotation of the two atoms of a
molecule round one another is about 10" seconds.           This
is the period of the electrodynamic radiation which the
electrons of the two atoms give out while they rotate together
with the ponderable atoms round one another.          It would
correspond with ultra-red waves. As the computed value of
the period of rotation is only the average value of the differ
ent periods of rotation possessed at the same time by different
molecules, the emission must give a more or less extended
spectrum of dark heat-rays, which spectrum would have its
maximum in the region of the average value. Indeed emis
sion of gases is similar, in so far as the latter is only based
on increase of temperature. When the period of rotation
is accelerated the spectrum might possibly pass into the visible
region.
     rof. G. J. Stoney took up the matter of the electro
dynamic radiation of oscillating electrons at about the same
time as I did, but in other respects (Trans. Roy. Dublin Soc.
vol. iv. 1891, p. 585); later also Prof. H. Ebert (Arch.
de Genève, [3] xxv, p. 489, May 1891).
   I next developed the purely kinetic part of my conclusions
(Wied. Ann. xlviii. March 1893, pp. 467–492). There I
have also taken into consideration the dissociation-heat of
hydrogen given by Prof. Eilhard Wiedemann. The same I
have also made use of for comparison, besides the dissociation

              Determinantal Relation of Dynamics.                 531
heat of nitric tetroxide and iodine, already made use of in
 the first publication of 12th Jan. 1891, in the detailed
accounts of my electrical calculations (Münchener Akademie,
#.         p. 1, 13 Jan. 1894, and Wied. Ann. Bd. lii. p. 385,
   There I have also added the following calculation. Assu
ming that molecular magnetism is produced by the rotation
of the valency-charges, we obtain for the specific magnetism
at saturation-point values which correspond in the order of
"'           with those found by experiment.
     elmholtz's electrochemical theory has meanwhile also
been confirmed in other respects by the very interestin
calculations of Prof. A. P. Chattock (Phil. Mag. [5]. xxxii.
p. 285, 1891; xxxiv. p. 461, 1892; xxxv, p. 76, 1893).

LII. Note on a Simple Graphic Illustration of the Deter
    minantal Relation of Dynamics.             By G. H. BRYAN".
IN the whole range of theoretical dynamics there is probably
      no theorem which is so difficult to fully grasp as the
determinantal relation connecting the multiple differential of
the initial coordinates and momenta of a system with that of
its final coordinates and momenta. This relation, which
may almost be regarded as the keystone to the Kinetic Theory
of Gases, is conveniently written in the Jacobian form
                 d(pi', ps', . . . , Qi', q2, ...)
                                                   = 1,
                  d(P1, P2, . . . , Qi, Qs . . )
where pi, p2, ... are the generalized momenta corresponding
to the generalized coordinates q1, q2, ..., and unaccented
and accented letters refer respectively to initial values and
final values after a fixed interval of time t.
   To my mind the difficulty of grasping this result arises from
the want of simple graphical illustrations and verifications
from first principles not involving the use of the Calculus.
The following illustrative examples of its applications to
systems with one degree of freedom have afforded me great
assistance in understanding the theorem, and I trust that they
may prove useful to others.
   Consider a particle moving in the straight line OX (fig. 1)

  532 Mr. G. H. Bryan on a Simple Graphic Illustration
  under any law of force. Let M be the position of the particle at
  any instant, and let the velocity of the particle at this instant be
  represented by the ordinate MP drawn at right angles to OX.
. Then, since the momentum is proportional to the velocity, the
  coordinates OM, MP represent the coordinate and momentum
  of the particle at the given instant, and we may call P the
  representative point.
     Now let four such particles of equal mass be projected
  simultaneously, having the initial coordinates w and a +8x.
  and the initial velocities v and v+ 8v. The representative
  points will form a small rectangle PQRS of area 8x. 8v.
     Let P/Q/R/S be the corresponding representative points
  at any subsequent instant t.          -    -
     Then the determinantal relation asserts that the area of the
  small parallelogram P' Q/R/S is equal to that of the rect
  angle PQRS.
    £          of taking four particles we might suppose the
  points P, Q, R, S to refer to the same particle projected with
  different initial conditions and allowed to move for a fixed
  time-interval t.]
    This property may be verified from first principles in the
  following simple cases:—
    CASE I. Let the motion be uniformly accelerated. Then from
 the equations
                   v'=v +ft,       a'=w +vt-##ft”,
  and the corresponding equations obtained by substituting
  w-Höx for w and v+öv for v, it is easy to see (fig. 1) that the
                                Fig. 1.

                 V
                         R   S         P’         Q
                        P     Q

 parallelogram PQ'R'S' has its base PQ' parallel to OX and
 equal to PQ or öv, and its altitude equal to PQ or 8v.
 Therefore
                    area PQ'R'S'=area PQRS.
    The parallelogram will, however, have undergone a shear,

and is proportional to t. As the time increases, the diagonal
P'S' becomes more and more elongated, but the area of the
parallelogram remains the same.

tion varying as the distance from a fixed point O (fig. 2).

velocity, the representative points of different particles will
all describe concentric circles about O with uniform angular
velocity. Hence the figure PQRS will be brought into the
 position PQ'R'S' by rotating about 0 through a certain
 angle, and the areas of the two figures will of course be
 equal.
  ''. I. might be deduced as the limit of Case II. by
(i.) reducing the scale of representation of velocity so that
 the circles become projected into ellipses; (ii.) supposing the
 centre O to go off to infinity, so that these ellipses gradually
 become elongated into parabolas.
    The case of a repulsive force varying directly as the distance
 would be a little more complicated; and it therefore seems
 hardly worth while to give a proof for it, though the legiti
 macy of the corresponding inference for this case might be
 inferred by means of “imaginary projection.” The theorem
 might possibly then be extended to the case of any variable

 534                Dr. Silvanus P. Thompson on a
 law of force by dividing up the times, and therefore the corre
 sponding spaces decribed, into elements so small that the
 force might be supposed to vary uniformly with the distance
 along OX in any single element. This is not put forward as
 a satisfactory proof, but then the object of this note was to
 show, not how to prove the theorem, but how to convince
 oneself of its truth after proving it by highly analytical
 methods. This I found hard in the case of systems like that
 of Case I., where a slight variation in the initial conditions
 (viz. the difference of velocity 8v of the points M/K’) causes
two such systems to separate indefinitely. I could not see
how this was compatible with the multiple differential (82.8v)
remaining constant till I had worked out the above explana
tion. It is a pity that systems with more than one degree of
freedom could not be treated by this graphic method, but a
similar objection applies equally to the graphic proof of the
formula for uniformly accelerated motion of our text-books
and to many other valuable illustrations of the principles of
dynamics.
        LIII. Note on a Neglected Experiment of Ampère.
                     By SILVANUs P. THOMPsoN".
    N the year 1822 Ampère, being at Geneva, showed to
        De la Rive in his laboratory a number of his now
classical experiments on the actions of conductors carrying
currents upon other conductors and upon magnets. These
are recounted by A. De la Rive in the Annales de Chinnie et
de Physique, xxi. p. 24 (1822).
   Amongst these experiments there is one that has almost
been forgotten, but which, had it been followed up, would
assuredly have led Ampère to anticipate by some years the
great discovery of Faraday as to the induction of currents.
   The experiment was first described by Ampère in October
1821, in a letterf to Van Beck. It had been tried in the
preceding July. The following is Ampère's own first descrip
tion of it:—
    “Ce que cette expérience prouve directement, c'est que la

     The experiment of July 1821, being thus unsuccessful, was
  repeated in 1822 at Geneva, using a more powerful horse
 shoe magnet lent by Pictet. It is described by De La Rive*
 in the following terms :
     * La seconde expérience consiste dans l'influence qu'éprouve
 une lame de cuivre pliée en cercle de la part d'une ceinture
 de forts courans électriques au milieu desquels elle est sus
 pendue, et qui l'entourent sans la toucher. Cette influence,
 que M. Ampère avait d'abord crue nulle, a été, à Genève,
 constatée par lui-même d'une manière très-précise. En pré
 sentant à un côté de cette lame un aimant en fer à cheval,
 très-fort, on l'a vue tantôt s'avancer entre les deux branches
 de l'aimant, tantôt au contraire en être repoussé, suivant le
 sens du courant dans les conducteurs environnans. Cette
 expérience importante montre donc que les corps qui ne sont
 pas susceptibles, au moyen de l'influence des courans élec
triques d'acquérir une aimentation permanente, comme le
 sont le fer et l'acier, peuvent du moins acquérir une sorte
 d'aimentation passagère pendant qu'ils sont sous cette in

     This note, which is textually repeated at p.285 of Ampère's
 * Recueil d'Observations,' is entirely vague on the crucial
 point whether the attractions and repulsions observed occurred
 only at times when the current was varying. By reprinting
 it textually (even the footnote about the instrument, which,
 however, he changed into the first person and signed with
his initial * A'), Ampère accepted De la Rive's version
 and explanation of the Geneva experiment. Nevertheless
 a second version was given by Ampère himselft twelve days
 later on his return to Paris. This document lay unpublished

dédoublé, mais sans aucune communication avec lui, a été
attiré et repoussé alternativement par l'aimant, et cette ex
périence ne laisserait, par consequent, aucun doute sur la
production des courants électriques par influence, si l'on ne
pouvait soupçonner la présence d'un peu de fer dans le cuivre
dont a été formé le circuit mobile. Il n'y avait cependant
aucune action entre ce circuit et l'aimant avant que le courant
électrique parcourût la spirale dont il était entouré; c'est
pourquoi je regarde cette expérience comme suffisante pour
prouver cette production ; je me propose, néanmoins, pour
prévenir toute objection, de la répéter incessament, avec un
circuit formé d'un métal nonmagnétique très pur. Ce fait
de la production de courants électriques par influence, très
intéressant par lui-même, est d'ailleurs indépendant de la
théorie générale de l'action électrodynamique.'
    There is a discrepancy between the first and second versions,
in that while De la Rive says that the attractions and repul
sions were in correspondence with the sense of the current
in the coil (which we know could not be the case), Ampère
says nothing about reversal ofthe current. As he attributed
the effect to the possible presence ofiron, it is clear he was
expecting an effect due to the continued pressure of the cur
rent, not an instantaneous effect at make or break. We know
now that this must have been so, and that an unvarying
current could have produced no such effects as those described.
 That this should have escaped the notice not only of Ampère,
 but also of so skilled an experimenter as De la Rive, is
 remarkable. But the explanation of the phenomenon, as
 being due to a temporary magnetization acquired by the non
                         *
 magnetic metal, given De la Rive, and accepted by Ampère,
 is still more strange. Had no suggestion ever been made that
 there might possibly be an induction of currents by the action
of a magnet, an explanation which ascribed the effects to a

538              Dr. Silvanus P. Thompson on a
sort of temporary magnetism might have been more reasonable.
But Ampère had himself already been looking for a possible
inductive effect; nor was he alone in the idea that such might
exist. Fresnel had on November 6th, 1820, announced to
the Academy of Sciences that he had decomposed water by
means of a magnet which was laid motionless within a spiral
of wire. Emboldened by this announcement, Ampère re
marked that he too had noticed something in the way of
production of currents from a magnet. But before the end
of the year these statements were withdrawn by their authors.
Fresnel wrote * to the Annales de Chimie explaining the
matter. He had surrounded a bar-magnet of steel with a
spiral of iron wire, the ends of which dipped into water; and
what he had announced on November 6th was that he had
found one end of the iron wire to be discoloured and oxidized,
while the other became covered with minute bubbles.                He
now finds that the announcement was premature, that the
effects were not sustained by repeating the experiment, and,
further, he says he does not believe in the success of Ritter's
much earlier attempts to decompose water by a magnet. On
behalf of M. Ampère, he added that the latter had indeed found
little movements of a magnetic needle by bringing near it a
circuit of copper wire (laiton) of which a portion was coiled
in a spiral around a magnet, but that these movements were
not repeated in any constant manner. Further, that these
movements were, moreover, so feeble that Ampère would not
have published the experiments if the success of Fresnel’s,
which he thought certain, had not persuaded him that these
 small agitations were occasioned also by an electric current
resulting from the action of the magnet on the spiral in which
it was enveloped.
   This having occurred in 1820, it is clear that when making
 the Geneva experiment in 1822 Ampère must have had before
him the possibility of induced currents, and chose rather the
explanation of a temporary magnetism conferred on the
copper loop.
   Others in the meantime had tried to repeat Fresnel's
observation, and found it erroneous.
   Gilbertt, after giving an abstract of Fresnel's reputed
discovery, says that he repeated the experiment without
finding any discoloration of the iron wire, and concluded that

pour but de décomposer l'eau avec un aimant.”

                 Neglected Experiment of Ampère.                   539
the announcement was premature. Similar conclusions were
arrived at by Pohl”.
   A year or two later, when Arago’s rotations were attract
ing the attention of experimenters, Becquerel f investigated
the supposed magnetism of bodies by taking small pieces of
them, which he hung within a multiplier-coil of wire in place
of the usual magnetic needle, and then turning on a current
observed whether they moved or not. He found signs of
magnetic action in needles made of peroxide of iron, copper,
wood, and even shellac. After narrating his own experi
ments, he alluded to the Geneva experiment of Ampère, on
p. 272, in the following terms:—
   “Il résulterait de cette expérience, vu l'action semblable
exercée par les deux poles de l'aimant en fer a cheval sur
une même portion du circuit, que l’influence du courant
electrique aurait développé dans la lame un autre courant
electrique, tel qu'on en observe dans un fil métallique qui
communique avec les deux poles d’une pile voltaique; mais
M. Ampère s'est assuré depuis qu’il n'en est pas ainsi.”
What steps Ampère had in the meantime taken to assure
himself that induction currents did not exist, Becquerel did
not state, however.
   In 1831 came Faraday's discoveries of the induction of
currents by magnets, of the induction of currents by other
currents, and of the cause of Arago’s rotations. A group of
notest on these discoveries is to be found in December 1831
in the Annales de Chimie.            It is curious to note the change
of views. Becquerel and Ampère's communication to the
Academy of January 23, 1832, appears along with abstracts
of  £.          work, and with an account of the experiments of
Nobili and Antinori. There is an epitome of facts observed
by Becquerel, and another of things to be looked for, by
Ampère. This is followed by the following:—“Expériences
 sur les Courans électriques produits par l’influence d’un autre
 Courant,” par M. Ampère. This article gives a third version
 of the Geneva experiments.
    “Pendant mon séjour à Genève au mois de septembre
 1822, M. Auguste de la Rive voulut bien m'aider dans des
 expériences que je désirais de faire sur la production d'un

 Nous présentions à ce cercle un fort aimant en fer à cheval,
 de manière qu'un de ses poles se trouvait au dedans et l'autre
 au dehors du cercle. Dès que nous faisions communiquer
 avec la pile les deux extrêmités du fil conducteur le cércle
 était attiré ou repoussé par l'aimant, suivant le pole qui
 répondait à l’intérieur du cercle : ce qui démontrait l’existence
 du courant électrique qui y était produit par l’influence du
 courant du fil conducteur. La découverte que vient de faire
 M. Faraday des courans électriques produits par l’influence
 d’un aimant, courans qu’avait obtenu Fresnel en 1820, mais
 qu'il n'avait pas cru suffisamment constatés parses expériences,
 m’a porté naturellement à employer le galvanoscope multi
 plicateur, dont l’illustre chimiste anglais a fait usage, pour
 constater de nouveau et étudier dans toutes ses circonstances
 la production d’un courant électrique par un autre courant.”
    Ampère seems to have considered that the oxidation at first
 alleged by Fresnel was caused by induction currents arising
 from the diurnal variations of the magnetism of the stationary
magnet. But it is evident that the electromotive forces due
to any such cause would be of an order of magnitude utterly
inadequate for the purpose. Further, as such currents must
necessarily have been in alternate directions during the rise
and fall of temperature, the total chemical action at the end
would in no way depend upon the intermediate charges, but
only upon the difference between the initial and final tem
peratures. Hence the total electromotive impulse tending to
chemical action must have been infinitesimal compared with
that due to simply removing the magnet once from the
circuit! The third version differs from the former in describing
the position of the magnet, and saying that the magnet (which
in the original Ampère experiment was brought up after the
current had been turned on) was placed in position before the
circuit was completed.
    From that time forward Ampère's experiment seems to have
passed into oblivion. One reference to it, however, appeared
in 1872, which gives a fourth version, differing not only from
the three former, but accompanied by a picture and description
of a very different form of apparatus. This description, from
the pen of the usually accurate M. Verdet, is to be found at
p. 357 of his well-known Conférences de Physique. It runs as
follows:—

à ces phénomènes et qu'ils n'avaient pas comprise. Ces
physiciens cherchaient s'il y avait une action des courants sur
des conducteurs placés à distance, par analogie avec les effets
d'influence de l'électricité ordinaire ; ils entreprirent une série
d'expériences avec l'idée préconçue que le phénomène produit
par le passage du courant dans un conducteur voisin serait
permanent, c'est à dire persisterait pendant tout le temps que
le courant traverserait le conducteur ; ayant au contraire
observé un phénomène instantané, ils regardèrent ce résultat
comme un fait singulier ne méritant pas une étude ultérieure.
Voici en qui consistait leur expérience : un fil fin de cuivre
enroulé en anneau A [fig. 2] était suspendu à un fil de soie
sans torsion OC, devant la base d'un électro-aimant BB", de
manière que les plans des spires de l'electro-aimant fussent
 arallèles au plan de l'anneau. A l'instant où le courant était
* dans l'électro-aimant, l'anneau était repoussé; mais
cette déviation ne persistait pas, et bientôt le fil revenait
rigoureusement à la verticale. Si l'on interrompait le courant,
on observait une attraction aussi peu persistante que la
répulsion.'
   The anachronism of representing a soft-iron electromagnet
as having been used in 1822 is the strangest part of this
description. But the experiment, as described by Verdet,is
of interest as being a sort of forerunner of the actions
observed in 1884 by Boys*, and in 1887 by Elihu Thomson.
   I have repeated the experiment of Ampère in the form
originally shown to De la Rive. It is quite easy of per
formance : but the relatively great moment of inertia of the
copper circle masks the purely transitory effect of the impulse
which the ring receives each time the current is turned on or
offin the outer coil.

      1. ‘The Pleistocene Beds of the Maltese Islands.      By John H.
Cooke, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S.
    For the right understanding of the Pleistocene beds, a previous
knowledge of the physiography of the islands and of the earlier
sediments is necessary. A full description of the physiography
and of the character of the sediments, so far as they are necessary
for the understanding of the accumulations forming the subject of
the paper, occupies its earlier portion. Especially noticeable is the
absence of ordinary anticlinal and synclinal folding, and the pre
dominance of monoclinal faults, which largely affect the character
of the surface. These faults were formed prior to the deposition of
the Pleistocene beds.
    The plateaux of Malta, rising to a height of 600–800 feet above
sea-level, occur south of the great east-and-west fault, which has a
downthrow to the north. They have no Pleistocene deposits upon
their summits.
    Three classes of superficial deposits are described:—
    I. Valley-deposits, including (a) those found on the higher slopes
of plains and plateaux, due to subaerial waste and rain-action, con
taining land-shells and mammalian bones; and (b) those situated
at the bottoms of valleys, consisting of stratified layers of water
worn sand, gravel, and large pebbles, occurring in such order as to
show that the agents which produced them have greatly decreased
in intensity.
   II. Agglomerates and breccias found along coast-lines and fault
terraces, always at the foot of the fault-terraces, or along the lower
slopes of the depressed areas: these accumulations are either sub
merged or lie at the water-line.      Their materials are much water
worn, and land-shells are contained in many of the layers. The
agglomerates are in many cases distinctly stratified; and the author
concludes that the materials appear to have been swept down,
during heavy rainfall, into the waters of land-locked creeks.
   III. Ossiferous deposits of caves and fissures, which have been
described elsewhere.

R. Baron, F.L.S., F.G.S.
   The part of the island travelled over may be divided into four
sections.
   I. Antananarivo to the East Coast.—The principal rock is a horn
blende granitite-gneiss, but there is also much norite usually con
taining olivine. The general strike of gneiss and norite along this

region is north-west and south-east, or north-north-west and south
south-east.    The country is traversed by several large dolerite
dykes.
   II. The Northern Part of the East Coast.—Dolerite-flows pre
dominate along the coast, and from their character are believed
to have flowed from such fissures as are indicated by the dolerite
dykes noted in the preceding section. Some felsites, probably
lavas, and felsitic breccias were also observed; also a granitite
penetrated by epidiorites, and associated with chiastolite-slates.
Many other rocks, schists and eruptives, were found.
   III. The Northern End.—Sedimentary rocks (sandstones and lime
stones) are extensively developed in this section, as well as much
volcanic material.    The sediments are of Jurassic and Cretaceous
ages. The volcano Ambohitra is situated on these sediments, and
has poured out olivine-basalts. Shells of recent species occur on the
mountain-chain at the northern end.
   IV. The North-western Coast and Islands. --Marine strata of
Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Eocene ages are found in this area, together
with various igneous rocks including trachyte, foyaite, nepheline
phonolite, hauyne-nepheline-phonolite, andesite, and basalt. South
west of Anorontsanga are four islands—three composed of volcanic
rocks, and the fourth, Antanifaly, of nummulitic limestone.
    3. ‘On a Collection of Fossils from Madagascar obtained by the
 Rev. R. Baron. By R. Bullen Newton, Esq., F.G.S.
    The fossils forming the subject of this paper were collected in the
 northern part of the island. The author gives an account of the
 previous work on the fossils of Madagascar; this is followed by a
 description of the post-Tertiary, Tertiary, Cretaceous, and Jurassic
 fossils. The post-Tertiary fossils are for the most part terrestrial
 shells found on Ambohimarina hill, mainly of species still existing
 on the island.   A few marine forms have been found elsewhere.
    A description of species, many of them new, follows; and the
 author furnishes a list of all recognized fossils from the island,
 concluding with notes on certain limestones, including a Globigerina
 limestone and one containing Girvanella.

 shire). By T. G. Bonney, D.Sc., LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S., Professor
 of Geology and Mineralogy in University College, London.
    The author revisited this district, briefly described by himself
 and Mr. Hill in 1878, at Easter 1893 and in September 1894.
 The old excavations had been greatly enlarged, but little of import
 ance had been disclosed: no dykes and no new junctions with
 sedimentary rocks.    But the crystalline rocks have been recently
 struck in a fresh locality between Narborough and Huncote, about
 half a mile west of the pit near the former village.  As in that case,

the rock lay very near to the surface; here the highest part of the
boss was barely covered. The rock is hardly to be distinguished
from that of the Narborough pit. The enlargement of the pit
south of Enderby has exposed fresh sections of the junction of the
slate and syenite, which has been now traced along the whole length
of the pit from north to south, and some particulars are added to
the former description.
   The enlargement of certain of thepits has displayed some interesting
sections of Boulder Clay resting upon the crystalline rocks. The
latter are not appreciably ice-worn. The fragments in the Boulder
Clay, identified by the author, were from the Carboniferous, Trias,
Jurassic (especially Lias), and Upper Cretaceous formations. They
indicated, in the main, a drift from a more or less north-easterly
direction.
    2. “The Tarns of Lakeland.      By J. E. Marr, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.,
Sec.G.S.
    The author has examined several tarns of the English Lake
District.    In those cases where the stream issues from the tarn
 over solid rock, he finds either (1) direct evidence that the tarn
results from the blocking up of part of a pre-existing valley by drift,
causing the deflexion of the water to a direction different from that
 of the original stream in this locality; or (2) evidence which is
 perfectly consistent with such an explanation of the origin of the
 tarn.
    Under the circumstances he would submit that tarns cannot be
 assumed to lie in rock-basins simply because the issuing stream
 flows over solid rock (and this assumption has been made), but that
 those who maintain the existence of such rock-basins must prove
 the occurrence of solid rock entirely around the tarn.
    3. “Description of a New Instrument for Surveying by the Aid
 of Photography, with some Observations upon the Applicability of
 the Instrument to Geological Purposes. By J. Bridges Lee, Esq.,
 M.A., F.G.S.
     The instrument described in this paper consists essentially of a
  photographic camera fitted inside with a magnetic needle, which
  carries a vertical transparent scale divided and numbered to 360°,
  and also with cross fibres which intersect at right angles. The
  fittings and adjustments of the instrument are of such a character
  that the camera can be accurately levelled and directed towards any
  point in a horizontal direction, and when a photograph is taken in
  an ordinary way the bearing of the median vertical plane which
  bisects the instrument through the photographic lens will be recorded
  automatically on the face of the photograph.
     The vertical fibre (and its image on the photograph) serves as an
  index to read the bearing; and the same fibre marks by its shadow
  a line right across the photograph, which marks the median vertical
  plane on the image. The horizontal fibre is adjusted to mark on
  the image the horizontal plane which bisects the photographic lens.

                    The Marble Beds of Natal.                   5.45
   The camera rests on a divided horizontal circle, which can be
adjusted to a truly horizontal position by levelling-screws. There
is a tripod stand and head, with suitable appliances for supporting
and adjusting the instrument in position. The camera is provided
with a rectilinear doublet lens and iris diaphragm and rack-and
pinion focussing adjustment. It is made of aluminium, and it is
surmounted by a telescope adjustable in altitude and fitted with
vertical and horizontal webs; and it is also surmounted by a
revolvable tubular level.
   The details of construction and the peculiar features and adjust
ments of the instrument are fully described in the paper, and some
of the chief purposes to which it may be applied in furtherance of
geological research are pointed out. The maker of the instrument
is J. J. Hicks, of 8 Hatton Garden.

   A “crystalline limestone of enormous thickness’ was mentioned
by Mr. C. L. Griesbach, in 1871 (Q. J. G. S. vol. xxvii. p. 56), as
occurring along the lower course of the Umzimkulu, in the county
of Alfred, in the southern part of Natal. Since the time of his
visit there the country has been opened out by settlers, and some
attempts have been made to utilize this marble.            The chief
mass of this rock is met with at about 7 miles inland, in the
Indwendwa hill-range, within the fork formed by the junction of
the Umzimkulu and the Umzimkulana, over 700 feet above sea
level, and continuous with the tableland westward. This consists
of granite, overlain by the massive marble, roughly stratified,
which is denuded north and south of the hill into the gorges of the
two rivers, and is continued on the opposite flanks until cut off by
faults.   The north fault divides it from the Table-mountain Sand
stone lying on clay-slate; and the south fault divides the granite
from the Table-mountain Sandstone and clay-slate. The bedding
of the marble dips towards the rivers, on each of their flanks, and
strikes E. and W.
   In quality the marble varies from coarse to fine-grained, and in
colour from pure white to deep red. The coarse-grained variety
contains 5 to 13 per cent. of carbonate of magnesia. Calcareous
tufa, in some places several feet thick, has been formed from the
marble.
   From the junction of the two rivers eastward, slate is seen below
Table-mountain Sandstone; and on the latter is a long stretch of
the Dwyka Conglomerate to the coast, greatly disturbed for the
most part, and pierced by two dolerite-dykes, between which a
patch of Ecca Shales is preserved.
   The author concludes that the marble was deposited on the
granite, and probably on the Malmesbury Slates nearby, before they
were disturbed; that it does not extend far under the neighbouring
hills; and that some of its local detritus indicates that the rivers
ran at higher levels within relatively recent times.

   1. ‘The Lower Greensand above the Atherfield Clay of East
Surrey. By Thomas Leighton, Esq., F.G.S.
   This paper embodies the results of the author's examination of
the Lower Greensand of East Surrey during the three years 1892–94;
and it is stated that two papers published by the Geologists’ Asso
ciation (vol. xiii. pp. 4 & 163) are to be taken as introductory to
this one. The area discussed in this paper extends from Leith Hill
in the west to Tilburstow Hill in the east; and the divisions of the
Lower Greensand chiefly referred to are those hitherto known as the
Bargate, Sandgate, and Hythe Beds. The author states that the
Lower Greensand of East Surrey shows that formation to consist of
beds deposited in a marine estuary or narrow sea, not far from land
and within the influence of strong currents, extending generally
from N.W. to S.E., so that, without palaeontological evidence, no
correlation of beds here with those exposed at Sandgate and at
Hythe is possible.     He arrives at this conclusion by following the
outcrop of the various chert-beds, which, after Dr. G. J. Hinde
(Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. vol. clxxvi. 1885), are accepted as of sponge
origin (deep-water deposits), and further by following the outcrop
of the pebble-beds, described by Mr. C. J. A. Meyer (Geol. Mag.
for 1866, p. 15).
    In Part 1 of the paper the author discusses the district to the
 west of the Mole, and endeavours to show that the view set forth
 in the Weald Memoir of the Geological Survey, to the effect that
 between Dorking and Leith Hill the lower horizons of the Lower
 Greensand undergo a change in composition, although possibly
 verbally correct, is geologically incorrect, since the lithological
 change is from south to north, from beds laid down in deep water
 to beds laid down in shallow water.      In his communication to the
 Geologists’ Association of last year, the author showed that the
 pebble-bed at the base of the Folkestone Sands was at Abinger
 intimately associated with the Bargate Beds; and he now states
 that he has identified this pebble-bed in the Dorking-Horsham road
 section, described by Prof. G. S. Boulger and himself in 1892, and
 at two other places to the east. The drifts of the same neighbour
 hood are then discussed, and it is found that at the top of and on
 both sides of the Lower Greensand escarpment, which, as stated by
 the Geological Survey, is here sandy throughout, there are gravels
  obviously deposited by a considerable stream consisting chiefly of
  Lower Greensand chert (entirely of Lower Greensand material) with,
  amongst the rougher material, lenticular beds of fine pebbles composed
  chiefly of débris from the Bargate Beds. Fragments of Lower Green
  sand chert have been obtained from the alluvium or from the beds of
 the streams now draining the Weald area to the south of Dorking.
  The soil over the Weald Clay as far south as Holmwood Common
  has everywhere yielded to the author fragments of the same chert.
  Hence it is argued that the chert-beds now seen upon Leith Hill to

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             547
 the west formerly existed over the Weald to the south of Dorking,
 and that the fragments now lying about the surface have been left
 by denudation, as described by Dr. G. J. Hinde (op. cit.). Since,
 however, as has been stated, the present Lower Greensand escarp
 ment to the north consists of “sandy beds’ only, there must be
 a lithological change from south to north (deep-water beds to
shallow).
    Part 2 of the paper is devoted to the district east of the Mole.
 Where the escarpment rises above the alluvium of the river,
 the author finds the Bargate Beds with pebbles (at Park Hill,
 Reigate) separated from the Folkestone Sands only by a thin bed of
 Fuller's Earth and a layer of sandy chert.    The section is now first
 described; the dip has been observed and proved, and by measure
 ment this pebble-bed is shown to lie at approximately the same
 horizon above the Atherfield Clay as when it was last seen west
 of the Mole.      From Reigate eastwards to Tilburstow Hill the
 same beds are seen in the numerous hollow lanes and pit-sections.
 The pebble-beds are found approximately on a definite horizon; but
 whilst they become of less importance eastward, the overlying
 cherts, first seen at Reigate, become of greater importance in that
direction. The thin bed of Fuller's Earth, also first seen at Reigate,
thickens to the east likewise.     '
   2. “On the Eastern Limits of the Yorkshire and Derbyshire or
Midland Coalfield. By W. S. Gresley, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author attempts to throw light on the question of the
 easterly extension of the Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Nottingham
shire coalfield beneath the newer rocks.       He notices the general
trend of the strata, the sizes of other British coalfields, the question
of the origin of mountains, stratigraphical considerations, and the
faults of the North of England. His object is rather to suggest what
he believes to be novel ways of treating the subject than of reaching
conclusions or locating limits.
   3. ‘ On some Phases of the Structure and Peculiarities of the Iron
Ores of the Lake Superior Region. By W. S. Gresley, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author has been studying heaps of ore brought from the
region lying south-west of Lake Superior since 1890. He describes
certain structural features of the ore-fragments, and, discusses the
evidences of mechanical movements and chemical alteration exhibited
by these fragments.

     ON ELECTROMAGNETIC TRACTIVE FORCE.             BY M. WEBER.
   The author summarizes the results of his experiments as
follows:—
   (1) An iron wire of great length in comparison with its dia
meter, one end of which is in a magnetic field parallel to the lines
of force, experiences a pull in the direction of its length which
for unit area (the square centimetre) of the cross-section is
P:= IH=&H’.

548           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   (2) If the magnetic lines of force are at right angles to the lon
gitudinal direction of the wire projecting into the field, the tractive
force at right angles to the lines of force is smaller in iron than
the force p #. The ratio pi:/p_L (where p! and p_L are the tractive
forces parallel and at right angles to the lines of force respectively),
which with mean strengths (about H=100) is greater than 100,
rapidly decreases as the field increases and appears to approach
unity.—Wiedemann's Annalen, No. 1, 1895.
ON THE INFLUENCE OF MAGNETIZATION ON THE CONSTANTS OF
                 ELASTICITY IN IRON.      BY A. BOCK.
   The result of this research is stated as follows by the author:—
By magnetization the constants of elasticity of soft iron, the
modulus of torsion, and the modulus of elasticity are certainly
not altered by more than 3 per cent. The series of observations
indicate that the flexure diminishes, at the same time the torsion
seems also to diminish, while the ratio of the lateral contraction
to the longitudinal expansion increases. Iron is more incom
pressible in the magnetic field. Nothing can be alleged with
certainty as to magnetized steel bars. These results are in perfect
agreement with the well-known investigations of G. Wiedemann,
and they may be deduced from the theory propounded by that
author on the assumption of rotating molecular magnets.—Wiede
mann's Annalen, No. 3, 1895.
    ON THE MAGNETIZATION OF IRON BY VERY SMALL FORCES.
                        BY WERNER SCHMIDT.
   The experimental results of this research are given by the author
in the following statements:
   1. Steel follows small magnetizing forces more rapidly than iron.
   2. The magnetization function k of mild steel is greater for small
forces than that of iron. In the present case k (steel) is to k
(iron) as 4 is to 3. The stronger magnetization ordinarily ob
served in iron is only met with in greater magnetizing forces, for
instance, H > 1.
   3. The constancy of the magnetizing function & for very small
forces, first observed by Lord Rayleigh, is confirmed. The
boundary of proportionality between magnetizing forces and mag
netic moments may be taken with sufficient accuracy for technical
purposes as near the magnetizing force H =0.06. This value
represents a rather sudden transition in the curve k=f(H,).
Below this the deviations from proportionality are only very feeble,
that is the curve k= f(H,) passes into a parallel to the H-axis.
The point at which it can be identified with a straight line
(parallel) is different according to the nature of the iron investi
gated, and especially according to the sensitiveness of the
apparatus used for the measurements, without varying much from a
certain mean value which may be regarded as lying between the
magnetizing forces H, =0.03 and 0.04.—Wiedemann's Annalen,
No. 4, 1895.
