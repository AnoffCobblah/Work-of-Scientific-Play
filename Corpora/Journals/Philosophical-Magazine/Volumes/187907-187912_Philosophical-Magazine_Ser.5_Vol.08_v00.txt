    (4) When we     close a circuit consisting of a battery and a
rectilineal iron wire,  we observe an extra current in the oppo
site direction to that of the principal current". . At the open
ing of the circuit an extra current arises with the same direc
tion as the principal current. These currents were discovered
by Villari, and were named shock-currents. G. Wiedemannf
at first based an explanation of them on the assumption of a
transversal or circular magnetization of the iron wire; Her

investigation of them.
    (5) Longitudinal magnetizing of iron rods or wires has an                           in
fluence upon their resistance.   I mention this point last because
the results hitherto obtained respecting it have proved most
anomalous and in part contradictory to one another. Edlund
and Mousson found no alteration, Thomson | and Beetz"                                   in
 crease of the resistance; while even a diminution was inferred
 from older observations, and has recently been confirmed.
 Beetz's results have lately been corroborated by Chwolson** in
 a brief communication.
    § 3. In the experiments and considerations which          have                  I
 carried out upon the facts here brought together,          started             I
 directly from the last two points, partly because here the ma
 terial in hand appeared to me least sufficient for the full un
 derstanding of the phenomena, partly because           considered          I
 that       I
          could not concur in the view (in which Beetz and
 Herwig agree) that the cases treated by them (4 and 5) must
 be kept perfectly distinct.    Rather have I, with G. Wiede
 mannff, received from their results the conviction that the
 two phenomena may very well be connected with one another,
                                                                         i.

     I commence                with the examination                       of the influence of mag
netization upon the resistance.               -
    For  measuring      the resistance                         I
                                            used a Wheatstone bridge.
A universal resistance-box         by  Siemens furnished the resist
ances wi, wº, we of the three parallel branches.                In the expe
riments the ratio wi: we was almost constantly as 1000 : 10,
in some instances as 100: 10; consequently the resistance
wa in the first case represents 100-fold the resistance wa to be
measured.       Since 0:01 of a Siemens unit can be measured with
certainty, the accuracy of the determination extends to the
fourth decimal place; it only became uncertain in case wº
amounted to more than 10 units.
     Iat first used as the measuring-instrument a Wiedemann
galvanometer with the thinnest of the wire coils that are usu
ally joined to                 it,

  Permanent increase A=0.0097.                   If we   neglect this, we get
for the transient increase
                                      8=0'0281.
     These values are extraordinarily          high.      The permanent       in
crease     of the resistance can also be inferred from the fact that
we have here to do with abnormal proportions. Of course
this conclusion must, to a certain extent, be extended to the
following series of experiments, based upon another wire.

Further, with the same signification as above, we get
                     A=0.0015 and 81=0.0156.
The disproportionately low value of A, compared with that
found in 19, can be accounted for from the circumstance that
the wire     f
             had already, in consequence of having been fre
quently passed through by the current, considerably neared
its stationary condition.                                    -

for H=2D, M=1D (therefore as in 22):-

therefore a negative value of 8, as in 22.
   25. In experiment-series 6 and 21 the conclusion was reached
that the resistance of hard iron wires was not changed by
magnetizing them.        I  sought to realize the same case with a
tempered thick steel wire     F  (l=1450, d-1:31).       I succeeded,
when H was =2D and n=92, with almost equal approxima
tion when M was =2D and M-3D. This point can be fixed
still more exactly with annealed iron wires. On the contrary,
in hard steel wires there was always an alteration of the resist
ance; and, indeed, with H constant, the more insignificant
 the magnetizing force the smaller in general was the altera
tion.    É. the experiments with slight magnetizings       I  will only
mention that     they  mostly  yielded  lower values of 8 than those
 with iron wires; only with the lowest values of the ratio Mn: H
does the opposite take place.                              I
                                     On the other hand, will give
some more series of experiments with magnetizing forces to
which, in iron and tempered steel, positive values of 8 would
have corresponded.

    If now the magnetizing     current was reversed, there followed,
as at the commencement of the first series, first an increase of
 8 by magnetizing, which, however, after the current had
 passed twice had already given place to a diminution.           Gene
 rally, this wire proved very favourable, not only for these
 measurements, but also for those of which       I have yet to speak
 in the course of this    investigation.    But the absolute values
 of 8 are here much smaller than in other wires; already on the

  25th May, with a series (M) of 5B, had obtained scarcely
 higher values of 8.

14             Dr. F. Auerbach on         the Passage    of
slight dependence of the resistance on the magnetization of
the English steel, or whether considerably stronger magneti
zing forces were not required here in order to produce, even
approximately only, the state of so-called saturation, I made
use of a Gramme machine of the newer construction (1875),
a short time previously acquired for this laboratory by Prof.
O. E. Meyer, and, driven by a steam-engine, capable of ope
rating with considerable effect. Its distance from the galva
nometer amounted to about 25 metres; the electromagnet
               º
was set up between the two, at the distance of 5 metres from
the machine, and 20 from the galvanometer, and connected in              -
both directions by thick copper wires. The spiral never grew
so hot that it      not be touched with impunity.   The caout
chouc pipe never exhibited any trace of heating, even with the
most rapid rotation of the machine (1200 revolutions per
minute).     Notwithstanding, many of the series of experi
ments made with soft iron wires, especially with thin ones,
proceeded in a manner which         I
                                 can only account for by influ
ences of temperature.       If
                            we seek to eliminate these, we ob
tain increases of resistance by magnetization rising to 1 per
cent. and over.   Simpler and more reliable are the results of

the influence of the magnetizing is demonstrable even when
accompanied by considerable influences of temperature.         On
making certain simplifying assumptions, it is easy to ascer
tain the law according to which the resistance in the circuit of
the principal current changes with the time through lateral
radiation of the spiral.                            If

phenomenon of unequal heating, the analogue of the unequal
electrification of the tourmaline when warmed, would be found.
It was also imagined, by a reversal of the known pheno

The same weight of mercury (221 grims.) was employed
throughout.            The source of heat (the steam) was applied
below the crystal in every case. The original temperature of
the mercury having been read off on the thermometer, the
heat was applied until the temperature rose through a given
range—in the first experiment 50 degrees C., in the subsequent
 ones 40 degrees C.               Mercury was employed as being more
 convenient in several ways, though a water calorimeter would
 probably be more accurate.                   The results of nineteen experi

      It    would appear therefore, by this method of experiment,
  that the ratio of the two conductivities in opposite
  through the crystal while it was becoming hotter was roughly
  as 100.to 119.             The more rapid flow is toward that pole
  which, when the crystal is warmed, becomes positively elec

       It only remains to add, that the second-named of the authors
  has made a few preliminary experiments with the view of de
  tecting any unilateral conductivity of tourmaline for electricity.
   These experiments were made with the same slice of tourma
  line, “B,” as had been employed in the last-mentioned heat
   experiments—a crystal in which the faces were normal to the

crystallographic   axis. The crystal was heated to 100° Centi
     e in a steam-bath. . A 5-microfarad condenser was charged
through the crystal with 10 or 12 Daniell’s cells for a minute;
and then the condenser was discharged through a sensitive
astatic Thomson galvanometer of 7000 ohms resistance.          The
conductivity of the tourmaline was so slight that the motion
of the spot of light was only about two inches. The limit
of swing was accurately observed, and then the operation
repeated with the tourmaline (electrically) reversed.          This
was done again and again alternately in opposite directions.
   When the temperature of the tourmaline was rising, a
distinct difference was perceived between the to-and-fro dis
charge. Also when it was falling there was a difference, in
the other direction.     (These effects are of course due to that
which is ordinarily termed electromotive force in the warming
or cooling crystal.)    But with a perfectly steady temperature,
which was     only attained after some hours, not the slightest
difference could be perceived.        But before being satisfied
with this   imperfect   and  negative  result, we should wish to
use a battery of very much higher electromotive force (say
1000 cells), and, if possible, heat the tourmaline above 100°,
so as to increase             its
                       conductivity, which      100°   slight.        at            is

    So far, then, as experiment has at present gone, the results
for the case of electricity have been altogether negative.    For
the case of heat, distinct results have been obtained ; but it
is to be remembered that a rising temperature has always been
used, and no experiments on the conductivity for heat have
been at present made with the temperature constant: it is
probable that, when they are, negative results will be also ob
 tained corresponding with the negative results for electricity.

with colloids. This      the case with granite, and eminently
so  with basalt,              all   of is
                           whose constituents are crystalline.
When the solid has resulted from the intersolution of two or

of  solid matter will break conchoidally when subjected                                                 to

advances into the sheet; and this is followed by a fan-like
cracking of the glass between the apex and the still nearest
circumference.         In fig. 4, a shows the cracking of a plate
of crown glass, 9 inches in diameter, over an air-gas burner;
b is a 53-inch-diameter plate similarly treated.             In e we have
a plate of crown glass, 3 inches in diameter, which was laid
on a cloth and heated from above by a fine blowpipe-flame.
If we conceive what was before called the apical point to reach
the centre, the heat fracture would become approximately the
central-pressure fracture, namely radial.

IV.  On a neglected Principle that may be employed in Earth
  quake Measurements.    By JoHN PERRY and W. E. AYRTON,
  Professors in the Imperial   College of Engineering, Japan".
                             [Plate IV.]
     PECULATIONS        regarding the internal constitution of
      the earth have   interested  philosophers for many years.
For a  long time it was considered that our globe consisted of
a thin solid shell containing a fluid core: but Hopkins, who
was one of the first to investigate the subject on correct prin
ciples, showed that this shell must be from 800 to 1000 miles
in thickness; and still more recently Sir Wm. Thomson has
proved that the apparent absence of elastic tides in the earth's
surface leads to the conclusion that the average rigidity of the
earth is greater than that of glass, and possibly even greater
than that of steel. We do not on the present occasion propose
to consider whether the state in which the internal part of the
earth exists is like any state of matter with which we are ac
quainted; but this              is,
                           course,    subject well worthy
                                      of              a         very                       of
careful investigation.
  It  is probable that the earth was once         molten condition   in
                                                                      a

                                                 so         resulting
from this cooling must develop vast internal forces,     producing
strains,    deformations,
            or                great magnitude.

reaches us is much modified by the media through which it
has been transmitted; and, again, since there is a great want
of continuity at the surface of the earth, very important mo
difications are introduced by surface conditions: for example,
ranges of mountains are well known to reflect earthquake
vibrations in a marked manner; and veins of good conducting
rock, by transmitting the vibrations more rapidly than less
conducting veins, set up transverse vibrations.
   Professor Palmieri and others have invented instruments
which record the date of the vibration, and give rough ideas
of the direction of propagation of the earthquake-waves,
together with what is called the strength of the vibration.
   Mr. Mallet, whose wide experience on the subject of earth
quakes has necessarily caused his writing to be regarded with
great respect, describes the object of Professor Palmieri's                                             in
strument as follows:—“By means of this apparatus the time
of the first shock is recorded, as well as the interval between
the shocks, and the duration of each ; their direction, whether
vertical or horizontal, is given, as also the maximum of inten
sity.” He further says, however —“It is not my intention
here to offer any criticism as to the construction or perform
ance of this instrument, the rather as           must confess   I   do not                  I
quite share the high opinion of            inventor  its     the certainty  as   to
or                   of    its               And this opinion

    exactitude           indications.”                                  Mr.
Mallet with regard         Professor Palmieri's instruments

 are several times quicker than the earthquake vibrations them
 selves; that when the springs, however, are weak, the motion
 of the mass relatively to the box in no way represents the ab
solute motion of the box itself; but that the introduction of
 friction, although it diminishes the accuracy of observation of
regular vibratory earthquakes made by means of very rapidly
vibrating springs, makes it possible to get an approximation
to accuracy even with slowly vibrating springs, and is always
desirable when the earthquake vibration is irregular and                                                         in

box of the centre of mass of the body supported in it may
accurately represent the real motion of a point of the box itself,
it is necessary that the mass be large, and the springs sup
porting it so strong that                      its

point to the employment of a small amount of friction and

calculations should be chiefly employed only for directing and
making use of experimental knowledge:—first, because we
assumed the friction to be proportional to the mass of M and
to      its
        velocity, whereas    reality the friction

shape      of   AEF,
                   prevents A B recording any lateral motions,
since the motion of A B parallel to itself is so small as to be im
perceptible. C D turns about the pin C, and is prolonged to G,
where it is attached by a pivot to an eye rigidly attached to
the ball: G CD therefore records lateral motions in one direc
tion, say north-south; but is not effected by east-west motions
or by vertical motions of the ball, as these latter only cause
the pin C to move vertically in the slot.      The third arm, not
shown in the figure, by a somewhat similar arrangement of
levers, only records east-west motions.       All the motions are
recorded on one plane, on the same band of paper; so that the
curves would be somewhat as shown in fig. 6. Drawing any
line A B at right angles to the motion of the paper, we see that
at that moment of time the ball was moving from south to
north, from west to east, and from up to down; and from the
shape of the curves we can determine the position, velocity,
and acceleration in magnitude and direction of the ball at that
or any other instant of time: the complete law of the motion
of the ball is therefore recorded. Should the box be slightly
tilted and some of the springs elongated or shortened durin
the disturbance, then the motions will not be strictly north
south, east-west, &c.; but it is evident that this cannot pro
duce any serious discrepancy in the indications unless the
earthquake motions be exceedingly violent, and when this is
the case it will not be very difficult to eliminate the errors.
    It is evident the points B and D may be above the ball in
stead of below it as in the figure; and this arrangement would
be preferable when we wish to surround the ball with a liquid,
as the paper could then be kept quite clear of the liquid.

   Mr. Mallet is of opinion that there is no turning action of the
ground during earthquakes; but it is possible this conclusion
may be perhaps a little premature, since any explanation that
has been given of the observed twisting of columns, based on
considerations of the attachment at the base, might also apply
to the twisting of rock in                  its
                                natural position. To test whether
any such turning action really exists, simple apparatus, such      a

    The observations of Mr. Mallet, made at the scene of the
Neapolitan earthquake of 1857, are of great value in connexion
with the science of seismometry, which owes                 growth                                     its                  in  a

VI.    Note on the Examination of certain Alloys by the Aid of the
    Induction-balance.        By W. CHANDLER RoberTs, F.R.S.,
     Chemist of the Mint".
                                  [Plate VI.]
             weeks since, Prof. Hughes showed me that equal
SOME    volumes of    various metals give widely different indica
tions with the induction-balance.              It appeared probable that
a careful examination of a definite series of alloys would prove
to be of interest; and as Prof. Hughes at once gave me the
most generous assistance, teaching me the manipulation and
controlling the results,       I am able to submit the following ob
servations to the      Society.
    The relative values of different metals as indicated by the
induction-balance were given by Prof. Hughes in a paper read
before the Royal Society on the 15th of May last. They do
not accord with the values usually accepted as representing
the relative conductivity of the respective metals; and this
being the case, it became important to ascertain what relation
the indications given by alloys, when under the influence of
the induced current, bear to their electric conductivities, which
afforded Matthiessen a basis for dividing them into groupsf.
    A series typical of each group was therefore taken; the con
stituent metals were melted together in the requisite propor
                                               im.
tions; and the thoroughly mixed alloys were carefully rolled
to a uniform thickness, usually 1-3                     Disks 24 millims.
in diameter were then cut with the same                 punch; and these
disks were placed in succession on one side of the balance, so
that their bases lay exactly on a line midway between the pri
 mary and secondary coils, this having been found to be the
 plane of maximum force. The respective values of the alloys
 were ascertained either by introducing the sonometer into
 circuit, or by superposing a graduated wedge-shaped scale of
 zinc over the opposing coil        .#.     balance, as has already been
 explained by Prof. Hughes.
     The alloys of Lead and Tin were selected as an example of
 Matthiessen's first group.         The results are recorded in the fol
 lowing Table, and are graphically indicated in the curve No. 1,
 Plate   vi.     The readings are those of the zinc scalef.
                                                             ...}.
     The Gold-Silver alloys, representing the second group, pre
 sented no difficulty of manipulation; and the
 were made on disks 1-3 millim. thick and 24 millims. in dia
    * Communicated     by the Physical Society.
    t British-Association Report,    1863, p. 37.
    f The   use of a scale of greater accuracy than the one employed may
 slightly alter some of the figures, but it can hardly change the general
 nature of the curves.

meter.              The results are given in the Table and in curve
No.    II.
   The alloys of Tin and Copper, taken as representative of
the third group, are peculiar. Their tints and fractures are
widely different; and the series is interesting as having various
industrial applications. As many of them are too brittle to roll,

   If the  curves for Lead-Tin and Gold-Silver are compared
with those given by Matthiessen" for the same alloys, their
similarity will at once be evident. On the other hand, the
induction-balance curve of the Tin-Copper series, while bear
ing some general resemblance to Matthiessen's curve of con
ductivity, differs essentially from it in certain parts. Mat
thiessen's curve falls rapidly from 93 (the conductivity of
pure copper) to 9 (that of the alloy containing 85 volumes
per cent. of copper). It then passes horizontally in a line which
is approximately straight to 13, the conductivity of Tin.
    Some light would appear to be thrown on the difference
between the two curves by the work of M. Alfred Richf on
the density of alloys of copper and tin.            He showed that
copper and tin contract in alloying, the contraction being
regular from pure tin up to the alloy containing 38 per cent. of
tin, the density of which is higher than that of pure copper.
M. Rich's experiments were conducted on alloys both in the
form of powder and ingots; the latter have alone been given
in the curve marked with his name on the Plate; and the rela
tion between the two curves, especially at the points a,                                                 a',   b,

end is reduced, the loss of current through the fault being
º
greater than the increase in the current leaving the sending
end. Another effect is to increase the speed at which signals
can be made through the cable. A cable may be considered
electrically as a long cylindrical condenser, or as a conductor
having a great number of condensers of small capacity con
         at equidistant points to it on the one side and to earth
on the other. When an electromotive force is applied at one
end, to establish a permanent current in the circuit these con
densers have to be charged, an operation requiring time for
its fulfilment; and before the current can cease when the elec
tromotive force is removed, the charge must be got rid of:
in fact, the current results from the discharge of the cable's
electricity. If there is a fault, the discharge of the cable is
facilitated; for there is not only a smaller quantity of electri

would not deteriorate, and would considerably accelerate the
speed of working.      The best position for a single fault would
be the centre of the line; and perhaps 33 of the line's resistance
would not be too low for the fault.

of the    above equation      (1). When there are faults, each of
the sections into which       they   divide the cable has a solution of
the above form. In the case of a single fault, there are four
conditions (namely, two for the fault and one for each end of
the line) which suffice to determine the eight constants.            But
to determine the maximum strength of the received current,
it is only necessary to find the sum of the squares of two of
the constants.      This shortens the labour, which is again greatly
shortened     by  neglecting    e-" in comparison with 1.

quantity of the vapour from the gaseous to the liquid state
sufficient to cover the surface a few molecules deep. The mo
lecular attraction seems to be very slight in gases, where the
molecules are ten or fifteen molecular diameters apart. To
get some idea of the amount of work done in compressing one
gramme of oxygen to the liquid state, we may consider that in
 the union of one gramme of hydrogen with eight grammes of
 oxygen 34,462 units of heat are produced. It matters not
that the condensation is brought about by the energy of che
 mical separation rather than by the work done in pressing
 them together in a cylinder.
    The superficial energy of platinum is 169.4 metre-grammes
 per square metre, or 01694 per square centimetre, equal to
 '00004 of a unit of heat. The proportion

IX.   On a new Form of Spectrometer, and on the Distribution

       HAVE   invented a spectrometer which,       think, opens a I
      new and     interesting field to those who are engaged in
spectrum-analysis.
   The ordinary spectroscope is occupied with the frequency
of aether-vibrations or wave-lengths. That which         am about     I
to describe has a different function.       It deals with the                   in
tensity or brilliancy of light.    It depends on the well-known
optical principle that a light becomes invisible when it is in
presence of another light about sixty-four times more brilliant.
   In some researches published by me in 1847, on the pro
duction of light by heat, or the incandescence of bodies, I used
this method as a photometer, and became sensible of         value.        its

tinguishing flame be at a suitable distance, the whole spectrum
may be discerned.            As that distance is shortened, first the
violet and then the other more refrangible colours in their
descending order disappear, and at length in the steadily                       in
creasing effulgence the red alone remains. The yellow never
stands out conspicuously, as might have been expected.
     This is scarcely consistent with the assertion that the yellow
is the brightest of the rays.             The red is plainly perceptible
long after the yellow has gone.                 There is a greenish tint
emitted by gas-light that disappears a little previously to the
extinction of the red.
     From these observations         I think that the luminous intensity
of the coloured        spaces   has a relation to the compression or
condensation       that the prism is impressing upon them.                It
may be that, properly considered, the intrinsic intensity of
the light is the same for all.           In this we must always bear in
mind the      physiological    peculiarities    of the eye.
     The   foregoing    statement is      perhaps   sufficiently explicit to
enable any one to verify the facts.                   I
                                                   may, however, mention
some improvements in the apparatus, which experience has
 led me to adopt.
     The intensity of the extinguishing light may be insufficient
 to obliterate the spectrum even though the slit be closely nar
 rowed.       How, then, may the intensity of the spectrum be
 diminished, and that of the extinguishing light be simul
 taneously increased ?           I accomplished this by depositing on
 that face of the      prism   which acts as a reflector an excessively
  thin film of silver.       This,   though it was to the transmitted
  rays quite transparent, increased
  reflection the extinguishing ones.

  through this film and that before the face was silvered, but
  the reflected     light was incomparably more brilliant.               The

   observations can    be    made very conveniently           bykeeping the

as to diminish the extinguishing light, the                   region first
came into view, the other colours following in the order of
their refrangibility, the extreme violet, appearing last.               On

     If    the cause of the increasing intensity of light, in the
prismatic spectrum, from the more to the less refrangible
        be the compression exercised by the prism on the
coloured spaces, increasing as the refrangibility is less, we
ought not to find any such                in the diffraction
spectrum. In this the coloured spaces are arranged uniformly
and equally in the order of their wave-lengths. An extin
guishing light ought to obliterate them             the same                   all   at
moment.

                                   General Conclusions.
   1st.   In the prismatic spectrum the luminous intensity                                  in
creases   from the more to the less refrangible spaces, its
maximum being not in the yellow but in the red. This is due
to the action of the prism, which narrows and as it were con
denses the coloured spaces more and more as we pass towards
the red, increasing the intensity of the light as it does that of
the heat.
   2nd. In the grating or diffraction-spectrum the luminous
intensity is equal in                all
                               the visible regions,           the colours       all
being simultaneously obliterated                     by
                                                extinguishing light.

   There are hence two causes which must not be overlooked

I    think, bearing        mind the correlation
                               in                         light and heat,  of

                     ON        THE ELECTRIC LIGHT.                               BY   J.   JAMIN.
I    HAVE the honour to present to the Academy a pattern of elec
     tric burner reduced to the simplest form possible. The two car
bons are maintained parallel by two insulated copper tubes separated
by an interval of 2 or 3 millims., in which they slide with friction,
and which serve at the same time to direct them and to bring the
current.      They are surrounded by a directing circuit composed of
five or six helices coiled upon a thin rectangular frame 40 centims.
in length and 15 centims. wide.                                   I
                                          have explained how this circuit,
traversed by the same current as the carbons and in the same
direction, brings and fixes the electric arc at the extremity of the
    ints.
    The lighting takes place automatically.          For this purpose the
two extremities of the carbons are wrapped round with a thin
caoutchouc band, which presses them to one another; a small piece
of iron wire is then insinuated between them, or a little above,
which puts them into communication at one point only.                  As soon
as the circuit is closed the current passes through this wire, makes
it red-hot, and melts the caoutchouc; the two carbons, having
again become free, separate, aud the arc is set up with a sort of
explosion.      Carbons can be employed of any size up to 8 millims.
diameter. At this limit the wear does not exceed 8 centims. per
hour. As it goes on, the points approach the supporting tubes;
but they can be from time to time brought back to their initial po
sition by sliding the carbons in the tubes by a common movement,
without extinguishing them. In future applications an easily de
vised mechanism will perform this office; and as M. Carré manu
factures carbons the length of which reaches 1 metre, the lamp can
remain lighted during twelve hours, which exceeds all needs.                 It
will be remarked that the carbons are not separated by any insula
ting material, that it is not necessary to first break off their points,
            fix        their base, nor
                               at                                  their point

dielectrics, by the application of electric forcef.    In this paper
I  propose to offer some notes of a later and more extended
series of experiments on the same subject.           The methods
applied are, for the most part, much the same in principle now
as formerly; but my means of observation have been greatly
amplified and improved, chiefly by assistance from the Govern
ment Fund.      I  begin with the construction of the most im
portant part of the apparatus.

a good many repetitions of this operation are sometimes re
quired before the charge is sensibly free from specks of solid
matter.
    When the cell has to be charged with a new liquid, the
press is unscrewed, the planks and panes are removed, the
faces of the block are cleaned, two clean panes are laid against
the mouths of the tunnel, and held there while the cell is
thoroughly         rinsed     with a proper solvent.                The panes
are     removed,     the faces of the block are            again   cleaned,   two
clean panes are placed as before, and the rinsing is re
   eated.      Half-a-dozen thorough rinsings with ether and alco
   ol are generally sufficient to prepare the cell perfectly for any
new liquid.

 (8). It would be rash to assert that there is no considerable
 discharge of electricity through the cell in the course of that
experiment. On the contrary, I think that when the wires
 are in position and the machine working, there is a certain
quantity of convective discharge through the liquid.                 But the
present observation shows, to a certainty, that the shell of                                          bi
sulphide in the cell, though not more than one eighth of an
inch thick, is able to keep the two inner balls at a large
difference of potentials, a larger difference than would be
supported under similar conditions by more than an inch of
air. The liquid is therefore a good insulator; and the resto
ration of the light by electrization is due, in              probability,   all                       to
electrostatic inductive action      through     the   liquid.    Up      this                to

observer sits      atthe polariscope, and the machine            worked              is               at
a   moderate rate.
   The first thing observed         broad horizontal band, very dim
                                        is  a

and darkens        by

                                        it   is                                                       of
that   part   ofthe flame  having  disappeared.     As the potential
still rises the flame   begins    reappear

at  the centre      ofthe band.    The  patch  brightens  and widens
gradually till the one band along the axis         clearly broken   is                                up
into two, lying symmetrically                     on
                                         opposite sides      the axis,               of

                Observations on various Liquids.               93
and concave to each other. As the potential still rises, the
bands move symmetrically outwards from the axis, dividing
the flame into three large segments which are sensibly of equal
brightness. And when the electric action is at the strongest,
near spark-discharge through the liquid, the bands cross the
flame at points very little, if so much as, outside of the cylin
der which envelops the two balls. The bands are still          in
tensely black and well-defined where they cross the flame; and
they are quite distinct in their whole course, as fine arches
resting on the two balls, and spanning the intermediate field.
When the machine is stopped, and the potential falls to zero
more or less slowly, the optical effect passes through the same
phases, but of course in reversed order.
   12. This fine experiment presents a case of what is known
in optics as the cross duplication of positive uniaxal plates,
the axis of the compensating slip being vertical, and that of
the liquid plate horizontal.     The birefringent action of the
dielectric plate is not uniform either in time or space, but
increases in time at any given point of the field as the po
tential rises, and diminishes at each instant regularly in space,
outwards from the axis of the electric field; and this con
sideration affords a sufficient general explanation of the form
and phases of the phenomena.         When the flame is divided
by the bands into three segments, the light of the middle
segment is restored by predominance of electric action in the
liquid plate, while the light of the extreme segments is still
restored by predominant action of the compensating plate of
glass.   I  think the following variation of the experiment
worth mentioning as an additional illustration of this view.
               ...,'
    The extinction-bands being formed as in (11), and kept
 stationary in the outer parts of the electric field by constant
motion of the               introduce the hand compensator, and
                                   j
 apply a horizontal compression beginning at zero.        As the
 compression rises gradually to a large intensity, the arched
 bands move in gradually towards the axis of the field, until
 they coincide in one band, which finally disappears.     If  the
 compression be suddenly relieved at any point in this process,
 the arches come into view again at once in their old positions.
 Like effects are obtained by a strong downward pull upon the
 weight which is attached to the         compensator.
    13. These   extinction-bands,  obtained by electric action
 against the tension of the fixed compensator, improve in      all
 respects with every increase of  tension and corresponding    in

In electro-optic experiments the action of this paraffin is
similar to that of the preceding, equally regular and pure,
but remarkably stronger. The extinction-bands are as fine
in this liquid as in cumol, if not finer. Against a weight
of 4 pounds on the fixed compensator the bands are easily
moved out beyond the balls; but against a weight of 7 pounds
the axal band is barely, if so much as, divided. There is no

other liquid that have examined, except CS, which is clearly
superior to this heavy paraffin in strength and range of electro

above or below it.

                                                                     action ;

 the earth’s magnetism might be based upon the experiment.
 But upon calculating the potential of the earth required to
 produce the effect,       I found that it was entirely too great to
 exist without     producing     violent perturbations in the
 movements, and other violent actions.
    I   have lately read Professor Ayrton and Perry's publication
 of the same theory; and as they seem to have arrived at a
 result for the potential much less than            I did,  I have thought
 it worth while to       publish   my                      rejection
    i.
                                        reasons for the               of the
 theory.
           first objection to the theory that struck me was, that
 not only the relative motion but also the absolute motion
 through space of the earth around the sun might also produce
 action. And to this end          I instituted an experiment as soon as
 I  came home from Berlin.
     I  made a condenser of two parallel plates with a magnetic
 needle enclosed in a minute metal box between them; for                     I
 reasoned that, when the plates were charged and were moved
 forward by the motion of the earth around the sun, they would
 then act in opposite directions on the enclosed needle, and so

cause a deflection when the electrificationof the condenser
was reversed.  On trying the  experiment in the most careful
manner, there was not the slightest trace of action after all
sources        of error had been eliminated.
    But the experiment did not satisfy me, as               saw there was                I
some    electricity  on the metal case          surrounding    the needle.
               I
And so attacked the problem analytically, and arrived at the
curious result that if an electrified system moves forward with
out rotation through space, the magnetic force at any point is
dependent on the electrical force at that same point—or, in
other words, that                       all
                           the equipotential surfaces have the same
magnetic action.         Hence, when we shield needle from elec                     a
trostatic action, we also shield          from magnetic action.

    This theorem only applies                 irrotational motion, and
                                                                  to

trous oxide, we shall find little or nothing unusual therein,
but only see the fainter and still more faint prolongations of
the green band going off in that violet-ward direction.
   In cyanogen, carbonic acid, and carbonic-oxide tubes, how
ever, there is something suspicious that in one certain spot in
each of them—as far beyond, or violet-ward, of the crossing
place of lines as that is from the strong red-ward beginning
of the tube-carbon's green band, there is a sort of smear, or
half rubbed-out line—in fact, looking more like an impurity
trace than a proper constituent of the chemical compound
under trial.
   But in the alcohol and olefiant gas-tubes (and even in the
marsh-gas as well, though not so strongly) that sort of chalked
place is occupied by a brilliant colossal bright line, so glaring
that it almost extinguishes by         superior light the fine thin

 exactitude than has been usual, we have found,            direct oppo                 in
 sition  to  general belief hitherto:-
     1st. That each               of
                            the three varieties      compound carbon         of

rently from the other.
     2nd. That the feature which           thus peculiaris        carbo                     in   a
hydrogen tube           undoubtedly the well-known and most bril
                         is
liant coal-gas and air blowpipe-flame's carbo-hydrogen spec
trum.
   3rd. Whence we conclude that the pale and weak residual
feature which     peculiar
                         is        carbo-oxygen tube must there
                                               to   a

    which      I    obtained            by observing that the equation could be
    solved by supposing each u of an odd order to be equal to the
    u of the order immediately superior, and also by supposing it

     By an inspection of the above Table it will be seen that
from 5 to 20 grims. the rate of change is proportional to the
amount of free acid, above 20 grims. the rate increases more
rapidly than the acid. This latter fact seems strange ; for it
might be supposed that when large quantities of acid were
  resent the oxidation would suffer comparatively a retardation.
      t this increase of rate in proportion to the acid takes place
gradually and, apparently, according to some definite law, is
      1.

sulphate     to produce the same rate of oxidation as the latter
acid alone. The values obtained would at first sight seem to
represent the absolute ratio of the dynamical equivalences of
these two acids; but on considering the different changes
that take place in the two cases, such an inference cannot as
yet be drawn from this single reaction. . When hydric chlo
 ride is added to a solution of ferrous sulphate containing free
 hydric sulphate, the colour changes to a light straw-tint,
 owing probably to the formation of some ferrous chloride.
 When this solution is oxidized by potassic chlorate it becomes
 after a time of an orange colour, due to the ferric chloride
 formed ; so that, when experimenting with two solutions, one
 containing hydric sulphate and the other hydric sulphate and
 chloride, in the former case we have ferrous sulphate being
 oxidized to ferric sulphate, and in the latter a mixture of
 ferrous sulphate and chloride (having probably different
 facilities of oxidation) converted into ferric sulphate and
 chloride, also an oxidation of the hydric chloride.
     That ferrous sulphate in presence of hydric chloride is
 partly converted into chloride may account for the fact that
 in many cases when about 4 grims. HCl were employed the
 observed and calculated values for y or t were found to differ,
 the reaction seeming to undergo a gradual retardation. These
 discrepancies, however, might, arise from the difficulty of
 making sufficiently accurate determinations of the iron by
 permanganate in presence of hydric chloride.
     Various strengths of solutions were tried ; and the numbers
 obtained for the ratio of HCl to H, SO, were invariably the
 same within the limits of experimental error.
     The most complete series of experiments, contained in
 Table III., were made with the following quantities of sub
 stances:—5440 grm. iron, 1985 grim. potassic chlorate, and
 various amounts of acid ; total volume 260 cubic centims. ;
 10 cubic centims. of the permanganate equal to 0201 grim.
 of iron.
     The numbers under “calculated ratio of dynamical equiva
  lence of HCl to H, SO," were obtained in the following
  way.     It has been shown that b, or, in the first experiment
  with 6 grms. Ha SO, 2357-5 is inversely proportional to the
  amount of acid ; consequently to give the value 1664.8 it
  would require 8.498 grims. H, SO. But this number was
  obtained with 4 grims. H, SO, and 2 grms. H Cl. Hence by
  exchanging 4.498 grims. H., SO, for 2 grms. HCl, the same
  rate of change would be produced.      Expressed in molecular
  weights, 36.5 parts by weight of hydric chloride are equal to
  82-1 parts of hydric sulphate in the dynamical sense.

as almost to defy calculation, especially if the mutual induc

number and in direction, and that, in addition to strength
ening or weakening the field, the passage of the current had
the effect of apparently thrusting the lines of filings forwards
towards the iron disk or backwards from      it.   Moreover the
region separating the two separate distributions    ofmagnetism
on the diaphragm was shifted    on the passage of  the current—

  While experimenting with these figures, it occurred to the
author to try the effect of leading the current of a powerful
battery into the plate and of writing on it with the other pole.
This done, fine iron-filings were dusted over the plate ; and on
gently tapping it the writing became legible immediately.      A
small thin disk of steel which thus had a current passed through
itscentre exhibited afterwards                       a    magnetism distributed                    in

   300 cubic centims. of a solution of rosaniline acetate or hy
drochloride containing .0003 grim. in a litre of water are com
pletely decolorized by half an hour's heating to ebullition ;
15 cubic centims. of this solution lose their colour in a few
minutes.  Either of these bleached solutions will then readily
impart unaltered colouring-matter to a piece of immersed
silk.
  In order to avoid any    possible bleaching effect due to any
alkali that might  be extracted from glass vessels by a boiling

being therefore three hundred times as strong as in I. and II.
When this was boiled, even for several hours, it refused to
bleach; but on allowing the hot liquid to cool gradually, the
colour slowly faded away before the ordinary temperature was
reached.     Repeated attempts to decolorize the liquid by heat

                                       meets with.
     This needs     explanation; even the expression
                        no                                           itself”         “    of

            is       special case
                           a             the above principle.
                                               of                  Another
is Lenz’s law which determines the direction of the induced
current.     Further, here belong the facts that                 solids the          in
cubic coefficient            of
                        compression diminishes             the pressure    as                       in
creases, that the specific heat and the galvanic resistance                                          of
solid bodies increase with the temperature, &c.
   For the present case we may conclude from the above prin
ciple that the resistance         ironof    observed   as      when        by
                                                                         cur    us             a

Thence,       the next place,       follows that circularly magnetized
               a in
                                          it
possesses     greater resistance than unmagnetic iron,                  least              at
if the amount         the circular magnetization does not exceed
                           of
that which the current itself could produce. Evidently, how
ever, we may drop this limitation; for                the circular magne

                be
there      always another intensity

               For this    latter,  therefore,   the above proposition
  olds  good.    But the resistance                       of   an
                                                   iron wire possessing                              a
definite magnetic statef        independent
                                     is               the intensity

of circular magnetization.                                            -
      follows, further, that the resistance must

current the worse the more intense the circular magnetization
is ; but by the added longitudinal magnetization a portion of
the circular is annulled.       In fact my experiments show, in
iron as well as in   steel,  a diminution of the resistance in con
sequence of feeble magnetizings.
   The behaviour is different when the longitudinally magne
tizing force is great ; a longitudinal magnetizing will then
result from            its
                  cooperation with the circular magnetizing force
of  the principal  current. And here the theory leaves       blank.                                       a

        As the expression of the work done by the current in the
    rotation of         molecular magnets, an extra current occurs at
     the closing of the principal current, as we have seen, or, as it
     was expressed, a passing augmentation of the resistance.               If
,    the wire has been previously magnetized longitudinally, and
     is still in that state at the closing of the principal current, the
     rotation by the latter is of course much less.             From this we
     might at first be inclined to conclude that the work also is less,
     which would be contradicted by the observed fact that the
     extra current is in this case more intense.             But we must bear
     in mind that the rotation is smaller in amount because the lon
     gitudinally magnetizing force holds back the molecules more
     strongly than the direction-force, which alone, in the first case,
     counteracted the force of the principal current, but the other
     factor of the product representing the work, the longitudinally

 144                   Dr. F. Auerbach             on the Passage              of
 magnetizing force, is much greater than the direction-force.
 Now, as long as the rotations are infinitesimal, the force varies
 in inverse proportion to the angle of rotation; therefore the
 work of the current remains constant; but when the longitu
dinally magnetizing force is considerable, and therefore the
rotations into the axial position cannot be regarded as infini
tesimal, the work to be done by the current increases, although
                                                                          H If,

an increase or a diminution of resistance.  The value of the

154            Mr. S. T. Preston on the Continuance of
the fragments or scattered parts rebound or glance off exceeds
the greatest velocity of approach that gravity could generate
in them when falling together from an indefinite distance, then
the degree of aggregation after the collision would be less than
it was before. Indeed, fixing the imagination upon a single
cubical element of space containing detached solid masses of
matter, and enclosed by a rigid envelope [other similar cubical
elements existing outside—and the masses being figured for the
instant at rest], it is then quite conceivable that such a velo
city might be suddenly given to these detached masses of
matter that the heat developed at their mutual collisions is
 sufficient to resolve the whole into discrete molecules (or a gas)
 pervading the cubical envelope uniformly, i.e. so that gravity
 is incompetent to produce any degree of aggregation (in the
 form of clusters or nuclei) at all". Is not a less velocity than
 this conceivable which, when communicated to the masses,
 would still leave them some degree of aggregation, dependent
 on the mean velocity of translatory motion ? which velocity
 (though constant from one unit of volume to another) would
 vary greatly from one mass to another in accordance with the
 principles of the kinetic theory—producing corresponding
 variations in the degree of aggregation from one mass to an
 other without affecting the mean state (per unit of volume).
      The case is comparable on smaller scale to the minute.
 masses (each consisting of a number of molecules aggregated
 about a common centre) forming the compound molecules of
 a gas of high complexity.           Here it is a known fact that such
 a velocity of translatory motion (dependent on temperature)
 might be given to these minute masses (compound molecules)
 composing the gas as to break them up into discrete mole
  cules. A less velocity than this is conceivable at which a
  small degree of aggregation is possible, and a still less velocit
 where a still greater degree of aggregation can ensue.              Indeed,
                                                                 tº:
 if the constituents be numerous so as to admit of a great va
  riety of groupings, a very considerable range in the             i.   ee of
  aggregation is possible by varying the rates of
  motion (dependent on varying temperatures). It is also a
  recognized fact here that the degree of aggregation by any
 given rate of translatory motion (temperature) refers only to
 the mean state, and not to the state of each of the individual
     * It is evident that since we are not limited as to velocity, a certain
 (adequate) velocity must exist, corresponding to an adequate degree of
 energy, that would suffice to produce this result.     Of course the cubical
 envelopes are merely used for facility of illustration, and may be supposed
 abolished, substituting for them infinite space containing matter in a
 similar state.

masses; for frequently one of the minute masses (molecular
clusters) may acquire such a velocity in the accidents of colli
sion as to break it up into discrete molecules at an encounter,
these discrete molecules grouping together again in another
part of the gas, the mean state of aggregation (per unit of
volume) remaining unchanged.          Of course it is obvious that
there are differences of detail in considering the case of the
masses of the universe.       For example, in a compound gas,
where the central   agency   producing aggregation is “chemical
action,” the fluctuation in size of a mass (molecular cluster)
under the collisions is limited, whereas in the case of the masses
of the universe, where the central agency producing aggre
gation is mainly “gravific action ”*, the                   in size

that,    if

region of the gas, the mean temperature (per unit of volume) of
the gas remaining the same. One known consequence of the
kinetic theory is that vast fluctuations of temperature may
occur in the gas, from one of the portions of matter (consisting
of one molecule or several) that moves as a whole in the mo
tion of translation, to another portion, though the whole
(reckoned by units of volume) may be in equilibrium of tem
perature. The same would apply in principle to the case of
the universe, consisting of portions of matter in translatory
motion among each other, if we do not limit the scale on which
the principles are applicable; or it would follow that there
might be vast differences of temperature from one portion of
matter (stellar mass) to another, while the whole (reckoned by
 units of volume) might be in equilibrium of temperature.      In
 order to have an idea, by inspection, of the mean state of tem
 perature of the universe, we should require to sweep over a
 unit of volume, containing some hundreds of milions of stellar
 masses (dark and bright), in the same way as we do (on
 smaller scale) in examining the state of temperature of a gas;
 any appreciable volume of which contains some hundreds of
 millions of portions of matter in translatory motion (at differ
 ent temperatures).
    If  it were possible to visualize the individual molecules in
 a compound gas at normal temperature, molecules would be
 observed in various parts glowing at a white or red heat (and
 some in a state of dissociation); and if the state of tempera
 ture of the whole gas were judged of from these relatively few
 luminous molecules, the assumption would be that the whole
 gas was at a white heat. So in the case of the universe, if the
 state of temperature of the whole were judged of from the
 perhaps relatively few luminous masses [which of course can
 alone be visible to us], an entirely false impression might be
 conveyed of the real state.
     If therefore the above suggestion as to the possible applica
 tion of an admitted dynamical principle on a large scale should
 be found valid, it would follow that the universe may already
 be at uniform temperature, in the sense that the limits within
 which there is fluctuation of temperature are indefinitely small
 compared with the collective universe, but that these limits
 are, relatively to a planetary system, very great, and amply
 sufficient to allow continual physical change, adapted to the
 maintenance of life.
     So in an analogous way as regards the state of aggregation
  of the matter of the universe: since, by the application of the
  kinetic theory, this depends on the temperature, it would fol
  low that the mean state of aggregation of the matter (per unit

158             Mr. S. T. Preston             on the Continuance         of
of volume), like the mean temperature, is the same through
          º
out—though indefinite fluctuations of dimensions would occur
from one mass to another, in harmony with the fluctuations
of velocity.
     It      further follow from the principle that molecules of
different densities (molecular weights) tend forcibly to become
uniformly diffused, that by an adequate past duration of the
universe the different kinds of matter must be uniformly dif
fused (per unit of volume) by the continued interchange of
motion, though considerable fluctuations of mixture within
                      .."
ranges less than a unit of volume would be possible in harmony
with the kinetic theory.
     Itmay be              that in principle, in order to account
for the continuance of change in the universe, the existence
of some process of recurrence is absolutely essential. The
cooled down material of extinct suns must in some way be
made available for the development of fresh suns or centres of
heat.    For if this were not the fact, there would be a continual
accumulation of the material of extinct or useless suns in the
universe, and processes of renewal and maintenance of the
activity of the universe would come to a deadlock in the ab
sence of matter to operate upon.        It seems inconceivable how
this end could be effected under recognized dynamical prin
ciples, excepting through an exchange of motion going on
among the matter of the universe, involving collisions and an
alternating renewal and loss of heat: or this seems on broad
principle the only conceivable way in which there should be
recurrence, under the condition that the same matter should be
wsed again.    There would appear to be a simple grandeur (not
out of harmony with the recognized characteristics of nature)
in this great result being brought about by the mere move
ment of the stellar masses according to the kinetic theory.
 Moreover the kinetic theory has been mathematically proved
 (when a large number of masses are concerned) to produce a
system of order and symmetry (or mean similarity of the con
ditions in      all
                parts    the system) which

are bound to believe that some process of recurrence must
exist, whereby useful change and activity are continued in the
universe, and the purposeless end of a changeless chaos pre
vented—and that we should seek for the explanation of this,
not so much with the view to prove the fact thereby, but
rather as a satisfaction or confirmation of a fact we already
had logical grounds for believing to exist.
   That recurring changes exist in the universe seems to have
been the conviction of Sir W. Grove.     He remarks relative to
this subject (“Corr. of Physical Forces, page 67):-‘‘En
larged observation may prove that phenomena seeming to
tend in one direction will turn out to be recurrent, though
never absolutely identical in their recurrence; that there is
throughout the universe gradual change, but no finality; . . . .
that no star or planet could at any time be said to be created
or destroyed, or to be in a state of absolute stability, but that

           NOTE ON THE SPECTRUM OF BRORSEN's COMET.
            BY PROF.    C. A. YOUNG, OF PRINCETON, N.     J.
AFTER                                       I
            several unsuccessful attempts, have at last, on April 1st
          2nd,  obtained fairly satisfactory observations of the spec
      and
trum of this comet. It consists of three bands, like the spectra ...i
the other comets hitherto observed, the bands being well defined at
the lower (least refrangible) edge and fading out towards the upper.
The spectrum is so faint that observation is very difficult, and    I
was able to determine the position of only one of the bands—that
in the green, which is much brighter than the other two.
    The instrument employed was the 94-inch refractor of our new
observatory, armed with a one-prism spectroscope of sufficient dis
persive power to separate the D lines clearly: the eyepiece has a
micrometer which carries a bar thick enough to be seen on the
background of even a very feeble spectrum. The observation was
made by placing the bar so that the bright edge of the band should
be just visible as a thin line, the rest of the band being occulted.
The instrument has also a scale like that of the ordinary chemical
spectroscope; and the position of the micrometer-bar is determined
both by the reading of the micrometer-screw and by the reading of
the scale, illuminated for a moment after the bar has been set.
                  I
    On April 1st got three scale-readings—respectively 99-9,100.0,
 and 100-4, the value of one scale-division in this part of the spec
 trum being very nearly 25 units of Ångström's scale, or about
 double the distance between the extreme lines of the b group, the
 readings decreasing with the wave-length.
    Just before dark, b, in the spectrum of daylight coincided with
 100 on the scale; also, immediately after the third pointing and
 without disturbing the telescope, spectroscope, or micrometer, the
 flame of a Bunsen burner was presented to the slit; and the lower
 edge of the green band in the well-known spectrum of this flame
 was found to show itself at the edge of the occulting bar precisely
 where the comet-spectrum had been.          We may therefore fairly
 conclude that the lower edge of the central band in the comet-spec
 trum had a wave-length of very nearly 517 millionths of a milli
 metre. The observation of April 3rd confirms this, though but a
 single reading could be obtained. The only special interest in this
 observation lies in the fact that in 1868 Mr. Huggins obtained a
  somewhat different result for this same comet.
     In an elaborate paper published some years ago by Vogel in
 Poggendorff’s Annalen, upon the spectra of comets, he comes to
 the conclusion that there are several different kinds of come
  spectra, the differences lying merely in the wave-length of the
 bands. But he seems to have reached this conclusion by assigning
  rather too high a degree of accuracy to the observations. With
  the exception of Brorsen's comet, it would seem that the discre
 pancies between the different results are entirely within the range
  of probable error, and that there is no valid reason for supposing

more than a single cometary spectrum, slightly modified in different
comets by differences of pressure and temperature.
    Itwould now appear from my observations that Brorsen's comet
also must fall into line with the rest.
    Iam entirely at a loss how to explain Mr. Huggins's result.          It
                                                                                            its
can hardly be that the comet has really changed                spectrum                                              in

182               Mr. M. M. Pattison Muir on
another;    Berthollet considered also the masses of the acting
bodies and the physical actions which aided the purely che
mical changes.      A substance with a small affinity for either
of the constituents of another substance was nevertheless, ac
cording to Berthollet, capable of decomposing the other, pro
 vided the mass of the first substance was large compared with
 that of the second.     The affinity of an acid is in this view
 greatest for that base with which it combines in smallest
 quantity, because, if the affinity be large, the mass must be
 small as compared with the mass of another base which has a
 small affinity for the given acid; otherwise equal amounts of
 chemical work would not be done in forming each of the neu
tral salts.
    The theories of Bergmann and Berthollet were antagonistic.
 Since the year 1803 chemists have now inclined to one,
now to another. Modifications have been made in each; but
no new important theory has been advanced.
 . The most important contributions made within recent years
towards the final solution of the problem of chemical affinity
are contained in two papers by Guldberg and Waage, and
three papers by W. Ostwald.
    The object of this paper is to give an account of the results
obtained by these naturalists.
    The first paper by the two Christiania Professors was pub
lished in 1867, and is entitled “Etudes sur les affinités chi
miques;” the second paper by the same authors appeared in
    º
the March number of the present year of the Journal far
praktische Chemie.      Ostwald’s papers, entitled “Volumche
mischen Studien,” are to be found in Pogg, Ann. Ergänzg.
Bd. viii. p. 154, and in Journ. prakt. Chem. [2] xvi. 385, and
xviii. 328.                             -
               and Waage do not attempt to formulate a general
theory of chemical action; they confine themselves to a con
sideration of the action of mass in chemical changes.    The ex
planation which they give of this action is singularly simple,
and so exact as to allow of mathematical deductions being
made, which are shown to hold good by the results of expe
rimental researches.
   Ostwald considers the measurement of affinity as exerted
between acids and bases in solution combining together to
form salts which are soluble under the experimental conditions.
Berthollet's statement, “Toute substance qui tend à entrer
en combinaison, agit en raison de son affinité et de sa quan
tité" (Statique Chimique, p. 2), has been extended and ren
dered more exact by the researches of Guldberg and Waage.
These naturalists have given a definite meaning, independent

      Those reactions which consist of two parts, the direct and
  the reverse chemical change, are most favourable for the study
  of the influence of mass. As examples of this class of changes
  may be cited:—the oxidation of a metal by water-gas, and the
  reduction of the metallic oxide so produced by hydrogen;
  the dissociation of a substance A B under conditions such that
 A B and A and B (the products of the dissociation) are simul
 taneously present in the chemical system; the division of two
 acids between two bases so as to produce a soluble and an inso
 luble salt; and the mutual decomposition of two soluble com
 pounds with the production of substances themselves soluble
 under the experimental conditions.
     In their earlier paper Guldberg and Waage give the results
 of a long and elaborate series of experiments upon the action
 of carbonates of the alkalis on barium sulphate, and of alkali
 sulphates upon barium carbonate; they also consider the results
 obtained by Berthelot and St. Giles in their examination of
 the reaction between alcohol and acetic acid, which results in
 the production of acetic ether and water. From these, and
 other quantitative results, the law of mass-action already stated
 was deduced.
     In their later paper  the same naturalists detail the results
 of their examination of many different reactions, and show
 that in each case the law of mass-action holds good.
    Guldberg and Waage recognize two main groups of chemi
 cal forces:—the true forces of affinity, which bring about the
 formation of new chemical substances; and the secondary forces,
 the action of which is to be traced to the presence of foreign
 bodies, i.e. bodies other than those directly undergoing che
 mical change.
    Guldberg and Waage do not think that a complete account
 of a chemical change involving simultaneous series of decom
positions and recompositions can be given, if regard be paid
merely to the forces of attraction at work between the sub
stances, or the constituents of the substances, upon which the
change is effected; they deem it necessary to consider the mo
lecular and atomic movements of these substances.
    The equilibrium attained by a system in which the changes
                 A + B-A’--B',      A/4. B/= A + B
have been allowed to proceed       is regarded by them as by no

means the equilibrium of a system the parts of which are at
rest.
   So long as equal amounts of A' and B', and of A and B,
are formed in unit time, so long is the equilibrium of the sys
tem maintained.

their proper vibrations within the molecule A. At certain
positions of a and y we may suppose that the force acting
between these two atoms is very small.     Let another molecule
B be  composed   of the atoms 3 and   8,  these atoms will also
perform vibrations within B; A and B will also each be pos
sessed of             its

      2. Systems consisting    of two Insoluble and two Soluble
                               Substances.
    In  the case  of insoluble compounds the active mass of the
substance does not necessarily decrease in the same proportion
as the total mass of the substance present.            Increase of the
absolute amount of an insoluble substance does not increase the
active mass of that substance to any sensible extent.                Thus,
 1 grm. of an insoluble salt in 100 cub. centims. of liquid pro
duced the same effect as 2 grims. of the salt.
    Supposing, then, that the masses of the insoluble substances
are constant during the experiments, these masses enter the
equations as unknown constant quantities, the value of which
may be determined from the experimental data, either indepen
dently or along with other unknown constants.              Under these
conditions, the proportion between the amounts of the two so
luble substances is always the same when the system is in equi
librium.
   The value off is determined for the systems now under             consi
deration by aid of the formula

corroborate those obtained by the specific-volume method.
    When aqueous solutions of              and bases are mixed in
equivalent quantities, the volume of the product is different
from that of the sum of the volumes of the constituents. This
change of volume varies with the acid, the base, the tempera
ture, and the degree of concentration. The two latter con
ditions being kept constant, a value is obtained for each com
bination of acid and base. The normal temperature employed
was 20° ; the normal concentration 1 equivalent (in grams)
of the acid or base, in 1000 grams of the solution.

  It is    evident from these Tables that the relative affinities of
hydrochloric and nitric acids are independent of the tempera

ture, while that of sulphuric acid varies with the temperature,
but in a manner inversely as the binding of that acid by neu
tral sulphate (see Table VI.).
   From these results Ostwald concludes that most probably
the relative affinity of the acids is a constant number independent
of base, and independent of temperature; he believes that this
generalization holds good for          the acids.             all

acids and for bases is accounted for by Ostwald by the hypo
thesis that the change of physical properties brought about by
each substance entering into chemical combination is of constant
value, and is independent of any alteration caused by the entrance
into the compound of other substances.
   The volume-changes which accompany the action of mono
basic acids upon the normal salts of the same acids are shown
to be very small.      The volume-changes accompanying the
action of one monobasic acid upon the normal salt of another
acid are determined by Ostwald ; and by dividing the number
so obtained by the difference     between the volume-changes
noticed on   neutralizing  the base by each acid separately (a
small correction being   made for the action of the acid set free
in the reaction upon        own normal salt), numbers are ob

      On the Distribution of Heat in the Visible Spectrum.                                            203
of the atomic theory. A modified form of Berthollet's asser
tion that the affinity of an acid is greatest for that base with
which it combines in smallest quantity, seems to be suggested
by Thomsen's results (confirmed by Ostwald's volumetric
method) that large affinity-value is accompanied by low heat
of neutralization.
   Ostwald furnishes chemistry with a new method for solving
some of her most difficult problems; and Guldberg and Waage
lead the way in the application of mathematical reasoning to
the facts of chemical science.

     In  none    of the other measurements that have been made of
 the heat-spectra, as far as I am aware, are the positions of the
 solar lines stated; and therefore part of the data for eliminating
 the action of the unequal dispersion of the prisms is wanting.

prisms; and these were assumed to have the same dispersive
power as the one used by Lamansky, and the curve plotted
accordingly.    Two sets of measurements are given by Knob
lauch; and the mean of these was taken for the following cal

differs greatly from that in the dispersion-spectrum, and that

XXIV.    On Structures in an Earthquake Country.     By JoHN
  PERRY and W. E.     AYRTON,  Professors in the Imperial Col
  lege of Engineering, Japan".
   a country like Japan, where several sharp earthquakes
IN occur yearly, where there are between three and four
hundred destructive earthquakes on record, and where over a
hundred thousand people are said to have been killed in one
almost continued earthquake lasting for a month, and which
occurred so recently as 1855, the question of the stability of
structure is all-important.
   When working at our paper “On a neglected Principle that
may be employed in Earthquake Measurements,” read before
the Asiatic Society of Japan on the 23rd of May, 1877, and
which appeared in the Number of the Philosophical Magazine
for July 1879, we were led to consider how the effect produced
by an earthquake on a structure is influenced by the time of
                                                                                                     .
vibration of the structure.
    It follows from that principle that if a number of quickl
vibrating bodies form part of the same structure, they
vibrate in much the same way; that                the periods       is,

    The amount of momentum which has to be transmitted
 through the foundations of a building to the superstructure
 depends on the nature of the earthquake (that                   sudden                  is,    its
 ness and the amount        earth-motion),

hammer, a block of wood is used as a cushion, the wood being
of service because, having an appreciable time of vibration, it
causes the duration of the impact to be lengthened, and so        di
minishes the force acting at any moment.                    the baro
meters in men-of-war are not now suspended direct to the
ship's sides, but to the end of a flexible lath, in order to prevent
the shock accompanying the firing of the guns breaking the
barometer-tube.       In the same way, the lower parts of a struc
ture having appreciable times of vibration cause the earth
quake-shock to be altered in character, to be lengthened in
time, and therefore diminished in intensity before it reaches
the upper parts. Hence it is obvious that if small stones or
bricks set in bad common mortar are our building mate
rials, it would be better to choose for the site a quaking bog
which was capable of supporting the weight of the building,
rather than to build the house
or if the  ground   is firm,  there

the house a foundation of         yielding   timber; or some other
method should be sought for by means of which the time of
transmission of momentum through the joints may be                in
creased.
   Thus, there is a best time of vibration of the part of a struc
ture below a joint, which depends on the strength of the joint;
and if the basement has a time of vibration different from this,
then we should advise that the building be kept low. For ex
ample, it is desirable that houses with ordinary wall-thicknesses

built of bricks set in common mortar should not be more than
one or, at the very most, two stories high if there is a piled
or concrete foundation; but if good cement be                     in
stead of bad mortar in fastening the bricks together, then a
height of two or three stories may be employed probably with
comparative safety.
    Again, the horizontal vibration of the ground is given up
to a stone or brick building mainly by shearing-stress com
municated from course to course, a kind of stress which mortar
is very unsuitable to transmit.        Hence a stone or brick build
 ing subjected to horizontal shocks ought certainly to be built
 with cement and not with ordinary mortar. In fact, in every
 part it ought to be capable of resisting pulling as well as
 crushing stresses.
    Every joint is a weak place; and it is evident that if by      in
 creasing the size of the building we diminish the area of joints,
 we shall be increasing the stability.         Now in large masonry
 structures larger stones are, as a rule, employed, and the joints
 are made of less area.      In this respect, then, may we say that

large masonry structures built with common mortar are usually
more stable than smaller ones.
  It is quite evident that as a concrete can be obtained which
will resist as great a tensile stress as ordinary brick itself, we
shall derive great benefit from making          horizontal sections,                 all

influence asserts itself.

218                         Dr. F. Auerbach                on the Passage          of
   That such an influence must be present the following con
sideration shows.        In the fundamental laws, among other
ideas occurs that of resistance; this must therefore be fixed
once for all, in order that the validity of those laws may have
a meaning. For iron, according to the investigation which has
been carried out, this is a doubtful problem.              Over against
the reflection   that,  in order to make      comparisons     with other
metals possible, the resistance of unmagnetic iron must be
taken into consideration, stands another, that this quantity is
inaccessible to experience.         Since, then, the laws of Ohm,
Joule, and Lenz, &c., hold good for it alone, experience,
which of necessity makes use of the empiric notion of resist
ance, must give deviations from the laws.
   According to Ohm's law the resistance is independent of
the electromotive force".         This of course is true also of the
                                wire;
                                                                                                      it on
ideal resistance of an iron                                     its
                                            real resistance must,      the
contrary, change when the electromotive force, and with                the
current-intensity,      changed.  is For with the latter the circular
magnetization, and with this the resistance, increases                                                 up     to

   So colossal an alteration of resistance (almost 5 per cent.)
could not have escaped the observers, and is moreover in itself
improbable ; it even overpasses the limits of the alterations of
resistance by magnetizings as above given (§ 6).
   A third series of experiments, finally, showed that when the
current passed through continuously the resistance diminished
enormously; there was, namely:-
         At        first    <U+017F>º. ...'.                       5,              5,        5   minutes.

   The current was then opened for     short time, and again            a

WIre.
     Even with new wires there                          is   one    difficulty not unimportant.

determination of the resistance.        As, then, a rise of tempera
ture of 1° C.   augments      the resistance 1 by 0.0005, thermal
influence appears in fact not to be excluded.
   These reflections    Ifirst made after having, as believed,          I
already proved, by numerous series of experiments without
taking this circumstance into account, the                     of the
resistance upon   the  intensity  of the current. Of the results
                                 I
of some of those series will quote the mean values, first,
because at least so much can be inferred from them, that even
after deducting the thermal alterations of resistance others
still remain, and, secondly, because the comparison with later
experiments, which were free from thermal influences, fur
nishes indeed a confirmation of the calculation we have just
made.

of  symmetrically   distributed   experiments   in sets of 5 each:-
   (1D) wi-7.7570, (2D) was 7.7600, (3D)                           was       7.7636;
             wa–wi =0.0030, wa–w, =0.0036.
   Therefore w, 11–w, is nearly constant, and

   This number, it is true, is below the extreme value found
for the effect of the heating ; but the probable value corre
sponding in this case to the extreme value of that effect does
not at any rate amount to more than the half of the former ;
it therefore amounts to no more than 0.00025. It is there
fore established, to a high degree of probability, that the resist
ance increases with the intensity of the current.
   2. Repetition of experiment 1.
            wi-7-7482, wa-7-7526, was 7.7574;
                  therefore mean of 8=0.00059.
  3. As experiment 2 had given a higher value of 8 than ex
#.
 eriment 1, so a third series of experiments gave for it a still
       value ; for the result was:—
           wi-7-7469,            w,-7-7528,                   7-7587;
                                                       was
                                     8   = 0.00076.
  This gradual increase of 8 furnishes a confirmation of what
was assumed at p. 219, that the high values of 8 in the wire
there under investigation might be a consequence of    having               its
been several times used galvanically.

 which two consecutive ones only were constantly used for the
 formation of the differences of resistance:—

                              S=0.00061.
    If this 8 were   solely a consequence of the heating, it could
not but be much greater in comparison with the 8 of experi
ment-series 1.

thermal influences were at most very slight, are graphically
represented in fig. 7.

   This value agrees with the probable value of the thermal
influence for this special case, so far as agreement is possible
in rough calculations of this sort.
                                 I
   Of various artifices which employed in order to exclude
the influence of heating, the following finally proved to be the
most effectual, at least with thin wires. The resistance of the
iron wire was determined approximately, to one or two places
of decimals.     On closing the bridge, there then resulted a still
smaller deflection toward one        #.   perhaps toward that to
which    corresponds  too small a  measuring  resistance.   The last
figure of this measuring resistance was then made 1 higher by
insertion in the resistance-case, so that now, on the closing of
the bridge, a deflection resulted toward the opposite side. Let
these two deflections be equal a, and b, for the case in which
n elements are used ; if these are small quantities (in the ex
periments their angles never exceeded 15'), and if induction
phenomena of every sort are excluded, any observed deflection
s, can be reduced to an additive or subtractive resistance by
dividing it by an + ba according as this deflection is observed
at the taking-out or insertion of a unit in the last place of de

      This again gives a system of simultaneous deflection-values.
Finally     the mean of these two was taken afresh.                      It then re
presents a system simultaneous with the determinations 3, and
can by means of them be exactly reduced to a system of ad
ditive or subtractive resistances.
      Here the current remained closed, on the average, only a
 few seconds; so that a thermal influence could hardly assert
itself (compare below). On the other hand, the extra currents
in thick wires made the procedure impossible ; hence was                       I
obliged to confine myself to thin ones.

These numbers, however, cannot            quite constant.   For the    be

rent must itself lessen that constant. Indeed Robinson" has
confirmed this by showing that t diminishes with i increasing.
But in iron, apart from the heating, a further increase of w
takes place particularly through the magnetizing.      Hence,

                                           have sometimes found very
useful. Working from the best possible extinction, and before
the electric force was applied,         Iintroduced the hand compen
sator, and applied a very feeble strain steadily, so as to merely
destroy the purity of initial extinction in one direction or the
contrary.       e electric force was then applied; and                I
                                                                found re
gularly that the effect of horizontal tension was clearly strength
ened by electric force, and the effect of horizontal compression
clearly weakened.        These results were obtained consistently
many times in succession, and with several successive charges;
but, considering their singularity,              I
                                              could not be satisfied till
I  had seen them under better conditions.
    43. Purified Sperm.—Sufficient quantities of the two pre
ceding samples were given to Mr. Tatlock, the public analyst
for Glasgow; and he kindly had them purified for me with
great care, by a process which is described in Miller's ‘Che
mistry.” As the oils left the hands of Mr. Tatlock he consi
     .
dered them extremely pure and dry.              In electro-optic experi
ment there was now no         difficulty  or doubt about either sample,
the effects being   much    stronger    than before.     By electric force
the light was well restored from pure extinction; and the effect
was         s neutralized perfectly by horizontal compression of
glass, and always strengthened by horizontal tension. Judging
from memory,        Ithought the effect was at least as strong as
the similar effect observed in Young's light paraffin (29), and
a great deal stronger than the contrary effect observed in lin
seed-oil (38).     One thing is certain, that the action of sperm
oil under electric force is of the same kind as that of carbon
disulphide, and contrary in character to the action of every
other fixed   oil yet examined.

   46. The only new piece introduced is a Thomson's long
range electrometer.     W. particular instrument is the second
that Mr. White has constructed of the kind, and it is modelled
closely on the first. For a full description and a good figure
of this electrometer,   Imust refer to Sir W. Thomson's reprint
of  Papers   on Electrostatics and Magnetism.       The unit of
                  *
scale-value of potential which I adopt is one turn of the screw;
the whole range of the instrument is 200; and the highest
potential ordinarily sustainable in the prime conductor of my
plate-machine is          180.
   Three   guarded  wires are led from the prime conductor, one
to the first outer ball of the plate-cell (the second outer ball
being always connected with earth), another to the inductric
plate of the electrometer, and the third to the knob of a
           º
small condensing-jar, whose outer coating is connected with
earth. The use of the condenser is to slacken and regulate
the rate of variation of the potential. The pieces and con
necting wires are placed properly, so as to leave the action of
the electrometer undisturbed. The rest of the arrangements
are precisely as in the experiment of extinction-bands (11),
and as             in the diagram of 6.

   47. Method of Observation.—The plane of polarization of

the lines of force or to the horizon, and the second Nicol bein
fixed at extinction, a weight of one or more pounds is

to one of the plates of the fixed compensator, so as to give a
definite          restoration in the polariscope. Two observers
attach themselves, one to the electrometer           and the other to the
polariscope; and the machine is worked at a proper rate, under
direction from the first observer, so as to give a slow but steady
rise of potential. The second observer watches for the first
appearance of the patch of light at the centre of the black axal
band (11), and he marks the instant of                its
                                                  appearance                by

liminary work, the final observations were not quite satisfac
tory. The effect in the polariscope varied in many cases so
slowly that the observed              of potential were too far apart.
The   compensator   itself was   subject to small irregularities, which
it was almost impossible to prevent or to neutralize perfectly.
Whether these difficulties are inseparable or not from the
 method, and how far they might be overcome by a good
 choice of materials and by very careful work,               I am not yet
 able to  judge.

 results of two early sets of observations.           Columns A and B
 give the numbers of pounds attached to the first and second
 plates respectively of the fixed compensator; column C gives
 the observed range of corresponding or sensibly neutralizin

optical effect are sensibly proportional, and each approximately
a measure of the other.
   (3) As the potential increases, the intensity of the corre
sponding birefringent action also increases.      This is evident
from both Tables.
   (4) The increments of potential corresponding to a constant
increment of birefringent action have sensibly smaller values
at high than at low potentials. This is distinctly proved by
column K of both Tables. It shows that the intensity of the
optical effect varies more rapidly than the potential. Any
conclusion more definite would be perhaps premature at pre
sent, and until the numerical results are more consistent; but
the following is not without interest.

   The numbers for the first three liquids are probably exact;
those for xylol and the following liquids are doubtful, though
certainly not far from the truth. It is worthy of notice that
the potentials for carbon dichloride are to the optically equi
volent potentials for carbon disulphide almost exactly as 2
                                        i.
to 1. The corresponding ratios for cumol as compared with
carbon disulphide are          very nearly equal to each other,
their values   being 1:41, 1:41, 1:38, 1:35.  We infer that opti
cally equivalent potentials in carbon disulphide, cumol, carbon
 dichloride are very nearly as the numbers 10, 14, 20. The
 last line of numbers contains the results of a particular expe
 riment (apparently a very accurate one) with benzol, in
 which the arrangements were so made that the restoration in
 the polariscope was in the form of a star or bright fringe on
 the contour of the positive ball.       By a comparison of the
 numbers with those above them, it will be seen how great are
 the variations that may be induced in the optical effect by a
 small change of conditions, and how great is the care that
 must be taken to secure any thing like consistency of results
 in this line of work.

tensified. And when the discharges through the liquid are
obtained from      powerful Holtz (two
                      a                               plates) which                                       is
provided with the usual condensers, the effect becomes still
more brilliant. These observations agree with that already
made (in 51)          connexion with the shortening
                         in                                    the in                      of

the outer balls       D
                    and       the cell, the sparks through the air

                              as       B           and now, for the
first time      my observations, the purity

the  polariscope  was    some   degree
                                in       lost, the old object (though
seen    clearly  enough)  being    displaced     and distorted irre
gularly.
  (4) Not even with the torrents          electricity rendered
                                                           of                                             by
this powerful machine when worked            the hardest, did theat
continuous   discharge  (air-interval zero) give any sensible
effect from pure extinction     the polariscope, in

 240                           Dr.    J.   Kerr's Electro-optic
     (5) When       large induction-coil worked by one Grove's
                       a
 element was used as a source of electricity, I found it suffi
 cient to connect the balls D and F with the two ends of the
 coil by unbroken wires. The light was then sustained conti
 nually from initial extinction in the polariscope, but always
 with a very sensible flicker. The liquid required in this case
 to be particularly clean ; for otherwise the effect was marred
 by specks or chains of particles, as in the former experiments
 with insulating liquids when these were not very clean.
    (6) The contrast between the central and the outer parts of
 the field, with reference to intensity of optical effect, is as
 marked here as in any of the insulating liquids.              Returning
 to the experiment of 51,                  I
                                   remove the screen PQ and turn
 the flame L edgewise to the cell, so that the object in the
 polariscope is a narrow vertical streak of light extending well
 above and below the balls.         The object now restored in the
 polariscope by discharge is a comparatively short central seg
 ment of the flame, lying well within the cylinder which enve
 lops the two balls, and fading gradually to extinction at both
 ends, but very well outlined laterally.
    53. Experiment.—The arrangements and procedure of 51
 are retained with only one change; the plane of polarization
 of the light rendered by the first Nicol is horizontal or vertical—
       is,either parallel      perpendicular                    discharge

in   the polariscope      now evanescent.
                           is
     In most     my repetitions
                  of                  this experiment, the restoration
                                                of
 from pure extinction was reduced                   extremely faint but

still perceptible flash                                   of to

disappeared completely. The Nicols had only                        turned
                                                                       to       be

The light is restored in the polariscope, and appears (when
the eyepiece S is at rest) as a sharply      and very narrow
horizontal band extending from ball to ball ; but when the
eyepiece is set in motion, the band is transformed into a large
ring, narrow and bright at the top and bottom, wide and faintly
luminous at the sides. The plate K is finally removed; and
the extinction is seen to be pure.
   56. Experiment.—Things being thus prepared, the cell is
charged with clean nitrobenzol, and the balls D and F are
connected with the terminals of a large Ruhmkorff's coil by
unbroken wires. The coil is worked by one Grove's element,
 and gives a half-inch spark with broken circuit.
    (1) The eyepiece S is left at rest. When the currents
pass, the luminous band is restored continually in the polari
 scope, not, however, as a steady light, but flickering or
 quivering very rapidly.    For our present purpose, this is a
much better form of effect than anything that can be obtained
from the plate machine.
   (2) The eyepiece S is set in motion at a moderate speed.
When the currents pass, the light is restored in detached
bands, which are distributed, of course, as generating elements
of the luminous ring observed immediately above (55). No
trace of the ring can be detected except the flashing bands
themselves, these being separated by wide and perfectly dark
intervals.
   (3) Observation (2) is carried forward, the eyepiece being
now driven round as rapidly as possible. There is a clear
change of optical effect, the bands restored by the currents
being enlarged into wide patches, which are much fainter in
their later than in their earlier parts. It appears thus that
 each of the discharges of the coil through the liquid, considered
 as a discharge optically effective, occupies a sensible interval
 of time ; it appears also that each discharge falls gradually in
 power towards       its
                     termination.    There was nothing like this
 widening                                                       any

 compression vertical (55). When the currents pass, and the
 eyepiece revolves         moderate rate, the flashing bands are

 when the   eyepiece    driven
                           is   very rapidly, the bands are widened
 as    (3). The flashes are quite

observations (2) and (3), though they are not now on a dark
ground.
   (5) Observation (4) is carried forward, with only one change:
the plate K is laid with the line of compression horizontal.
There is an evident change of optical effect. The flashing
bands are fainter; and when the eyepiece revolves as rapidly
as possible, the bands are not widened nearly so much as in (4).
The optical effect of discharge appears thus to be weakened by
horizontal compression.
   (6). The compression of the plate K is increased by degrees,
and the observations (4) and (5) are repeated at intervals.
The contrast between the two cases comes out more and more
strongly, till at last, when the compression has reached a
certain value (a value greater than could have been antici
           .
pated), the contrariety is manifestly perfect. When the line
of compression is vertical, the flashing bands are sensibly as
distinct as ever; but when the line of compression is hori
zontal,       are evanescent and, under good conditions, quite
imperceptible.
  (7) When the right degree of compression has been reached
by trial as in (6), #. observer takes the piece K in his hands,
and turns                     the ray, backwards and forwards
                it rapidly round
through a right angle, the eyepiece revolving and the currents
passing      all
            the time. The effects are brought out thus       very              in a
striking form, and are seen        perfectly regular and decisive.
                                        to   be
     An intense electric current through nitrobenzol                      is therefore
optically equivalent           to   tension along the line          of   discharge,     or
to   compression        in   the perpendicular direction.

to be doubtful.

of the fixed oils. Sperm-oil holds an exceptional place, being
clearly positive.
      (6) The influence of density on electro-optic power is
marked and certain in the case of the paraffin oils, increase of
density being accompanied by increase of electro-optic power.
      (7) In carbon disulphide and several other liquids, electro
optic measurements are manageable through long ranges of
potential and optical effect.         The results of some careful
trials in this direction are   given   in 49 and 50.

   (10) When nitrobenzol is traversed by an intense electric
current, it exerts a purely birefringent action on transmitted
light. The action is similar to that of a positive uniaxal plate
with axis parallel to the line of discharge.

and so on, the right-hand number rising to 100 for the bushel.
It  will be remembered that the logarithms are common loga
rithms corresponding to the number of inches in the depth
and in the diameter.
    The number –14.6368 may be divided into two parts,
—a and —b, subject only to the condition that a +b= 14.6368.
And as we propose to use two engraved series of numbers,
one relating to the depth and the other relating to the dia
meter, we may attach —a to the first and —b to the second;
so that the numbers of the first column will be
               33:219 x log (depth in inches) —a,
and those of the second column will be
            66.439 x log (diameter in inches) —b.
And   we have now to consider the details of the two engraved
series which will represent these.
   When we plunge the material scale into the cylinder, to
touch       its
          bottom, we obtain,      inch-measure    the scale, the
                                                 in                      on
quantity    “depth.” But the engraved numeral
                  of                                      give                 is
                                                                               to

or
                         “(33219        x x      log inch-measure)—a.”
Therefore

depth of a cylinder be measured by the engraved numerals on
the depth-scale, and the diameter by the engraved numerals
on the diameter-scale, the sum of the measures will be 10 for
half-gill, 20 for gill, 30 for half-pint, 40 for pint, &c.
   As the zero-end of the scale is always to be brought to con
tact with the bottom or with the interior of the circle, that
end ought to be hard; in other respects the scale may be a
very light rod. .                If
                       the bottom of the measure is spherical, the
measure of   depth  to be adopted is the mean of those taken;
one with the zero-end of the scale resting on the centre, and
the other close to the circumference.

  XXVIII.     On a convenient Source of Heat for Chemical Ope
    rations.   By CHRISTOPHER CLARKE HUTCHINsoN, Assoc.
    R.C.Sc.I. &c."
      OST chemical laboratory operations require some source
 M       of heat, which should be capable of being readily ap
plied and varied to meet the requirements of each individual
CaSe.
   This is effected, in most instances, by the combustion of
coal-gas in an ordinary Bunsen burner. Circumstances may,
however, debar the operator from the use of coal-gas. He
may be called upon to carry out some process, e. g. in the
workings of a mine, at the side of a mineral spring, in the
collection of water, gas, or air, in field blowpipe work, &c.; or
finally, his laboratory may have to be hastily improvised in a
country district (especially in a partially civilized country)
where coal-gas is not obtainable.
   He has then to fall back upon the older and more crude
methods, such as the spirit-lamp, the wind- or charcoal-fur
nace, &c., which are at the best incovenient, and often fail to
give satisfactory results in their employment. None of them
can be readily varied according to the desired temperature;
and they require some dexterous manipulation, or a consider
able amount of attention.
   To supply this want, a simple method suggested itself to
me which    I believe may be of utility under some of the condi
tions above enumerated.               It will be found efficient as well as
simple, the cost both for material and apparatus being small,
in addition to which it can be rendered exceedingly port
able.
   It is well known that many of the common forms of the
liquid hydrocarbons are easily vaporizable, even at the ordi

mary temperature. Mixed with the amount of air necessary
for their complete combustion, it occurred to me, their vapours
would form an efficient substitute for coal-gas.

    have tried, and found to yield excellent results.
     The vaporization is effected by passing a brisk current of air
through a column of the liquid, sufficient being vaporized to
yield an exceedingly efficient combustible mixture.
     The apparatus used is exceedingly simple and of trifling
cost, the liquid hydrocarbons used being either common me
thylated ether, benzol, naphtha, or common alcohol.                        The
mixture of the benzol hydrocarbons, almost universally sold
and known as “benzoline,” is preferable, on account of                                                          its
small cost and             its
                         higher volatility.

even a higher temperature than that of coal-gas; they also
possess the advantage of yielding pure and innocuous combus
tion products—water and carbonic anhydride.         They can
therefore be employed without danger in the   vicinity of deli
cate instruments, which would be otherwise injured by the
acid combustion-products of our impure gas supplies.                    All
who are in the habit of using platinum vessels are aware of
the injurious effect produced upon their surfaces submitted to
the action of the flame of impure gas: with the use of these
flames this effect is obviated, and delicate platinum surfaces
and instruments can be heated or cleansed in them without
injury.
   Experiments made to determine the cost for the supply of
an ordinary Bunsen-flame gave the consumption of common
ether about 1.5 ounce per hour, the cost of which is about two
pence; with common benzoline the consumption was at the
rate of one ounce per hour, or under one farthing.
   In tropical climates, such as that of India, where the great
volatility of ether or benzoline would be unfavourable to their
use, they might be replaced by naphtha or common alcohol.
Filling the vaporizing-cylinder with naphtha and immersing
in water at about 120° F., an intensely hot flame was main
tained from the resulting vapour. With alcohol the same
result followed when immersed in water at about 130°F.       In
those countries where the operator is deprived of the use of
coal-gas this method for obtaining a supply of heat could be
used with advantage.
   The experiments were made in the laboratory of the Royal
College of Science, under Professor Galloway.

hands of government; suitability of epoch; sympathy of others;
persecution; employment as teacher, lecturer, or examiner; acting
as assistant to other investigators; age; marriage; connexion with
scientific societies, and “international encouragement.”               It is
plain that many of these circumstances may be unfavourable as
well as favourable to scientific research ; and that is how Dr. Gore
treats them; but putting that on one side, we can scarcely be
wrong in supposing that these “circumstances” were treated of
just as they occurred to him. There is no apparent attempt at
classification, and no reason why the list should not be made longer:
e.g. why not include amongst the “circumstances” the character
of the philosopher's father, or of his mother, whether he was an
only child or had brothers and sisters, whether he was a teetotaller
or given to wine and strong drinks, and so on 2 The fact is that
there is no end to such a list; every circumstance of a man's life
may be looked at in such a way as to suggest the question, Is it
favourable to scientific research?         But there are only a few                                       cir
cumstances in which this        point of view is not very artificial; and
those few Dr. Gore has neither singled out nor discussed.                  A
careful and discriminating account of the influence exercised by
such “circumstances” as encouragement at the hands of Govern
ment, connexion with a scientific society, or active employment as
a teacher, would have been instructive and pertinent; and this he
has hardly attempted.           But when it comes to the influence of
marriage on scientific research, the wrong question is raised.            In
most cases, it is true, a man can only support a wife and family
by spending all his strength on his profession; and, of course,
absorption in a laborious profession is inconsistent with scientific
research. In these cases, marriage is simply incompatible with
research.
             If,   however, we suppose this urgent necessity not                                            to
exist, the question        then, not what the influence       marriage, but       of

cation, total absorption in a laborious profession, are obstacles not
to be overcome; but as this is quite plain to begin with, the whole
discussion is singularly wanting in purpose.
   It is sometimes curious to notice the irrelevancy of the details
of Dr. Gore's illustrations; thus a propos of poor men becoming
eminent for research, he mentions Hunter, who began life as an
apprentice to a cabinet-maker, in which capacity he, naturally
enough, “ constructed chairs and tables” (p. 263).     He afterwards
went into surgery and made the famous collection of anatomical
preparations.    His case affords a striking instance of genius and
industry overcoming obstacles, and proves conclusively that poverty
in youth is not inconsistent with a life devoted to scientific re
search.    Dr. Gore's way of telling the story is this:—“With the
proceeds of his practice as a surgeon, he bought        the bodies                           all                   of
the wild beasts that died       the Tower       London, and

compared the anatomy             them all, and discovered the history
their  organs.            In
                       this  way        expended more than £70,000

                                                                        the fact                    of

to have written unless he had some discovery of his own to an–
nounce. Such announcements were made in language, if not always
the most polished, yet certainly, to scientific minds, the most
pleasing, because the most simple.    On looking through his papers
here collected, it seems that almost all his discoveries were crucial.
   He was essentially witty, if by wit is meant nimbleness in cor
relating divers impressions.     By viewing an idea from various
sides and  combining   those views, he produced a discovery, a solid
fact.                                                     -
   He never wrote for the sake of writing; nor did he regard
physics as the application of mathematics to hypothetical matter.
His mind was in unison with Nature. He seemed to feel that
theorization should be the servant, not the master, of investigation ;
and hence his superiority in usefulness over most of his contem
poraries.

   Less sharply defined tones can be produced, in an extremely simple
manner, by only two impulses.              We have only to put two fingers
of the hand    together    so that the ends of the nails are level, and then

Val 15: 16.

     OF PRAGUE.
     The author has          made experiments                      for the purpose             of   measuring

directly, by means of a spring dynamometer, the work required for
the induction of an electric current of determined strength in a
circuit of given resistance, and comparing it with that calculated
from theory.
    A magnetoelectrical machine for continuous currents served for
the induction-apparatus,     the electromotive force of which had
previously been exactly ascertained and found to be proportional
to the number of turns. The dynamometer was a dynamometric
winch of the newest construction, provided with a marking
apparatus for sketching the work-curves.       Its scale was tested by
 direct  loading, and found accurate.   The  dynamometric     winch was
 screwed to the induction apparatus on an axle attached to the
 machinery instead of the ordinary winch.
     For the measurement of the induced currents a tangent-compass,
 ..
the reduction-factor of which was exactly ascertained, was inserted
 in the circuit, of which the resistance was measured as accurately
 as possible, and could be altered at pleasure by means of inserted
            For counting the number of turns a seconds' pendulum
 with a loud stroke was used.
     Five experiments were made : in three the velocity of rotation
 amounted to 1 revolution of the winch in 1 second (corresponding
 to 7 revolutions of the inductor); in the two other experiments 1
 turn of the winch took 2 and 4 seconds respectively. In each
 experiment 65 turns were executed—once with interrupted, and
 once with closed circuit.   The difference between the work recorded
 by the dynamometer in the one case and in the other was the
  work of induction expended for the production of the current
 simultaneously measured on the tangent-compass according to the
  proportion of the electromotive force calculated from the number
 of turns or from the known resistance. It amounted, according
  to the very well accordant results of the five experiments, in which
  the expenditure of induction-work lay between the limits of , and
  6 meter-kilograms, to the electromotive force of one Daniell element,
  and to the resistance of one Siemens unit, reduced 0.13 metre
  kilogram per second—a result which comes very near theoretical
  determinations.
      Comparing this value of the work with the number of calories
  corresponding to the chemical processes that take place in a Daniell
  series with equal resistance, we get for the mechanical equivalent
  of the heat, on using the numbers given by W. Thomson and
  Jenkin, the number 428, or, if we take as the basis of the cal
  culation the higher amount of induction-work in the first four ex
  periments, the number 421, very closely agreeing with the generally
  accepted equivalent of Joule.—Kaiserliche      Akademie der Wissen

                ON THE RADIOMETER.       BY DR.   J. PULUJ.
      The paper contains a criticism of the evaporation         theory of
   Osborne Reynolds and the emission theory of Zöllner.

   Were evaporation or the emission of molecules on the irradiated
side of the vane the only or at least the chief cause of the radiometer
motion, this would of necessity increase when the rarefaction is
continued, since according to experience both evaporation and the
emission of molecules must be so much the more vigorous the
lower the pressure in the space occupied by rarefied gas. But, as
we have learned from experiments by Finkener and Crooks, the
moment of rotation exerted by the flame upon the radiometer at
first increases, carteris paribus, with the rarefaction of the gases,
              its                 certain pressure, and with further rare

tions the intensity is less; but there will be no sensible dis
crepancy of phase, and therefore no sensible diminution of
intensity, until the obliquity is such that the (greatest) pro
jection of the diameter of the aperture upon the direction in
 question amounts to a sensible fraction of the wave-length of
 the light. So long as the extreme difference of phase is less
 than a quarter of a period, the resultant cannot differ much
 from the maximum; and thus there is little to choose between
 directions making with the principal direction less angles than
 that expressed in circular measure by dividing the quarter
                 by the diameter of the aperture. Direct antago
 nism of phase commences when the projection amounts to half
 a wave-length.       When the projection is twice as great, the
 phases range over a complete period, and it might be supposed
 at first sight that the secondary waves would neutralize one
 another. In consequence, however, of the preponderance of
 the middle parts of the aperture, complete neutralization does
  not occur until a higher obliquity is reached.

     This indefiniteness of direction is sometimes said to be due
 to “diffraction ” by the edge of the aperture—a mode of ex
  pression which    I think misleading.               the point of view
  of the wave-theory, it is not the indefiniteness that requires
  explanation, but rather the smallness of its amount.
       f the circular beam be received upon a perfect lens, an
  image is formed in the focal plane, in which directions are
  represented by points.     The image accordingly consists of a
  central disk of light, surrounded by luminous rings of rapidly
  diminishing brightness.       It was under this form that the
  problem was originally investigated by Airy". The angular
  radius 6 of the central disk is given by
                                         X.

      In estimating theoretically the resolving-power of a tele
   scope on a double star, we have to consider the illumination of
   the field due to the superposition of the two independent
   images. If the angular interval between the components of
   the star were equal to 20, the central disks would be just in
   contact. Under these conditions there can be no doubt that
   the star would appear to be fairly resolved, since the bright
   ness of the external ring-systems is too small to produce any

    The diminution of star-disks with increasing aperture was
observed by W. Herschel; and in 1823 Frauenhofer formu
lated the law of inverse proportionality.              In investigations
extending over a long series of years, the advantage of a large
aperture in separating the components of close double stars
was fully examined by Dawes".             In a few instances it hap
   ned that a small companion was obscured by the first bright
 uminous ring in the image of a powerful neighbour.                A di
minution of   aperture  had then the effect of      bringing the smaller
star into a more favourable position for detection ; but in
general the advantage of increased aperture was very appa

rent even when attended by considerable aberration.
    The resolving-power of telescopes was investigated also b
Foucaultf, who employed a scale of equal bright and
alternate parts: it was found to be proportional to the aper
ture and independent of the focal length. In telescopes of the
best construction the performance is not sensibly prejudiced
by outstanding aberration, and the limit imposed by the finite
ness of the waves of light is practically reached.          Verdett has
compared Foucault's results with theory, and has drawn the
conclusion that the radius of the visible part of the image of
a luminous point was nearly equal to the half of the radius of
the first dark ring.
   Near the margin of the theoretical central disk the illumi
nation is relatively very small, and consequently the observed
diameter of a star-disk is sensibly less than that indicated in
equation (1), how much less depending in some measure upon
the brightness of the star. That bright stars give larger disks
than faint stars is well known to practical observers.
    With a high power, say 100 for each inch of aperture, the
sharpness of an image given by a telescope is necessarily de
teriorated, the apparent breadth of a point of light being at
least 8% minutes.     In this case the effective aperture of the
eye is Tºo inch.      In his paper on the limit of microscopic
vision $, Helmholtz has shown that the aperture of the eye
cannot be much contracted without impairing definition—from
which it follows that the limit of the resolving-power of tele
scopes is attained with a yery moderate magnification, pro
bably about 20 for each inch in the aperture of the object-glass
or mirror.

   We have seen that a certain width of beam is necessary to
obtain a given resolving-power; but it does not follow that the
whole of an available area of aperture ought to be used in order
to get the best result. As the obliquity to the principal direc
tion increases, the first antagonism of phase which sets in is
between secondary waves issuing from marginal parts of the
aperture; and thus the operation of the central parts is to retard
*.   formation of the first dark ring. This unfavourable influ
ence of the central rays upon resolving-power was well known
to Herschel, who was in the habit of blocking them off by a
cardboard stop.     The image due to an annular aperture was
calculated by Airy; and his results showed the contraction of
the central disk and the augmented brightness of the surround
ing rings". More recently this subject has been ably treated
by M     à.   Andréf, who has especially considered the case in
which the diameter of the central stop is half the full aperture.
How far it would be advantageous to carry the operation of
blocking out the central rays would doubtless depend upon the
}.
nature of the object under examination. Near the limit of the
  ower of an instrument a variety of stops ought to be tried.
           the best rays to block out are those not quite at the
centre (see § 2).
    The fact that the action of the central rays may be disad
vantageous shows that in the case of full aperture the best
effect is not necessarily obtained when                     all

   In order to obtain a more precise idea of the character of the
image of a luminous line, we must study the march of the
function u-" sin” u. The roots occur when u is any multiple
of T, except zero. The maximum value of the function is
unity, and occurs when u-0. Other maxima of rapidly dimi
nishing magnitude occur in positions not far removed from
those lying midway between the roots.       The image thus con

   The third and sixth columns show the intensity in various
directions relatively to the intensity in the principal direction
(u = 0); and the curve A B C D (fig.          exhibits the same
                                          #
results to the eye. A comparison with Table I. shows that a
considerable advantage has been gained, the relative illumina
tion at B being reduced from 4053 to 3205. On the other
hand, the augmented brightness of the first lateral band
(towards C) may be unfavourable to good definition.          The
second bright lateral band (towards p; is nearly obliterated.
The curve E'          BEF
                       represents the resultant illumination due
to a double line whose components are of the same strength,
and at the same angular interval as before.        The relatively
much more decided drop at B indicates a considerable im–

provement in resolving-power, at least on a double line of this
degree of closeness.
  #.    increased importance of the first lateral band is a ne—
cessary consequence of the stoppage of the central rays; for
in this direction the resultant has a phase opposite to that of
the rays stopped.    The defect may be avoided in great measure
by blocking out rays somewhat removed from the centre on
the two sides, and allowing the central rays themselves to pass.
As an example, have        I   the case in which the two parts
stopped have each a width of one eighth of the whole aperture,
with centres situated at the points of trisection (fig. 3).

rise at C is much less.                      Probably this arrangement is about as
efficient as any.
  I have  endeavoured to test these conclusions experimentally
with the spectroscope,   using the double soda-line. The hori
zontal aperture  of a single-prism  instrument was narrowed by
gradually advancing cardboard screens until there was scarcely
any appearance of resolution. The interior rays were blocked
out with vertical wires or needles, adjusted until they occupied
the desired positions when seen through the telescope with
eyepiece removed.     With the arrangements either of fig. 2 or
of fig.4 a very decided improvement on the full aperture was
observed; but there was no distinct difference between these
two arrangements themselves. Indeed, no such difference was
to be expected, since the brightness of the first lateral band
has no bad effect on the combined images, as appears from the
curve E'        BEF
                 (fig. 2). Under other circumstances the                                               in
fluence of the bright  lateral band might be more unfavourable.
   In powerful spectroscopes the beam is often rendered un
symmetrical in brightness by absorption. In such cases an im
provement would probably be effected by stopping some of the
rays on the preponderating side,        which purpose            for

 270                Lord Rayleigh's Investigations in Optics.
 of the present section was solved in the Philosophical Maga
zine for March 1874.     I there showed that if n denote the
number of lines on a grating and m the order of the spectrum
observed, a double line of wave-lengths A and A+8X will be
just resolved (according to the standard of resolution defined
in the previous section), provided

 which shows that the resolving-power varies directly as m and
 n. When the ruling is very close, m is always small (not
 exceeding 3 or 4); and even when a considerable number of
 spectra are formed, the use of an order higher than the third
 or fourth is often inconvenient in consequence of the over
 lapping.     But if the difficulty of ruling a grating may be
 measured by the total number of lines (n), it would seem
 that the intervals ought not to be so small as to preclude the
 convenient use of at least the third and fourth spectra.
    In the case of the soda- double line the difference of wave
 lengths is a very little more than Toon ; so that, according to
 (1), about 1000 lines are necessary for resolution in the first
 spectrum. By experiment I found 1130°.

By $ 2 the condition of resolution of a double line whose com
ponents subtend an angle 6 is that 6 must exceed A+a. Hence
from (4), in order that a double line may be resolved whose
components have indices u and u+8A, it is necessary that t
should exceed the value given by the following equation,
                            t=   .        .   .     .    .   .   .    .    .    (5)

   That the resolving-power of a prismatic spectroscope of
given              material is proportional to the total thickness
used, without regard to the number, angles, or setting of the
prisms, is a most important, perhaps the most important, pro
position in connexion with this subject.      Hitherto in descrip
tions of spectroscopes far too much stress has been laid upon
the amount of dispersion produced by the prisms; but this
element by itself tells nothing as to the power of an instru
ment. It is well known that by a sufficiently close approach
to a grazing emergence the dispersion of a prism of given
thickness may be increased without limit; but there is no cor
responding gain in resolving-power.          So far as resolving
power is concerned, it is a matter of indifference whether
dispersion be effected by the prisms or by the telescope.     Two
things only are necessary:-first, to use a thickness exceeding
that prescribed by (5); secondly, to narrow the beam until it
can be received by the pupil of the eye, or rather, since with
full aperture the eye is not a perfect instrument, until     width        its
is not more than one-third       orone-fourth of the diameter                    of
the pupil.

barely resolved.     A soda-flame was generally used, though
similar observations have been made upon the D line of the
solar spectrum. When the adjustment was complete, the aper
ture along the face of the prism was measured, and gave at
once the equivalent thickness, i.e. the difference of thicknesses
traversed by the extreme rays, since the prism was in the posi
tion of minimum deviation. Care, of course, was taken that
no ordinary optical imperfections of the apparatus interfered
with the experiment.
   One observer, familiar with astronomical work, fixed the
point of resolution when the thickness amounted to from 1:00
to 120 centimetre.      I was myself less easily satisfied, requi
ring from 1:35 to 1-40 centimetre. But even with a less
thickness than 1 centimetre, it was evident that the object
under examination was not a single line. With the same
prism   I found the thickness necessary to resolve bab, in the
solar spectrum to be about 2.5 centimetres.        According to (11),
the thickness required for bab, should be 22 times that
required for D. D. Probably something depends upon the
relative intensities of the component lines.                         -

Sº          four years ago the description of a new measuring
      polariscope was communicated by the author to the
sical Society (see ‘Proceedings, vol. i. p. 152), in which the
advantages gained are an extensive field of view combined with
accurate means of measuring the rings and the separation of
the optic axes in biaxal crystals.              The peculiarity of the                                            in
strument consists in the arrangement of the two central lenses,
one on each side of the crystal. These two lenses are plano
convex, very nearly hemispheres, and, with their flat surfaces
inwards, form the two sides of a box to hold the crystal im
mersed in        oil   orliquid; they are
                             a                                         so

WHi<U+017F>              writing a little elementary manual of mechanics
            lately for Messrs. Chambers, my attention was                                                        di
rected to a certain amount of vagueness and loose language
which appears to be current in modern statements concerning
energy.
     Iventure, therefore, to ask you to publish in your Journal

the   following    remarks on the subject, the greater part of which
aim at    embodying        in a concise form what understand to be               I

not seem as yet to have been               clearly apprehended all      phy                              by

      Every action which takes place between two bodies" is
     1.
of the nature of a stress. A stress consists of two equal op
posite forces (called action and reaction, or force and anti
force), one of them exerted by the one body, and the other by
the other; and it is impossible for one force to be exerted
without the other.
   2. Whenever a body exerting a force moves in the sense
of the force it exerts, it is said to do workf; and whenever a
body exerting a force moves in the sense opposite to that of

electromagnetism, with a comparatively small waste.

                              producing Arago's Rotation.                                      287
  In      case(1) the increasing pole induces in the portion of the
sheet  opposite to itself a circular cºrrent opposite in direction
to the currents representing the poles.
                repelled by       poles.
                                                     this portion of
                                                repulsion
                                                                  #.
the sheet is                both         . The             from the
increasing pole is perpendicular to the sheet, and gives it no
tendency to move; but the repulsion from the other pole tends
to move the sheet from the constant pole toward the one which
is increasing.
    In case (2) the diminishing pole induces in the portion of
the sheet opposite to it a circular current in the same direction
as those representing the poles; so that this portion of the
 disk is attracted by both poles, and the disk tends to move from
 the diminishing pole toward the one which is constant.
    In cases (3) and (4) it can easily be shown that the results
 are the opposite to those obtained in cases (1) and (2) respec
tively.
   If  one pole increases while the other diminishes, both ten
 dencies to move are in the same direction, and the resulting
tendency is the sum of the two.
   The pole of an electromagnet made or broken is the extreme
case of a pole increasing or diminishing.
   Now conceive an even number of vertical bar electromag
nets arranged in a circle with their upper poles in one hori
zontal plane, and a copper disk to be suspended above them ;
and the two magnets at the extremities of each diameter to be
coupled together, and with a battery, so that each such pair
of magnets forms a horseshoe electromagnet independent of
 all                  Let          P,     Q,   R,

   The only statement made by König as to the notes of which
the beats consist, is in Phil. Mag. fifth series, i. p. 425, where
he says that the two notes of a harmonic interval appear alter
nately, but that the observation is difficult in the case of the
octave.   Now in           all
                         cases where beats exist,       possible,   it   is             by

well as the primary notes, until the effects were most distinctly
obtained.                   nodes and loops are formed in the room
for all the notes   present;    and by taking advantage of these the
analysis may be much assisted.
   Curious results are undoubtedly obtained. For instance, the
beats of an octave slightly out of tune are almost entirely on
the lower note.      If  the notes are kept apart in the room, the
upper one appears quite steady; while the lower one varies
much in intensity, whether we listen to it with the unassisted
ear or with a resonator.         With the assistance of a resonator
the much smaller variation of the upper note can be detected.
These two phenomena are not separated by König, but de
scribed simply as a beat. . According to Helmholtz, the beat of
the lower note would be due to the difference-tone, that of the
upper note to the octave harmonic of the lower note interfering
with the upper one. Now it is easy to convince oneself with
the analyzing resonator that the latter interpretation of the
beat of the upper note is right: one can hear separately the
octave harmonic and the octave note, as well as the beat itself.
But the explanation of the beat of the lower note, as due to
the interference of the difference-tone, presents this difficulty.
If  we run up the lower note by means of the siphon, the dif
ference-tone should become audible.            But with the arrange
ments    I  employed no trace of difference-tone could be per
ceived, even when the octave was run up to a fifth and a sen
sitive resonator employed to detect the difference-tone.          The
notes were placed far apart; and the arrangement was, no
doubt, not favourable to the production of a difference-tone :
but then how could it be there, so as to form these strong beats
 of the lower note, if it was not loud enough to be       ...i   sepa
 rately?    I have  only   stated the above with the  object of show
 ing that there is a large ground here, important in a theore
tical point of view, which will repay careful working.         In fact

                       I
 such resonators as have                   or with pure notes equally
 powerful and manageable, is a work essential to the establish
 ment of the foundations of the theory of the subject.
    I have come to the conclusion that it is not practicable to
 carry the work much further with this apparatus without a
 much steadier wind.         For this purpose it is desirable to con
 struct improved bellows. No existing pattern (except that of
 Cavaillé Coll) delivers a wind of any thing like the steadiness
 desirable.    I shall return to this question later.
    Although with an improved bellows hand blowing would
 be admissible, yet it is always difficult to secure uniformity in

what is the motion thereby imparted to the surrounding air?
There is a question how far the solutions of this problem,
which have been given, conform to the facts. The experi
mental settlement of this question is quite possible; and it
goes to the very foundation of a certain portion of the mathe
matical equations upon which the modern theory is built.
   Again, the equivalence of sound with mechanical energy is
at present in the position of a mathematical speculation. The
establishment of this equivalence, with a systematic mode of
measurement, and the determination of the various laws on
which it depends, is a work which alone would constitute an
important research.                I
                             shall return to this later.
     here is another      important   question in aerial mechanics,
which calls for mention among the very first. The whole
theory as now developed, neglects intentionally the viscosity
of the air. Now the effects of viscosity are more easily dealt
with by experiment than by theory. It is pretty certain that
the effects of viscosity are not really negligible;                they               for if

a new importance for this purpose when driven by a uniform

                             Revolving Stopcock.
    There is a large class of investigations which depend on the
 regular opening and closing of a channel, for the interruption
 either of a current of wind or of a current of sound. A turn
 table fitted with revolving stopcocks has been constructed for
 these investigations; and rough results are obtained without
 difficulty; but it is only by the employment of the uniform
 motor that accurate results can be expected.
    The dissipation of sound in resonators and organ-pipes is a
 problem which may be attacked by means of the interrupted
 current of wind. What is the length of a periodic interrup
tion in the wind-supply of a pipe or resonator which just fails
to break the continuity of the tone? The answer to this ques
tion, and the phenomena we come across in the process of ob
taining    it,furnish important contributions towards our know
ledge    of aerial mechanics.

reeds from those in which the reeds are influenced by the re
action of the resonator. This arrangement gives rise to a
beautiful set of experiments having many bearings.            The
trouble of maintaining the constant motion of the turn-table
is very great; and it is practically impossible to obtain definite
results without the uniform motor.
   This arrangement, where the stopcock delivers wind into a
pipe or resonator having the same vibration-frequency as that
of the jet of the stopcock, gives a smooth powerful tone: it is
well fitted for the evaluation of a sound of given loudness in
terms of mechanical energy.                      I

   The conditions of the flow of sound-energy from strings,
through sound-boards, into the surrounding air require inves
tigation. The case of practical interest is that of the violin.
By arranging a sort of skeleton so as to represent the principal
parts of the instrument, and employing mechanical bowing,
it is expected that some light may be thrown on this obscure
subject.    This question is as yet untouched; but it is probable
that the bridge and sound-post transmit a longitudinal vibra
tion, which is communicated to the back at the point where it
meets the sound-post at right angles.    The effect of “muting,”
or  loading  the bridge  with a small weight, comes in as a ques

each other, and affect either the pitch or intensity with which
they would speak separately.                  two organ-pipes of the
same pitch weaken each other's intensity, there is said to be
“sympathy.” When two of different pitch affect the pitch in
which they mutually speak, there is said to be “drawing.”
Lord Rayleigh brought forward some cases of the latter (see
Proc. Musical Assoc. 1878–79, p. 26), in which the pipes
spoke the same note, lying above the pitch of either separately:
this was with open pipes.          I have observed a case where two
stopped pipes “drew           together to a note below the pitch of
either separately.       This mutual influence also occurs with har
monium-reeds. With organ-pipes it presents an interesting
problem of atmospheric vibrations. With harmonium-reeds it
is practically important in connexion with the construction of
tonometers. This subject remains almost unworked.
     Loudness of Sound. Mechanical Equivalent of Sound.
   The subject of the measurement of the loudness of sound
will receive a new foundation in the admission of Fechner's
  sycho-physical law, with respect to the perception of sound
|.   the ear". This law is derived from the admission that
equal fractions of any existing mechanical intensity produce
equal impressions; and it results in the statement that the im
pression is the logarithm of the mechanical intensity.
    Under these circumstances impressions have to be classified
as to apparent loudness, in the same manner as stars are clas
sified as to apparent brightness. The criterion of successive
stages is that they appear equally distinct from one another
when loudness only is considered.          The following is a sketch
of such a classification.
    Audible sounds are divided into ten magnitudes. The first
 magnitude includes the loudest sounds. The magnitudes down
to the fifth include lesser sounds that are still loud ; the sixth
 to the tenth magnitude includes sounds that are not loud, the
 tenth magnitude containing the softest sounds that can be
 heard. The distinction between loud and not loud is very
 definite to my ear; it may not be equally so to others.            Of
 course the    following   list represents only my  own   impressions,
 and it may probably require amendment when considered by
 others.    Each magnitude includes the sounds up to the next
 on the loud side.

  As to (3), showed some years ago" that, on certain sup
positions which cannot be very far from the truth, the energy
of notes of different pitch and the same loudness varies as the
wave-length.     The other conclusions drawn at that time were
based on the supposition that mechanical intensity was a true
measure of the impression on the sense. The arrangements
now described will furnish the means of examining this point
in other ways.
   (4) When sounds of different pitch excite different parts of
the sensorium, it appears probable that Fechner's law applies
to each part separately.    It is quite certain that a single soft
stop sounding the octave below is detected at once, if added to
the full organ without such stops; whereas the addition of a
similar stop, having the same pitch as any part of the sound
actually present, could not be detected by the most experienced
ear.      s part of the investigation is as yet untouched.
                Phonograph and Phonautograph.
   These instruments consist of devices for producing marks
characteristic of sounds on a moving surface, generally a cy
linder which rotates uniformly. The uniform motor will give
to the results of these instruments a completeness which they
now generally fail to possess. It has hitherto been almost
impossible to obtain, for instance, phonographic records of
musical sounds, on account of the uncertainty of the speed of
rotation; and the exact reproduction of such sounds from the
phonograph has presented great difficulties,      indeed, has   if,          it

                         Bellows of Precision.
   The only bellows of precision that           I  know of is that of
Cavaillé Coll": it is expensive; the complete machine costs
£80.      I will state shortly the principles on which the obtain
ing of steady wind from the feed depends; it will appear that
it is not necessary to increase largely the cost- of the ordinary
bellows.                                                               -
   The simplest form of supply is one feeder driven by the up
and-down motion of a handle, the stroke overcoming also the
weight of the feeder. This arrangement discharges a volume
of air into the reservoir with a uniform velocity, which begins
and ends suddenly : the weight of the feeder always causes a
shock at the beginning and end of the stroke.            The area of the
feeder is   generally   equal  to the area of the     reservoir,   so that
the velocity imparted by the stroke to the top board of the
                                                     §
reservoir is half that of the lift of the end of the feeder. This
is the worst form of supply; it is common in very small organs.
    In all cases the reservoir must be made                 one inverted
 and one direct rib. This is well understood by organ-builders.
    The next best form of feed is that common in English
                                                            |.
 organs. Two equal feeders, each occupying half the area of
 the reservoir, are moved in opposite directions by up-and-down
 strokes of a handle. The feeders balance and the                   is ma
 terially lessened. The velocity of the upper board is a quarter
 the lift of the end of the feeder.      But the stroke is still generally
 made with uniform       velocity,   beginning  and ending suddenly.
    The next improvement is the application of a pair of cranks,
 axle, and fly-wheel to the previous combination. In this case
 there are two discharges for each turn of the fly-wheel, whose
 velocities follow the pendulum-law.           The velocity alternates
 between zero and its maximum. Great smoothness is here
 attainable so long as the speed is low; but at high speeds the
 variation of the velocity of supply will be objectionable.
    This inconvenience may be to a great extent obviated by
 using three feeders instead of two, the three feeders bein
 worked by three cranks on a shaft, set at angles of 120°. The
 velocity of supply in this case has maxima and minima at                in
 tervals of 30°; but these maxima and minima are in the ratio
 of 2: V3, or 1: 0.866 nearly. This variation is less than
 that obtained by using four feeders, but it is more frequent.
 The value, however, is so nearly uniform that it is not thought
 that any considerable gain would result by increasing the
 number.       If more exact uniformity were desired, six feeders
 at intervals of 60° would give exceedingly small variations of

same at points 30° apart. The weights of the feeders
borne by the cranks, it is of no consequence that they do not
absolutely compensate each other.
   The escape-valves open into the feeders in the best modern
work; the supply then ceases without noise or shock when the

   The principle here            is that of making the feed of
wind itself steady ;  the plan more commonly adopted has been
to  employ  appliances  to overcome the effect of the unsteadi
ness of the supply.

to drive the molecules apart, and therefore the less will it ex
pand on being heated; and consequently the greater the coeffi
cient of expansion the lower the melting-point.                The two
phenomena of fusion and expansion by heat thus admit of a
common explanation, viz. the attraction between the molecules.
Again, the greater the attraction between the molecules of a
body the greater the external force required to separate them
mechanically, and therefore the harder the body.                                                   If

true, then the hardness of a body ought to bear some relation
to      its
       melting-point.      We            find that,      general rule,               as   a

 classical researches have shown, and for a given elementis, as
 far as we know, absolutely invariable.
    This subject (viz. the reference of the properties of the ele
 ments to their atomic weights) was first attacked in a syste
 matic manner by Newlands (“Law of Octaves,” Chem. News,
 xiii. p. 113, also ibid. x. pp. 59, 194), who in 1864 pointed
 out that the atomic weights and properties of the elements
 vary periodically with one another; and in 1869 Mendeljeff,
 apparently independently of Newlands, in an elaborate and
  most important paper, propounded what is known as the
 Periodic Law (Deut. chem. Ges. Ber.                  553, Ann. Chem.        ii.   p.
  Pharm. Suppl. viii. pp. 133-229).             This law states that
 “The properties                  of
                         the elements are     periodic function     theira                                     of

 atomic weight         his final standard, and represent each

another, and those belonging to odd series also bear great
resemblance to one another; whereas the corresponding mem
bers of even and of the following uneven series, though they
have many points of resemblance, yet differ from one another
in character much more than the corresponding members of
two even or two uneven series.     Thus, in group II., Ca, Sr,
and Ba are  nearly related, and also Mg, Zn, and Cd ; but Ca,
though in many respects it resembles %. yet it differs from it
far more than it does from Sr or Ba. This theory of odd and
even members of a group is well illustrated by the degree of
reducibility of the elements to the free state, those elements
(as Ca, Sr, Ba, Ti, Zr, W, Cr, Mn, Ta, Nb, W, B, Be, &c.) be
longing to even series being obtained in the free state with
comparative difficulty, whereas elements belonging to odd
series, as Cu, Ag, Au, Zn, Cd, Hg, Tl, Ir, Sr, Pd, Sn, Bi, &c.,
are easily reducible.              I

  This Table shows that if the elements be taken in the order
of their atomic weights there are, with but very few excep
tions, no sudden jumps from a high to a low melting-point,
or vice versä, whilst the end of one series of elements runs
gradually into the beginning of the next. Thus we pass by a
series of gradations from easily fusible sodium to almost infu
sible silicon, and thence on to gaseous chlorine, then to easily
fusible potassium, &c. This running of the end of one series
into the beginning of the next is especially seen in the case of
group          VIII.

occurs with the heat of formation of the dichlorides, and also
with the atomic magnetism of the same metals", which latter

    In divisions 2 and 3 the elements on the falling portions of
the curve are electro-positive and electro-negative n the
rising parts, whilst in divisions 4, 5, and 6 those elements
following directly after the maxima and minima are positive,
and those occurring immediately before these points are nega
tive. A well-marked positive or negative character is possessed
only by those metals which have comparatively large atomic
volumes, or, according to Meyer, “the aggregation of a large
mass in a small space appears to be incompatible with the
development of a marked positive or negative character.”
    On comparing the Table of melting-points (p. 315) with
Meyer's curve of the elements, we find that the melting
points (and also the boiling-points) rise and fall as the curve
falls and rises; i. e. they are inversely as the atomic volumes".
The only important exceptions to this rule are As and Se in
series 5, Sn, Sb, and Te in series 7, and Tl, Pb, and Bi in
series 11, the melting-points of which are too high to be in
accordance with the above rule.                                I
                                             have pointed out (Deut.
chem. Ges. Ber. xii.      440),  as previously    mentioned, that the
coefficients of expansion of the elements are the greater the
lower their melting-points, and that there are but five excep
tions to this rule, viz. As, Sb, Bi, Te, and Sn. Now it is seen
that    allthese five elements are also among the eight excep
 tions   to  the relation between the melting-point and atomic
 volume,        asshown

All these eight exceptions likewise belong odd series and                     to

    In 1876 the French Academy of Sciences offered a prize
 for the best solution of the question; but although, at the ter
 mination of the competition, a prize was awarded to M. Violle,
and encouragements        to MM. Vicaire and Crova, the Com
mission of the     Academy    declared that the problem had not
 been solved".     The Commission pointed out that the chief
 source of error was the necessity of making use of an un
 trustworthy extrapolation in order to deduce the solar constant
to the limits of our atmosphere, and that even this was not
the least danger which necessarily follows from extending a
law of radiation, which is hardly applicable to temperatures
between 0° and 300°, to temperatures above the melting-point
of platinum. Thus, from almost identical observations on
solar radiation, Secchi obtained over 2,000,000° by dedu
cing the temperature from Newton's formula, whilst M. Violle
obtained only 1500° by employing that of Dulong and Petit;
nevertheless it has been shown that both the formulae are only
applicable when there is only a very small difference between
the temperature of the hot body which radiates and that of the
cold body which is warmed by the radiation. When the two
formulae are applied to the case of a body rendered incandes
cent by the oxyhydrogen blowpipe, the temperature of which
is certainly as high as 2000°, Newton's gives 45,900°, which is
excessively high, whilst that of Dulong and Petit gives 870°,
which is certainly too low. M. Violle, in order to justify the
low value given      § Dulong and Petit's formula, attributes the
error to the emissive power of the incandescent body; and,
assuming the formula to be exact and applicable even in this
case, he deduces from it an exceedingly small value for the
emissive power.
    It appears to me that, instead of forcing the formulae to show
what they can never do, it would be much better to confront the
question directly, and, by means of well-chosen experiments,
to ascertain the law according to which the intensity of radia
                                                        ...

which expresses the radiation within the limits of the expe

sun investigated with any degree of accuracy. In so doing I
hope to overcome one of the chief difficulties which the problem
presents.     Like my predecessors,     I  have been obliged to have
recourse to an extrapolation in order to obtain the value of
the solar constant within the limits of our atmosphere; but the
method which      I have followed renders it much more precise,
      I                                     I
and think that the numbers which have obtained represent
the temperature of the sun in a satisfactory manner. This will
be rendered evident by a perusal of the present memoir.
   I.  Description  of the Instruments employed in the Researches.
    1st, Thermoelectric Piles.—In my experiments         I have used
 two piles—one made by M. Duboscq, and the other by M.

    The one made by M. Duboscq (No. 1) was composed of
 25 antimony-bismuth elements arranged in the form of a
 straight prism with a square base; the junctures of the metals
 were placed at the base of the prism, and were covered with
 lampblack. The first rod of bismuth and the last of
 were in communication with two insulated coils of wire in whic
 the rheophors were fixed.       The pile was protected by a small
brass case with double wall     (fig. 1) in which were two apertures
                                      Fig I
opposite to two sides of the pile. The pile was situated in
the centre of the case and was kept in position by a piece of

a  rectangular base.       Each base, back and front, was mo

           be as

                                        the case. The interior walls
of   the case were covered with lampblack; they could not,
however, radiate towards the faces                 the pile, because the
                                                                      of

                                     the curve showed that the
thermal effect      the radiation increases much more rapidly

Newton's   law,  which    expressed
                                is   by straight line,     anot ap                   is
plicable here.     fact  has long since been shown that New

                                           of
which receives the radiation.   By very careful series a     ex                            of
periments Dulong and Petit proved that the law        radiation                  of
is represented       by
                  the formula

in which      q represents the quantity of heat, given out by the
                 unit surface of the radiating body in the unit of
                 time

              ti the surrounding temperature,
              a and b two constants.
Although this formula corrrectly represents the phenomenon
of radiation in the experiments of Dulong, and Petit, which
extended only between the limits of 0° and 280°, yet it has
been shown by Ericson that it is not applicable when the                                               dif
ference in temperature between the radiating body and the
surrounding temperature exceeds 80°. M. Jamin declares
that it is an empirical formula which becomes inexact at high
temperatures.     Since, then, the formula of Dulong and Petit
is empirical  and limited in     use,       its
                                       have sought   substitute

                                            in the square     the        to
temperature. This supposition was confirmed by many           my

                       on the Temperature               of    the   Sun.                    331
experiments, and also by those of Tyndall on the emission of
heat (see Pogg. Ann. vol. cxxiv.; also Wüllner, Lehrbuch
der Physik, vol. iii. pp. 215, 216). The best experiments of
Melloni and Tyndall have shown that, as the temperature rises,
the radiation of the body increases, because not only does the
energy of the rays belonging to the primary undulations                                     in
crease, but also new undulations of higher refrangibility are
added to them.      Thus the effect of radiation increases on
account of the  very  large number of rays of different refran
gibility, and on account of the intensity of each ray.
   In order to ascertain whether the formula properly repre
sents the phenomenon of radiation between the limits of my
experiments, and to find out whether it is capable of further
extension, I began by determining the value of the constants
a and b by means of the experimental data of the precedin
Table. By taking experiments 7 and 10, in the first of whic
       y=1167,                T=196.6+273=469-6,                      T-6=1728,
and in the second
       y=204-0,              T=256-6+273=529-6,                       T-6=232-8,
I obtained the         values
            log   a-4:5252152–10,                     a-0-00000335131,
            log b-8:8040253–10,                        b=0.0636833.
  In order    to make sure whether the formula, with the values
of a and b calculated in this way, represents the radiation for
  º.
all differences of temperature between 0° and 273°, the values
of y for intervals of 50° were calculated and compared with
the corresponding values taken on the curve.

  Itesearches on the Motion of the Moon, made at the United States Naval

  THEin object
             the first paragraph of the author's preface as follows:– “For
   several years after the publication of Hansen's Tables of the Moon
   it was very generally believed that the theory of the motion of that
   body, after having been the subject of astronomical and mathema
   tical research for two thousand years, was at last complete, and that
   in consequence the motion of the moon could now be predicted

                   Motices respecting New Books.                     333
with the   same accuracy as that of the other heavenly bodies.        In
1870 the writer showed that this belief was entirely unfounded,
and that the correctness of the tables since 1750 had been secured
only by sacrificing the agreement with observations previous to that
epoch, so that about 1700 Hansen's tables deviated more widely
from observations than did those which they superseded. . . . . . . .
Altogether it appeared that, notwithstanding the immense improve
ment that Hansen had made in the accuracy of the inequalities of
short period, the theory of those of long period was no nearer such
a solution as would agree with observation than when it was left
by Laplace.”
    In consequence of Hansen's tables deviating so widely from ob
servation in 1700, and generally at epochs previous to 1750, “the
latter date was fixed upon as the terminal point of the investiga
tion, consisting of the study of the inequalities of long period,
partly because it is the epoch at which accurate meridian observa
tions commence, and it is also that which separates the period
within which we have readily accessible observations and copious
tables of reduction founded on modern data from that during which
both these requirements are wanting.”
    This investigation, as well as that of the mathematical theory of
the inequalities of long period in the moon's mean motion, were
made a part of the author's official duty at the Naval Observatory.
Difficulties arising in the investigation of inequalities of long period,
it was found necessary to leave this part incomplete until the best
method of treating the subject could be decided on. In the mean
time the author, in the course of a journey in Europe, obtained
several valuable series of observations which he has employed in
obtaining his result.    He remarks that the material most used has
hitherto been least known; also that the most valuable portion of it
is possibly found in the unpublished Paris observations, whereby the
 moon's mean longitude is determined with astronomical accuracy
 from 1680 onward.

on the Value of the Secular Acceleration deduced in this paper.
   For the subjects treated in the sections above enumerated we
must refer the reader to the work itself, in which will be found
evidence of the skill with which the author has accomplished his
task, and the results at which he has arrived.       In section 15, de
voted to the discussion of Deviations, the author, speaking of the
cause of outstanding deviations, remarks that we may make two
hypotheses:–(1) That these deviations are only apparent ones,
arising from inequalities in the axial rotation of the earth. The
deviation of the observed secular acceleration from the theoretical
value 6"18 has long been attributed to a retardation of the earth's
rotation; and by supposing this retardation to be a variable quan
tity, and indeed sometimes to change into an acceleration, we may
completely account for the observed deviations.       (2) We may sup
pose the deviations to arise from one or more inequalities of long
period in the actual mean motion of the moon. On the first of
these hypotheses the author says,              “If
                                          it is correct, the problem of
predicting the moon's motion with accuracy through long intervals
of time must be regarded as hopeless, since it cannot be expected
that variations in the earth's axial rotation will conform to any de
terminable law. Success in tracing the deviations in question to
the moon itself, and to the theory of gravitation, is therefore a
 consummation to be hoped for.”
   In the last section, containing the concluding remarks on the
value of the secular acceleration deduced by the author, he suggests
that “either the recently accepted value of the acceleration and the
usual interpretation of the ancient solar eclipses are to be radically
altered, the eclipse of –556 not having been total at Larissa, and
that of —514 not having been total in Asia Minor, or the mean
                               is,              centuries, subjected

to the further progress of an important application of the resources
of nature.
    It will be seen from the foregoing that have called the light         I
intensity measured intensity.     For if we produce a light by any
source, it will be at once perceived that not all the light produced
by that source can be made available for illuminating-purposes.
A part of the total light will be lost for the special purpose of
illumination, inasmuch as only a part of the total light is in a posi
 tion to act on the photometer, or, which is the same, on the retina.
 Hence we may say the total light produced by any means consists
 of two parts: the one is lost for illuminating-purposes, and may
be called internal light; the other acts on the retina, can be
 measured, and may be called external or measured light.             For
 instance, of all the light produced in one electric arc, a considerable
 part is hidden by the electrodes between which the arc plays, be
 cause the electrodes have a volume, and moreover the positive elec
  trode is hollowed-out like a dome, and it is the highest point of that
  dome which contains the most intense light, which is mostly lost.
 How much this loss in each case will be, depends on a variety of cir
cumstances.       In the first place,                   all
                                           other conditions being the same,
that loss will increase with the thickness of the electrodes.                 The
loss  of light will further increase with decrease             the length

          of                                                    the case       one  in                of

current and the given electrodes, the light lost              the internal light or

one arc, and that the other resistance                                        in the circuit, in which no
light is produced,                     has remained constant throughout.
        If we hada material infinitely conducting, of infinite strength,
 and with a    melting   point at least as high as that of carbon, then
 surely the division of the light would be perfectly economical up to
 any limit, inasmuch as we might then use linear electrodes.
    In practice we can only try to approach this limit. Up to the
 present time there appears to be no better material for electrodes
 than carbon, either natural or artificial.         But this is no reason why
 an effort should not be made to try to find a material for electrodes
 more accommodating to the division of the electric light than even
  carbon. The above, limited strength, limited electric conductivity,
 and limited melting-point of the material of electrodes, constitute
 only one of the difficulties which stand in the way of an unlimited
 economical division of the electric light.

                            is         the practical necessity that lamps,
    whatever construction they may be, have

    their nature        addition in   the resistance    to  the arc. For                      of                             in

of  the lamp consists        the resistance of    the electromagnet plus the of
resistance        the two electrodes when metallically closed. This

cally fulfil the condition, that the sum of the resistances of the n
arcs is equal to the resistance of one arc, to have the same current;
i.e. the former must be made smaller than the latter, on account
of practical construction reasons.
    We may therefore sum up as follows:—The economical solution
of the division of the electric light is theoretically quite possible, but
practically difficult to obtain.      The division can never become un
 limited; but ingenious inventors may nevertheless solve the problem
practically.
    The attempt by inventors to solve the question is therefore per
 fectly legitimate.      If their attempt cannot lead to a perfect solution,
 they may nevertheless do so approximately, and by it tend towards
 real progress in illumination, inasmuch as by their attempts the
 electric light may probably become more and more a successful
 general rival to gas, which at present the electric light certainly
 is not.
                                 I
     Before I conclude, must briefly avert to a paper on the Electric
 Light by Mr. W. H. Preece, published in the Philosophical Ma
 gazine for January 1879, in which the author believes that he
  has demonstrated from dynamical considerations that the division
  of the electric light is impossible. This it certainly is under the
  conditions introduced by Mr. Preece, viz. that the resistance of
  each voltaic arc, or each incandescent wire, is maintained constant.
  But it is unfair to the electric light to introduce this condition,
  especially as it does not at            all
                                      represent the question       issue.     at

 of  each must       diminished, and when number
                      be                                    lights are joined

  parallel, the resistance           of
                                  each must      be a
                                                increased       proportion

  their number,       so   as  maintain the total external resistance con
                                to
 stant.  If    Mr. Preece will introduce this condition into his equation,
 he   will find that theoretically the division         the electric light

of the two mirrors or the two halves of      the prism. Fresnel (Mémoire
sur la diffraction, vol. i. p. 355 et passim) assumes that, in the centra
part of the fringes, the diffraction resulting from this limitation of
the waves plays but an absolutely negligible part.             On that hypo
thesis the fringes should                        all

   According       M. Weber", attentive observation shows that these

consequences are not exactly verified: the relative breadths               the                                      of
lines vary with the distance          the sources from the focal plane

through b a a b and the coil, the latter having been introduced
into the tube from the top. The spring d K, around the lower
half of which the other end of the wire was wound, the upper
half being provided with a clamp-screw g g, was fastened to a
second arm of the stand (also omitted in the figure).      By pro
perly adjusting the rod b h and the arms of the stand, the wire
could be brought into coincidence with the axis of the tube

    A powerful galvanic current heated the wire to the degree
of redness desired. The former entered at g g and passed
back to the battery through b h, as shown in the figure. To
prevent the oxidation of the wire during the process of heat

entering by means of the hose C attached to the lower end.

    Properties, Specific Resistance, and Hardness     of Steel.  347
wards, however, it was found expedient to measure these
forces (as Kohlrausch and Ammann “ had done in similar
experiments before) by a method of compensation, the object
being to avoid the difficulties from the species of polarization
due to Peltier's phenomena. The method can be easily de
duced from that proposed by Bosscha, the latter, in the case
               º
where small electromotive forces are to be measured, admitting
of simplification.
    In the diagram (fig. 4), E denotes the compensating element
(1 Daniell element, = 11:7 Weber-Siemens units), e the ther
moelectric couple whose electromotive force is to be deter
mined, both acting as shown in the figure, C a Weber's
commutator                  for reasons given below), G the gal
vanoscope. Let us represent the resistance of the branch a b
by w, that of the branch a Eb by W +k, where W represents
the large resistance of a rheostat interposed, k that of the re
mainder of the branch (about equal to 1 Siemens unit) inclu
ding E.
     When the current in G is zero, we have
                           e
                                     º
                          E W-E k + º'
     But as the ratio
                       f  is small, and therefore of necessity also v
 (maximum      value = 10 Siemens units), in comparison with
 W+k+a (about 20,000 Siemens units), we may with suffi
 cient approximation put
            -
                               6 -W    4',
 the experimental accuracy obtainable allowing us to neglect
 k+a; in comparison with W. In the experiments the branch
 a b was a small Siemens rheostat.
     The precise moment in which the current in the galvanoscope
 is equal to zero can be best determined by observing whether
 the needle on closing and opening the circuit remains at rest.
 This, however, is only possible when the opposed currents
 from e and E which pass through the galvanoscope are closed
 simultaneously.     To accomplish this, the little cups at the end
 of the rods 1 and 2 of the commutator were quite filled with
 mercury, those of 3 and 4 only partially.         By this device, on
 closing, C, and C, are first brought into contact, and the cur
 rent E C, C, b a W E, not passing through the galvanometer,
  comes into action ; in the next moment (Cs and C, being
 joined) the current from e and the partial current from E. re
  ferred to are closed simultaneously.       In this way also induc

could be conveniently made by the same observer.
              V.    Determination           of the Specific              Resistance.
     For determining the specific                       resistance           of steel rods, use
was made of a Wheatstone-Kirchhoff's                                     bridge.     An appro
priate mercury commutator allowed the observer to inter
change the unknown resistances without altering the value
of those belonging to the bridge proper. Thermoelectric dis
turbances were avoided as far as possible by closing the cur
rent (one Smee with large resistance) only for very short
intervals of time. Finally they were eliminated completely
by replacing the hydroelectromotive force by a Weber's
magneto-inductor *. The resistances of              rods were deter       all
mined    in terms        of   to an
                           arbitrary standard     (0.0312 Siemens        8
unit   at0°), chosen      correspond       magnitude with the un

known resistances. The galvanometer used was the one already
mentioned above.
   As the resistances                 to    be
                                    measured were         very small                 all
(0-1     0-01 Siemens unit), great care had

Imercury.
  The   ºncient length     was determined by deducting from
the total length that of the amalgamated ends.  For the mea
surement of the diameter, use was made of the microscope;
a determination of this dimension from known length, weight,
and specific gravity was impracticable, inasmuch as the use of
the pycnometer, which alone would have given sufficiently
accurate results, would have compelled me to break the rods.

      Properties, Specific Resistance, and Hardness                         of Steel.          351
    The Bunsen cups were introduced without altering the                                       re
maining parts of the circuit. The length of the wire heated
was not in all cases the same.

of 1878; temperature of the room very constant, and at about
20°, this, as          observed, being nearly the same as t, the

temperature of the water in the colder receiver. The method
of compensation was employed throughout. The determina
tion of T was effected by a             normal thermometer (gra
duated in  0°1),  that of t by an ordinary  instrument (graduated
in 0°2), which had, however, been carefully compared with
the former.

                             the difference of temperature of the
ends of the steel rod is  given  under T, the corresponding elec
tromotive force for the elements copper-steel under E.; a and
A are constants which satisfy the equation E. = at—81*.
These were calculated by first computing their proximate
values out of two distant observations, and then adding to
them corrections deduced from five of the most satisfactory
observations by the method of least squares.

   The experiments now following, under the heads C and D,
have more a descriptive character than one of precise measure
ment; the results are therefore given with one decimal less.
For the determination of T. E. H. the rods coming under
these heads were compared indirectly with the rod VIII.
(Table II.), for the T. E. H. of which the number 0:000069
(as above found) was assumed.

millims.       These were hardened by the aid of a blast-lamp.

 In this way the rod could be transferred with great rapidity
 out of the flame into the water.

we derive that the thermoelectric                            position             of   steel progresses
continuously with      degree  itshardness, or,    of other words,                     in
thermoelectric and mechanical hardness are direct functions
one of another.
   This statement involves the assumption that rod cannot                                  a
pass from the glass-hard (maximum)            the soft state (mini      to
mum) without passing through every intermediate stage—or
that,     by

           each case currents from   apex     base through warm,    to
thus  harmonizing    with the  previous   experiments.      Near the
points only the results became uncertain. On bringing toge
ther the cones with the rod [IV] (Table VI.), the points were
found thermoelectrically harder, the bases softer, than the
former. On the other hand, the point              fine needle pre    of   a

fine point therefore was apparently softer           rod [IV].           H.

                      º
of the ice wedge to the parts near the base generated a current
from thin to thick through warm, to parts near the apex a
current in the opposite direction; finally, between these a
position was            at which the application of the ice wedge
produced no current at all. This occurred at parts about
1.5 millim. in diameter.       The other cone gave like results.
    4. When the bases of two similar cones of the same mate
rial are connected with the galvanometer and their apices
brought into contact, upon warming the latter, a current in one
direction or another will be produced—this from the fact that
the points are rarely equally hard. Experiment shows, how

become more complicated.
   Furthermore, suppose the ends of a thick glass-hard cylinder
to be kept at temperatures T and t (T-t). In this case,
since each of the infinitesimally thin cylindrical shells has a
particular T. E. H. corresponding to                                    its

 364      Dr. C. Barus on      the Relation   between the Thermoelectric
      The minimum values of T. E. H. (obtained by cooling the
 red-hot bar as slowly as possible) of different kinds of steel"
 and of soft iron are therefore approatimately the same ; whereas
  the maximum value of this constant (obtained by cooling the
 highly heated bar as rapidly as possible) differ enormously,
 this difference being a direct function of the quantity of carbon
 cantained.
                                             º
     f. Sir W. Thomson f has shown that in a thermoelement
  consisting of magnetized and unmagnetized steel of the same
 hardness and form, thermo-currents due only to magnetic
 difference can be generated.          The direction of these currents
 was found to be in one case from unmagnetized to longitudi
 nally magnetized through warm, in another from transversely
 magnetized to unmagnetized through warm, therefore also
 from transversely to longitudinally                       through warm.
     For the    purpose    of informing     myself  of the magnitude of
 the thermo-difference thus        produced,    the following   experiment
 was made:–A soft rod              (I.,  Table II.) was tested for its
 electromotive force when combined with copper (as described
 above, p. 348), and the locus of the equation E, = ar—&r” con
 structed from fifteen very carefully made observations.
     Hereupon a large magnetic battery weighing 40 lbs. was so
 placed that each of the ends of the horseshoe touched a re
                                           ..f
 ceiver. The distance between the poles of the magnet and
 the corresponding ends of the                    rod was thus about 5
 centims. A second series of fifteen observations was now
 made.      Upon comparing the locus of the latter with that of
 the    former,   the two curves coincided so completely that no
 influence could be discerned.             Herefrom we conclude that
 the thermoelectric effect due to a difference of magnetic state
 may, in comparison with those which can be produced by a
 difference in hardness, be completely neglected.
       . A very curious analogy was found in comparing the re
 sults at which Frommef arrived, in studying the specific gra
 vity of differently tempered steel, with the T. E. H. of similar
rods as found in my experiments.                 Dr. Fromme, if infer I
 correctly, limited his experiments to rods whose diameter was
 greater than 2 millims, and less than 7 millims.               His results
are contained in the following Table, the volume of the soft
bar being put = unity.
    * Steel is here used as distinguished from iron only by containing a
greater proportion of carbon.     No attention has been paid in this paper to
the effects of P, S, Si, Mn, &c., so often present in both. -

consideration that the results were obtained from different
material, the parallelism observable is striking. To the ve
large difference between glass-hard and
when compared with the much smaller                      between
yellow and blue, blue and soft, as seen in both observations,                              I
would once more call attention. The fact that glass-hard rods
can be considerably annealed at comparatively low tempera
tures, must be regarded as an adequate indication of their un
natural strained condition.
   A second result of Fromme, that the specific gravity of thin
rods suffers greater loss by glasshardening than that of thick
rods, also harmonizes with the conclusions drawn in § VII., b,

           VIII.        Hardness and Specific Resistance               of Steel.
     From the data found for specific resistance of steel rods
of different hardness, inferences analogous to the above may
be deduced :—
  a. The specific resistance of steel increases continuously with
its mechanical hardness.
  b. Rods like-annealed differ but slightly, glass-hard rods
considerably with respect to their specific resistance.
                                                                                 tiºn

  c. On comparing                    the values      found for the ratio
we   infer that the specific resistance of steel is approvimately a
linear function of               its

rimented upon the value of                 Tiri.               usually too large—a fact
which is easily accounted for, as the unavoidable resistances
of contact above referred to will in this case have a relatively
great effect, the resistance of the bars themselves being very
small. In the rods included in Table VI. it was impossible to
secure a uniform redness throughout, the ends invariably re
maining darker. As, however, T. E. H. depends principally
on the warm end, and AS, on the mean hardness of the
whole bar, we have thus a second cause for an overlarge ratio.
   So much, however, think           I              I
                                       have fully established, that
T. E. H. and specific resistance of steel throughout their varia
tion are very simple functions one of another. T. E. H. and
specific resistance must therefore be looked upon as effects of
   e same cause, as phenomena having some very intimate
connexion.

  In                      I
        this place will avail myself of the experiments of Ruths
on the relation between hardness and magnetic moment,
these being perhaps the most comprehensive. With suffi
cient approximation for our purpose, we will put the T. E. H.
of glass-hard rods = 120 : 10", that of the yellow annealed=
40 : 10", of the blue = 20:10"; and with these as abscissae and
Ruth's values for the corresponding permanent magnetic
moments (“in millions of                        units,” mg-mm.-sec.
syst.) as ordinates, suppose the curves belonging to each of
the bars f to be constructed. These curves are given in fig. 6,
the attached number referring to the ratio between the length
and diameter of each rod.
   I   will omit the interesting deductions which Ruths makes
 from his data, these going beyond our present purpose.
    From an inspection of the curves we derive the following
important result, viz. that, like the electrical properties of
 steel and       specific gravity,

the normal halogen compounds                               of the elements are a periodic
function of the atomic weights                           of the constituent elements. For
if   the elements be arranged in the order of their atomic
weights, then the melting-points, boiling-points, and heats of
formation of their halogen compounds rise and fall periodically
nine times, these periods corresponding exactly with Mende<U+017F>
jeff’s nine series of elements. The maxima occur at the posi

    As before, the substitution of Sn for Si produces a greater
influence on the melting-point in the case of the bromides than
in that of the iodides, i. e. where the atomic weight of the
    §
negative element is least.
  -
         The melting- or boiling-point or heat of formation of a
bromide is always nearer to that of the corresponding chloride
 than to that of the corresponding iodide; and the melting- or
boiling-points of the halogen compounds of the middle member of
 three consecutive elements of the same group are always nearer to
 those of the first (i.e. the one with least atomic weight) than to
 those of the last  member.       Thus:–
                             SbOl.           SbFr.              Sb.I.

       Melting-point = 1045                   981                901

                     Difference      = 54                51
    The former of these phenomena probably depends on the
 fact that the atomic weight of Br is nearer to that of Cl than
 to that of  I;   and the latter on the fact that the atomic weight
 of the middle member of three consecutive elements of the
 same group is always less than the mean of those of the other
 two elements; thus—

                   Difference = 44-5                     47
                                 P.            As.               Sb.

                   Difference     =    44                47
    We have here, therefore, a good instance of the influence
 of atomic weight on the physical properties of compounds.

    (5) The melting- and boiling-points of the halogen com
pounds of the elements belonging to the first and second
groups of Mendeljeff's classification are widely separated from
those of the other groups, being in fact considerably higher.
Different relations, too, often appear to exist between the melt
ing-points of even members of these two groups from those
which exist between groups (3–7) inclusive; while the com
pounds of the elements which are often placed in the odd divi
sions of the first and second groups are generally altogether
irregular. In the case of the odd members of the first group,
 this may be explained by the fact that it is very uncertain
 whether Cu, Ag, and Au really belong to the same group as
 Na or not, as pointed out by Mendeljeff in his memoir on the
                            |.
 Periodic Law; for he places these elements not in the first
 group along with Na,            in the eighth with Fe, Pd, Pt, &c.
    In the paper above referred to it has been shown how the
 preceding relations may be applied
    (1) To the calculation of unknown melting- and boiling
 points.-The following are instances of melting-points pre
 dicted by this method having been verified by experiment:—

  when the application of the methods of specific heat and

  #.
  the atomic     weight   of Be has been found to be 9:2, thus
             with the determination of the specific heat made by
    mmerson Reynolds, and proving Nilsson and Pettersen's
  determination to be incorrect; for they found a value for the
  specific heat corresponding to the atomic weight 13.8.
     As far as existing data allow us to judge, the compounds of
  the elements with fluorine and also with monatomic organic
  radicals, likewise obey the same laws as those of the halogen
  compounds.       The fluorides, however, cannot be strictly com
  pared with the chlorides, bromides, and iodides, since } is an
  even member of the seventh group; whereas Cl, Br, and              I are
  odd members.

rendered evident in homologous series, and the second in

intended, if opportunity admits, to refer to it at length in a

    The connexion between the boiling-points                                      and composition
of organic compounds as pointed out by Kopp (Ann. Chem.

that it will be unnecessary to go into detail with regard to                                                   it.

deal at this subject, and have come to the following conclu
S10n S   :—
     (1) The melting-points of those compounds, the atoms of
which are symmetrically arranged, are higher than in the case
of compounds in which the atomic arrangement is asymme
trical. (2) The stability
of   symmetrical
trical   compounds
                       compounds
                                          therefore the heat of formation)
                                       is greater than that of asymme
                         isomeric with them.
                                                   º       this be true, then  If
it would follow that the heats of combustion of the former
compounds are less than those of the latter.
        e application of the first of these conclusions may be
made, first, to isomeric compounds, and, secondly, to com
                                                                                                                 re the

thelot (Ann. Chim. Phys. [4] xxvi. p. 408) concludes, with
regard to the relations between the coefficient of division and
the chemical composition of the substance dissolved, that ether
removes from water with greater facility:-(1) the more
highly carburetted of two homologous acids; (2) a monobasic
acid more easily than the corresponding dibasic acid, as acetic
rather than oxalic ; (3) a monobasic acid rather than a dibasic
acid of nearly the same composition, as acetic rather than
succinic.    (4) Of two acids containing the same proportion of
carbon and hydrogen, that with the smallest number of O
atoms is the more easily removed, as succinic, C, H, O,
rather than malic, C, H,      8,   or tartaric, C, H, Os.

Schroeder (Pogg. Ann. clx. p. 199) has                         the hypo
thesis that “All bodies combine in whole volumes.”                  In the
case of   gaseous bodies this can be       proved,    as is well   known,
without exception by reducing to a common temperature and
pressure (Gay-Lussac).            For liquids, Kopp (Ann. Chem.
 Pharm. xcvi. pp. 153, 303) has shown that the volumes of C,
H, O, and other elements in organic liquids are equal in all
compounds if their specific gravity be determined at the
boiling-point.    The following are his more important results:—
 (1) Differences of molecular volume are proportional to the dif
ferences between the corresponding chemical formula. Thus the
 difference of CH2 in homologous series corresponds to a dif
 ference of 22 in the molecular volume, thus:–

effective magnitude or the angle of the pinnae to an amount
unknown to the observer must produce a false perception of
the relative intensities of the sounds, and give rise to an illu
sion as to the direction of the sound.
   The simple instrument for
which the author suggests the
name Pseudophone consists of
a pair of ear-pierces, AA, fur

flaps or reflectors of sound, CC,
which can be fitted to the ears

can be set at any desired angle (4

ears, and can also be turned
upon a revolving collar about
that axis so as to reflect sounds into the ears from any desired
direction.
   The theory of the Pseudophone is very simple, and is as
follows:—
     The intensity of a perceived sound depends upon the amount
of   space over which the waves are gathered                    by the external
collecting apparatus of the ear; ini by analogy with optical
phenomena we may say it depends upon the number of rays
of sound which                reach the ear.
Let the effective              surfaces of the
pinnae which gather the sound
rays be       fi ..f
                   º, and let them

   Suppose one flap to be adjusted at an angle of about 40
degrees with the line of sight, in which position it is about
most favourably situated to receive sounds from a point right
...
in front of the observer; then if the other flap be adjusted to
any angle greater or less than 40°, fewer rays of sound are
          into the ear on that side than on the other, and the
hearer imagines the source of sound to be situated on that side
on which the sensation is more intense. Accordingly, to verify
the perception, the hearer turns his head until both ears hear
the sound equally loudly, and imagines then that he is looking
in the direction of the sound, whereas he is looking at a point
situated nearer to that side on which the larger effective sur
face exists. This observation agrees with Steinhauser's theory.
The illusion is very easily obtained by means of a loud-ticking
clock, but with some persons does not succeed unless their
eyes are blindfolded ; for when there is a conflict between the
evidence of the eyes and the evidence of the ears, the tendency
appears to be to believe the former rather than the latter.
   A more striking illusion occurs when the flaps of the pseu
dophone are reversed and adjusted so as to reflect into the ears
sounds which come from immediately behind the observer.
In this case also, if a source of sound, situated anywhere be
hind the head, be observed, if the observer does not know how
the flaps are adjusted, he will estimate it to be somewhere in
                      #:
front; and, on turning his head about until the sounds are
equally intense, he            himself to be looking straight at the
source of   sound,  whereas it is in reality exactly in an opposite
direction. This illusion succeeds well with a loud-ticking
clock, well also with the human voice, but not well with a
tuning-fork of medium pitch. In a room the experiment may
succeed with a tuning-fork; but there is never the same clear
and decisive impression, as to the position of the sounding
body.    In the open air the writer has never succeeded in pro
ducing the illusion with a tuning-fork; for the sensation is one
of a character from which it appears to be impossible to draw
any precise judgment.        The sound does not appear to have
any precise
               ..".        This result, which agrees with some
experiments made by Lord Rayleigh with tuning-forks, stands
in strong opposition to Steinhauser's theory, which ought, if
true at all, to be a fortiori true for simple sounds. The author's
experiment differs from that of Lord Rayleigh in this respect—
that in the case of Lord Rayleigh's experiments with the un
aided ears the head of the observer was to be held immovable;
                                                ...
whereas in the experiment with the pseudophone the head is
turned about, seeking in vain a direction
nounced to be that of the sound-rays.

   The illusion succeeds in the open as well as in-doors with
the sound of a loud-ticking clock, and with the human voice;
but with shrill sounds it succeeds best, notably with the sharp
click of a metronome, and even with a metronome-bell.
    These results point to the explanation foreshadowed by
Lord Rayleigh, namely that the diffraction of sounds of medium
and great wave-length around the head, thus bringing the
lower and upper partial tones of the compound sound in un
equal intensity to the two ears, plays a great part in our per
ception of the direction of sounds.      When the effects of dif
 fraction are such as to be relatively negligible, as for shrill
sounds (whose wave-length is small), then Steinhauser's theory
of the relative intensities appears to hold good. Any one may
at once convince himself of the fact that diffraction may thus
produce a difference in the relative intensities with which the
 partial tones of a complex sound reach the ears, by the simple
 experiment of comparing the note of a musically-ticking clock
placed in front of the head with
                                                 its
                                         note when placed behind.
 They appear somewhat different, the difference being one                                         of
 timbre rather than of total loudness.
    Another experiment with the pseudophone which gives rise
to  acoustical illusions, consists  setting one flap catch sounds
                                           in                              to
 from the   front, while the other catches sounds from behind
 or above the observer.      Under these circumstances the sounds
seem,         as   the observer moves his head,
                                                        or to

the      right, sometimes from the left,                         sometimes from the
ground.
     Lastly, most      these experiments with the pseudophone can

    In this arrangement the “make” currents are of course
 alternately in one direction and in the other, as also are the
 “break” currents; so that the discharge appears to the eye
 during the working of the machine the same at both termi

    The advantages of the method are:—first, the fact that, as
the machine effects                 its

No most
   exact measurement of          any quantity, even with the
                  sensitive
              accurate and          test-methods available, can
reasonably be expected unless the standard by which the un
known quantity is to be gauged is perfectly constant in itself;
or, if nature does not permit of such a desirable state of things,
the causes to which the variation of the standard are due
should be known, and in addition also their quantitative effect
on the standard, in order to be able to introduce a correction
whenever accuracy of measurement should permit and circum
stances necessitate            it.
     This requirement for      standard necessarily entails
                                         a                          the                              on

the standard and the causes              variation, andof    its

                                   of     an

    Further, having         constant standard,
                                    no                  impossible             it   is                       to

therefore the light produced by a standard cannot alter per
ceptibly in time. To make the light constant from the moment
the current passes, i. e. to establish dynamic equilibrium be
tween the heat produced and the heat lost per unit of time, it
is necessary to make the arrangement in such a manner that
the electric resistance offered by the standard is only in the
piece of platinum intended to be made hot by the current, and
not in the other parts of the circuit.
    For this reason              I
                         find it best to cut the piece of platinum
 out of a platinum sheet.
aft Figure 7, Plate XI. gives the form in actual size. The two
            white in the drawing, may then conveniently form
the electrodes between the leading wires and the piece of
 U-shaped platinum which has to produce the light.                   As the

 -   Photometric Measurements.-Having now a constant light,
 it  became possible to measure the variations of light which the
 combustion standards invariably show.
     For instance, one of Sugg’s candles was compared with the
 P. L. S. (A) with the result shown in the following table:—
            Distance in millimetres.

    * In order to show that a platinum light-standard can easily be repro
 duced,   I will give here some actual measurements:—
   The platinum sheet out of which the P. L. S. (A) was cut weighed
;.º
0.0364 gram per square centimetre.           From this the weight of the part
which becomes hot, calculated, gives 0.0264 gram. The resistance of
the standard, measured at 66° F., gave 0-143 S. U., including contact
resistances.
    Now another piece of platinum sheet 26x28 millims. was found to
weigh 0:265 gram. The piece cut off which actually becomes hot = 0.026
     m, which agrees within 0-0004 gram with the weight found by calcu
        for       P.        (A) actually used.                                        -

or contact resistance probably=0.034 S. U.

than by resistance,

   The resistance of the mercury rheostat can be easily altered
by moving the bridge b along the two parallel mercury-grooves.
If the bridge is taken out, the total resistance of the rheostat
is in circuit.
   If the bridge b is close to the two terminals ff, the resist
ance of the rheostat is nil.
  This range of resistance with about 6 to 10 volts will prove
sufficient to make the current strong enough and to keep it
constant for many hours, especially if the precaution be taken
to open the circuit when no light is required.    The bridge b
consists of a strip of copper at least 2 centims. broad and 1
millim. thick.    The knife-edges which dip into the mercury
are amalgamated.
   The current-measurer G has been gauged by comparison
with a standard tangent-galvanometer; so that the currents

  402                On a new Standard     of Light.
 are proportional.      These suppositions are almost correct for
  small variations of the current.
     In conclusion it may be stated that it was ascertained that
 the platinum light-standard (B) produced the unit intensity
  of light (the unit of light equal to the light emitted by the
  standard candle) at a total expenditure of energy equal to 427
 Q ergs per second. Of these, 300 Q ergs were actually trans
 formed into light by heating the platinum up to a high tem
 perature ; while the remaining 127 Q ergs were lost for
 illuminating-purposes, being used for raising the temperature
 of the circuit exclusive of the platinum standard.
     The platinum light-standard (A) being made of much
 thicker platinum sheet, showed a much less favourable result.
 The unit of light by (A) was produced at a total expenditure
 of energy equal to 1226 () ergs per second, of which 725 Q
 ergs were actually transformed into light; the remaining 501
 Q ergs were wasted in heating the circuit to low temperature
 (no light). Considering that the unit of light can               pro
 duced in an electric arc at a total expenditure of energy of 10
 Clergs per second only (see my ‘Précis of Report on Electric
 Light Experiments,’ London, 1st Nov. 1878, p. 11), when
 produced by Siemens's intermediate dynamo-electric machine,
 it follows that, from an engineering point of view, light b
incandescence can scarcely be expected to compete with light
 by disintegration (electric arc).
     In fact, it appears that light by incandescence is scarcely any
 cheaper than light by combustion.        The reason for this is that
 the temperature of an incandescent platinum wire is not very
 much higher than the temperature of a flame, and that for unit
 volume the mass which has to be kept heated in a piece of
platinum is much larger than the mass in a flame.          Unless we
should be fortunate enough to discover a conductor of electri
city with a much higher melting-point than platinum, and
that the specific weight and specific heat of that conductor is
also much lower than for platinum, and that at the same time
the new conductor does not combine at high temperatures
with oxygen, we can scarcely expect that the principle of          in
candescence will be made use of for practical illumination.
    Further, it was ascertained that the resistances of the platinum
light-standards (not including contact resistance) were as
follows:—
    P. L. S. (B)=0.136      ohm  at 22°2 C.
 -
                   =0.876    m   at the temperature of the standard
where the light was measured, or increase       #=644.

where the light was produced, or increase                                        ;=945.
  I   regret that             I
                       have not been able to calculate from the
above results the temperature of the heated platinum, since                                                I
could not procure in time a copy of Dr. William Siemens's
Bakerian Lecture (1871), which at present, to my knowledge,
is the only source whence the increase of resistance of platinum
at high temperatures can be found.
    To sum up, the advantages of the new standard of light are:—
The light is perfectly constant if the current be kept constant;
it allows a correction to be made for the variation of the current
if this variation is known ; it can be reproduced accurately
everywhere if ordinary precautions be taken to secure pure
platinum *;          its
                   magnitude can        altered     any extent

in which the upper limit of the integral is the cube root of the
extreme aberration expressed in quarter-periods. For example,
the upper limit is unity when the phase at one extremity is a
quarter-period in advance, and that at the other extremity a
quarter-period in the rear, of the phase at the centre.
    The influence of aberration may be considered in two ways.
We may suppose the aperture (a) constant, and inquire into
the effect of an increasing aberration (c); or we may take a
given value of c (i.e. a given wave-surface), and examine the
effect of a varying aperture.            To the latter comparison Airy's
results are more immediately applicable. The following Table,
easily derived from that given by him, exhibits the values of
\cos $7(o"—mo)do, between the limits specified in the head
ings of columns 2, 3, 4, 5. The results are applicable at once
to the comparison of the amplitude-curves corresponding to
various apertures, since the relation of m to £ in (3) is inde
pendent of a. To obtain intensities, it would be necessary to
square the numbers given in the Table.

quantity of light in the beam is independent of the aberration;
and this area is equal to that of a rectangle whose height is
the maximum ordinate OA of the first curve, and width the
distance O B between 0 and the first position of zero intensity.
It appears that aberration begins to be distinctly mischievous
when it amounts to about a quarter-period, i. e. when the
wave-surface deviates at each end by a quarter wave-length
from the true plane. The most marked effect is the increased
importance of the lateral band on one side, and the approxi
          º
mate obliteration of the lateral band on the other side.
   When the aberration is symmetrical about the centre of
the beam, the term in a "vanishes, and the whole effect is of
higher order. In general the term in a“ will preponderate ;
and thus the problem for a symmetrical beam resolves itself
into the investigation of aberration varying as a ". In one
respect the problem is simpler than the preceding, on account
of the symmetry of the intensity-curves; but in another it is
more                since the phase of the resultant does not
correspond with that of the central element.    The intensity is

          duction,            I
                       observed certain circumstances which                                                    I
had not before noticed, and which seemed deserving of further
attention.           I
                was therefore led to inquire a little more closely
into these matters; and although the investigation is by no
means full or complete,                        I
                                have obtained one or two results
which    I thought     might  I venture to lay before the Physical
Society. The apparatus used in these experiments consisted,
as at first arranged, of two coils of copper wire, one of which
was connected in circuit with a battery of three Leclanché
cells, and with a microphone which was actuated by a watch,
while the other was connected with a telephone, in order that
the induced currents, while passing through              might render                it,
audible the   beating               of
                           the watch which was used         the source                     as
of sound.
                        this arrangement was afterwards tried,

On the Conjugate   Positions of two Circular Coils of Wire.   413
    With the first arrangement of apparatus it was possible to
  lace the coils so as to get complete silence in the telephone.
W.     the powerful current from twelve Grove's cells and the
key for making and breaking the circuit, however, the silence
is not absolute; but in the positions which give a minimum
of sound the sound is very faint, being just audible and no
more. This faint sound may perhaps be accounted for partly
because the different convolutions of wire in the secondary
coil experience slightly different inductive effects from the pri
mary one, and
                 | ".    because it is difficult to adjust the posi
tions of the coils with any great degree of accuracy without
having special arrangements for the purpose.
   Now it was found that the various conjugate positions in
which the secondary coil could be placed in the neighbourhood
of the primary one were situated in a path along which it
could be moved either towards or away from the primary
coil without sounds being heard in the telephone, but that
with a slight deviation from this path to either side the sounds
were again heard.
    In order to ascertain whether the direction of the currents
in the secondary circuit was reversed when the coil was
moved from one side of the path to the other, a delicate re
flecting galvanometer was substituted for the telephone, and
the position of the coil so adjusted that on making and break
ing the circuit no deflection of the galvanometer was observed.
The coil was now moved slightly away from this position, say,
towards the right; and the direction of the deflection of the
galvanometer on making contact was noted, that on breaking
being, of course, in the opposite direction. The coil was now
moved towards the left to the other side of the path, and
                                            º
 the direction of the deflections again observed; and it was
 found that they were now reversed.       We may therefore infer
 that this path (which, if it could be            traced, would of
 course constitute a surface of revolution about the axis of the
 primary coil) divides space into two regions, in one of which
 the inductive action of the primary coil has the opposite      di
 rection to what it has in the other.
    This path appeared to be slightly curved ; and it seemed as
 if a part of it might very readily    i.traced.    The part which
 appeared to be best suited for this purpose was that along
 which the secondary coil has to pass while being moved away
 from contact with the primary one parallel to it to a position
 at some distance from      it,   ashere the inductive effect    is
 greatest, and therefore any deviation      of   the coil from the
 proper position   inthe path     ismost easily detected.    As the
 coils are further separated, however, the position     of the path
 becomes more difficult     to  trace, until  at   last we lose  it
 altogether.

  In order,   then, to trace a curve which would represent this
path, it was necessary to find several points in it whose posi
tions could afterwards be accurately laid down. This was
done by fixing the secondary coil in several positions succes
sively and determining the position of a certain point in it
with relation to certain fixed objects, by measurements which
were afterwards used as abscissae and ordinates in tracing the
curve. These measurements were taken in inches; and their
values are given in the annexed Table, where the columns
headed w and y are those of abscissae and ordinates respec
tively.

  No special arrangement was used to adjust the parallelism
of the coils, and only one measurement was taken for each
number; hence the irregularity in the increase of the ordi
nates.  The point whose position was determined in each case
was the centre of the plane of the secondary coil; and that is
the point which is situated in the curve when silence is main
                          *
tained in the telephone.
   The curve (Pl. XII.) is that found in this way; and it repre
sents the path which the selected point of the coil has to follow
in order dº   silence may be maintained in the telephone.      Cl
and  C, are sections of the primary   and secondary  coils respec
tively; C', and C",             the secondary coil in two other

axis and plane of the primary coil. The points a, b, c, &c.
are the intersections of     abscissae and ordinates, and repre
sent the successive positions occupied by the selected point of
the secondary coil when the measurements were taken by
means of which the curve was traced. As the coils became
further separated, however, the position of the curve became
less distinct; and so no attempt was made to trace it further.
   If, now, we suppose the curve      rotate round the axis
                                           to                                 of

section; and    we observe the conditions
               if                           necessary  for placing
the  secondary   coil   the curve
                          in            theinproper   position  for

that their direction on the other side of the curve           towards                                        is
the  plane                  of

 combination, it may be observed that the greatest inductive
effect occurs when the planes of the coils are at the greatest

this effect gradually diminishes, until, when they still are at
some distance, it becomes nothing.                                                                                     &

Author has         decided
                   a          preference:         considers Wheatstone's he

some are devoted              to developing the theory on which the discussions
in the previous section are based, others to explaining special
applications of those sections. Thus the first Appendix to the
second     section of the second part is devoted to the theory of
 finding the “Resultant Fault,” while the second Appendix, “on
 the execution of Regular Tests,” lays down general and practical
 rules for the operation, and gives an account of the routine observed
 in their execution on the Indian lines.
    Considered as an account of the principles on which the methods
are based, the work can hardly be regarded as in all respects
satisfactory: if this had been the Author's sole object it might
be fairly said that the arrangement is inconvenient and the exposition
obscure. For instance, the accounts of Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's
 corollaries, which are the foundation of the theory of Wheatstone's
 Bridge, are the subject of two Appendices; and the connexion
 between them and the various parts of the theory laid down in the
 preceding section is not very clearly made out.            In fact, we doubt
 whether more than a     very   few readers would        actually   make it out
 unless they had recourse to other books.           Added to this, it may be
 noted that the correction of the proof-sheets does not seem to have
 been very thoroughly made”.
    This, however, is a matter of comparatively small importance;
 for doubtless the work will be quite intelligible to the class of
 readers for whom it is written, namely those who are practically
 concerned in working a Telegraphic System. The information on
to all
     points     which such readers will

                                of
near Port Dinorwig.       Beyond these come the felsite series, which
overlapped by grits and conglomerates           far     the Bangor road,

also that the bed with purple fragments near Tairffynnon and the
Bangor poorhouse are only Cambrian conglomerate faulted down.

                                               the above three series are
fairly parallel throughout, and that they only form three subdi

 Morte slates passing into Ilfracombe slates (overlying Hangman

 Foreland grits, as no representative of the Lynton beds is present
 between Oaktrow and Timberscombe.
    In traverse 2, the fault between the Hangman and Foreland
grits is proved by the presence of the Lynton beds in the valley west
of Luccot Hill and their conformable infraposition to the Hangman
series, and abrupt termination by fault against the Foreland grits
of Porlock and Oare Hills. At Oare a patch of schist of the Lynton
zone was noticed resting on the Foreland grits on the north side of
the fault.
    The 3rd traverse, in the Tone valley, gave the following succession
 of beds:—Culm-measures on Pilton beds; Pilton beds with grits,
much flexured, on Olive slates with Lingula and grits with Cucul
 lara, conformably overlying Pickwell-Down grits, which make a con
 formable junction (following the feature) with the underlying
 quartziferous slates of the Morte series (Middle Devonian); the
latter were observed between Huish Champflower and Clatworthy;
but as the Middle Devonian slates appear to extend considerably
northward in the Brendons, they were not traversed beyond Clat
worthy.
    The 4th traverse, from West Quantockshead to Cannington Park,
proved the composition of the Quantocks along that line to be grits,
in places associated with schistose shales, apparently belonging to
the Hangman series (Middle Devonian); whilst the Palaeozoic
inliers, in the Triassic area of Bridgewater, are unlike the Quantock
rocks in character. The limestones of Asholt and Hollwell, asso
ciated with slates of the Ilfracombe series, are very similar to varie
ties of the South-Devon limestone, and are quite unlike the lime
stone of Cannington Park.
    3. “The Whin Sill of Teesdale as an Assimilator of the sur–
 rounding Beds.” By C. T. Clough, Esq., F.G.S.
    Owing to the general absence of mechanical disturbance, the
author is of opinion that “the whin consists in part of altered
sedimentary beds, that it partly represents beds which were once
in the position it now occupies, that it did not make room for itself
simply by thrusting aside these beds, but also by incorporating them
into itself.”   He proceeds to describe sections at Caldron Snout,
Cronkley Fell, Noon Hill, &c., which seem to him inexplicable on any
other theory. The author discusses objections on chemical grounds,
holding that the general uniformity in chemical composition of the
Whin may be explained by supposing the absorbed beds to have
permeated a large mass of the Whin, as an alloy does melted metal.
He thinks the explanation may be extended to other intrusive
masses.
    4.  “On the Silurian    Rocks of the Valley of the Clwyd.”      By
Prof. T. M'Kenny Hughes, M.A., F.G.S.
    The author gives a preliminary sketch of the Silurian rocks of
the southern and western part of the Clwyd valley.        He describes

                      Intelligence and Miscellaneous                        Articles.                          421
first some beds below the horizon of the Denbigh Grits at Ffriddfawr
which agree very well in their characters with the base of the
Coniston Grit, and others near agreeing with the passage-beds
between these Grits and Flags.        He next describes sandstones in
the Clywedog valley, the equivalents of the lower Grits, and,
lastly, at Bod Renail, flags &c., the Pale Slates, which contain Grap
tolites and are thus to be identified with the Graptolitic mudstones
of the Lake-district.    Thus he is of opinion there is a basement
series here for the Silurian, corresponding in all     details with that         its
in the Lake-district.

darker hues of oxidation.
     5.   It was only with the disappearance                      colours (in the    of    all
grey state) that the rods resumed the specific gravity and volume
which they possessed before the hardening—that                           the crude               is,   in
state     in which they were procured.            That, notwithstanding this,
the two states, grey and crude, are absolutely different follows (as
is  shown loc. cit.) from the fact that grey rod takes             a    much more                      up
permanent magnetism than                crude one (in

 very slowly, the specific gravity again diminishes,                   the volume
increases. This increment amounted                     the average         on
                                                                         somewhat

 DETERMINATIONS OF THE VAPOUR-DENSITIES, AT HIGH                    TEMPE
    RATUREs, OF SUBSTANCES THAT ATTACK MERCURY.                      By L.
     PFAUNDLER".
    In connexion with the numerous newer methods for determining
vapour-densities, especially the most recent, by W. Meyer and C.
Meyer (Beibl. iii. p. 252), Pfaundler reminds us of one mentioned
already in 1870, in the Berichte des naturwissenschaftlich-medicinischen
  Vereins in Innsbruck.     The construction of the apparatus he em
ployed was substantially that of a Regnault air-thermometer; only,
 instead of the simple glass cylinder, a glass vessel formed of several
compartments one above another, and connected by capillary tubes,
served for holding the vapour, by which the vapour to be investigated
could be kept separate from the mercury, at least during the obser
vation.    Moreover, in the case of dissociation, diffusion of the con
stituents in unequal quantity can be prevented by employing a
capillary tube coiled in any manner instead of the second, third, &c.
compartments.         The temperature is observed on an exactly like
constructed   air-thermometer;     and the difference of pressure in the
latter and in the    vapour-apparatus   gives the pressure of the vapour
very accurately, since many errors eliminate one another.              The
substance to be examined is introduced through a narrow tube into
the apparatus, which is then hermetically closed, the capacity of
the vessels having been previously determined in the known volumi
mimetric manner.        In the method used by W. and C. Meyer also,
the air (nitrogen &c. respectively) displaced by the vapour prevents
contact with the barrier-liquid; the difference of principle between
 the two methods, however, is this—that in the Meyers' the volume
of the vapour is deduced from that of the displaced air, while with
 Pfaundler the determination has in view the measurement of the
pressure of the vapour at constant volume.            Pfaundler himself
 regards the Meyerian method as by far the simpler, while he con
 siders his own the more exact and hence more suitable for testing
 theoretical relations.—RTH. in the Beiblåtter zu den Annalen der
 Physik und Chemie, 1879, No. 7, p. 484–5.

    those     striking changes of hue due to variations of the intensity
     of illumination.      Of the simple colours, as the brightness of
    the ray increases, red and green change to yellow, blue becomes
     white.     Besides these remarkable changes, familiar only to
     the   spectroscopist,   there are in the outdoor world a host of
     striking effects.     Passing cloud-shadows on the water at noon
    day reveal to us that what under shadow is indigo-blue be
    comes instantly, in the direct sunlight, a subtile silver-grey.
    The same cloud-shadows transform the sun-lit yellow-green of
    a neighbouring hillside into blue-green.            All these effects are
,    the necessary result of that peculiarity in the action of our
    nerve-termini.        Of more direct interest at present is the                                        in
    fluence upon white daylight.         Such light at ordinary intensi
    ties affects the three sets of nerve-termini equally ; the re
    sultant impression is whiteness.          Now daylight is simply the
    light of the sun weakened by manifold diffuse reflexions.

  An interesting question is that concerning            the nature of the
medium in our atmosphere by means of which the light
reaching us from the open sky has been reflected.                   Such
light is polarized ; and the angle of incidence at which               po                         its

 obtained, and to reprecipitate, so as to thoroughly eliminate
 every trace of zinc.
     The method of separation described by Fresenius, and
 usually given by other authorities, is also open to the ob
jection of not yielding concordant results, even though every
 precaution be observed in the process and the quantity of
 the reagents be carefully adjusted.      This method is based
 upon the insolubility of the hydrated oxide of cadmium in an
alkaline solution containing tartaric acid. To the hydrochloric
acid solution of the two, as near as possible neutral, tartaric
acid is added ; sufficient sodium or potassium hydrate is then
added until the solution is distinctly of an alkaline reaction.
If  this solution be boiled for about two hours, the hydrated
oxide of cadmium separates out on cooling, the zinc being left
in solution. After filtration, the hydrated oxide is ignited
and weighed as the oxide (Cd 0). The zinc may be precipitated
as the sulphide by ammonium sulphide, or titrated with sodium
sulphide.
   Two examples may be given, showing the mutual varia
bility in estimations which should each have yielded the same
result. In each case the determination of the amount of cad
mium contained in a mixed precipitate of zinc and cadmium
was the object in view.

paratively small amount of the metal present, are serious, and
indicate the method as unreliable. The subsequent zinc-esti
mation in all of these cases showed that in no instance was the
whole of the cadmium present precipitated ; the error, there
fore, relatively to the total cadmium present, was even larger
than above shown.      This was           confirmed by other ex

quantity was so great as to impart quite a deep yellow colour
to the otherwise white zinc sulphide.
    Experiments were now made in which advantage was taken
of the difference of behaviour of the two sulphides when boiled
with a solution of potassium cyanide, sulphide of zinc being very
soluble and the sulphide of cadmium insoluble in that reagent.
This method appears, at first sight, to be both convenient and
accurate. Several trials, however, showed that it was unsatis
factory; the difficulty of obtaining pure potassium cyanide
free from iron, the subsequent destruction of the cyanide, and
the large excess of potash salts left, with their effect upon the
estimation of the zinc, gave results                     far
                                                  from approaching the
accuracy desirable.
    After several trial experiments, the following method was
adopted.

             It    is based upon the difference          action     ofammo             of
nium carbonate upon the precipitated metallic carbonates, and
yields accurate and concordant results. From considerable

LIII.         Experimental Researches                on the Temperature   of   the       Sun.
        By F. RosetTI, Professor of Physics in                    the University           of
        Padua.

IV.       Calculation of the Constants of the Formula in order to
          render it applicable to the Experiments made with Pile
          No.   1.
                   my investigation was to ascertain the tem
                object
THEperature ofof the  sun by applying the formula to experi
ments made on solar radiation.    In these, and in many other
experiments made on the radiation of very hot bodies,     em                         I
ployed the pile No. 1. The constants, a and b, determined
for pile No. 2, had then to be modified in such a manner that
the same formula, with the new values of the two constants,
could be applied to the experiments made with pile No. 1.
For this purpose             I
                    made experiments by placing the two piles
successively in front of the Leslie's cube, kept at a constant
temperature           of 312°C.
                     Pile No. 1 produced 28° deflection,
          -          Pile No. 2          78°,    32
giving
                                 No.    1       28 =0-359;

i.   pile No. 1 =0-359 No. 2.
     e.
   Thus, in order to adapt the preceding formula to pile No. 1,
the constants a and b had to be multiplied by 0.359.              was              I
desirous, however, of so expressing the formula, that by
means of it the thermal effect of the sun on pile No. 1 could
be directly compared with the effect of the radiation from the
hot body observed under the same angle as the sun, i. e.
32' 3".6.     By placing the pile with                    its
                                             face 134 millims. from
the  radiating  surface               of
                            the Leslie's  cube, which,      the inter     by
position       diaphragm, was limited
                of a                            circle    32.65 mil

   the same angle        the sun, the pile should have been placed
                                 as

                                                                     on of
     adistance                                            the

nometer should have been 0.1444 division.                         Thus we have for
pile No. 1,
                     0.1444 =A.         -
                  No.   1   = 0-0014665.
                                T985
   The constants a and b have therefore to be multiplied by
the two reduction coefficients 0.359 and 0-0014665 in order
to obtain the new constants m and n.                    I
                                        have used the formula
thus obtained in my experiments with pile No. 1. For this
pile, then, we have the following formula:—
                        y=mT”(T-6)—n(T-6),
                  log m- 1.2466088–10,
                  log n = 5:5254189—10,
on condition that the pile be placed at a distance from the
radiating body equal to 107-17 times the diameter of the body,
so that it shall appear, like the sun, at an angle of 31' 3"-6.
V.     Verification   of the Applicability of the Formula for Tempe
                            ratures        above 300°.
    Calorimetrical Erperiments.-These experiments were made
in order to ascertain whether the formula continues to repre
sent correctly the thermal effect of the radiation of bodies when
their temperature exceeds 300°. The first experiment was
made with a sheet of copper covered with lampblack and
heated by a spirit-lamp.       This was one of the sources of heat
employed by Melloni, according to whom the copper has a
temperature of about 400°. Other physicists affirm the tem
 perature to be 390°. On introducing the value of the deflec
tion on the galvanometer, obtained with pile No. 1, into the
formula,     I
             obtained, from two successive experiments, numbers
                  º
 between 390° and 400°.        As the temperature of the sheet was
 probably slightly different in the two experiments, regarded           I
the result of this first trial as satisfactory. It was necessary,
 however, that some more conclusive experiments should be
 made at temperatures which were higher, but which could
 nevertheless be determined by calorimetric methods.           there          I
 fore took a ball of copper heated to redness, the temperature
 of which was               by means of a calorimeter constructed
 for high temperatures.        suspended the copper ball                    by

 to    beconstant when the galvanometric deflection remained

constant for a certain time. Then, at a given signal, an as
sistant pushed the flame aside, and another assistant placed
the calorimeter-receiver under the ball and immediately raised
it,   so that the ball dipped into the water                   of

                           c=0.1092,             t—762°1.

   Calculation of the Readings of the Galvanometer.—Four
readings were taken on the galvanometer before the ball was
immersed in the water.      The first reading, with an open cir
cuit, gave the zero-point ; the second was made with a closed
circuit, the pencil of heat-rays being shut off by means of the
double screen.   These two readings were always nearly iden
tical, showing that the case protected the pile effectually.
   In the first of the experiments mentioned the readings
Were    :—
                          Circuit open          .   .    .    66'5
                          Circuit closed        .   .    .    68-0
In   the second:—
                          Circuit open .            .    .    64-0
                          Circuit closed .          .    .    65-5
   The difference 1:5 in the two readings represents the effect
of the medium upon the face of the pile which receives the
radiation, the window of the case being open ; but it might
also arise from some slight thermo-electric current induced
by contact with the rheophore.            Whatever may be the cause
of the slight deflection, it can easily be eliminated by subtract
ing the second reading from the following readings which give
the deflection produced by the radiation.
   The third reading affords a measure of the thermal effect of
the flame ; the difference between the fourth and the second
reading gives the total effect of the radiation of the hot ball
and of the half of the flame which surrounds it. Thus the
thermal effect produced on the pile by the radiation of the
ball can easily be found. It is well known that the blue flames
of Bunsen's burners are almost entirely diathermanous. Con
sequently it is only necessary to subtract the number of divi
sions which represent the thermal effect of the front part of the
flame (which on account of                its
                                      feeble emisssive power     always     is

the radiation        the heated body) from the difference between
                     of
the fourth and second reading, which gives the combined effect
of the flame and the ball.

     In the first     two calorimetric experiments the difference
                     of
between the fourth and second readings was equal                  248-9      to

 art    the pile received rays, not from the whole of the sphere,
     from a spherical segment, the thermal effect of which was
equal to the radiation which a circular disk of 21:42 millims.
diameter would produce if placed so that the back point made
a tangent to the sphere, i.e. at 170 millims. from the face of
the pile.   By the law of inverse squares, we find that if at 170
millims. distance the thermal effect of the radiation of the
ball was 235.9 divisions of the galvanometer, then at 2296.5
millims. it should have been 1322 division.
   There are two methods of comparing the results of the calo
rimeter experiments with the galvanometer observations; and
they yield similar results. We can either introduce the values
T and    T-6  (given by the calorimeter experiments) into the
formula, and obtain thus the value of y, in which case we
should have
                           T=273+762-1=1035:1,
                           6=273+         11.0=    284.0,
                      T–6=751-1,
giving                            y=1-3943;
or we can equally well introduce into the formula the value
Ay=1:322 given by the galvanometer observations, and deduce
from this the value of T and then of t. Doing this and re
membering that the surrounding temperature was 11°0, and
consequently
                           6=273+11:0=284,
we obtain                  T=1019-0, t—746-0.

we see that they do not differ much ; but quite enough to
show that the formula would not be applicable at high tempe
ratures. It struck me that the slight difference might
be owing to the emissive power of the red-hot ball, and that,
since the experiments which were employed for the calculation
                           ...
of the constants of the formula had been made with a surface
covered with lampblack,             all
                             discrepancies would probably have
disappeared,    even
                 if     high temperatures the radiating surface

  In the following section shall make use of this method.
For the present, I need only mention that I obtained from my
experiments the number 0-943 to represent the emissive power
of copper surrounded by a flame.
   In the calorimetric experiments already mentioned, the bare
ball of copper gave       y=1:322.
If  this ball had been covered                         with lampblack, the thermal
effect would have been
                         1.322
-                                  y=fiji=1402;
and the formula would give the value
                                         t = 763-6.
     The values

                               762-1   and 763-6
are near enough to be satisfactory; and we may therefore

446         Prof. F. Rosetti's Experimental Researches
VII.    Verification of the Applicability of the Formula to Tempe
                          ratures above 800°.
   If  we call e the specific emissive      power of the radiating
bodies, the formula becomes
                     y=meTº(T-6)—n(T-6);
and   if the experiments be made with lampblack, e=1.
   In order    to ascertain whether this formula be also applicable
when the temperatures are higher than those used in the calo
rimetric experiments, I used the same experiments as those by
which e was determined, commencing with copper.               I made
use successively of three disks of copper with the same dia
meter of 10 millims.        The first had a thickness of 1 millim.,
the second of 2 millims., and the third of 3 millims. It is certain
that each different disk when placed in the flame acquires a
different temperature, the smallest attaining a higher tempe
rature than the other two: if a disk were made any smaller
(as, for example 4 of a millimetre), it would soon become red
hot and begin to melt. Now we know the melting-point of
copper is 1050°; and therefore we may conclude that the
smallest of the three disks acquires in the flame a temperature
of about 1000°. The following results were obtained:—
    Sept. 3.-Copper disk blackened, with thickness 1 millim.,
diameter 10 millims., placed at 438 millims. from the pile;
the surrounding temperature being 28°C.; 6=273+28=301’’;
the deflection on the galvanometer = 15.9. Calculating the
deflection on the galvanometer, supposing the pile were at a
distance of 107-17-1-10 millims., we obtain
                          y=26554 divisions.
 Introducing     this value into the formula, as in the case of E = 1,
we have                               -
                         T=1260°,       t—987°.

923°3 with the thickest disk, were most probably their true

     To sum up, we find that the disks of copper acquired                     dif
ferent temperatures according to their thickness: the thinest
disk attained the temperature of 987°, the next thicker one
945°, and the thickest 923°. The thin disk of iron reached
the temperature of 1035°, the disk of platinum 1147°, and the
cylinder of magnesium oxychloride 1160°.        We can under
stand how the last-mentioned body may attain a higher tempe
rature than any of the others; for, being non-metallic, it is
not so good a conductor of heat as the others, and therefore
does not give up as much of      heat its the metallic support

   Second experiment.—In this experiment     obtained a large  I
deflection on the galvanometer, but the cylinder  shone very
brilliantly. Distance from the pile 420 millims.   Deflection
(mean of three experiments) = 42-0 divisions.    At the dis
tance 107-17+ 6.1 millims. we should have had

                             T=2670°,            t—2397°.
   These two numbers, 2167° and 2397°, although higher than
those obtained in the first series, will not appear too high if we
reflect that platinum immediately melted before the flame, and
that the li #. emitted in the experiments of the second series
Was                  greater than that emitted in those of the
first.      I
           think that all who have made researches of this nature
will consider the results obtained to be satisfactory, and that
 there is reason to conclude that the formula
                          y=mET*(J–6)—m(J–6),
which has stood the tests so well up to 2000°, can confidently
be applied to experiments made at higher temperatures, and
that it can be employed to find the temperature of the sun.

  It    appearsfrom these numbers and from their graphic
representation in line 1, fig. A, that the torsion varies directly
as the rate.          So exactly is this the case that we may in future
with perfect confidence reduce from one rate to another or to
any arbitrary common rate when the rate varies between ex
periments, to test the effect of variation of other kinds. And
we have, if the magnets and torsion keep constant, a very
exact and not inconvenient instrument for measuring the rate
of rotation of machinery.

of  experiments    were made to determine this relationship.
We need    only  reproduce here the longest and most complete.
The apparatus used was that shown in fig. 1, Plate XIII., which
is drawn to a scale one third true size.
   The copper disk, c, was replaced by one of ebonite, to the
lower surface of which the metal plate could be attached by
a drop of weak gum. The copper disk used was only 0.27
millim. thick; so that           all   its

   The ebonite disk and central clamp had been found to be
unaffected by the fastest speed used.           In order to avoid ex
travagant torsion, the rate of rotation was made less when the

   In  Table        column D shows the distance in millimetres
between the upper surface of the magnet and lower surface of
the copper         ; A shows the observed angles of depression;
T shows the time in seconds for one revolution of the worm
wheel; A' is the product of A and T.              Since T is inversely
and A is    directly   as the    rate, A’ shows the pure effect of
distance; it would be a constant if the distance did not vary.
Each of the experimental numbers given, whether of angle or
time, is the mean of never less than three observations.        These
observations of    angle and time were simultaneous.

          Variation in the Diameter of the Disk-For the study
of this effect the same apparatus was used                  the only
difference being that the magnet was only 2 inches long; and
a series of disks of copper were cut of the same thickness as
that used for finding the law of distance.        They were held in
the same    way—by     a drop   of weak    gum on the under surface
of the ebonite disk. The distance was kept constant, namely
3 millims.     In Table III., column Diam. gives the diameter
of the disk in inches, column A the corrected mean deflexion
of about four observations, column T the time of one revolu
tion of the worm-wheel, got by taking the time of ten or
twenty turns, during which the angles are read ; and column
A<U+017F> is equal to Ax T, and represents the torsion for constant
velocity.

     The column headed              y is obtained                    by dividing the numbers
in the previous column by the thickness of metal used. The
numbers in the column r, give the resistance in ohms of 100
inches of wire drawn from the same metal that was rolled into
sheets, and 79 millim. in diam. These two columns multiplied
together give the last column, which should be a constant if
the deflexion is proportional to the conductivity.   Now these
numbers range from 229 to 301, which seems rather a wide
divergence ; but in this case there are many considerations to
be taken into account, in each of which errors may easily
creep in, especially in the assumption that the specific conduc
tivity of the same metal is the same whether it be rolled or
drawn.    The approximation to equality, obtained in the num
bers in the last column, is    that could         all
                                            expected.                       be

     With regard to the validity of this method of determining
the conducting-power of liquids a few words may be said.
 1st. What will be the action of para- or dia-magnetic liquids
apart from conductivity?              Iron gives a greater turning effect
than      copper     when   placed  over a revolving magnet, owing to
 its   very great magnetizability and                                  its

a   perceptible       time;   but whether liquids can acquire sufficient
 magnetism and retain              long enough

is    impossible          say; experiment will show.

                 of                                                           the                  on

 electro-magnet turning about 3000 times a minute, was about

 15° an hour; in other words, the magnet went about 4,320,000
 times as fast as the liquid; and the total possible error on the
 supposition that the liquid is still, would be trºooo of the
 whole amount; therefore it may be safely ne
    It appears, therefore, that the point to be         in mind is
 that the torsion must not be measured till the liquid has attained
its constant velocity; i.e. sufficient time must be allowed. This
velocity and this time will be less the greater the friction or
viscosity.    But the introduction of glass threads, screens, or
porous plates to increase the friction would do more harm by
introducing uncertain electrical resistances than they could
possibly do good: the only device which seems as if it might be
of any use would be to make a jelly of the conducting liquid;
but this is quite unnecessary.
    We are engaged in measuring the conductivity of liquids by
means similar to those above shown.

afterwards found, as regards alcohols, ethers, and organic
acids belonging to the same homologous series, that the rate
of flow was the greater the lower the body was in the series.
He also found that the rate of an acid is slower than that of
an ether with which it is metameric.               More recently still,
 Schultze (Chem. Centr.       1872,  p.  705)  found,    as the result, of
his experiments, that in respect to solutions of salts of K, Na,
and Li, as also to solutions of salts of Ba, Sr, Ca, and Mg, the
velocity of flow is the greater the greater the atomic weight of
the metal, and that there is but little difference between the
rate of flow of the chloride, bromide, and iodide of one and the
same metal.       But it was reserved for Hannay (Nature, 1879,
xix. p. 378) to show that solutions containing equivalent
quantities of the respective salts must be used if the influence
of the chemical composition on the rate of flow is to be fully
made out. “By the use of such normal solutions, he found
that the rate of flow does not depend on any of the mechanical
properties of the salts, such as crystalline form, molecular
volume, solubility, &c., but upon the mass of the elements
forming the substance and the amount of energy expended in
its                                                                         its

    formation.       Each element has value            a   own, which                                    is

is continued          in   all    its
                           combinations. The greater the combi

also the greatest constant of capillarity in the solid state; but
 if any connexion exists between the capillarity and chemical
composition of liquid inorganic bodies, it is an extremely com
plicated one, and very difficult to trace.                  Gueront (Compt.

    Formic and acetic acids, however, are exceptions to Guerot's
 law, which he attributes to possible impurities in the speci
 mens examined. He also points out that the coefficients of
 capillarity of the ethers are very much higher than those of
 the alcohols or acids which give rise to them.
    In the last column of the above Table have added the    I
 boiling-points of the respective liquids; and it will be seen
 that, with the exception of acetic and formic acids, the coeffi
 cients of capillarity diminish as the boiling-point increases.
 Also, if we compare together an acid with the isomeric ethers,
 we find that the same rule holds good; thus:–

   Compressibility and Expansibility of Liquids.--According to
Amagat (Compt. Rend.                pp. 27, 139), the compressi
bility of compounds belonging to the same homologous series
diminishes regularly as we ascend in the series, or as the
boiling-point increases.    The introduction of S, Cl, or Br into
a compound    tends to render it less compressible.
   Kopp has compared together the rates of expansion (as deter
miº.       himself and Pierre) of nearly ninety liquids; and he
finds, as a general rule (but one to which there are many ex
ceptions), that the most expansible liquids are those which have
the lowest boiling-points.    In the case of compounds belong
ing to the same homologous series the rate of expansion always
diminishes as we ascend the series, and therefore as the boil
ing-point increases.    The fatty acids expand less rapidly than
 any of their ethers, at any rate up to the amylic ethers;          all
 data are wanting for the higher ethers.      The alcohols expand
 almost exactly    the same rate (though somewhat less rapidly)
                   at
 as the corresponding valerates.     The rate        of
                                                    expansion also
 diminishes from chlorides      bromides,
                                     to     and thence    toiodides,
                        boiling-point  increases;
                   is as
 and therefore     the                              this also holds
 good,   as
          far     asknown, for the halogen compounds           ofthe
 elements.
      As regards gases, Mendeljeff and Kajander (Deut. chem.
                 ix.
 Ges. Ber.       1311) have recently shown that gases having
                  p.
 the same molecular weight have the same coefficient  expan
                                                          of

466                                     Dr. T. Carnelley on the
weight of the gas. This holds good in the case of H, CO,
N2, CO, N, O, and SO2.        But, for reasons explained in the
original paper, HBr and     SiF, are exceptions to the rule.
   Conducting-power of Gases for Heat.—Magnus and, more
recently, Stefan (Chem. Centr. 1875, p. 529) have proved that
 ases differ in their conducting-power for heat; whilst Clausius
 Pogg. Ann. cxv. p. 1) and Mohr (Deut. chem. Ges. Ber.                                                      iv.
p. 85) have shown from mechanical considerations that these
conducting-powers are proportional           the velocity    the      to                             of
molecules      the gas, and, further, that under equal pressure,

creased absorption of the more refrangible rays for each
increase of CH2 in the molecule of the alcohols and acids.
 (4) Like alcohols and acids, the ethereal salts derived from
them are highly transparent to the ultra-violet rays, and do
 not exhibit absorption-bands. (5) Aromatic hydrocarbons,
phenols, acids, and amines derived therefrom are remarkable
for their powerful absorption of the ultra-violet rays. (6) Iso
meric bodies containing the benzene nucleus exhibit widely
different spectra, both as regards the position and intensity of
the absorption-bands; and so much is this the case that these
absorption-spectra may be used as a means of identifying
organic substances, and is a most delicate test of their
p urity.
     Relatire Sensitireness of Photographic Papers.-MacDougall
 (Chem. Journ. [2] iii. p. 183) has shown that the relative sen
 sitiveness of silvered papers salted with solutions of the haloid
 salts of various metals is independent of the nature of the
 metal with which the halogen is combined, and depends solely
 on the quantity and nature of the halogen. Combining the
 results of Wright (Chem. Journ. [2]

 the haloid salts.
     Spectra of  the Elements.-Several cases have been observed
  which   appear  to show that the atomic weights                  of
                                                         the elements
  have  a  marked and definite influence on the nature of the
  spectra which they yield; thus:—
      Chlorine Group (Cl, Br, I).--(1)              In
                                               passing from         Br,      Cl   to
  and thence   to   I, the spectra expand gradually towards the
  ultra-violet.   (2) Each spectrum has two maxima               light,      of
  which   approach    each other   as
                                    the atomic weight               of

                                                        º
  increases; and the brilliant lines seem also        become broader,
                                                              to
  and the maxima move towards the violet,               we approach
                                                               as                      I
  (Ditte, Compt. Rend. 1871, lxxiii.               p.
      Ditte also examined the spectrum          fluorine produced
                                                         of                            by
  passing the induction-spark through SiFi, and found that
  though the spectrum had two well-defined maxima, yet               did          it
  not present the brilliant region peculiar           the spectrum
                                                              to                       of
   the Cl  group, and the maxima are wide apart. He there
   fore concludes that, according             spectrum, Fought not
                                              to   its
  to   be placed among the halogens.         Nevertheless      think     I             it
   resembles the    Cl group  in  possessing two maxima, which are
   wider apart than      in
                          the case  of
                                     the other elements     the group,  of

470                        Dr. T. Carnelley on the
because   the atomic weight of F is less than that of Cl; but
in other respects the spectrum is very different from those of
Cl, Br, and I. These facts, it appears to me, agree perfectly
well with Mendeljeff's theory of odd and even members of a
group (vide supra); for Cl, Br, and                  I
                                             are odd members,
whilst F is an even member of the halogen group of elements.
   Sulphur Group (S, Se, Te). Ditte (Compt. Rend. lxxiii.
p. 622) has also examined the spectra of this group by pass
ing the induction-spark through the vapours of their chlorides
and eliminating the lines due to Cl; and he found —(1) That
the spectrum of S extends between the divisions 22 and 120
on the micrometer.     It shows two maxima, one being a double
line in the yellow, and the other in the commencement of the
blue. (2) The spectrum of Se begins at 19 and ends at 125,
and also shows two maxima, the first between the yellow and
green, and the second in the blue. (3) The spectrum of Te
begins at 18 and ends at 146, and also shows two maxima,
one in the indigo and the other in the violet.
   The spectra of this group thus increase in range, especially
towards the ultra-violet end, as we pass from S to Te, i. e.
with the atomic weight.      Each of the spectra likewise shows
two maxima, one being superior to the other; and as we pass
from S to Te, the two maxima move towards the violet
end.
   Phosphorus Group (P,As, Sb, Br).-Ditte (Compt. Rend.
lxxiii. p. 738) has likewise found:—(1) That the spectra of
the chlorides of the elements belonging to the phosphorus
group expand more and more, especially towards the violet
end, as the atomic weight of the positive element increases, or
in proportion as the properties of the element approach to
those of the metals.      (2) The spectra of the chlorides of this
   oup all have three maxima         luminous intensity, due
                                    of                           very
                                                                to
brilliant lines   separated    by   comparatively     dark intervals.
These three maxima move towards the violet end            as
                                                           the atomic
weight    ofthe positive element increases.

groups    ofluminous bands.       (3) As the atomic weight          of

element   increases,  these three maxima advance more and more
towards the violet. Lead also, though not examined             by
                                                               Troost

                    Influence of Atomic Weight.                  471
and Hautefeuille, appears to be in accordance with the above
rules, giving a more refrangible spectrum than Zr.
   Aluminium Group (Al, Ga, In, Tl).—Aluminium is charac
terized by the large number of bright lines lying close together,
of which the most important in the red are those of wave-lengths
6243 and 6245, and in the blue 4661 and 4662.           The alumi
nium-bands seen in the ultra-violet are   extremely   characteristic.
 Gallium. This spectrum consists of two violet lines, of which
the brighter Ga 2, of wave-length 4170, lies a little more
towards the blue than In 8, and the second, Ga 3 (wave-length
4031), a little more towards the violet than K/9.            Indium.
The   spectrum   of this metal is made   up  of an intense indigo
blue line In a     (wave-length    4509) and a less intense violet
line In 8, 4101. Thallium is characterized by the intense
green line Tla (wave-length 5349).          From the above it is
seen that, as the atomic weight increases, the rays become
less and less refrangible:       thus Al, the metal with lowest
atomic   weight,  is remarkable for bright lines in the ultra-violet,
whereas   Tl, with the greatest atomic weight, is recognized by
its well-known green line.
    Calcium Group (Ca, Sr, Ba).—Here also the rays towards
the violet end of the spectrum become less and less refrangible
as the atomic weight increases.
    Magnesium Group (Be, Mg, Zn, Cd, Hg).-In the case of
these elements the rays towards the violet end tend, on the
other hand, to become more and more refrangible as the
atomic weight increases.        Zinc, however, is an exception to
 this rule.
    Potassium Group (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs).-The spectra of this
group become less refrangible from K to Cs, i.e. as the atomic
weight increases.       In the case of Na and Li, which are excep
tions, may they not give lines in the ultra-violet beyond         KS
which have not yet been observed?
    Copper Group (Cu, Ag, Au).—Here the rays towards the
 violet end become less and less refrangible as the atomic weight
 increases.
    The general conclusions, therefore, which are to be drawn
 from the above remarks on the spectra of the elements are as
 follows:—
    (1) That for non-metals and quasimetals (including the Cl,
 S, P, and C groups) the spectra become more and more re
 frangible as the atomic weight increases.
    (2) That for true metals (Al, Ca, K, and Cu groups) the
 reverse holds good, the spectra becoming less and less refran
 gible as the atomic weight increases.        The Mg group, and

472                                 Dr. T. Carnelley on           the
also Li and Na, are exceptions to the latter of these state
ments".
   Spectra of Chemical Compounds,-Lockyer (Proc. Roy.
Soc. 1873, p. 285) has investigated the spectra of metals when
combined with various negative elements, and finds that regular
relations obtain. Thus in the case of Pb F2, PbCl, Pb Bra,
and PbT, it appears that the length and number of the metallic
lines observed diminish as the atomic weight of the non
metallic element increases. This was also found to hold good
with the haloid compounds of the metals of the alkalies and
alkaline earths.                                         -
   Mitscherlich   (Pogg.  Ann. cxxi.    p. 459;  Phil.  Mag. [4]
xxviii. p. 169) has also pointed out a singular relation between
the atomic weights of the haloid compounds of Ca, Sr, and Ba
and the distance between the chief lines of their spectra.    He
finds that in the case of Ba, the distances between the most
prominent lines given by the Bahaloid compounds respectively
are directly proportional to the molecular weights of these
compounds, whilst for the haloid compounds of Sr and Ca
these distances are inversely proportional to the molecular
weights of the compounds.

    Electric Conductivity.—Kohlrausch            and Grotian, and also
Tollinger, have found that the conducting-power of the fol
lowing chlorides when in solution are in the order repre
sented below, beginning with the highest in each class:–
                           KC),     NaCl,      LiCl.
                           BaCl2,   SrCl2,     CaCl2.
                           ZnCl2,   MgCl2.
    The order of conductivity of the sulphates also appears to
be the same as above.           We thus see that the conductivity of
the salts in the same group, when in solution, diminishes with
the atomic weight of the positive element.
    Magnetic      and Diamagnetic Powers.--It has been noticed
 (Watts's Dict. iii. p. 773) that those metals which are highly
diamagnetic possess large atomic volumes, whereas those which
 are highly magnetic have but small atomic volumes. Thus
 Bi, the most diamagnetic substance known, has the high
 atomic volume 21-2, whilst Fe, Ni, and Co, which are highly
 magnetic, have very low atomic volumes, viz. about 3-5.               The
 relative distances between the atoms, however, are not the
 only cause which conditions the magnetism or diamagnetism
 of a body; for there are several well-known exceptions to the
above rule, as K and Na, which have large atomic volumes,
and are slightly magnetic, while Cu and Zn, on the other
hand, have small atomic volumes, and are slightly diamag
netic."      For elements belonging to the same group, the
 ºngºlin
thus
                     appears to increase with the atomic weight :
   *   In  a paper which will be published shortly in the Ber. deut. chem.
 Ges.,  I have  shown that those elements which belong to Mendeljeff's even
series (vide   supra)  are magnetic, whilst those which belong to odd series
are diamagnetic.      Out of about forty elements to which this rule may be
applied there is not a single exception, unless it be Na—which Faraday
 found to be diamagnetic, and therefore in accordance with the rule,
 whereas Lamy states that it is first repelled and afterwards attracted by
 a magnet.

   Physiological Action.—The results obtained by Gamgee, as
regards the physiological action of ortho-, pyro-, and meta
phosphoric acids, and also of the salts of vanadic acid, appear
to show that there is likewise some regular connexion between
chemical constitution and physiological action.
   Chemical Affinity.     Mutual Displacement of Halogens.—
Potilizin (Chem.    Centr,  1876, p. 577) has determined the
amount of Cl   displaced  by Br when the latter is allowed to act
upon metallic chlorides; and he found that the amount of Cl
replaced by Br was proportional to the atomic weights of the
metals with which the Cl was combined, provided they had
the same atomicity in the respective compounds: thus

   From this it is seen that the higher the atomic weight of
the element (B, Si, Ti, As, Sn) united with Cl, the more is
the Cl replaced by the Br of the CBra; and the higher the
atomic weight of the element united with Br, the less will
that Br be replaced by the Cl of the CC1,.
   Cross and Suguira (Chem. Soc. Journ. 1878, p. 405) have
shown that the amount of O in PbO replaced by the action of
the halogens at a high temperature is the greater the lower the
atomic weight of the halogen.

it is necessary to reduce this thickness as much as possible.
One way of attaining this result would be to narrow the aper
ture; but, as we have seen in preceding sections, to narrow
the horizontal    aperture is really to throw away the peculiar
advantage of large instruments. The same objection, how
ever, does not apply to narrowing the vertical aperture; and
in many spectroscopes a great improvement in definition may
be thus secured.     In general it is necessary that both y and a
be small.    Since the value of is independent of    f      would                                p',it

A*           hypothesis respecting the elementary law according to
            which hydrodiffusion proceeds was first advanced by A.
Fickf       twenty-three years since. The great analogy which ex
ists between the process of hydrodiffusion and that of the con
duction of heat in rigid                  induced Fick to assume
that the elementary law followed by hydrodiffusion is of the
                                                                              i.
same form as that advanced by Fourier at the commencement
of this century for the conduction of heat in rigid substances.
According to that assumption, the quantity of salt which, in
hydrodiffusion, flows in the direction of diminishing concen
tration through any element of surface in a certain              of
time would be    proportional  to the   magnitude   of the surface
element considered, the length of the time-element, the value
of the negative differential quotient of the concentration at the
place of the surface-element in the direction of the current,
and, finally, proportional to a constant the value of which de
#.       on the nature of the salt-solution in which the hydro
  iffusion takes place.    This constant, which may be denoted
by k, was called by Fick the “diffusion-constant.”
    From this elementary law it follows that the diffusion
constant, k, signifies the amount of salt which would pass
through the unit of surface during the unit of time if the de
                                                            º
crement of concentration at the place of this unit of surface
had invariably the value 1 ; and it follows, further, that the
course of the diffusion, in a vessel in which the concentration

488                  Prof. H. F. Weber's Researches on
cedure was such that it could not possibly serve for rigorously
testing the accuracy of the assumed elementary law. Several
times in the last twenty years attempts have been made to
employ more exact methods of measuring, and expecially those
founded on optical principles, for tracing the course of hydro
diffusion,-thus by Voit” in 1866, and by Johannisjanzt in
1877.     The success, however, of these supposed more delicate
optical methods was no greater than that gained by Fick; and
these new investigations do not at              make          all

 solution encompassing the copper electrode rises.               It thence
 follows that    galvanic   elements which are formed of two un
 equally concentrated solutions of copper or zinc sulphate and
 two copper or zinc electrodes dipping in these solutions, must
show an electromotive force of such a direction that the cur
rent produced by it in a closed circuit tends, in consequence
of the migration of the ions, to equalize the existing differences
of concentration. Observations by Wild and by Lindig, many
years since, proved that these electromotive forces really exist,
and that the currents springing from them do flow through
the element in the direction of increasing concentration. The
 most recent experiments, made by                       J.
                                                Moser, have completely

extended series of observations for the purpose of ascertaining
empirically the connexion between the intensities of these
electromotive forces and the concentrations of the salt-solu
tions generating them.          They showed that with greater con
 centrations the electromotive force between two electrodes of
 zinc, or two of copper, which are immersed in two solutions
 of zinc or copper sulphate of different degrees of concentra
tion,  is,  within a  moderate difference                of

   Two adjacent solutions of sulphate of zinc, with the concen
trations 2, and 21 generate therefore, between two zinc elec
trodes immersed in them, an electromotive force the quantity
E of which can be represented by the expression

   By aid of the relation (1) it becomes possible in certain
cases, from the measured electromotive force which makes its
appearance between two zinc electrodes immersed in solutions
of zinc sulphate of different degrees of concentration, to make
a sure induction respecting the amount of difference of con
centration of the solutions.

   By the reduction of the measurement of the concentration
to the measurement of an electromotive force advantages are
gained which are offered by none of the methods hitherto used
for the investigation of diffusion: the accuracy of the mea
surement can be carried to almost any degree desired; the
concentrations measured are not, as in previous methods, mean
concentrations of thin layers of liquid, but are those which
occur in certain surfaces, namely the boundary surfaces in
contact with the electrodes; lastly, the method employed per
mits (and this might be an important advantage) the diffusion
vessel to be carried to any distance we please from the mea
suring-place—for instance a place free from agitation, and
which offers the most constant temperature possible.
   Two essentially different forms of investigation were made
use of: one of them requires, like                         all

 fitted to the bottom of a glass cylinder of about 11 centims.
 width.    Upon the zinc plate a considerably concentrated solu
 tion of  sulphate  of zinc, freed from air, was poured, up to the
 height of l; centims.     The concentration varied in each series
 of experiments between 0.25 and 0.35. A thin disk of cork
 was then laid upon the free surface of the solution, upon which
 a much less concentrated solution (the concentration chosen
 between 0.15 and 0.20) was                             let

the temperature of the room regularly rose during the forenoon,
till about twelve o'clock, about 2°C., to fall exactly as much,
extremely slowly and regularly, from that time till the next
morning. The observations, which in each series were carried
on throughout both day and night, at intervals of three hours
each, showed that the diffusion proceeded with the utmost
regularity during the period from about 1 P.M. to about 7 A.M.;
while for the six hours of the forenoon they gave, day for day,
a somewhat devious course.      This indicated that variations of
temperature even to the amount of only about 2° considerably
disturb the course of diffusion, and that pure results can only
be obtained at as nearly as possible constant temperature of
the diffusion-vessel. (From the experiments afterwards com
municated it will be seen that the method of observation                                         I
have employed is so sensitive that it makes most distinctly
evident the influence of a temperature-variation of as little as
 or °.) Professor Wolf had the kindness         place   my disposalto       at

       was mentioned above, the compensation     method was
used for measuring the electromotive forces.  The compensa

electromotive force : the ascertained variations of it never
exceeded Tºon of           its

   It was not without some little difficulty that the melting-point
of iridium could be determined; that metal in fact necessitates the
employment of hydrogen and oxygen pure and dry in the blowpipe
of Deville and Debray; and to melt 20 grams of iridium not less
than 500 litres of hydrogen and 250 litres of oxygen must be con
sumed.     Nevertheless three experiments were brought to a suc
cessful issue, conducted in the manner indicated for platinum, and
in which 24, 8-970, and 8.404 grams of solid iridium gave up to
the calorimeter, at the temperature of the fusion, respectively 842,
853, and 83.9 units of heat per gram of metal, or a mean of 84.5
units.   If, then, it be admitted that the formula above given repre

(We     here give only the observations made upon eyes of absolutely
normal refraction and visual acuteness, and consequently giving the
surest guarantees of correctness.) We must particularly insist upon
the instances of descent of the curve in the green, which we believe
we are among the first to verify with certainty.       Here are the
figures of one of the experiments for a length of 7 centims. of the
spectrum taken in the interesting                    region                         0.83, 0-76,

1-02. The minimum of acuteness sensibly corresponds to the
middle of the distance between the lines E and F in the green. In
this latter point d and D differ by 6 decimetres; and fourteen
measurements effected over the whole extent of the spectrum give
a perfectly regular curve.
   Let it not surprise that in the observation just reported the visual
acuteness in the defective region still corresponds to about three
fourths of the normal. Direct experiments have shown us that the
visual acuteness varies slowly when the light diminishes in a consi
derable proportion.    Thus it was that, in one of the experiments
made on this question, the intensity of the light varying in the ratio
of 1 to 4, the distance at which one of us had to place himself to
recognize the character varied only in the ratio of 1 to 1:34.     We
have not, however, been able to discover any simple relation between
visual acuteness and intensity of light; and we are engaged in
transforming the present apparatus so as to leave the visual acute
ness constant while making the intensity of the light alone to vary.

    IN studying   the phenomena of the voltaic arc the author
                             º
        has been led to inquire into the actions produced by
    magnets upon movable portions of circuits traversed by
    electric currents.
       It  is not easy to construct a mechanism having a given
    number of degrees of freedom which shall at the same time
    possess sufficient            and freedom from friction to admit
-   of the experimental study of the forces exerted upon such a
    system by the joint action of an external magnetic field and
    of a current traversing the conductor thus constructed. Many
    different forms of apparatus have been devised for exhibiting
    motions of translation and rotation produced by the attrac
    tions and repulsions due to such joint actions; but in         these        all
    the motion was     necessarily  limited     one      two degrees

apparatus of Ampère and Faraday, are of innumerable forms,

       Systems of Bendable Conductors.-Cumming" devised
the elegant  experiment of passing a current         a strip of
gold-leaf which hung vertically between the horizontal poles
of a horse-shoe magnet. The motion of the flexible strip from
or towards the magnet served to indicate the direction of the
current. A telegraph on this principle was suggested by
Highton, and even patented, but never brought into practical
operation.
  Le Roux f, in 1860, studied the action of a powerful mag
net upon a long spiral coil of thin platinum wire raised to
near      its
         fusing-point     the passage                by

            Magnets on Mobile Conductors               of Currents.     507
  IV. Systems of Conductors of which the Electric Arc forms
a Portion.—In 1821, Davy" observed that the electric arc was
affected by a magnet, being apparently drawn towards, or
repelled from between, the poles of a magnet, according to
the direction of the current and the position of the poles of
the magnet.
   In 1844 Casselmannt conducted a research on the influ
ence of the earth's magnetism upon the arc when placed in
various positions. When the arc was horizontal, and so placed
that the current through it flowed from north to south, the
arc was deflected towards the eastern side; when from
       south to north, the arc was deflected towards the west;
       west to east,     y;         3y         27        north ;
       east to west,     2)         **         27        south.
   Later, Walker f found that when the arc is made to pass
from a pole of carbon to one of iron, the iron being at the
same time powerfully magnetized, the arc rotates round the
iron pole, the rotation taking effect in a sense opposed to that
assumed by Ampère for the hypothetical molecular currents.
   Quite recently two lamps have been constructed in which
this phenomenon is turned to account.           M. Fernet has in
this  way  sought  to increase the effective illumination obtain
able in a given direction with a pair of carbon poles arranged
as usual, one above the other in a regulator, a powerful mag
net being placed behind to compel the arc to maintain a posi
tion in front of the carbon poles between which it is produced.
   M. Jamin § has constructed an electric candle in which the
arc is maintained at the extreme end of the two parallel pencils
of carbon by the influence of an external conductor of rectan
gular form traversed in a parallel direction by the same current.
   V. Systems of Conductors of which the Luminous Discharge
through a Rarefied Medium forms a Part.—Plücker | first
drew attention to the remarkable effects produced by a mag
net on the luminous discharges in the Geissler tubes.         De
la Rive's" beautiful apparatus for demonstrating the actual
rotation of the discharge about the pole of a powerful mag
net is also too well knwon to require further comment.      More
recently Mr. Crookes” has devised a number of striking ex
periments, which illustrate in greater detail the laws of elec
trodynamics which determine the movements of currents.

his researches on “Thermal and Electric Conductivity,” read
before the Royal Society of Edinburgh in March and June

as to the inverse variation of thermometric conductivity with
absolute temperature—and in fact that he believes iron to be
possibly exceptional in the inverse connexion of conductivity
and temperature,              all

where b is positive for metals whose conductivity increases
with temperature, but both b and c are negative for those
whose conductivity diminishes with temperature, like iron.
   It will be necessary to reckon temperature, as before, from
the temperature of the enclosure (vo–274 =to) as zero; so
instead of b +t we write m +6, where m-to-H b.
   Similarly, for the law of variation of specific heat and den
sity, we may assume (see § 8),
                      p=3-(1        +                                t) = a(n +6),

heat of        all

than n+                          hence this is the condition which                        will allow

these constants for such metals as we at present possess any
experimental data for. We will assume the temperature of
the enclosure to be 0°C. (so that m = b and n=3, see § 30),
and the highest observed point of temperature (3 on the rod
to be 100° C.: then the following Table contains the values
of the constants A, B, and C for iron and copper, together
with certain ratios which will be used later. The row of num
bers deduced from the experiments of Forbes, confirmed by
Tait, are probably nearly accurate; the others are subject to
discount.

responding values of 6 and r, the constants A, B, C can be
determined, or at least such of them as are required for the
determination of the constants k and m.        In order to deter
mine these constants we must apparently use some method of
successive approximations; and the precise method adopted
will probably be a matter of taste.       may, however, suggest  I
the following    as certainly applicable to the case of k and m
positive, i. e. to equation (36), and as inferentially applicable
to the other case (37) if we can get some imaginary quanti
ties to cancel each other.      We will therefore proceed with
the  general  case, and not trouble about whether the quantities

   Description.—The above-described         first method requires
rather   long periods   of
                         time for the observations,     consequence              in
of  which the   investigation    very  tedious and,
                                        is                account                 on                   of

524              Prof. H. F. Weber’s Researches on
methods of investigation; and       I succeeded in discovering one
which affords the    possibility of   making  within a few hours an
extremely delicate trial of the correctness of Fick's elementary
law of diffusion, and determining within any fraction of an
hour the quantity of the constant of diffusion. By this proce
dure the influences of the temperature and concentration upon
the course of the diffusion can be investigated in a way as
much more exact as it is more convenient. It is as follows:–
    A plane, circular, amalgamated zinc plate forms the bottom
of a shallow glass cylinder about 12 centims. wide. Upon three
places at the margin of this plate bits of a plane-parallel hard
gum plate, each of 0-52 centim. thickness, are put, which have
to support a second amalgamated zinc plate exactly similar to
the lower one. The slight interspace between the two parallel
zinc plates is filled up with a solution of zinc sulphate of any
degree of concentration : in the following experiments concen
 trations between 0.20 and 0.38 were employed. Wires are
 soldered to the two zinc plates in order to send a galvanic
 current through the system consisting of the plates and the
 the solution, or to insertit in the circuit of a galvanometer.    If
 before the experiment the two zinc plates are rubbed down
 and then rinsed with solution of zinc sulphate of the same
 concentration as that which is to fill the interspace between
 them, the system of plates and solution shows itself absolutely
 without any difference of potential when both plates have the
 same temperature; only when the two have not exactly the
 #."
  same temperature does a slight deflection appear on a sensitive
                  in the circuit of which the system is inserted.
     ereupon a galvanic current, maintained constant, is sent
                                 ...;
  through the combination thus prepared, entering through the
  lower plate and issuing                  the upper one.    By the
  migration of the ions the salt-solution becomes more concen
  trated in the boundary layer at the lower zinc plate (the
  anode), and more dilute in the boundary layer at the upper
  (the cathode).      These alterations of concentration of the
  boundary layers are proportional to the intensity and the dura
  tion of the current. Now, as soon as through the action of
  the galvanic current these alterations of concentration com
  mence, the diffusion-current develops itself, which tends to
  counterbalance    the action of the galvanic current.      By the

   When the constant galvanic current has passed through the
combination a suitably long time, and if an exactly specifiable
state of concentration-distribution between the two electrodes
has in consequence arisen, the galvanic current is suddenly
interrupted.   From this moment the solution is exposed to
the action of diffusion only.   The further course of the diffu
sion is now investigated with the aid of the electromotive force
which is generated by the variable concentrations of the boun
dary layers at the two zinc plates.   From the found temporal
course of this electromotive force both the entire course of
i. jºin
  ted.
              can be known and the diffusion-constant calcu
   An eminent advantage of this method consists in the
circumstance that, the distance between the electrodes, and
consequently the time occupied by the entire course of the
diffusion may be made as short as we please, without introdu
cing any uncertainty into the definition of the initial state of
the distribution of concentration from which the observed
diffusion is developed ; at whatever moment the galvanic
current may be interrupted, the distribution of the concentra
tion from layer to layer corresponding to that moment can
always be assigned.
    Theory.—When a galvanic current passes through a zinc
sulphate solution between two zinc electrodes, the quantity of
salt remains unchanged, in spite of the electrolysis that takes
place ; just so the concentration of every single inner layer
of liquid remains constant ; only the boundary layers of the
solution, situated at the electrodes, undergo an alteration of
their concentration: the salt-content of the boundary layer
adjacent to the anode is augmented ; the salt-content of           §:
at the cathode is diminished. The quantity of salt which a
constant current of intensity I, through the processes of electro
lysis and the migration of the ions, brings during the time t
to the boundary of the anode, and carries away from the
boundary at the cathode,      is,
                              according    Hittorf's comprehen

 with the concentration. The concentration used in the follow
ing experiments possessed such high values, and the differences
of concentration produced were kept within such narrow limits,
that the value of n could not vary more than a fraction
per cent.
    In order to ascertain the connexion subsisting between the
concentration 2 in any layer at the depth a below the upper
electrode after the lapse of time t from the commencement of
the current and these two variables w and t, let us start from
the hypothesis that, if the action of the galvanic current at                                    all
influences the progress       the diffusion, this influence asserts
                                       of
itself only    the numerical value of the diffusion-constant
                in                                                                               k.

current passing through the solution simultaneously with the
diffusion did not     any way perceptibly influence the latter.)

   From equation (5), however, an extremely convenient
                          ..
method for the investigation of the course of diffusion is obtained
in the following manner:—
   When the constant galvanic current has traversed the salt
solution during a            long time, say during the time T,
the current is to be interrupted. The differences of concen
tration produced in the different layers by the simultaneous
action of the current and the diffusion will from that instant
  radually be equalized by the diffusion proceeding alone.
#.    gradual equalization can be followed with extraordinary
accuracy, and, on that account, can serve as one of the finest
means of testing the correctness of Fick's elementary law of
diffusion.
   The law according to which this equalization proceeds can
easily be ascertained. In every place a > 0 and < L, and
at any time, the following differential equation is to be
satisfied   :—

It   hence follows that the diffusion-quantity k is not inde
pendent of the concentration, but diminishes, though very
slowly, with ascending concentration.
   In the theory of diffusion, therefore, Fick's elementary law
requires correction in the same manner as Fourier's elemen
tary law in the theory of heat-conduction: as there the
quantity of the internal conduction slowly diminishes as the
temperature rises, so here the quantity of the diffusion gradu
ally sinks to smaller values as the concentration increases.
Fick's hypothesis expresses the course of diffusion with only
the same accuracy with which Fourier's elementary law re
presents the process of the conduction of heat in rigid sub
stances.
 Appendia.-Remarks on so-called Unpolarizable Electrodes.
     Dubois-Reymond, in 1859, ascertained that the polarization
of amalgamated zinc electrodes in aqueous solution of sulphate
of zinc, on the employment of extremely feeble polarizing
currents, is vanishingly little, at                     all
                                        events incomparably less
than that      any other combination.
              of                           He thought that the
combination amalgamated zinc electrodes             zinc-sulphate        in
solution might with reason       designated “unpolarizable.”

   These experiments have hitherto been misconceived, almost
without exception,              by       all
                         who have reported thereon.     Although

unpolarizability exists only approximately with extremely feeble
polarizing currents, and entirely disappears as the intensity
of the current is increased, since that time the false opinion
has prevailed in the literature of galvanism that amalgamated
zinc electrodes in zinc-sulphate solution are unpolarizable.
   The second of the methods of diffusion employed by me
exhibits in the most striking manner the considerable pola
rizability of the combination in question.             Not only does a
demonstrable    polarizability   exist, but upon   it the most rigorous
and most convenient method of measurement of the course of
diffusion can be based. At the same time this method reveals,

                  VIII.       Thermal Radiation                  of the Sun.
     HE    observations on the thermal effect of the radiation of
       the sun were made with pile No. 1 (Duboscq), placed upon
 a platform near to the galvanometer. The pile could easily be
 directed so that the rays of the sun fell perpendicularly on                                    its
 face.    Four readings        the galvanometer were made for each

   Barometric observations were also made ; but we shall see
that these indications, as well as those of the hygrometer, can
not be used except in cases of simultaneous observations made
at different altitudes. Before giving the tables of observations,
it may be useful to show how the value of e, representing the
thickness of the atmospheric stratum traversed by the rays of
the sun, has been calculated.           If at the time of the observa
tion the sun is not more than 60° from the zenith, the formula
e= sec Z gives us the value nearly enough. When the sun is
lower, it is necessary to calculate e by a formula which gives
exact results. At the Mont Souris observatory Pouillet's for
mula is employed; but when the distance from the zenith is
#.      this gives too small a value for e. The values which        I
  ave entered in the following Tables are calculated from the
formula of Bouguer and Laplace, which gives exact and con
cordant results.
                                                     I
   In order to obtain the values quickly, constructed a curve,
the abscissae of which represent the zenithal distances, and the
ordinates the corresponding values of e. In order to trace the
curve   I  used the values contained in the following Table,
which have been calculated by Forbes with the formula of
Laplace.

   The deflections y which have been observed on the galva
nometer are produced by the pencil of solar rays which falls
on the face of the pile, after having traversed a stratum of air
more or less thick according to the altitude of the sun.                              In
this passage the thermal effect of the rays is greatly lessened
through absorption by the air, and especially by the vapour
                              * Hygrometer       = 100.

  542         Prof. F. Rosetti’s Experimental Researches
  contained therein. Before comparing the thermal effect of the
  rays of the sun with that of hot bodies placed at a short dis
  tance from the pile, it is necessary to find out what is the
  diminution                  by the atmospheric absorption in order
  to be able to calculate the thermal effect of the solar rays which
  fall on the face of the pile. To do this we first require to find
  out the law of absorption of the rays of the sun during their
  passage through the terrestrial atmosphere.           It has been ad
           by many physicists that the law is expressed by the
  formula                          q=ab";
     g being the quantity        of heat received in a unit of time by
        the unit of surface
        rays in a place on      i.
                                 perpendicular   to the direction of the
                                    earth's surface,
     a and b being two constants, and
     e a number which represents the thickness of the atmo
        spheric stratum traversed by the rays, taking for unity
          e height of the atmosphere.
     a represents the quantity of heat which in unit time would
 be received on the unit surface perpendicular to the direction
 of the rays at the limits of the atmosphere ; and this is the
 quantity which it is desired to determine.
     b is the proportion of the diminution of this quantity when
 the rays have traversed in the perpendicular direction the
 earth's atmosphere; and this is called the coefficient of ab
 sorption.
     Violle attempted to determine the hygrometric state of the
 air;  and he made simultaneous observations at different heights
 on Mont Blanc.          He found that the phenomenon was pretty
 well represented by the formula
                                  H+ (Z–2)k
 in which a, p, k are constants;
             Z, height of the atmospheric stratum beyond which
                  the vapour appears to cease ;
             z, altitude of the place of observation;
             f,  mean temperature of the vapour contained in the
                 strata of air between Z and z;
             e,  thickness of the stratum of air traversed.
     This is certainly the best method of expressing and estima
ting the law of atmospheric absorption; but it requires simul
taneous observations at different altitudes, and is not applicable
in the case of observations made at one and the same station.
I   have consequently been obliged to have recourse to other
methods.        I  tried at first to apply the formula q=ab" to the
curves obtained in some days of observations; but                I soon

                     on the Temperature        of the  Sun.                  543
found out that this single formula is not sufficient to represent
the phenomenon for one entire day.                 I then tried to employ
other empirical formulae, and in particular the two more com
plex exponential formulae
                                  q=alº     y
                                  q = 2 + m3 + ny",
a,  b, m, n, a,  S, y being empirical constants; but not one of the
formulae   employed      is able to represent with sufficient precision
the whole    phenomenon.

    In this case the formula answers pretty well.
    By applying the same formula to the curve of 28th Sep
 tember for the interval        e = 1°4 and e=2:6, we obtain
                                 a = 29.2°25.
 In the curve      of 1st November, interval e=2-0 and               e = 3-2, we
 have

 For the   10th October,
                                 a =339.95.
 The other curves would give results as much smaller as the
 interval taken for the calculation of the constants was greater.

                   on the Temperature    of the Sun.              545
    Now let us notice the values which were obtained for a and
b.    The values of b in each day's observations were found to
increase with the value of e ; but on different days, for one
and the same value of e we have different values of b. These
facts have been noticed by former observers.
         I
    As have already said, b represents the ratio between the
 quantity of rays which arrive at the face of the pile at the
 place of observation, after having traversed perpendicularly
 the depth e= 1 of the atmosphere, and the rays which it would
 receive if the atmosphere did not exist, i. e. if e were equal to 0.
 It is obvious that if the hygrometric state of the air were dif
 ferent on the different days, the values of bobtained by means
 of the formula corresponding to one and the same value of e
 would also be different.
     It is in accordance with the laws of absorption that b should
 increase as e increases.     In short, the absorption of rays which
 pass through a transparent body is greater in the first strata
 than in the subsequent ones. The observations of 20th Sep
 tember, 24th October, 21st October, and 22nd December show
 that, beyond a certain thicknesse, the coefficient of absorption
 becomes constant.
     Let us now consider    the values   of a.  Each of these values
  represents, in the units chosen for the curve, the true quantity
  of heat which falls on the unit of surface at the limits of the
  atmosphere. We see, nevertheless, that as e diminishes the
  value of a increases; and it is evident that, if we had been able
  to make experiments with less thicknesses of e, we should have
  had greater values for a.      If we express the values of a gra
  phically, taking for abscissae the arithmetic means of the values
  of e (which are found in the last column of the precedin
  Table) which have been employed in the calculation of eac
  of the values of a, and for ordinates the corresponding values
  of a, we find that the different points thus determined arrange
  themselves with very few exceptions in a straight line.          The
  more favourable the condition of the atmosphere on the day
  of observation, the more marked is this regularity.
      Consequently, since a more exact method was required,           I
   decided to take as the true value of a that portion of the axis
   of the ordinates which lies between the origin and the point of
   contact of the above-mentioned straight line with the same
                                                  I
   axis. In order to obtain greater accuracy, determined by the
   method of least squares the equation of the line a=m +ne,
   which approaches nearest to the points representing the values
                                                                I
   of a corresponding to the different mean values of e, and took
   for the value of the quantity sought the number m. This cal
   culation was made for several curves obtained under very dif
   ferent conditions, and gave for m such results as, if we take
   into consideration the causes which necessarily influence

observations     of this nature, we ought to regard as pretty                        con

   The calculations made for four other days gave for mean
value a=318.7.      Thus the mean of eight days was a = 323-4
divisions.   In order to give an adequate idea of the exactness,
I need only remark that, a being represented in divisions of
the galvanometer when sixteen Siemens units were introduced
.
into the circuit, one division would correspond to Po of a
degree; so that the greatest difference between the values of a
    I
     the mean value is not more than 3 degrees.
     wished to find out what values bought to have in order that
the formula should give for a the value which we have just
determined.       I
                  found that if we subtract 0.08 from each value
of b calculated,  we obtain a number, bi=b–0:08, which gives
satisfactory values for a. Thus, if with the numbers deduced
from the curves (Table VIII.), we reckon the value of a by
the formula y = al<U+017F>, giving to b, the values found for b
(Table IX.) minus 0:08, we have values which are not far
from the mean, a =323:4 (see the following Table).

  The arithmetic mean of these values is y=1687; and if we
determine the mean value of b corresponding to e =2:7, we
obtain the number

 the radiation from the artificial sources, and    determine                   so

 548         Prof. F. Rosetti's Experimental Researches
    X.    Determination    of the effective  Temperature   of the Sun.
    We have seen that the thermal effect which the solar radia
 tion, falling perpendicularly on the blackened face of pile No. 1,
 *
 would produce if there were no atmosphere, or if the pile
   y
        situated at the higher limit of the atmosphere, is expressed
                           a=323 divisions.
    The solar observations were made with sixteen Siemens resist
 ance units introduced into the circuit, whilst those on the
 radiation from artificial sources were made with no other resist
 ance in the circuit than that offered by the pile itself, the
 rheophores, and the wire of the galvanometer.              In short, in
 order to compare the solar observations with the others and
 to apply to them the formula, it is necessary to convert the
 value of a=323 into the value y, which would have given the
 same solar radiation      if the sixteen Siemens units        É.   been
 omitted. For this purpose it is necessary to find the resist
 ance offered by the pile, the rheophores, and the wire of the
  alvanometer.      The mean value from a dozen experiments was
  '408 Siemens units. The values furthest from the mean were
 3.374 and 3:496.
a mean value of 3.411.          I
                       Nine experiments made another day gave
                                   therefore took R=341 Siemens
               :-
units to express the total resistance.           Separately, the resist
anceS Were

   The value of y can now be easily calculated:
                 - hº        a E           a = 5'6921 a.
Since a=323,
                        y=1838.5 divisions.
   The effective temperature of the sun may be defined as that
temperature which an incandescent body of the same size
placed at the same distance ought to have in order to produce
the same thermal effect w if it had the maximum emissive
power, i.   e. E=1.     In this case we could apply       the formula
                    y=mT”(T-6)—n(T-6);
and   if  we consider the surrounding temperature during the
observations to have been about 24°, giving 6=297, we obtain
                            T=10238°4;
so  that the effective    temperature      of the sun, represented    in

                        on the Temperature              of   the   Sun.                549
degrees Centigrade, is
                              ''        (=9965°4,
if we only take into consideration the absorption produced by
the terrrestrial atmosphere.                  If
                                 we neglected this absorption
we should have a lower temperature.     In short, in the obser
vations made, the maximum was obtained on September 28th
at midday: this is represented by 210 scale-divisions, which
gives for y the value
                            y=5'6921 x 210=1195-3.
If we    introduce this value into the formula, we obtain
                    w
                                        T=88838,
giving
                                        t = 8610-8.
   This result will be greatly modified if we take into
                                              .
account the absorption exercised by the solar atmosphere.
According to Secchi, the solar atmosphere exercises a very
powerful absorption on the       which proceed from the photo
sphere: on account of this absorption only        of the solar          tº
radiation pass beyond the atmosphere of the sun, whilst
are absorbed by             it.   If
                        we regard this value given      Secchi                    by
as correct, we can calculate the thermal effect which the sun
would produce         were without atmosphere.
                        if    it                    This effect
would be
                                               100
                            y=1838.5                     15320-8.
                                          x    T2    =
The formula gives
                                        T=206537,
and consequently
                                        t=20380°7.
There are still two causes which can modify these results;
but certainly their effect        slight, since their influences are
                                        is
contrary and           so
                    compensate one another. One              these causes of
is the value     the specific emissive power
                   of                               the sun, which may
                                                                   of

  I hope with this explanation of the cause of the delay, you will
now allow me to assert my claim, especially as Dr. Allman, in
a note of November 13th, says, “you are quite right in assert
ing your claim to priority” &c., and “you are liberty to make

    As a very early investigator into those most interesting
phenomena,      I
               cannot afford to allow my discoveries to be un
recognized, without an appeal.      It is highly satisfactory to
find this supported by so high an authority as Professor                                   All
mann, who in his letter of the 9th November writes:—“I have
been refreshing my memory of your researches, by reading
your published account of them; and their completeness and
conclusiveness render my regret the greater, that had not                   I
given them the recognition they so well merit.”

 tively 16.4 and 85.1 volumes per cent.               copper, probably   of
 because the alloys between these points are too brittle                                              to
 permit their being formed into wire.

 LXV.       Note on a Determination of the Specific Electrical Re
     sistance of certain Copper-Tin Alloys. By OLIVER       LoDGE,       J.
     D.Sc., Assistant Professor of Physics in University College,
     London".
      N    the 5th  of November         I
                                   received from Mr. Chandler
           Roberts three rods of certain very brittle copper-tin
 alloys which he had with some difficulty cast, in order that I
 might determine their specific resistance per unit of volume
 by ordinary processes, because the readings which the induc
 tion-balance gave for disks of these three metals indicated that
 their conductivities did not by any means agree with Mat
 thiessen's curve of electric conductivity for copper-tin alloys,
 though, on the other hand, they did agree with some severely
 criticised and discarded experiments of Messrs. Calvert and
 Johnson on the conductivities of these same alloys for heat.
     The rods, which are hereafter spoken of as A, B, and C, were
 about 9 millimetres thick and from 30 to 40 centimetres long.
 The method which             I
                          employed to determine their conductivity
 was scarcely altered from that which was described by Prof.
 Foster and myself in this Journal in 1875f ; and the results
 which     I have obtained        I
                                 believe to be somewhat accurate.
 It was not worth while to aim at any very eaccessive accuracy,
 though the method is quite capable of it (by a calibration of
 the bridge-wire), because the temperature of the alloys was a
 little indefinite, being simply that of the room.
     The three rods were laid end to end in a groove in a long
piece of wood so that they just projected above                   its
                                                          surface; and
their ends were then screwed            up
                                       into secure contact with pads
of tinfoil between. The resistance of the contacts           not of the is
slightest consequence, provided          remains constant and
                                        it                          mo        is

                       measurements being made within the length
of the rod itself.

       Specific Electrical Resistance of Copper-Tin Alloys.                         555
   The observation of resistance consisted in placing the slider
at a definite point on one of the rods, and feeling about on the
bridge-wire with another slider for a point of the same potential.
The slider on the rod was then shifted to another part of the
same rod and the bridge-slider shifted correspondingly.      The
shifts on the bridge-wire (German silver) were of course rather
                                                                           º

moreover, the resistances in the circuit were so adjusted that
any step along the rods corresponded to a step of 3-62 times
the resistance along the bridge-wire.      It is needless to
that a weak battery and a reflecting galvanometer were used,
and that the contacts were only made momentarily.       As an ex
ample of the error to be expected     may quote the      I
   Two different steps along rod A gave, as the step on the
bridge-wire corresponding to the resistance of 1 centimetre
length of the rod A, the numbers
                    •0328 and 0325 centim.
Two different steps along rod B gave
                                •0269 and '0270 centim.
Different steps along rod C, which was a trifle less uniform,

       '123, 121, 1177, 1173, -1185, 1171 centim.
  As        the step 1185 was deduced from the entire length of the
rod,    I    have taken this as the mean.  The steps which gave
“123 and 121 were short ones; and their probable error is
therefore greater than that of the others. Moreover they were
made at the thinner end of the not quite cylindrical rod. As
regards the mean cross section of the rods, it was estimated by
                                                                           to all

   To get the value of the bridge-wire-readings in absolute

   diate antecedent is heavy rainfall concentrated over a portion of the
   Bay, accompanied by strong indraught, most marked from the Indian
   Ocean at the entrance of the Bay. This indraught from the Indian
   Ocean gives rise to strong winds and heavy rain at the stations on
   the south and west coasts of Ceylon.”
     “The air-motion in cyclones is one of indraught; and therefore
  the wind-direction at any point is not at rightangles to the direction
  of the centre. The stream-lines or the lines of air-motion are
  spiral curves. The relation between the wind-direction and the
  direction of the centre is probably not invariable, but depends on
  the intensity of the storm or the baricgradient. The law as laid down
  by Mr. Wilson in the report of the Midnapore cyclone is probably
  the nearest approximation. With the face to the wind, the direction
  of the centre is from ten to eleven points to the right-hand side.”

 C. Callaway, Esq., D.Sc. Lond., F.G.S.
     The author commenced by describing the physical geography of
 the ridges intervening between the vicinity of Wellington and the
 Longmynds, viz. Lilleshall Hill, the Wrekin, and the chain of the
 Caradoc Hills.      He passed on to describe the stratigraphy.       At
 Lilleshall are   slaty  beds dipping about N.N.W., and a rhyolitic
 agglomerate; at the N. end of the Wrekin a granitoid soil, pro
 bably of clastic origin, with a mass of decomposed intrusive rhyolite.
 The Wrekin consists of rhyolitic agglomerates, with (probably) lava
 flows and a few basalt dykes, the general dip of the bedded rocks
being to the N. At the southern end (Primrose Hill) granitoid
gneisses (some closely resembling the hornblendic gneiss of Malvern)
occur.     In the Caradoc range intrusive greenstones are more largely
developed; but here also are bedded Pre-Cambrian rocks.           Other
smaller exposures in this vicinlty were also described.  The prevalent
strike over the whole district is about E.N.E.—W.S.W.          The evi
dence of their age is often very clear, as they are overlain (with
marked unconformity) by quartzites (sometimes containing rhyolitic
fragments) which are clearly much older than the Hollybush Sand
stones.

   In this paper the authors refer to a blue mineral of a somewhat
remarkable character, which was specially noticed during an excur
sion of the Inverness Field Club in September 1877. This excursion
was made to Englishton Moor and neighbourhood, distant west
wards from Inverness about 5 miles, where the mineral occurs in
scattered blocks. It has since been noticed at Moniack Burn,
Reelig Glen, and South Clunes Farm,                                 all

    6.  “The Formation of Rock-basins.”          By  J. D. Kendall, Esq.,
C.E., F.G.S.
    The author    discusses the mechanical difficulties involved in the
glacier-excavation theory of lake-basins, and suggests that they are
due to the action of falling water engulfed in the crevasses of the
ancient glaciers, being thus of the nature of “giants' kettles,” though
on an enlarged scale.
    7. “On the Diorites of the Warwickshire Coal-field.”           By S.
Allport, Esq., F.G.S.
    The diorites are intrusive in the lower and unproductive measures
of the above field and the underlying Millstone Grit below Ather
stone and Marston Jabet (two miles south of Nuneaton).               The
author describes their microscopic characters. One variety is very
 finely crystalline, and contains brown hornblende ; another con
tains plagioclase felspar with a little orthoclase, small crystals of
brown hornblende, many crystals of clear yellowish augite, and
 several pseudomorphs after olivine, with apatite, magnetite, &c. A
 mineral also occurs belonging to the hexagonal system, which the
 author suspects to be magnetite. Other varieties are described, one
 of which contains augite with hornblende. These rocks differ con
 siderably from the syenites of Leicestershire.

 from the Carboniferous Series of Northumberland.”          By W. Percy
 Sladen, Esq., F.G.S., F.L.S.
    9. “On the Ancient River-deposit of the Amazon.”               By C.
 Barrington Brown, Esq., A.R.S.M., F.G.S.
    The author described a series of alluvial deposits, varying in
 thickness from 10 to 160 feet, which have been cut through by the
 river, and form a series of cliffs, giving rise to striking and cha
 racteristic scenery. The succession of beds exposed in these cliffs was
illustrated by a number of sections; and it was shown that the strata
in question must have been deposited by river-action.         It was then
 pointed out that the river is performing two classes of work—namely,
 cutting away the older sheets of alluvial matter, and depositing the
 materials derived from them at a much lower level. The interesting
 phenomena of the cutting of curves by the river, and the abandon
 ment by the river of parts of these curves, giving rise to the forma
 tion of lakes, was fully explained; and in conclusion the author
 showed by a map what vast areas in South America have thus been
 covered by these alluvial deposits.
     10. “The Glacial Deposits of Cromer.”        By Clement Reid, Esq.,
 F.G.S.
    The author described    the beds shown in the cliffs between    Wey
 bourn and Happisburgh.        The classification adopted was:—

568                        Geological     Society:-
      Sands and Gravels (Middle Glacial?).
      Bedded sand and marl.                      -
                                     Contorted Drift.
      Sedimentary Boulder-clay. }
      Fine Sands.
      2nd Till (unstratified Boulder-clay).
      Intermediate Beds (laminated marl &c.).
      1st Till (unstratified Boulder-clay).
      Arctic Freshwater Bed.
   The beds below the 1st Till were not described; the 1st and 2nd
Tills were  considered to have been formed by land-ice coming from
the W. or W.N.W.; while the Intermediate Beds appear to be
stratified glacier-mud deposited on the retreat of the ice.       The
Sands are probably marine; and so also appear to be the Contorted
Drift and Middle Glacial.       Glacial beds later than the Chalky
Boulder-clay appear to be represented near Cromer by valley
deposits which were not treated of in this paper.
   In dealing with the question of the age and mode of formation of
the contortions, the author pointed out that all, with the doubtful
exception of a few of the smaller ones, affected not only the Con
torted Drift but also the Middle Glacial, while, at the same time,
contortions affecting the overlying beds were often much more com
plicated at the base, and rested on an even, undisturbed surface of
the Preglacial beds. This he accounted for by considering the con
tortions to be formed by an advancing ice-sheet, which pushed
before it a mound of the older glacial beds, while the beds below
the level of the base of the ice were undisturbed; thus the junction
of the contorted and uncontorted beds is a horizontal fault-line.
The ice-sheet he referred to the period of the Chalky Boulder-clay.
   The author drew attention to the fact that the hollows in which the
Middle Glacial gravels rest are in every instance due to contortion,
and not to erosion. The large masses of chalk in Boulder-clay
were considered to have been torn off by the same force that pro
duced the contortions.
   11. “On a Disturbance of the Chalk at Trowse, near Norwich.”
By Horace B. Woodward, Esq., F.G.S.
   Attention was drawn to a section at Trowse, where the Chalk with
bands of flint was uplifted at an angle of about 37°.     Abutting.
against the Chalk was a mass of the same rock rearranged, con
taining broken flints, and pebbles of flint, quartz, and quartzite.
This rearranged Chalk was traced underneath the uplifted beds;
and the author gave reasons for believing that the disturbance was
produced by the agent (land ice) which formed the Chalky Boulder
clay. Allusion was made to many cases of glaciated Chalk in
Norfolk, and to the cervine and other organic remains occasionally
met with in         Comparing the Trowse section with that
                                                                      to at
                it.
Litcham, described by Mr.       S.Wood, Jun., the author came
                                     W.
the conclusion that this was     asimilar and striking instance  ofthe
incipient formation   of   huge Chalk boulder, serving
                           a                               throw light
                                                           to
on the origin ofthe large transported masses seen     in
                                                     the Cromer cliffs.

hend M.   Hall,  Esq.,  F.G.S.
    13. “On a Section of Boulder-clay and Gravels at Ballygalley
Head. By T. Mellard Reade, Esq., C.E., F.G.S."
   The section described is in a gravel-pit about 30 feet deep, situa
ted between Larne and Cushendall, in the north of Ireland. It shows
a considerable thickness of false-bedded gravel and sand, containing
shells, covered by Boulder-clay.        The shells collected from the
sand and gravel of this section do not, however, agree with those
found in the so-called “Interglacial beds” of Lancashire; and the
author regards the section as confirming his views that the tripartite
division of the drift–deposits is not, as maintained by Hull and other
geologists, equally applicable to the Irish and Lancashire deposits.
   14. “On the Augitic Rocks of the Canary Islands.”             By Prof.
Salvador Calderon. Communicated         by the President.
   As the result of a long investigation of the eruptive rocks of the
Canaries, and especially of Las Palmas, the author has come to the
conclusion that there are two groups of such rocks in those islands
—an older one, characterized by the presence of hornblende, and a
newer, containing augite.        In the latter he finds the essential
minerals to be plagioclase, augite, magnetite, olivine, sanidine, and
nepheline; and he distinguishes among them the following kinds of
rocks, all of which have their characteristic minerals imbedded in a
paste of augite and plagioclase :—1. Augite-andesite, with a small
quantity of sanidine; 2. Tephrine, with no sanidine, but abundance
of nepheline; 3. Basanite, with some peridote; 4. Nepheline-basalt
with abundance of peridote; 5. Dolerite, crystalline, characterized
by the disappearance of nepheline, the abundance of peridote and
porphyritically imbedded plagioclase, augite, and olivine; 6. Felspa
thic basalt (like 5, but semicrystalline); and 7. Essentially olivinic
                                                                  w
modern lavas.
    15. “On the Cambrian (Sedgw.) and Silurian Beds of the Dee
 Walley, as compared with those of the Lake-district.”          By J. E.
Marr, Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
   The principal differences in these districts appear to be due,
(1) to the non-correspondence of the epoch of volcanic activity,
(2) to the upheaval and consequent denudation of a part of North
Wales after the end of the Cambrian period. The author correlates
the deposits in the two areas, the Dee valley having deposits parallel
to the various members in the Lake-district, from the Skiddaw
Slates to the Upper Coldwell beds inclusive.      The Lower Bala series
contains ash-beds which appear to be andesite.            In the Middle
 Bala of Wales are some fossils which, in the Lake-district, occur in
 the Ashgill Shales above the Coniston Limestone.           He finds the
equivalents of the Graptolitic Mudstone of the Lake-district, near
Carrig-y-druidion, correspondent in stratigraphical position, litho
logical character, and fossils. One Graptolite, G. colonus, however,
occurs at a higher horizon in the Lake-district.           In the lowest
division of the Denbigh Grits Acroculia haliotis is found, which, in the
Lake-district, occurs in the Upper Coldwell beds; and in the upper

Slates and        Kirby-Moor Flags, thus giving further indications of

                    ON THE ABNORMAL SPECTRUM OF LIGHT.
                     BY M. DE KLERCKER, OF STOCKHOLM.
    The anomaly produced in the spectral position of various rays of
light when dispersion is occasioned by solutions of certain colouring
matters has for several years past deservedly attracted attention.
    The rays, of different sorts, whose index of refraction increases
in ordinary cases in proportion as the length of the luminous waves
diminishes from one end of the spectrum to the other, are here
thrown out of their normal positions; moreover this change of posi
 tion may be carried to such a degree that the usually most refran
gible rays, the blue and the violet, appear the least refrangible of
all, as is best proved when the light is dispersed by means of a solu
tion of fuchsine (aniline red).
    There     is,
               however, nothing        this phenomenon which would dis
                                                   in

acting alone. But          we must seek elsewhere the origin
                              if                                            the                    of

                                  admit that the refraction           light                  of          by
the fuchsine solution takes place for certain rays              quite another      on
 scale than for the rest; and          this property

                    of                the molecules        the colouring ma
terial, we may thence conclude that these must possess the hitherto
unknown property          retarding only certain luminous rays while

they permit the others         pass freely.

rated more and more, each presenting an altogether special optical
property.     One of these parts went pretty quickly to the right of
the   cross-thread,  increasing little by little in breadth, and finally
became a distinct spectrum containing in the regular order the less
 refrangible rays red, orange, and yellow, with Fraunhofer's lines
 A, B, C, and D distinctly visible; while the other part, which as
 sumed a violet-blue colour at the moment of separation, remained
 still in     its
             original place during the progress       the concentration,         of
