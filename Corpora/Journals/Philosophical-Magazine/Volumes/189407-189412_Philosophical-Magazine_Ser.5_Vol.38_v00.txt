     The Attraction of Unlike Molecules.—I. The Diffusion of
              Gases. By William Sutherland*.
IN my previous papers on the laws of molecular force the
      attractions of like molecules have been under considera
tion, and the results seemed to indicate that the laws of
the attractions of unlike molecules would not be difficult to
ascertain. With the hope of determining the general law of
attraction of any two molecules, I adopted two methods as
being at present available for giving values of the attrac
tions of unlike molecules, namely, that of the Diffusion of
Gases and that of the Surface-Tension of Mixed Liquids.
Both methods have led to the same result, viz., that if the
attraction between two molecules M, of mass ml at distance r
apart be denoted by SAxm^/r4, and that between two molecules
M2 by SA^n^/r4, then the attraction between an Mx and an M2 is
                         3 vA1A2m1w2/r4,
or the attraction of two unlike molecules is equal to the
 square root of the product of the attractions of the corre
 sponding like molecules at the same distance apart. As the
 expression 3A,??*,2 for two like molecules can be split into
 two parts \/3A1nii, the general law of the attraction of any
two molecules, like or unlike, can be stated thus :—Any two
molecules attract one another with a force inversely pro
 portional to the fourth power of the distance between them

and directly proportional to the product of the parameters
  V3Awi characteristic of each. Although the parameter is
written in the form i/'6Am apparently involving the mass m
it will be shown that VdAm is independent of the mass m
but is a function of the size of the molecule ; it would there
fore be better denoted by a single symbol a, so that the
attraction between any two molecules M: and Ms is a^a^r*, or
between two Mx is a//r*, the parameter a being a function of
the size of the molecule b-it not directly of its mass. Thus,
with GwjWj/r2 to denote th« gravitational attraction of two
molecules Mx and M2, the general expression for the force
between them is
                         Gwjwij/r2 + HjOj/r*.
   The dependence of the coefficient of diffusion of two gases
on the attraction between their moltr<:ules was indicated in
general terms in a recent paper on the Viscosity of Gases and
Molecular Force (Phil. Mag., Dec. 1893\ In that paper it
was shown that in those parts of the kineuS^Aeory of gases
which depend on the number of encounters of j^aaolecule per
second (or, in other words, on its mean free path),^H^rffcct of
molecular force cannot be neglected as of only seconiT?
importance ; it is fundamental. Thus the complete expres
sion for the coefficient of diffusion of two gases will involve
the attractions between their molecules in a manner now to
be established ; but as the kinetic theory of the diffusion of
gases, even when simplified by treating the molecules as
forceless, is in a little confusion (there being at least three
forms of expression for the diffusion-coefficient in the field),
it may be desirable to recapitulate briefly the theories of the
diffusion of forceless molecules from the three points of view.
   The first in time is that of Stefan, accepted by Maxwell ;
the second is 0. E. Meyer's, given in his book on the ' Kinetic
Theory of Gases ;' and the third is that of Tait (Trans. Roy.
Soc. Edin. xxxiii.), who has treated the diffusion of gases
rather elaborately.
   Stefan's theory is this :—If two gases are diffusing into one
another, then at any point one has a general velocity ax in
one direction, and the other a velocity oj in the »ther, the
density of the first diminishes in the direction of au of the
second in that of a2. Consider, then, an element of the first
of section unity and length hx in the direction of «i : the
partial pressure due to its molecules at one end is pu and at
the other pi + Sxdpt/dx, so that there is a driving pressure
8a; dm/d.v which is resisted by a resistance like friction offered
by the other gas in the length Ba, which may be denoted by

                   Attraction of Unlike Molecules.               3
 RSx, and then any acceleration of the element of the first
 gas is due to the force Sx (dpx/dx — R), but this acceleration
 can be neglected in comparison with either Sx dpjdx or ft Bx,
and we have
                            U = dpjdx                          (1)
    R has now to be evaluated ; it is the resistance offered by
 the molecules of the two sets in unit volume at x to one
 another's motion. Let v be the number of encounters per
second between          molecules of the first set in unit volume
and n.2 of the second, and let ft be the average value of the
momentum communicated when a molecule of the first set
with velocity at collides with one of the second with velocity
02 in the opposite direction, then
                                 H = vfi.
 If ax and a2 are the radii of the molecules of the two sets
 treated as spheres, and 3icli/2 and 3«2s/2 are their mean
square velocities, then (see for instance Tait, Trans. Roy. Soc.
Edin. xxxiii.)
                   v=2n1n2(a1 + a2)M(*,2 +
                        2 »i,»?2           .
                  /U= ^      ;    0*i + *».)•
 Now in diffusion the pressure remains constant, so that as
 many molecules of one sort pass in one direction as of the
 other in the other, or 71^= n^, and accordingly
 but «i»n1 = p1, the density of the first gas, and
            Pi=n1m1Ki/2=pi/c12/2, so that (1) becomes
          _dpi3       Ki       m,4-m2           1              ,n\
    Pl<Xl ~ dx~ 8    +           m% 7ri(«i + a2)2 (n, + n2)' ' ( }
 The coefficient of dpjdx is by definition the coefficient of
 diffusion D ; remembering that «1'-i/«22=TO2/m1, we get
             D_3 /wh+gA*                      1                 (4x
                  8 \ m2 J ¦7Ti(_al + a2)\n1 + n2y              K>
    Meyer's method of proceeding is quite different. He says
 that as the density of one of the diffusing gases diminishes
 in one direction, then, if a plane is drawn anywhere at right
 angles to this direction, the density increases on one side and
  diminishes on the other, so that more molecules cross the
                                   B 2

4                Mr. William Sutherland on the
Slane from the side of increasing density than from that of
  ecreasing density, and diffusion results. Thus if n1 is the
number of molecules per unit volume at the plane, that at a
small distance x from it will bo nl + xdrii/dx. The number
of molecules leaving an element dx after encounter in it to
cross the plane before the next encounter must be proportional
to nx + xdnj/dx, to d.v, to the mean number of collisions per
second fi/Xi, where \j is the mean free path of the molecules
of the first set near .r, and finally to e~xlx* the probability of
a path greater than x, so that the number of molecules of
the first set which cross the plane from one side in unit time
is proportional to
                     n («i + xdnjdx) e~llk> dx/'Xi
                 f
 (although x was stipulated to be small to justify the expres
sion «! + xdn^dx, no harm can come of integrating to oo ,
because the value of the integral becomes negligible for all
values of a: greater than a few times Xj). The number of
molecules crossing from the other side is proportional to
                      vi (ni —xdriijdx) e~*/K> dxfK^
                 J"
                 Jo
so that the excess accumulating in unit time on one side
is proportional to
                     2«i I ze~llKi dxdnj/dxXi,
that is to 2v1\1dn1/dx. The number of molecules of the
otber set crossing in the opposite direction is proportional to
2Fs\idni/dx. As these two expressions are not equal, there
is a gain of molecules on one side of the plane and a loss on
the other proportional t«
                   2(-vi\1dn1/dx — v2\dni/dx) ;
and to preserve the uniformity of pressure Meyer supposes a
bodily motion of the mixed gases to take place so as to carry
this number of molecules in the opposite direction, of which
the fraction n,/^ 4 «s) belongs to the first set and «j/(ni + ws)
to the second : thus the diffusion-stream of the first gas is
proportional to
                  drii       2w! /_ dnx - dnt\
                  dx       ni + n3\     dx      J dx J
that of the other being equal and opposite. On account
of the uniformity of pressure, dnl/dx=dn1/dx and the diffusion

                  Attraction of Unlike Molecules.              5
stream is proportional to
                         0dni nju^Kx + ntv 2Xj
                          ax      nt + «j
and the diffusion-coefficient to
                     (jij^Xi + n^Xj)/^! + Ti,).
   The defect of Meyer's theory is that it takes no account of
the actually existing diffusion velocities in the two seta.
Supposing the process of diffusion to be arrested suddenly by
some cause which then suddenly ceases to act, Meyer's
method shows how the diffusion-streams would begin to flow
again, but it cannot follow the process after that, because it
takes no cognizance of the bodily motions existing in the two
sets.
   Tait's theory takes account of both Stefan's and Meyer's
causes ; he supposes the molecules of each medium besides
their velocities of agitation to have velocities of translation
en masse «j and a^, and then calculates the quantities of each
flowing in unit time across unit section, these quantities
depending on «i and a3 and on expressions similar to Meyer's.
The velocities «i and «2 are determined exactly as in Stefan's
method, so that Tait's method labours under this difficulty,
that he supposes each molecule of each set to have a certain
velocity combined with the velocity of agitation, and yet
this velocity is different from that of the set as a whole.
   On theoretical grounds, therefore, Stefan's theory appears
not to have been improved by the later attempts, and, further,
it seems to me not to have been sufficiently recognized that
Stefan has given satisfactory experimental proof of the sound
ness of his method of treating the diffusion problem ; for
exactly on the lines of his theory of the diffusion of two gases
into one another he constructed a theory of the evaporation of
a liquid into a gas, which led to a striking formula for the
velocity of evaporation of a liquid, a formula verified by his
own and Winkelmann's experiments. As Stefan's elegant
theory of evaporation will only take a few lines to reproduce
here, and as it gives a valuable method of determining dif
fusion-coefficients, it may as well be reproduced in the present
connexion.
   Suppose a tube half filled with a liquid whose properties
are to be denoted by suffix 1 evaporating into an atmosphere
with suffix 2, but with fresh liquid added from below so as
always to keep the free surface of the liquid at a fixed mark
on the tube; then, when a stationary state is established, there
is a steady diffusion-stream of the vapour through the upper

 6                 Mr. William Sutherland on tlie
 half of the tuhe while the gas in the tube is at rest. Thus, in
 Stefan's theory of diffusion already given, we have only
 to put oj=0 and we can proceed at once to calculate the
 velocity of evaporation in terms of the coefficient of diffusion.
 In the expression (2) for R, u^l + njnj) stands for «i+«2> s<>
 that if a3 = 0 the term nj/nj in R drops out, and the equations
 (3) and (4), which can be written pla1=:Ddpi/dx, will in the
 case of evaporation have to be written
                             _T.dplnl + ni
 Let pi and p% be the partial pressures of vapour and gas, and
p the total pressure px +p3 at which the evaporation is going
on, then (nl + na)/ni=p/pi; and if p is the density of the
vapour under some standard pressure P, then pt can be taken
as equal to ppi/P if the departure from Boyle's law is not
too great, and then the last equation becomes

but p^! is the mass of vapour that crosses each unit section
of the tube in unit time, and in the steady state is constant :
therefore d\og (p—pt)/dx is constant. Let h be the distance
of the liquid surface below the open end of the tube, where
pi is 0 while at the liquid surface it is pt the saturation-
pressure of the liquid at the temperature of the experiment,
then

   This is Stefan's expression (Sitz. Akad. Wien, lxviii. 1873)

                  Attraction of Unlike Molecules.               7
In the case where the level of the liquid is allowed to fall the
velocity of the gas is not exactly 0, and in a later paper
{Sits. Akad. Wien, xcviii. 1890) Stefan has given a cal
culation wherein the small value of *3 is taken account of.
By very simple experiments on the evaporation of ethyl
oxide and carbon disulphide in test-tubes, Stefan verified his
expression first as regards the relation of h and t at constant
temperature, that is at constant pt, and then as regards the
very characteristic factor log/)/(p —pt) in which the satura
tion-pressure enters, by studying the evaporation of ethyl
oxide at temperatures ranging from 110,3(3. to 28°-7, where
the range in the saturation-pressure p, is from 302 millim. of
mercury to 605.
   Winkelraann has still more thoroughly verified Stefan's
evaporation theory in applying it in an extended series of
experiments to the determination of the diffusion-coefficients
of a number of vapours into air, hydrogen, and carbon
dioxide (Wied. Ann. xxii., xxiii., xxxiii., xxxvi.). As regards
the formula (5) the most important part of Winkelmann's
work is his further verification of the soundness of the factor
l°g P/(P~PS) by varying p in the case of water from 61
millim. to 749, while pt was about 1"5 millim.
   The correctness of Stefan's formula (4) for the diffusion of
gases composed, of forceless molecules seems to me therefore
to be well assured by the successful application of the
 principles involved in it to the details of the process of
evaporation; and the foregoing brief sketch of his theory
serves as the most natural introduction to a theory of gaseous
diffusion wherein the attractions of molecules are taken
account of.
    Let us first see wherein the expression
               D _ M + m,^              3*i
                    V m3 ) ^{a^a^in^n^
 for the diffusion-coefficient of forceless molecules applies
to natural gases and wherein it fails to apply. As m^,2 is
 proportional to absolute temperature T, and nl + ni is pro
 portional to p/T, where p is the pressure at which the diffusion
 goes on,

 Thus the theoretical diffusion-coefficient varies inversely
 as the pressure, which has been proved experimentally by
 Loschmidt to be the case for the natural gases (Site. Akad.

8                Mr. William Sutherland on the
 Wien lxii. 1871). The theoretical coefficient also varies as
the 3/2 power of the absolute temperature, but it has been
shown by Loschmidt and Obermayer (Sitz. Akad. Wien, lxi.,
lxii., lxxv., lxxxi., lxxxv., lxxxvii., xcvi.), in experiments
on several pairs of gases, that their coefficients of diffusion
vary more rapidly with temperature than according to the
theoretical law. They found empirically that the coefficients
vary as powers of the temperature, ranging from 1'75 to 2
instead of the 1*5 of the theory of forceless molecules. Here
is where the effect of molecular force comes in, just as in the
case of viscosity.
   In connexion with viscosity it was shown that with like
molecules the effect of molecular force on the number of
collisions of spherical molecules of radius a is to make it the
same as for forceless molecules in which (2a)2 is increased to
 (2a)2{l + 2mf(l/2a)/Y*\, where m2/(l/2a) is the potential
energy of two molecules in contact, and T2 is the mean
square of the relative velocity. So for unlike molecules of
masses mx and m2 and radii ax and a2, with potential energy
mim2f0-/ai + #2) a* contact and mean relative squared velocity
V2, the effect of molecular force on the number of collisions
is to make it the same as for a pair of forceless spheres with
(ax + a2)2 enlarged in the ratio
                 {1 + K + ^/a/aH^/V1'}.
   Now Vi and »as denoting the mean squared velocities of Wj
and m2,

and           *!* + «22 = *!*(! + a*2/*!2) = k^ (1 + m^m^ ,
so that the ratio becomes
                   1 + m1m3f (1/ax + a2) /§ro^2,
or                 1 + m^itf^l/ai + a^/m^11,
which may be written          1 + iC2/T,
and then the expression for the diffusion-coefficient of attracting
molecules derived from (6) for forceless molecules is
            D a Pt1

                           : m%1\i){ <h + a2)2(l1 + iC/T) • ' - (7)
As the diffusion-coefficients are all referred to a pressure of
one atmosphere, we have for the ratio of D2 at T2 to Dx at Tlf

   The experimental determinations for any one pair of gases
are not numerous enough, or at widely enough separated
temperatures, to test this theoretical relation between D and
T, but as the corresponding relation in viscosity has been
verified experimentally over a temperature range of 1400
degrees, it is not necessary to have such verification here
before proceeding. From a single determination of the ratio
of D3 to D, at any two temperatures T3 and Tj we can calculate
from (8) a value of xC2 which is a measure of the potential
energy of molecules 1 and 2 in contact. Loschmidt was the
first to measure diffusion-coefficients at one, or at different
temperatures, but as von Obermayer's results are later and
more elaborately determined it will suffice to use them. He
has measured the diffusion-coefficients of six pairs of gases at
ordinary temperatures, and at 61°*5 C. (Sitz. A/cad. Wien,
Ixxxi.), namely, those of carbon dioxide with air, hydrogen,
and nitrogen monoxide N20, and those of oxygen with
hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbonic oxide. In the following
table are given for each pair of gases the two temperatures
of v. Obermayer's experiments, the values of the diffusion-
coefficients at these temperatures, and the values of iC3 for
each pair calculated therefrom. The diffusion-coefficients are
given in terms of the centimetre and second as units, and are

   If the law of force is that of the inverse fourth power, or

10                  Mr. William Sutherland on the
the law of energy is that of the inverse cube, then
                Wlims/(l/ai + (h)=mimi 1A2/(a1 + a2)s,
and if we know relative values of ax and a3, then iCs(a| +a2)'
will give relative values of 1Agm1m3.
   There are two sources of relative values of the molecular
radii ax and a2:—first, the viscosity of the separate gases, and
in my paper on the Viscosity of Gases and Molecular Force
relative values of (2a!)2 are given as (2a)2 (relative) ; the
second source is values of /3 the limiting volume of a gramme
of a substance as obtained from its characteristic equation as
a liquid, and given for various substances in the papers on
the " Laws of Molecular Force" (Phil. Mag., March 1893) and
the " Viscosity of Gases and Molecular Force " (Phil. Mag.,
 Dec. 1893) : if M is the ordinary chemical molecular mass
 (weight) of the substance, then M/S is proportional to (2a)3 and
 (M/S)& may be taken as giving a relative value of 2a, and then
«i + «2 is given by (M,/3i)i/2 + (M2/32)i/2.
   The latter source of values of a is preferable at present, as
it yields values for more substances than the former. For
the gases of v. Obermayer's experiments we have the following
values:—
                 Hj.       02.        N2.      C02.      NaO.

   There is no direct determination of /8 for CO, but from the
molecular domains (volumes) of a number of carbon com
pounds I have deduced 1*35 as an approximate value of
(M/3)i/2 for CO. With the above values we get for
                  10-11C2{(Ml/31)4/2+ (M2&)*/2}3
the following values, which are relative values of jA^n^ ;

   It should be noticed that these numbers show a large range
of value, namely, from 131 to 1122. Now in the paper on
the Viscosity of Gases and Molecular Force relative values
are given for lAim^ or Am2, the corresponding factor in the
expression for the attraction between like molecules ; they are
given as 10-1M/3C, which in the notation of this paper would be
                  10-\C1{(M1/Si)i/2 + (M1^1)V2}3,
and are now reproduced for the substances of v. Obermayer's
experiments with the addition of an approximate value for CO :

    The mean value of the ratio is l-2, and the departures of
some of the individual numbers from the mean, though largo,
are not larger than could be caused by only slight error in
the experiments or the theory, for it must be remembered that
the constants ]C2 occur in equation (8) in such a manner as
to make their values when calculated from that equation very
 sensitive to small errors in the ratio of the diffusion-coefficients
at two temperatures. Thus, notwithstanding the high degree of
accuracy attained by v. Obermayer in his elaborate experiments,
it must be allowed that the last series of numbers is as nearly
constant as can be expected. To show this clearly it will bo
best to assume that the ratio is 1, and calculate xCg from the
 equation
       iC,«MA)*/2 | (M^0V2},= (MIy811C1M^„O1)*, . (9)
 and then by the equation (8) calculate values of the ratio of
 the diffusion-coefficients at v. Obermayer's two temperatures
 for comparison with his experimental values :—

    The largest discrepancy between theory and experiment
 amounts to 2 per cent., and it cannot be claimed that the
 ratio of the diffusion-coefficients at two temperatures, as
 measured experimentally, can be guaranteed correct to within
 2 per cent., especially as the experimental measurements only

 12                Mr. William Sutherland on the
yield values of the diffusion-coefficients by the intervention
 of quite an elaborate theory of the experiment.
    The outcome of the investigation so far, then, is that v. Ober-
 mayer's experiments (in continuation of Loschmidt's) on the
 temperature variation of diffusion establish at least the
 approximate truth of the law that the parameter jAjm,?^ in
 the attraction of two unlike molecules of masses wix and m3 is
 equal to the square root of the product of the parameters
 lAjWii1 and 2A37«a2 for the like molecules. To test the truth
 of the law in an independent manner, some experiments have
 been carried out on the surface-tension of mixed liquids and
 will be described in another paper.
    Meanwhile there is interesting matter to discuss in con
nexion with diffusion. It can be seen how desirable are
 experiments on the temperature variation of the diffusion-
 coefficients of many more pairs of gases. This variation
 could be prophesied for a large number of pairs of gases by
 calculating ,C2 according to equation (9), using therein the
values of y3 and fii given in the paper on the Viscosity of
 Gases and Molecular Force, but the calculations would
possess more interest if carried out in connexion with the
experiments than at present. However, as the diffusion-
coefficients of many more pairs of gases have already been
determined experimentally at one temperature, it seems at
 first sight to be possible to determine the corresponding
values of jCj from them in the following manner. Let us
write our relation (7) in the form
              }              (1/M1 + 1/M,)*                              .
                {(Mj/SOVa + (M2A)V2r(l + 1C/T)' ¦ • t> '
where B is a constant the same for all pairs, then for the six
pairs of gases already studied, as we know all the variables, we
can obtain values of B which ought to be all nearly the same.
 But when the calculation is made, using the lower value of T
in each of v. Obermayer's experiments, which is about 284, it
is found that B, instead of being constant, is closely propor
tional to 1+jCj/T, as the following values show:—
                  CO., & N,. COj & Ha. 002 & NaO. 02&Ha. Oa & N,. 03 & CO.
103B                209        1-53      2-19      158     173      169
WBftl+fiJT).. Ill              112         -94     1-17    T17      1-16
    This curious result has some interesting bearings. In the
first place, it means that the diffusion-coefficients of actual
gases at temperatures about 284 absolute are related to one
another almost as they would bo if the molecules were force
less spheres, and this explains why the investigators of

                 Attraction of Unlike Molecules.                13
diffusion have hitherto found fair agreement between the
results of experiment at ordinary temperatures and the kinetic
theory of forceless perfectly restitutional spherical molecules.
The immediate effect of the result on our present inquiry is
to render illusory the hope of obtaining values of jCj for the
various pairs of gases for which Loschniidt and v. Obermayor
have found values of the diffusion-coefficient at only one
temperature near 284, for as regards these values we have
just seen that the molecules behave almost as if forceless.
It may be suggested that the failure of B to prove constant
is due to inadequacy of Stefan's theory of diffusion, but
the expressions for the diffusion-coefficient given by Meyer
and Tait gave on trial about the same results as Stefan's ; so
that the failure of B to prove constant is not due to any
peculiarity of Stefan's theory. We have to go deeper for the
 reason, and in doing so have to open up a very important
department of molecular dynamics of which at present we know
but little, namely, the nature of collisions between molecules.
 Hitherto in the kinetic theory it has been assumed that the
forces called into play during the collision of two molecules
are such as they would be if the molecules were perfectly
 restitutional spheres, and the assumption seems to have
 worked well as regards the general phenomena of gases ; but
 in reality it was not required there, and could be replaced by
 the assumption that the translator}- kinetic energy of a number
 of molecules is a constant fraction of their total kinetic energy
 The usual assumption of perfect restitutionality causes no
 difficulty in connexion with the theory of the viscosity of a
 single gas, because the nature of the collisional forces be
 tween molecules is not directly involved in that theory ; but
 in the theory of diffusion, as well as in that of the character
 istic equation of the element gases, the forces involved in
 collision enter as an essential element of the calculation.
 Now in the paper on the Viscosity of Gases and Molecular
 Force, in connexion with the theory of the characteristic
 equation of the element gases, just such a discrepancy as wo
 have encountered in diffusion cropped up between the
 behaviour of actual gases and the theory of a medium com
 posed of attracting perfectly restitutional spheres ; and it was
 pointed out that in some way, which at present must be called
 accidental, the departure from perfect restitutionality in the
 collisions compensated for a certain effect of molecular attrac
 tion in such a way as to make the molecules behave in one
 respect as if they were forceless. It seems desirable, there
 fore, to bring out clearly the parallelism of the two cases.
    In the theoretical characteristic equation of a medium

14                Mr. William Sutherland on the
made of attracting smooth perfectly restitutional spheres, one
term is the virial of the collisional forces of all the spheres in
unit mass which takes the form 2a/xv/2 (see Viscosity of
Gases and Molecular Force), where a is the radius of a
sphere, fi the average momentum imparted to a sphere in a
collision, and v the average number of collisions per sphere
per second, the summation to extend to all spheres in unit
mass. This is closely similar to the expression which comes
in in diffusion for the resistance experienced by one medium
in passing through another, and which was written /jlv. In
the virial expression /jl is momentum due to velocity of agita
tion, while in the diffusion resistance /jl is the momentum due
to relative motion of the two media, which is very slow com
pared to the velocities of agitation. In the diffusion resistance
v denotes the number of collisions per second of a sphere of
one set with the spheres of the other in unit volume. It was
shown that %apv/2 when evaluated takes the form
                        $BTe-A_(l+lQ,/T),i
so that the theoretical characteristic equation becomes
               pr=BT{l + ^(l + 1CVT)»}-?;
whereas Amagat's experiments on H2, 02, N2, and CH4 above
the critical volume can be represented by the form
so that the factor (1 + 1C1/T)' due to molecular force seems to
fall out. Now in the diffusion expression it is a factor
approximately equal to 1+102/T that appears to drop out; and
the main difference between the two cases is that in diffusion
the velocity of diffusion involved in the momentum is small
compared to the average velocity of agitation involved in the
fi of the collisional virial. Thus it appears that the momentum
communicated from molecule to molecule in a collision is not
transmitted in the same manner as with smooth perfectly
restitutional attracting spheres, but that there is some
mechanism by which the transmission is made to depend on
the ratio of the potential energy at contact to the mean
kinetic energy in such a manner as to make the final effect
of the forces acting during the collision of molecules the same
as if the molecules were both forceless and perfectly resti
tutional smooth spheres. The mechanism is probably that
which preserves proportionality between the mean translatory
kinetic energy and the mean vibratory energy of a molecule;

                  Attraction of Unlike Molecules.                15
and the difference between the diffusion case and that of the
collisional virial may perhaps lie in the fact that the mechanism
does not operate in the same manner as regards the mass
motion of diffusion and the molecular motion of heat. But
the whole question of molecular collision is so large a one
that it will require considerable research' to itself; from the
glimpse we have got into it, it appears that the momentum
imparted to a molecule during a collision, instead of being u,
as calculated on the assumption that the molecules are smooth
perfectly restitutional spheres, is hfi, where h is a parameter
characteristic of the pair of molecules colliding, and which
we have found empirically in the case of diffusion to be
approximately proportional to 1 + iC2/T. It may be worth
while noting a certain regularity in the departure from strict
proportionality, or in the departure of 103B/(1 + 1C2/T) from
constancy : for the two triatomic molecules C02 and N20 its
value is least, namely, *94 ; for the triatomic C02 with di
atomic N2 and Ha it is I'll and 1*12 ; while for the three
diatomic pairs 02 with H2, N2, and CO, it is 1*17, 1'17, and
1-16.
    With Loschmidt's and v. Obermayer's diffusion-coefficients
for a number of pairs of gases at about 15° C, we can test
more extensively our empirical relation that at about that
temperature the diffusion-coefficient is proportional to
              (1/M, + l/M,)*/{(MA)*/2 + (M^2)V2}S.
The data are available for sixteen pairs including the six
already considered, and as the experimenters have reduced
their results to values at 0° C. by the approximate formula
                        D273/DT=(273/T)»,
which is near enough to the truth for small differences
between T and 273, we will take the values D273 as suitable for
our present purpose. The additional values required for

 are nearly constant, though showing on the whole a tendency
 to increase with the number of atoms in the diffusing mole
cules, as we already noted in connexion with 103B/(1 + 1C2/T)
for the original six pairs of gases.
     The last table can be greatly extended, thanks to the
 experiments carried out by Winkelmann for determining
diffusion-coefficients according to Stefan's evaporation method
founded on his equation marked (5) in the present paper.
He has determined the rates of evaporation of a number of
esters from 03H602 to C9Hi802, and ethyl oxide, carbon di-
sulphide, and benzene in air, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide
at different temperatures, and has calculated the corresponding
coefficients of diffusion.
     In order to obtain the values of D273 it is necessary to
obtain approximate values of jC2 for use in the equation

the following manner :—In the paper on the Viscosity of
Gases and Molecular Force it is shown that for compounds

where I is the virial constant of molecular attraction in the

large number of bodies being given in the Laws of Molecular

culating them for any body. As regards M3 for the esters,
I have found by determining /8 that for CnH'2n02,

coefficients about to be given I have taken the mean of the
isomers in each case, so that, for instance, the mean diffusion-
coefficient of the bodies just mentioned is given as the value
for C4H802. When the broad principles have been established
it will be time enough to take account of minor differences in
the diffusion-coefficients of isomers. The following table

mann's determinations at the temperatures of his experiments,

   It will be noticed that with hydrogen and air at the lower
members of the ester series and (C2H5)20 and CS2, the values
are near to the "2 which was about the mean value for the
gases, but that they increase steadily as the series is ascended ;
so that the result for vapours joins on continuously with that
for gases, but shows a decided departure from our empirical
result for gases that for temperatures near 0° C. the diffusion-
coefficients have nearly the same relative values as if the
molecules were forceless. But it should be remembered that
the results for vapours are all calculated on the assumption
that they obey the gaseous laws, and therefore that care should
 be taken not to give much weight to them till it is ascertained,
 either theoretically or experimentally, what is the effect on the
 diffusion-coefficient of such departure from the gaseous laws
 as vapours show.
    To carry the subject to the most suitable point at which to
 leave it at present, it seems best to take all the values of
           (1/M! + l/M2)V{(Ml/91)i/2 + (M2/32) */2}2D:273
 which have been given in this paper and divide them by the
 corresponding values of l + ^/^l^, using only the theore
 tical values of 1C2, calculated according to equation (9) . In this
 way, according to equation (10), we ought for attracting smooth
 perfectly restitutional spherical molecules to get the constant
 1/B2732 the same for all pairs of substances; and the amount
 of departure from constancy will furnish a good measure of
 the present degree of incompleteness of the kinetic theory of
 diffusion, the chief cause of incompleteness being, in my
 opinion, the assumption of perfect restitutionality in each
 individual collision.

    II. Coloured Cloudy Condensation, as Depending on the
       Temperature and the Dust-contents of the Air. By Carl

   1. TN the "koniscope" Mr. Aitkenf has expressed the
        -L dust-contents of a given sample of air, in terms of
  the colour, or of the intensity of colour, or of the amount of
  exhaustion necessary to produce a given colour, when the
  cloudy condensation is produced by sudden expansion of the
  gas in a suitable tube, containing enough moisture to satu
  rate the air.        The importance of temperature is pointed
  out, but not evaluated. Mr. Aitken prefers to make the

 estimation in torms of the colour-intensity of the blue, and the
 apparatus is graduated by comparing it with the direct dust-
 counter. Based as this apparatus is on colour discriminations,
 it is not adapted to give more than a few steps of dust-
 contents, and Mr. Aitken chiefly recommends it for qualita
 tive purposes, such, for instance, as may present themselves
 in sanitary work.
    2. During the course of my experiments on the thermal
 distribution in steam-jets, I had frequent occasion to note the
 actuating steam-pressure at which the intense blue-violet
 field of my colour-tube merges into opaque, eventually to
 reappear (pressure increasing) as an orange-brown field of
 the first order. It struck me that here was a sufficiently
 sharp criterion for fixing a value of pressure depending in
 the given apparatus only on the temperature and the dust-
contents of the inflowing air. In other words, for a given
kind of air, and at a given temperature, there are two well-
 defined pressures at which colour (blue and yellow) vanishes
into blackness. If the kind of air remains the same while its
temperature varies, the paired values of pressure will also
vary markedly, so that the margins of the opaque field may
be mapped out in a diagram in which pressure is expressed
in its dependence on temperature. It is the chief purpose
of the present paper to show the character of this diagram,
and to indicate the manner in which the positions of the loci
vary, when the dust-contents of the inflowing air are also
varied. Incidentally I will endeavour to ascertain the more
immediate cause of the opaque field, and to see whether the
water molecules may not themselves become nuclei of con
densation, §§ 15, 16.
   3. Apparatus.—Full details of the necessa^ apparatus is
given in PL V. fig. 1, where the colour-tube is shown at AA,
and the method of varying the temperature and dustiness of
the inflowing air is shown at E, D, F. The colour-tube is
identical in form with the apparatus described in an earlier
paper *. 1 need only call to mind here that the steam issues
at the jet j, from a nozzle about "16 cm. in diameter, and
that the tube AA is about 50 to 00 cm. long, and, in common
with the air-hole G, about 5 cm. in diameter. The glass
plates g and a are kept clear by moistening with a solution
of caustic potash, and the mirror M reflects skylight through
the tube. Mixed steam and air escape at B, and provision is
made (not shown) for screening off extraneous light from g,
the window through which the colour observations are made.

                    Coloured Cloudy Condensation.                    21
    The two essential appurtenances are the thermometer t, to
 register the temperature of the inflowing air at C, and the
 open mercury manometer (not shown) by which the pressure
 of the steam entering the jet j is measured. Inasmuch as a
 mercury thermometer is not very quick in its indications, the
 air at a given temperature must be allowed to pass over the
 bulb of t for some time before the record is taken.
    The steam used was .generated in a copper globe about
 25 cm. in diameter, and provided with a water-gauge and a
 steam-gauge. The vessel was heated by a largo ring-burner*
 and is strong enough to withstand, say, ten atmospheres,
 though in the present work pressures below two atmospheres
 fully suffice.
    G and H are forms of air-filters to be described in § 14.
    4. The air entering 0 is taken out of the atmosphere, the
 three influx tubes E, D, F passing through the window frame
 WW, and opening into the air on the outside (Smithsonian
 Park) as shown at b, c, d. Valves are inserted into each of
 these tubes at e, f, h, so that the quantity of air passing
 through any one of them may be regulated or even quite
 shut off. In the winter, when the valves are open, the air
 rushes through the tubes with considerable velocity, even
 when the jet j is not in action. This velocity increases with
 the steam-pressure actuating the jet, but can be regulated by
 shutting off the valves e,f, k partially.
    The tube E is clear, and the air passing through it has the
 temperature of the atmosphere. The tube D discharges into
 E and is provided with a drum, containing a coil of thin lead
 pipe of about O'G cm. calibre. About 20 turns of pipe, each
 somewhat less than 5 cm. in diameter, in a drum 35 cm.
long and somewhat less than 10 cm. in diameter, are more
 than sufficient. In cold weather steam is passed through
the lead pipe. Hence by suitably regulating the valves h
and /the air flowing through C may be kept at any desirable
temperature ; and as temperatures between 9° and 40° only
are needed for the present purposes, this arrangement is quite
satisfactory. In the summer time chilled brine or an ex
panding gas circulating through the coil will probably be
serviceable.
   The tube F also discharges into E, and is useful for in
creasing the dust-contents of the air entering C. For this
purpose a little closed basket of wire gauze, attached to a
stem passing through a perforated cork, is inserted into the
tubulure k, as shown in the figure. A piece of phosphorus

Geolog. Survey, no. 54, p. (JO (1S80).

  22                        Mr. Carl Barus on
  is put into the basket. The dusty exhalation of a freshly cut
  surface of phosphorus is almost nil at 0° C, but increases
  with great rapidity when the temperature rises, § 26. At
  any given temperature above 15° its dust supply is nearly
  constant for a long period of time (hours) ; hence its avail
  ability in the present work, unless the weather is very cold.
  Fortunately cold temperatures can usually be dispensed with
  when artificially dusty air is examined.
     It is to be noted that all the tubes E, D, F must pass out
  of the room. If, for instance, b opened into the room (which
 would often be desirable for the reasons just mentioned) , then,
  if the jet is not in action or only slightly in action, cold air
 would pass into C and D, and out at h as well as at B into
 the room.         At low steam-pressure the flow of dusty air
 would, therefore, necessarily be irregular. An advantage is
 secured by making the common tube i C long, so that the
 air may be well mixed before impinging upon the jet. At
 best, however, air dusted in this way is an inferior substitute
 for atmospheric air, and the results show much more fluctua
 tion. Each of the valves, h,f, e, is provided with a suitable
 dial and an index. The valve e must be free from leaks. It
 is best, moreover, when atmospheric air is examined to re
 move the basket k altogether, and to close the hole with a
 cork. The hole through which F discharges into E need not
 be more than a few millimetres in diameter, and it is advisable
 to carry it into the axis of E by aid of a glass tube. The
 whole train of tubes is easily made of ordinary tinned drain
 pipe and suitable elbows. To summarize : the faint phos
 phorescent glow visible on phosphorus in the dark is a nearly
 permanent aust-producer. This phosphorus-tainted air, dis
 charged through an ^-inch tube into the 2-inch tube of pure
 air, usually produces persistent colour-effects at ordinary
 temperatures. Thus the additional dilution* is less than -, (\0.
     5. A few remarks on the shortcomings of the apparatus
 may be made here. It is clear in the first place that the
 temperature of the air entering C will vary with the intensity
 of the jet, i. e. the velocity of current, even if the other ad
 justments remain unaltered. For the more rapidly the air
 passes through the drum D the less it is heated. This,
 however, is no serious inconvenionce since temperature is
measured at t.
    * It is best to provide the phosphorus tube with a glass stopcock in
place of the symbolic valve of fig. 1. On proper adjustment brilliant
colour-effects are obtained in this way for any reasonable length of time.
The line is quite permanent so long as the stopcock is left untouched,
but there is a change of colour whenever the degree of opening is
varied.

   Similarly the amount of dust introduced into the air will
(probably) depend on the rate at which the current passes
the basket at k. Hence at great jet intensities the air will
be less dusty than for small intensities. I have found no
easy way by which this discrepancy can be evaluated ; and
my experiments with artificially dusted air are intended
rather to show the character of the dust variation than to
map out precise loci, §§ 11-13. Fortunately the dust effect
is so striking that there is no possibility of misinterpretation.
Experiments which I made by introducing dust with jet
pumps and aspirators showed few advantages. To vary the
dust-contents uniformly at all jet-pressures, the mouths c, d
of the air-tubes must be introduced into a large artificially
dusted room, instead of the atmosphere. But this method
also presents grave difficulties. The final resort seems to be
to examine the atmosphere at different times and in different
places, or to construct apparatus for the rapid filtration of
air, §§ 14, 15.
   One serious theoretical question may be referred to here.
It is necessary that at all steam-pressures the amount of air
entering C should be nearly proportioned to the amount of
issuing steam. No doubt this is nearly the case ; for not
only do the air- and steam-currents increase and decease to
gether, but the air is admitted in excess of the quantity neces
sary to produce condensation at the supersaturated parts of
the jet, and it is to this condensation that the colour indica
tions apply. If the valve e be closed, and the valves /and h
all but closed, the pressures at which the margin of the opaque
zone appears from blue increase ; but the temperature regis
tered at t also increases at even a greater relative rate, so that
the apparent effect is, curiously enough, rather an excess than
a deficiency of dust (§ 13).
   I infer from this that in the work below the air is always
admitted in quantity sufficient to produce its maximum dust
effect. To test this question preliminarily, I replaced the
0*16 cm. nozzle by another 0'09 cm. in diameter, and thus
{cat. par.) only discharging one third as much steam as the
former. The new results virtually coincided with the old
 (§ 15) ; and hence, though the relations below were obtained
from a given apparatus, they are probably true generally * so
   * It will be expedient to consider the small differential effect of varia
tions of the barometer, and the tendency of the pressure corresponding
to " blue-opaque " to fall with tho time of efflux, ftc, in the Bulletin
cited. Brass nozzles corrode in the course of time, so that it is advisable
to make them of platinum. With some unpolished nozzles the "yellow-
blue " asymptote may fall even as low as 20 centim. of mercury at 30° air-
temperature.

24                       Mr. Carl Barus on
long as the inflowing air exceeds a certain minimum quantity
and the nozzle is of average smoothness. A full discussion of
all these points will be in order when I come to measure the
thermal distribution within the colour-tube, and particularly
in the neighbourhood of the nozzle of the jet. 1 will then
show to what extent each jet possesses special hydraulic pro
perties *. In a general way the jet may be advantageously
compared with a Bunsen flame. For just as in the one case
the blue cone is a locus indicating the speed of chemical
action t, under the given conditions of mixture and efflux, so
in the steam-jet the transparent cone of vapour indicates the
rate at which condensation takes place. Given the rate of
efflux of steam, a photographic method may then be easily
devised for expressing the speed of condensation % numerically.
    The fact that pin-holo jets are quite sufficient makes the
practical construction of the apparatus (Plate V. fig. 1)
on a small scale an easy possibility. A globular copper
boiler, 5 inches in diameter, and a sensitive steam-gauge with
a capacity of less than 15 pounds, are available for generating
the steam and recording pressure.
    6. Results. Normal Atmosphere.—The results in hand are
necessarily in very great number, for the case is one in which
the ob«ver has to construct the mean value or path, when
the observations themselves are unavoidably discrepant. It
will therefore be expedient to avoid cumbersome tables, by
expressing all the data graphically. An ulterior advantage
is gained in this way, inasmuch as the broad features of the
phenomena are at once evident to the eye.
    In the chart, Plate V. fig. 2 (and in all succeeding
charts), the abscissas indicate the temperature, in degrees C,
of the air entering the colour-tube at C (fig. 1); or, in other
words, the registry of the thermometer t. The ordinates
show the pressures in centims. of mercury under which
the steam is forced out of the jet. The points of the
curve between 0 and about 40 cm. then show the corre
sponding values of air-temperature and steam-pressure, at
which the blue-violet (first order) field seen in the colour-tube
merges into opaque. The points of the curve lying quite
above 40 cm. show the conditions at which the brown-
yellows of the first order just emerge from the opaque.
Curves indicating the approximate loci are drawn through
the points.

   Below about 9° C, therefore, the field is opaque at all
pressures ; above 9°, tho pressure at wbich blue changes into
opaque rapidly increases with increasing temperature ; and
the pressure at which brown-yellow changes to opaque de
creases from an enormous value, and at even a more rapid
rate as temperature increases.          Both loci, curving at a
gradually retarded rate, eventually reach a common asym
ptote at about 41 cm. (temperature being indefinitely high).
At the same time the colours which were very intense
at the lower temperature gradually become fainter, and the
opaque zone more translucent, until at about 40° of air-tem
perature (depending on the size of the nozzle, § 15) the field
is clear and without colour. The escaping steam is gaseous,
and not visibly condensed. When temperature decreases
again from 40°, white-yellow is the first colour to appear,
showing that tho particles here must be the smallest of the
whole series. At 35° the change from faint yellowish tones
to faint white-blues, when pressure is made to vary suitably
(see chart) from larger to smaller values, is quite marked.
There is no opaque demarcation, however, but rather a mix
ture of colours, for the opaque field is hardly impervious to
light above 30°. Indeed one often notices a brownish field
surrounding the jet, on a violet-bluish ground.
   For all temperatures and pressures lying to the left of the
two curves the field is opaque, and it sends off a kind of cusp
to penetrate into higher temperatures. There is a character
istic difference between the contours of the two margins ; for
whereas yellow-opaque after a sharp inflexion snoots up
almost vertically, blue-opaque shows a regular change of
curvature throughout.
   At about 13° in the chart I have inscribed the approxi
mate positions of the successive interference-colours *, indi
cating their positions by a cross. This cannot be nearly so
well done as the location of the opaque margin, and as the
colours are of smaller interest in the present paper, I will not
enter into the subject further. The contour of the successive
colour-curves is easily surmised from the line for blue-opaque.
Similarly above the yellow-opaque line, a family of browns,
oranges, and yellows may be located.
   When the dust-contents are increased, the margin of the
opaque field approaches the abscissa, and hence the colour
loci will be successively more crowded together.
   In the chart (Plate V. fig. 2) only a single air-tube (D,
fig. 1) was available. The air was heated to about 40° by
the circulating steam. This was then shut off and the
         * See Barus, Am. Met. Journ. ix. p. COO et seq., 1893.

26                      Mr. Carl Barns on
 temperature and pressure at which the colours disappeared
 noted on cooling. The mercury-thermometer is scarcely
 sensitive enough for such observations, and the temperatures
 of the diagram are probably too high. I have therefore
 lumped all my observations between Feb. 10 and 23, 1893,
 in this chart, seeing that the phenomenon as a whole is
 well represented.
     7. In the following work, however, the apparatus, Plate V.
 fig. 1, was used, with the phosphorus-tube closed up and
 the phosphorus removed. Great care was taken to wait
 for stationary temperatures, and about five (or more) steps
 between 10° C. and 40° C. were selected for observation.
    The first set of experiments was made on Feb. 23, the
 chart*, fig. 3, curve A being obtained in the morning,
 and fig. 4 in the afternoon. The day was cold, with
 snow covering the ground. The blue-opaque curve, A, fig. 3,
virtually reproduces fig. 2 ; but the curve, fig. 4, differs from
 it inasmuch as the tangential angles in the latter case are
 steeper, so that the locus is less curved and rises higher
 than in figs. 2 or 3. In all cases yellow-opaque lies above
 blue-opaque. I was at first inclined to refer tills to differ
 ences of the vanishing standard, believing the two curves
 to contain consistent observations, but differing from each
 other for reasons purely subjective. Whether or not this is
 the case can only bo found by comparison with succeeding
 series of observations, as will presently be seen. Taking the
 observations at their face value, the indication is less dust for
 the afternoon than for the morning. The curve P found for
artificially dusty air will bo described below (§ 11).
    8. The next series of observations were made on Feb. 27
(cloudy), 28 (rain), and on March 2 (clear). There was but
little difference in tho respective loci of the data except that
on the latter day the asymptote was somewhat below the
position for the other days (see chart, Plate V. fig. 5).
The common asymptote takes a mean position (pressure,
p = 43 cm.) between the corresponding values of figs. 2
and 3 (/»=42 cm.) and fig. 4 (p = 4b cm.).
    9. On March 3, however, the asymptote rose again to the
value jo = 46 cm.       The weather was cloudy, antedating
the storm of March 4, 1893. Two series of observations were
made.
    Finally, the results of March 6, 8, 10 agree in character
with fig. 5 ; while during the intermediate date, March 7,
the asymptote fell to the lower position jy = 42 cm. These
   * The observations FF' in fig. 3 refer to filtered air and will be
described in § 14.

                     Coloured Cloudy Condensation.            27
figures, as a whole, give some evidence in favonr of an
oscillation of the asymptote with the dust-contents of atmo
spheric air. The observed interval of oscillation is within
about 8 cm. of mercury pressure, but usually much below
this.
   10. General character of the Loci.—Resuming the remarks
of §6, it is seen that when the asymptotes are high, the loci
as a whole show less curvature and the points between 20°
and 30° C. tend to fall below the corresponding points for
low asymptotes. I have endeavoured to bring the whole
phenomenon into a convenient equation, in which temperature
and dust-contents might appear as two variables by which
the contours (pressure) of the margin of the opaque field
(figs. 2 ei se<j.) are conditioned. The invention of a single
form in which both the blue-opaque and the yellow-opaque
margins are contained is more difficult than the fitting of' a
separate form for each curve, and I have not been fully
successful in any case. Cumbersome equations, or such as
lead to involved computations, are of little interest for the
present purposes, where the object sought is merely a terse
and convenient epitome of the very large number of isolated
observations which go to make up each of the curves in
question.
   Let p be the steam-pressure actuating the jet, and t the
temperature of the air into which the jet is discharged, and
let A, B, C, n be constants to be presently discussed. Then
                            ^AlO^                            (1)
   The quantity (p — B) in (1) is always to be taken as a
numeric, i. e. positively ; otherwise imaginary results are
encountered. Suppose now this equation is tested by the
data of fig. 5, as these fairly represent a mean case. Then
   p = 0, <=A=9, by observation ;
   p = li, t = x> , or B = 43, the height of the asymptote above
the abscissa ;
   p = x> , < = oo .
   Hence the yellow-opaque margin, lying quite above p=B
= 43, corresponds directly to equation (1) ; whereas the blue-
opaque margin, lying quite below p = B = 43, corresponds to
(1) with (p— B) replaced by (B—p). Furthermore, while
in the yellow-opaque branch p increases from 43 cm. to oo ,
t passes through a minimum value. It is, therefore, necessary
to inquire the position and character of this uncalled for
singular point. Let equation (1) be differentiated, remember
ing that t = 0 corresponds to p= — oo , and therefore does not

disposed of. Then the pressure pm, corresponding to the
minimum temperature tm in question, is found to be

and the somewhat more involved expression of tm is found from
equation (1).
   With these preliminaries, the remaining constants C and n
are then easily enough, though somewhat tediously, obtained
from the observations making up fig. 5, by trial. The results
are as follows :—

   This curve, equation (1), has been inscribed in fig. 5, to
show the grouping of the observations around it. The mini
mum is markedata (£m=17-4°C. ,/>„, = 66*2 cm.). Through
out the extent of the figure, it unites two sufficiently flat curves
to fairly represent the observations ; for this part of the
margin, from its exceedingly steep ascent, cannot be traced
with precision.
   As a whole, therefore, equation (1) has reproduced the
complete phenomenon surprisingly well, both as regards the
blue-opaque (AB) and the yellow-opaque (BO) margin of
the opaque field. No doubt, better agreement could be had
on further trial, particularly by varying the point of inter
section with the abscissa, <=A. I shall not, however, do this,
since in the present paper the chief datum is the height of the
common asymptote (p = B) above the abscissa. It is this
parameter which expresses the dust-contents of the air, and
which fortunately may be obtained without computation by
the direct observations presently to be more fully specified.
   11. Artificially Dusty Atmospheres.—To interpret the above
data it is necessary to increase the dust-contents of the normal

                   Coloured Cloudy Condensation.                       29
atmosphere artificially, utilizing the tube F, fig. 1, containing
phosphorus. The results for this case are not without com
plexity, but the character of the effect, produced is obvious at
once : it takes but a trace of the phosphorus-tainted air to
make the field permanently opaque at all pressures and tem
peratures not unreasonably high. In other words, the tendency
is to drop the blue-opaque curve of the above figures into
coincidence with the abscissa. One would surmise that at
least the asymptotic portion of the yellow-opaque curve would
likewise drop to the abscissa, and this is actually the case, as
will be shown presently. By allowing the discharge from F
to take place into E through a glass tube only a lew milli
metres in diameter, while the air-tube C is fully two inches in
diameter, I was able to dust the air sufficiently to obtain at
least the approximate contours of the corresponding relation
of steam-pressure and air-temperature. The data are inscribed
in fig. 4, and together they make up the curve P near the
axis of temperature.          Thus the striking potency of even
traces of dust is well exhibited.
    Clearly the rudimentary curve P is a member of the same
family to which AB belongs, and it is therefore obvious
that the whole field between B and the abscissa is a region of
 temperature and pressure loci *, each of which corresponds to
 a particular value of dust-contents.              Since, therefore, the
 accuracy with which the point can be located at any (mean)
 temperature is about 1 cm., the apparatus ought to register about
 40 degrees of dust-contents between normal atmospheric air
 and the artificial mixture stated. On this scale the variation
 of the dust-contents of normal air f .lies in the interval between
 40 cm. and 50 cm. of mercury, remembering that the height
 of the asymptote (virtually reached at 28° to 30°) is taken
 for registry.
     12. To bring out the conditions more fully, however, it is
 necessary to make supplementary tests both with phosphorus
 anil with filtered air.
     If the basket of phosphorus is placed in the tube E (fig. 1)
    * Probably the best method of actually mapping out these curves will
 consist in using nozzles of different degrees of smoothness. By mere
 haphazard drilling and polishing of such nozzles, I obtained curves
 between asymptote 20 cm. and asymptote 50 cm. That these curves will
 be identical with the corresponding dust-curves is made probable by §16
 below.
    t Supposing that the possible errors have been correctly apprehended.
 In experiments made throughout the entire month I was surprised that
 an apparatus so sensitive to artificial dust should show such slight mean
 variations of the dust-contents of atmospheric air from day to day.
  Witness the above curves.

30                       Mr. Carl Barus on
near its mouth d, where the air-temperature (in winter) is near
the freezing-point, no effect is produced. Thus at 21°-22°
the blue-opaque margin was at 41-42 cm., showing that the
oxidation of phosphorus at zero is relatively negligible in
spite of the current of air.
   If, however, the same phosphorus be placed in the tube EC
at t, somewhere between the point of confluence and the colour-
tube, and where the temperature is say 20°, then it is actually
I)0ssible to obtain the yellow of the first order at steam-pressures
 ess than 1 cm. Thus at 19°, the yellow-opaque margin was
at 1*2 cm., and the colour persisted with increasing brilliancy
at all pressures above this.
   For temperatures greater than 20°, the tube is yellow at all
pressures until eventually above 35° all colour vanishes for
want of supersaturation.
   For temperatures below 20°, the tendency is to produce
opaque fields. Thus at 15° the tube is opaque at all pressures
above a few millimetres.
   The explanation of this somewhat puzzling behaviour is
this : at any given admissible temperature, the effect of
phosphorus dust is a change of the colour of the field in the
direction from blue through opaque to yellow in proportion
as more dust of the given kind is added. Again, the dust-
contents of the air passing over a given lump of phosphorus
decreases both with the rapidity of the current and with the
degree of cold. Hence at higher temperatures than 20°
brilliant brown-yellow fields are the usual occurrence when the
phosphorus lies in the air-tube t C If withdrawn from the
air-tube and so circumstanced that its exhalation is diluted
with much air (tube F, fig. 1), then any colour may be pro
duced, depending on the degree of dilution. On the other
hand, below 20° the oxidation takes place more and more
slowly, so that only very gentle currents of air can carry off
enough dust to produce a yellow field. For strong currents
in C there is a double source of dilution, and opaque fields are
the rule. In other words, the air now approaches the shite
 AB in fig. 4, so far as dust-contents are concerned.
   I have entered into this subject at length because of its
important theoretical bearing, seeing that it is necessary to
disentangle a series of involved relations.
   13. In fig. 6 (diagram), the pair of curves ABC indicates
the margin of the opaque field for unusually pure atmospheric
air. Above the horizontal asymptote through B there is a
symmetrical disposition of browns, oranges, and yellows, the
order of colours decreasing upward. Below B the colours are
blues, greens, and hues of higher orders. The whole field to

                     Coloured Cloudy Condensation.                    31
the right of ABC is coloured, merging into colourless ; the
field to the left of ABC is opaque.
     As the air becomes more and more dust-laden, the yellow
territory encroaches on the blue, so that for unusually dusty
atmospheric air the pair of curves ABC has changed into ADC.
      In the same way the yellows will continue to advance upon
the blues for each successive (now artificial) increment of the
dust-contents of the air, until eventually the blues have been
quite crowded out of the field, and the whole territory is per
sistently yellow at all temperatures and pressures. In other
words, the asymptote of the curve descends with increasing
dust-contents, while at the same time the curve BC moves
bodily to the right, so that BC finally coincides with the
co-ordinate axes of pressure and temperature. This at least
is the essential feature of the phenomenon so far as I now
understand it. Subsidiary details will be brought forward at
some other time.
      It is to be remembered that the particular curves, figs. 2 et
 seq., apply primarily to the particular jet discharging into the
 given tubes. Nor can any attempt as 3-et bo made to graduate
 the apparatus ; for a comparison with the Aitken dust-counter
 is not legitimate, unless it can be proven that any given
 class of particles * occurs proportionally to the total number,
 certainly a hazardous hypothesis. For the present the height
 of the curve at points above 28° (asymptote), expressed in
 centimetres of mercury (pressure), is the empiric dust-indicator.
      14. Filtered Air.—A grave difficulty is encountered in
 using filtered air, inasmuch as the supply cannot be obtained
 in sufficient quantity without employing very cumbersome
 apparatus. I have helped myself provisionally by using a tin
 tube G (fig. 1) with the end nn large enough to fit snugly
 into the air-hole C when the heater is removed. G is filled
 with cotton throughout about 20 cm. of its length in the
 usual way. The end nn is closed with a sieve of brass wire
 gauze, while the end m is closed with a perforated rubber
  cork, through which an influx tubulure, o, projects. This is
  connected with an ordinary gas-tank, containing highly com
  pressed air.
       When the tube C (fig. 1) is closed with the filter G (no
  gas passing through it), the field of A A at once becomes
  clear ; at the same time, however, its temperature rises to the
     * Cf. §14. Evidence is also adduced in my earlier paper (Am. Met.
 Journ. March 1803, §19) that it is only the smallest of dust particles—
  t. e. particles whose dimensions are limited either way and of the order
  of a few hundred molecular diameters—which induce coloured cloudy
  condensation.

32                     Mr. Carl Barus on
boiling-point, and the absence of colour in this case is more the
result of insufficient supersaturation than of absence of dust.
Now let the compressed air be admitted, so that the tube A A
is considerably cooled. If the steam-pressure is high enough,
and the gas in sufficient quantity, the field first clouds over
and then turps quite opaque. Thus at a pressure of 50 cm.,
and a temperature registered at t of 47°, such a result
 (opaqueness) was obtained. At 30 cm. steam-pressure the
field turned cloudy, but not opaque ; at 15 cm. no clouding
 was even apparent. Colours were not observed in any case.
   In view of the insufficient air-supply obtained in case of the
filter G, I replaced it by the form H, differing from G in
having a drum much larger in diameter (length 25 cm.,
diameter 15 cm.), and special sieves rr and s s. Similar
parts are similarly lettered. Under like conditions, such
a filter should supply nine or more times as much air as the
other (G).
   The absorbent cotton inserted between the sieves ss and rr
(the former and the lid being removed, and the latter [r r]
soldered in place) was carefully laid in layers parallel to rr,
quite filling the width of the drum. When full to the top, the
cotton was compressed by the second sieve ss, which thereafter
was also soldered in place, the lid with the inlet pipe o' m!
soldered on, and the space between lid and * * filled with loose
cotton to catch dirt. The compressed charge between * « and
r r mainly acts as the filter. When not in use it should bo
heated, so as to be thoroughly dry.
   In the first experiments with the filter H, compressed air
(issuing as usual from a narrow pipe, and at a tank-pressure
of about 15 atmospheres) was used as before. Spreading
through the filter, the air enters the colour-tube at a much
reduced velocity. As the air in the tank is gradually freed
from dust by the subsidence of the latter, there is here an
additional means of purification. But the method is much too
lavish to be practical, even if it be conceded that the filter is
actually efficient. The following data were thus obtained for
the margin of the opaque field at temperatures comparable
with the values in the charts. Colours were not observed :—
Temperature . . 20° 21° 22° 23° I 33° Centigrade.
Pressure .... 41" 5 42 43 44 5 8 Cm. Hg.
   In the set of data for 20° to 23° the filter was not so well
packed as at 33°. Observations were discontinued for want
of gas. I have inserted these data in the chart, fig. 3, at
F and F'. When taken together they suggest a locus of
the same nature as fig. 4, i. e. implying less curvature in

                    Coloured Cloudy Condensation.                          33
proportion as the air is less dusty. Bearing this in mind, the
 margin of the opaque zone at 20° for filtered air is not as much
above the atmospheric curve as one would anticipate. It
 follows that the size of the particles producing coloured
 cloudy condensation in atmospheric air is not necessarily
 enormous when compared with molecular diameters—an
 inference which I have already drawn * both from the
character of the colour phenomena and from the conditions of
condensation.
    15. Having obtained these preliminary results, I attacked
the subject on a much larger scale, using an apparatus very
similar to fig. 1 (with the phosphorus-tube removed), except
that the air, instead of being taken out of the atmosphere at c
and d, passed at those points through two large filters of the
type H (fig. 1). A large Root blower, actuated by a one-
horse-power gas-engine, forced the air through the system.
    Contrary to my expectations, this arrangement remained to
the last utterly iiiefficient. When the blower acted under low
pressures, the air entering the colour-tube was insufficient in
quantity. For higher blower-pressures and a more rapid
current of air t, the evidences of filtration were practically
absent. It was easy to trace the increase of dust-contents with
the velocity of the current of nominally filtered air, even
though high speeds were excluded by the nature of the case.
The nozzle of the original steam-jet being 016 cm. in diameter,
I replaced it by a finer one, O09 cm. in diameter, but without
advantage. It is noteworthy that for atmospheric air both
these jets gave identical results as to the location of the opaque
margin near the asymptote. The colours for the fine jet were
fainter, and together with the opaque field vanished at a lower
temperature, as one would suppose, seeing that only one third
as much steam is available in one case as in the other.
    The best results for filtered air are, therefore, those of the
preceding paragraph. A sufficient degree of supersaturation
presupposed, in no case was there an absence of condensation ;
but as I cannot assert that the air used was rigorously pure,
it does not follow that I have reached the conditions t under
which the molecules themselves act as condensation nuclei.
   * Amer. Met. Journ. ix. pp. 507, 519 (1803).
  f Compare this with the similar experiences ot Mr. Aitken, in Trans.
Roy. Soc. Edinburgh, xxxv. p. 11 et seq. (1888).
   t The delicate question of purity comes into play in the other researches.
Thus condensation apparently without nuclei was produced by Aitken
(Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin. xxxv. p. 16, 1888), using the expansion method.
R. v. Helraholtz failed to obtain it for exhaustions up to one-half atmo
sphere (Wied. Ann. xxvii. p. 521, 1880), whereas Aitken's exhaustions
were only to three-fourths atmosphere (I. c. p. 8).

 Were this the case, then the supersaturation at the lower
 margin of the opaque field, expressed either isothermally as
 pressure or isopiestically as temperature, would lead easily to
 the dimension of steam molecules. For the margin in question
  is a locus at which the issuing steam condenses as a whole, or
  in which the vapour contains within itself the conditions * of
  condensation.
     1 6. In the absence of my other papers, the last remarks
  need further elucidation. I have already shown t that the
 opaque field at any temperature occurs cotemporaneously with
 the breakdown of the stability of the steam-jet. In other
 words, whenever at any temperature the velocity of the jet
 is just sufficient to change steady into edging motion, then an
 opaque field is observed in the colour-tube. One is therefore
 amazed to find brilliant browns, oranges, and j-ellows appearing
 after the jet-velocity or jet-pressure is even further increased,
 and the natural inference is that with the occurrence of tho
 opaque field the degree of supersaturation reached is intense
 enough to cause the steam to condense without nuclei. Con
 formably with this view of the case, condensation at pressures
 below the opaque margin is induced by dust, whereas above
 the opaque margin condensation is independent of dust.
 Above and below the margin the colour-phenomena are thus
 different in origin, and experiment bears this out to the extent
 that the yellows in question, however produced, are not in
 fluenced by injections of active dust.
     Thus far all is plausible ; but the explanation given receives
 a rude shock when further observation shows the height of
 the asymptote to vary enormously (pressure, 20 cm. to 50 cm.
 of mercury) for different nozzles. Even in one and the same
 (brass) nozzle the height gradually decreases in the lapse of
 time in proportion, no doubt, as the smoothness of the nozzle is
 impaired by continued use (usually sulphur corrosion). Hence
 the hydraulic phenomenon—i. e. tbe breakdown of the stability
 of the jet—is the primary occurrence, and the condensation
 phenomenon follows upon this. It is still possible to patch up
 the view above stated by supposing supersaturation to be
 sacrificed with the breakdown of the jet, seeing that tbc
turbulent motion of the now noisy (intermittent) efflux of
steam is not such in which one would expect to retain the
supersaturated state.
    * Lord Kelvin's well-known equation (cf. Maxwell's ' Heat,' chap, xx.)
is here made the basis of consideration.

   Explanations of this kind are, however, too hazardous to bo
satisfactory. I therefore resolved to enter into the question
thoroughly by exploring what may be called the thermal
topography of the steam-jet, t. e. the longitudinal and radial
distribution of temperature throughout the jet for all
actuating steam-pressures, and for as many temperatures
of the surrounding air as I could obtain. The data * thus
laboriously gained did not, however, enable me to fashion as
trenchant an argument as I had looked for, chiefly because it
is difficult, even with the best thermoelectric means, to measure
the temperature of the narrowing jet quite up to the nozzle ;
and it is just here that the region of marked supersaturation
is located, as is evidenced by the sensitiveness of these parts
(Aitken). It seems expedient, therefore, to postpone decision
for the present, merely stating that if the degree of super-
saturation (measured isothermally as pressure) necessary for
spontaneous condensation can be reached, the data, in virtue
of the Kelvin formula, must lead to a new method for mea
suring the molecular diameter peculiar to water-vapour—a
method, moreover, which need not fail for other vapours.
    In concluding, it is interesting to advert to the cor
responding phenomenon in the case of the solidification of a
liquid.     i have shown t that in an isothermal march the
pressure at which a liquid freezes is apt to be much greater
than the pressure at which the same (solid) substance again
melts. In case of naphthalene, for instance, the magnitude of
the lag may reach 300 to 400 atmospheres. One is therefore
tempted to seek an analogous explanation for the stated
difference of melting and freezing pressures at the same
temperature, in the absence of nuclei, postulating a tendency to
liquefy (osmotic pressure ?) even in solid substance |, varying
with the curvature of the surface. A difficulty, however, now
presents itself, inasmuch as a liquid cooled below its melting-
point (unlike the corresponding case for vapours) can be kept
 in a solid vessel without solidifying. Hence the method for
measuring liquid molecular diameters which seems to loom
into view is not so near at hand.

III. On Torsional Oscillations of Wires. By Dr. W. Peddie,
           Physical Laboratory, Edinburgh University* .
                    Sketch of Previous Work f.
THE present subject is part of the more general one—the
        deformations of a non-rigid solid. That strain, or part
of a strain, which disappears wholly on the removal of the
distorting stress, is called temporary strain : that which is
observed after the complete removal of the distorting stress,
is called permanent strain or set, though it may, and usually
does, diminish as the time which has elapsed since the com
plete removal of distorting stress increases. The latter effect,
together with the converse effect of the gradual increase ot
set under continued constant stress, is called after-action by
the Germans.
    In 1835 (Pogg. Ann.) Weber investigated the laws of
permanent set of a stretched fibre. In 1837 (B. A. Report ;
 see also B. A. Reports, 1843, 1844) Hodgkinson, as the result
 of experiments on cast iron, came to the conclusion that " the
 maxim of loading bodies within the elastic limit has no foun
 dation in nature " ; that is, permanent set is produced by any
 stress however small. In 1842 (Ann. de Clam, et Phys.) and
 1848 (Pogg. Ann. Ergbd. ii.) Wertheim observed that per
 manent set occurred in a previously undistorted body as the
 result of any stress however small ; and in 1848 (Camb. &
 Dubl. Math. Journ.) this limitation to Hodgkinson's statement
 vvas independently pointed out, as a deduction from theory,
 by Prof. James Thomson. On the other hand, a body pre
viously distorted in a given sense may bo again distorted to
 a smaller, or the same, extent in the same sense without the
 production of new permanent set.
    Between 1858 and 1862 G. Wiedemann made statical
 experiments on the torsion of rods, in the course of which
 he verified Wertheim's observation ; and in 1880 (Phil. Mag.
 vol. ix.) he published the results of more extended experiments
 of the same kind. One of these results is that, after repeated
 twistings, alternately in opposite directions, by a given
 couple, the sot of a rod becomes constant ; and, if the rod be
 again twisted, by increasing couples, in the direction of the
 last twist, the strain (measured from the position of set) is

practically proportional to the stress so long as the original
value of the couple is not exceeded. Another is that tho
reversed couple produces a greater strain, measured from the
last set, than does the equal direct couple ; the difference in
this case corresponds to the change of zero produced by the
reversal of the couple—that is, to the set. Again, by repeated
reversals of twist under a given couple, the total torsion and
tho set diminish to fixed minimum values. Also, in the case
of torsion in one direction, the values of the total torsion and
of the set increase at increasing rates as tho couple increases,
and the latter relatively at a greater rate than the former :
these values for a given couple increase to maxima by repeated
applications of the couple, and this increase is also relatively
greater in the set than in the total torsion. Wiedemann
remarks that the approach of the position of final set to that
of final total torsion in this case is a phenomenon of the same
kind as the narrowing of the limits of total torsion and of set
by repeated reversals of a given couple ; the only difference
is that the negative couple is zero. He calls the process by
which the wiro is brought into the steady state as regards
total torsion and set the process of accommodation.
   In 18b'5 (Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond.) Lord Kelvin described
results obtained from the observation of torsional oscillations
of wires. He discovered tho phenomenon of " elastic fatigue,"
and found that the diminution of the range of oscillation, per
equal number of oscillations, followed the law of compound
interest when the range was very much smaller than tho
palpable limits of elasticity. Tomlinson's observations (Phil.
Trans. 1886) support this conclusion.
                Present Observations and Results.
   So far as 1 am aware, no attempt has been made to find the
law of decrease of the range of oscillation when it is so large
that it is accompanied by marked set—set which may amount
to a lar»re fraction of the total ransje. Lord Kelvin's obser-
vations were purposely made upon small oscillations in order
to avoid the disturbances which are introduced when the oscil
lations are large. Because of the known intimate dependence
of the instantaneous state of strain of a body under given
stresses upon all the previous strains to which it has been
subjected, it might be supposed that it would be absolutely
impossible to deduce with certainty any general law of decay
of large oscillations. In other words, any systematic arrange
ment of conditions might seem to be unattainable because of
the possible intrusion of arbitrary and uncontrollable, perhaps
even untraceable, conditions. As a matter of fact, I have

38                       Dr. W. Peddie on
found that, in all my observations hitherto made, such arbi
trariness is notably absent ; and I have been able to obtain an
extremely accurate empirical formula for the representation of
the results.
   The results here given refer only to a single iron wire whose
extremities were soldered into holes drilled axially in stout
brass rods. The length of the wire was 89" 1 centim., and its
diameter was O1011 centim. The one rod was firmly clamped
in a vertical position, with the wire suspended from it ; and
to the other rod was attached, symmetrically and horizontally,
a heavy lead ring of considerable moment of inertia. In per
 forming the observations, one experimenter increased the
torsional oscillations of the system up to a predetermined
 maximum, taking care to avoid as far as possible any swing
 of the sj'stem like that of an ordinary pendulum. Whenever
 the required maximum oscillation was attained, the system
 was left to itself, except in so far as any marked swing of
 the latter kind was damped out in such a way as not to in
 terfere, by friction or otherwise, with the torsional oscillations.
 Another observer commenced at once to take readings of the
 maximum elongation by means of a telescope placed a few
 yards off. The scale was fastened round the outer circum
 ference of the lead ring, and a fixed pointer was placed close
 in front of it. At first readings were taken at the end of each
 complete oscillation ; subsequently, as the time-rate of decay
 of the oscillations became less, readings were taken at the end
 of two, three, five, or more, complete oscillations. A curve
 was then plotted with the scale-readings as ordinates and the
 number of swings as abscissae. The oscillations were found
 to be almost isochronous, so that the axis of abscissa? was
 practically a time-axis. In almost all cases the curve showed
 traces of ordinary pendulum oscillations, but a smooth curve
 could easily be drawn on the average through the observed
 points so as to avoid all such irregularities. It would serve
 no useful purpose to give here the full details of each experi
 ment. Their general nature will bo seen from the curves
 shown in fig. 1, and the special data given in Table II. will
 be found sufficient for each. In fig. 1 the curves give the
 data obtained from observation, and the points show positions
 calculated from the respective equations in Table I.
    It was found that equations of the form
                            y(a; + a)=b,                         (1)
 where a, b, and n are constants, applied with great accuracy
 in each case Table I. gives details on this point.

                 Torsional Oscillations of Wires.                39
   The curves C, G, H, I, J, K are omitted as they were made
with an entirely different object and the readings did not
cover the same range.
   The actual value of the constant added to x depends upon
the interval which elapses after starting the experiment until
the first reading is taken. Thus the fact that in B this constant
is greater by about unity than the similar constants in D, E, F,
while the first reading in B is much less than the first readings
in D, E, F, points to the conclusion that the first reading in that
curve was taken one oscillation later than the first readings in
the latter. "We should therefore expect that the value will be
small when the initial range is large, as in M. The values of
the other two constants in the equation for M are much in
creased relatively to their values in the preceding equations—
a fact which illustrates the dependence of the action at any
stage upon the previous treatment of the wire. The decay of
the oscillations is at first more rapid, afterwards more slow,
than in the preceding experiments.
   In P the phenomenon of elastic fatigue is very apparent.
The conditions were practically the same in this experiment
as in, for example, E, F, andO, with the exception that in P
the wire was kept oscillating to the maximum extent for about
half an hour before the observations began. The rate of decay
of the oscillations is immensely increased at all the observed
values of the range.
   Putting aside the special experiments M and P, we find that,
after the wire had once reached a steady state (in B), the steady
state was maintained day after day ; so that it was easy to
repeat an experiment under practically the same conditions.
Even the exceptional treatment in M did not prevent the
return of the wire to its old condition before the experiment
on the following day was performed. In only one case, L1}
is there any exception, and this may have been due to a
difference of temperature.
   In the earlier experiments the initial range is said to be
over 100. No exact record was kept, but the excess was con
siderable ; the actual angle was probably about 125. In the
experiment 0 the angle was maintained steadily at 125 for some
time before the wire was let go and the observations were
begun. The constaots were not altered by this treatment ;
and this seems to indicate that the " after-action " under
steady stress has little or no effect in these experiments, which
are made under otherwise similar conditions.
   The experiment C was performed on the same date as B ;
so that D was performed after the wire had been at rest for

Torsional Oscillations of Wires. 41
42                       Dr. W. Peddie on
three days. Between the experiments F and L, experiments
were performed every day—twelve experiments in all, some
 with large, some with small, oscillations.
                  Test of the Empirical Formula.
    In the following table a comparison is made of observed
 results in each experiment with the results calculated from
the formula}. In the upper row are given values of y common
 to all the experiments.
    These figures show that the correspondence between tlie
observed results and the results derived from the empirical
 formulae is very close, and that it holds throughout a large
 range of values of x. The curves in fig. 1 show this even
 more clearly.
    All the results given in Table II. for each experiment with
 the exception of P were observed within ten minutes after
starting the oscillations. All the results given for P were
 observed within thirteen minutes. Within these time-limits,
 therefore, the quantity n in the equation is practically constant.
 Yet, since from that table we see that the value of n may
 diminish from 1*32 to 1*18 in the course of twenty-four hours,
 we cannot assume that n will not vary in amount in any one
 experiment until the vibrations cease to bo observable. As
 a matter of fact, it does so vary.
                    Variations in the Value o/n.
    From Table I. it appears that when a fresh wire is oscillated
with a given initial maximum range on different occasions,
the quantity n at first increases in magnitude and ultimately

46                       Dr. W. Peddie on
                Kelvin's and Wiedemann's Theories.
   Lord Kelvin said that the decay of the oscillations might
be due to viscous resistance, i. e. resistance to change of shape
depending on the rate of change, in which case the elasticity
is perfect within the limits of the experiment. On the other
hand he remarked that, if it were due to dependence of the
elastic resilient force on previous conditions of strain, the
phenomenon would be continuous with imperfectness of
elasticity, and this was indicated to some extent by the
phenomenon of " fatigue."
   His final experiments were made with small distortions,
within the palpable limits of elasticity, to test the former
theory. The loss of energy per vibration was greater than
could be accounted for by dissipation ensuing on change of
shape of an elastic solid, and it was also immensely greater
than that due to resistance of the air. He considered also
that the results showed a loss of energy much greater than
any that could be accounted for by imperfection of elasticity.
    Though the compound-interest law was precisely that which
would arise from viscous resistance, yet, in that case, the
 logarithmic decrement should vary inversely as the period ;
 but this was far from being so. Tomlinson finds that the
 decrement is nearly independent of the period in the more
 " non-viscous " metals, and that it increases markedly with
 the period in other metals. Kelvin remarked that the result
 was such as might be due to " after-action " or imperfection
 of elasticity.
     Wiedemann's statical observations showed that a wire
 which had once been twisted behaved in quite different ways
 according as it was twisted to one side or the other of its
 existing position of equilibrium ; whence he concluded that
 " the hypothesis according to which the decay of torsional
 oscillations is due to internal friction depending on the velocity
 alone, can no longer be maintained." Nor could the elastic
 after-action alone account for it. Ho then stated his own
 theory as follows :—Let the wire be " accommodated " by
 frequent rotations to and fro (see the account of his experi
 mental results on p. 37), and therein at last be temporarily
 twisted in the positive direction, describing an angle + a,
 while the molecules may be rotated so that the lower ends of
 their axes, looked at from the axis of the wire, describe an
 angle +«, say to the left. The direction of this rotation
 follows from my magnetic experiments. If the wire be slowly
 brought hack into the permanent torsion-position +b, the
 axes of the molecules will retain a portion 4-/3 of their rota

reached. The values of y for which x had the values 80, 120,
160, 180, 200, 220, 260, 300, were respectively 135, 10, 7-9,
7*2, 6-6, 6, 5, 4*4. The values of the differences of log y at
the extremities of the stretches of x 80-160, 120-200, 180-
260, and 220-300, were respectively proportional to 23, 18,
16, and 13. There is no approach to constancy, although the
average decrease of the range per oscillation during the last
40 oscillations was only one three-hundredth part of the
average range during these oscillations.
   The point will be considered further subsequently.

times occupied by the next ten oscillations, the unit being the

   Despite the irregularities inseparable from the conditions
of the experiment, it is evident that the period, while nearly
constant, increases slightly as the range increases.
                Damping due to the Viscosity of Air.
   In one experiment the surface of the oscillating part of the
apparatus was more than doubled by placing light sheets of
rough paper on the top of the lead ring. It was found
that this did not produce the slightest difference in the ob
served results. Thus the decay of the oscillations is not
appreciably affected by the viscosity of the air.

tion to the left. If the wire now receives an impulse in the
positive direction, which again elongates it up to +a, accord
ing to the laws of perfect elasticity it will swing back again to
the position + b. If it now swings beyond this position farther
to the right, and if the molecules in their rotation had no
friction on one another at all to overcome, it would arrive at
the elongation — a, since the same force tbat twists it from
 + b to +a twists it in the contrary direction from +b to — a,
while the axes of the molecules would be rotated just as far
 (—a) to the right as previously to the left. Again, with
perfect elasticity the wire would go back to the position — b,
in which the molecules would be rotated — /8, and so forth.
The to-and-fro motions of the wire, between ±a and ±b,
are perfectly elastic ; therefore the performances of work in
the swingings outwards and the swingings back again must,
within these limits, completely compensate one another. In
fact, however, there results a diminution of the amplitudes of
oscillation ; hence the loss of vis viva therein can only corre
spond to the work which is expended for the alteration of the
positions of equilibrium, or the rotation of the molecules
from 4-/8 to — /S, which determine it.
                  Theory of tlie Present Results.
   The kinetic theory of the viscosity of gases, as developed
by Maxwell, asserts that viscosity is due to interchange of
momentum between relatively-moving portions of the sub
stances—this interchange being effected by the passage of
molecules from one portion to the other. In the same way
the viscosity of liquids is explained. There is essentially
a passage of molecules from one group to another. Such
passage does not take place in a perfectly elastic solid ; but
there may still be interchange of momentum in the relative
motion of the constituents of a group, and therefore true
viscosity in a solid. Yet, if the potential energy of deforma
tion of a group is large in comparison with the kinetic energy
of average relative motion of the constituent molecules of the
group—a condition which holds in the case of the torsional
vibrations of a fino metallic wire to the free end of which is
attached a mass of great moment of inertia—it seems certain
that the energy dissipated by time viscosity will be small in
comparison with the energy dissipated in the breaking down
of molecular groups (as in Maxwell's theory of a molecularly
constituted solid) , should such rupture take place to, possibly,
a small extent only.
   Wiedemann seems to regard the loss of energy as due to
the work done in rotating the molecules from one position of

  48                      Dr. W. Peddie on
  stable equilibrium to another, that rotation causing, in its
  turn, the permanent relative displacement of the moleculos
  which occurs in the " set : " and this, of course, is quite a
 plausible hypothesis. In the homogeneous permanent torsional
 strain the final configuration of a given group of molecules
 is essentially similar to the initial configuration ; yet we may,
 since a position of unstable equilibrium has been passed, say
 that the old configuration has broken down and that a new
 one has been formed ; so that the loss of energy may be
 ascribed to the work done in breaking down molecular con
 figurations.
     There seems to me to be no need to ascribe such a special
 type to the rupture of the configurations. On the contrary,
 I think it more likely that the permanent molecular rotation
 is a consequence of the permanent set which ensues on com
plete rupture of configurations—t. e. rupture in which mole
cules in given configurations part company, new groups
being formed. It appears to be most probable that the loss
of energy in this total rupture greatly exceeds, group by
group, the loss due to the cause which Wiedemann contem
plates.
    Such total rupture takes place in all liquids and in plastic
solids ; and, by analogy, we conclude that it takes place in
all solids to a greater or less extent. Indeed we do not
need to rest upon analogy. The evaporation of ice below
the freezing-point is due to such rupture ; and so, probably,
as has been remarked, is the characteristic smell of metals,
such as freshlj' cut copper or iron. At a given temperature,
the molecules in a given configuration are in rapid motion
with a certain average speed, the actual speed of a molecule
being sometimes greatly in defect, sometimes greatly in
excess, of this average. When the excess is sufficiently great,
the molecule will pass beyond the range of the molecular
action of the remaining constituents of the group, rupture of
the configuration will occur, and the potential energy of
deformation will be transformed into heat energy. In a
sufficiently long interval of time such rupture must occur,
according to the kinetic theory. In a given state of strain
it occurs more readily the higher the temperature ; at a given
temperature it occurs more readily the greater the strain.
    It is easy to see that, if a molecule is under directional
control by molecular forces, rotation will in general ensue
on rupture of a given group. A dynamical illustration will
make this plain.
    Let PQ represent a pendulum, with a massive bob Q,
supported at the point P. Let the pendulum be situated

                  Torsional Oscillations of Wires.              49
symmetrically between the rigid fixed blocks A, 'A', to which it
is attached by equal and similar elastic cords I, I1 ; and let the
pendulum be attached also by equal and similar elastic cords
X, \', to the rough movable blocks B, B', which rest, sym
metrically with regard to P Q, upon A, A'. So long as B, B'
are not displaced the equilibrium position of PQ will not be
altered ; but if the bob be moved to the right to such an
extent as to move the block B into the position indicated by
the dotted lines, so that the cord \ becomes slacker, the
equilibrium position will change. The slackening of the cord
\ corresponds to the removal of a molecule from a given con
figuration. The displacement of the equilibrium position
corresponds to the set of the molecule P Q. There is change
of relative position of Q, A, A', and B', and there is also
rotation of PQ from its old direction. The change which
takes place in one group is shared by all other groups which
are in direct or indirect connexion with that group. This
could be shown in the model by attaching PQ by elastic
cords to other pendulums. In this way the whole system
takes a set.
    Displacement of Q from the new position of equilibrium
towards the right will take place strictly in accordance with
Hooke's Law so long as the former maximum displacement
is not exceeded. The old maximum force will be needed to
cause the original maximum displacement to the right, but
the actual displacement which it causes is now measured from
the new equilibrium position. An equal force applied in the
opposite direction shifts the equilibrium point back to its old
situation, and gives a maximum displacement to the left, from
this point, equal to the former maximum to the right. As
regarded from the second equilibrium position to the right,
the system resists more strongly displacements farther to the

right than it resists equal displacements to the left. These
facts illustrate Wiedemann's experimental results with regard
to the torsion of wires.
   Consider the wire in its initial undisturbed condition, or in
any condition of equilibrium with set provided that the next
torsion is to be oppositely directed to that which was last
performed and which produced the set. If the wire be now
twisted through an angle 0, and if, during that twist, no
configurations break down, the potential energy will be re
presented, in accordance with Hooke's Law, by the expression
where k is a constant. If there is rupture of molecular
groups, the potential energy will fall short of the above
amount by a quantity which we shall assume to be propor
tional to a power of the angle. Thus we get
                     V=$kff2-P6m                             (3)
   In those cases in which the loss of energy, per outward
swing, is small in comparison with the total energy, so that
the set is negligible in comparison with the total range, the
loss is practically equal to hd d0. Hence (3) takes the form
                        -Mdd=p6mdt,                          (4)
where dt is the time of an outward swing. The integral is
                        6*{t + t0)=b,                        (5)
where b and ^0 are constants, and « = m + 2.
   This is exactly our empirical equation (1) ; which we thus
derive as an approximate consequence of the theory that the
loss of energy is due to the rupture of molecular configura
tions, and is proportional to a power of the angle of torsion.
   A glance at the curves in fig. 1 will show that, in the
steeper portions, the drop of angle per single swing is not
really negligible in comparison with the range, though, even
in the steepest portions, it does not exceed one tenth part of
the range and rapidly diminishes as the range decreasi'S.
Hence we cannot expect the values of n which hold through
out those portions of the curves which are dealt with in
Table II. to hold at still smaller angles of distortion. The
value of n which holds approximately over a considerable
stretch of a curve where the angle is large will, quite apart
from after-action, be greater than the value which holds over
a considerable stretch where the angle is small.
           Deduction of the Compound-Interest Law.
   In experiment C the value of n decreased, as time went
on, from a value greater than unity to a value less than unity.

                  Torsional Oscillations of Wires.           51
 If, in equation (4), we put m = 2, equation (5) takes the form
 which expresses the above law. This law therefore follows
 from our theory if we suppose that n decreases in value to
 the limit zero ; and the theory shows that the decrement of
 energy per swing then follows the compound-interest law—
just as the decrement of angle does.
                   Explanation of After-action.
    When a wire is held in a state of torsion under a constant
 couple, some of the less stable molecular groups will in time
 break down, and so the strain slowly increases. If it be held
in a given state of strain, this gradual rupture of groups
 necessitates a slow diminution of the couple. On the removal
of the couple, the wire remains in a state of internal stress
because of the set. Consequently the gradual rupture of
 groups produces a slow diminution of set ; for the strongest
 groups remain unbroken in the original deformation, and, in
any ordinary experiment, the groups which break form a
small fraction of the whole. This is Maxwell's explanation.
    The after-action takes place with comparative rapidity at
first: afterwards it goes on more slowly. It takes place more
and more completely the longer the strain is continued, and
 requires proportionally longer maintenance of an equal reverse
strain to undo it. Hence, if a wire be twisted first to tbe
right through a given angle for a long time, then to tbe left
through an equal angle for a short time, and be then gradually
put into the position of set, we should expect that the set
would change (as it does) first in the sense of recovery from
the second strain, and finally in the sense of recovery from
the first strain.
         Conditions of Maximum and of Zero Resilience.
   From equation (3) we obtain
                  -dV=-kd + mP0>"-\
or, say,                 =—k9 + I/6*+1,
Hence we see that there is angle of maximum resilience

    As the torsion of a wire is increased, the set and the differ
 ence between the angle of torsion and the angle of set
increase. This goes on until the angle 0 is reached. As the
 twisting couple is further increased, the set increases at a
 greater rate than the torsion. The stronger configurations
 now break down, and the removal of the twisting couple is
 followed by small recoil. If the twisting couple be maintained
 in excess of the value required to overcome the maximum
 resilient couple, work is done constantly in breaking up
 molecular groups, and the material of the wire flows steadily,
 the angle of torsion and the set increasing at constant equal
 rates. Under that constant couple there is also constant
 resilience. The condition corresponding to the theoretical
 angle 0O is attainable under a finite couple of moment
 k'0 1,+1 = k0o. Thus the theory indicates that the melting-point
 is conditioned by shearing-stress.
    The flow will of course commence at the surface of the
 wire. The angle # might also be called the Angle of Plas
 ticity, and the couple k0o might be termed the Couple of
 Fluidity.
                 Relation between Torsion and Set.
    If we assume that the torsional rigidity is not sensibly
 altered by set, the quantity k is constant, and we may write
 (3) in the form
 where a. is the angle of set.   This gives
                   "=*(»-\A-*L4i>
     To test this expression I have used Wiedemann's statical
  observations given in Table I. p. 4, Phil. Mag. 1880, vol. ix.
  I find that the equation
                 a = 0(1 — •l-8SH)(lO)-ie03-M8)
  corresponds to a remarkable extent with his observations.
  The curve in fig. 2 represents this equation with values of
  0 as ordinates and values of a. as abscissae ; and the points on
  or near it represent Wiedemann's results.          No stronger
  confirmation of the theory need be desired.

The kinetic energy of the system oscillating as a whole is

the expression for V represents kinetic energy of molecular

Hence we have
                       ie* + k82= constant,
which shows that the motion outwards is simple harmonic
motion as reckoned from the origin; but it is only so in
virtue of the condition that the defect of the potential energy
from the value that it would have in accordance with Hooke's
Law is due to its transformation into a kinetic form. The
periods of the outward swing from zero and of the inward
swing to the position of set, on the assumption that k does
not change, are each equal to
                            Wl
   Wiedemann's statical experiments show that after the few
preliminary applications of the maximum twisting couple
necessary to fix the set, 6— a. varies almost in accordance
with Hooke's Law, and that the slight difference is in the
direction of too great magnitude as the torsion increases :
and Tomlinson has shown that great permanent torsion de
creases the torsional elasticity. These facts may indicate
that k is slightly decreased at the greater torsions, in which
case the period of oscillation will slightly increase as the
range is increased.
                      Concluding Remarks.
   The experiment A was not the first made with the given
wire, though it was the first made with it under the stated
conditions of length &c. Thus, in A the wire was in a fatigued
condition relatively to its condition in the experiments R
and S.
   It has been found by Kelvin and Tomlinson that, in the
case of small ranges, the rate of decrease of range per oscil
lation is practically constant for all periods of oscillation in

the less viscous metals and increases with the period in other
metals. According to the above theory this is due to the
fact that a given state of stress is continued longer, so that
the molecular configurations have more opportunity to break
down.
   If the theory were pushed to the extreme in its application
to Wiedemann's results on torsion and set above quoted, we
should find that 0=2400, and that the couple necessary for
zero resilience was fully double the maximum couple em
ployed by Wiedemann (that corresponding to 0 = 1725).
   Various deductions might be drawn from the theory in
connexion with the observed values of the constants in the
empirical equations. I do not think that such deductions
would be of any value except in connexion with a much wider
experimental basis than that furnished above. I hope soon to
be able to communicate the results of further observations.
IV. On the Mechanism of Electrical Conduction.—Part I.
   Conduction in Metals. By Charles V. Burton, D.Sc*
1. ri^flE view of electrical conduction which it is here my
    JL object to explain receives general support from
more than one consideration ; for it leads to the conclusion
that deviations from Ohm's Law must be quite inappreciable
in the case of metallic conductors, and it goes far to explain,
I think, why metals are so much less opaque than thou
ordinary conductivities would lead us to infer. But it is no,
alone on such considerations that we have to rely, for, as i
seems to me, the main conclusions are capable of exact demon
stration ; and accordingly it would appear most convenient to
commence with a few simple theorems, seeking afterwards to
account for known phenomena by means of our definite results.
                          2. Theorem I.
   In a region containing matter, there may be (and probably
always are) some parts which are perfect insulators and, some
parts which are perfect conductors ; but there can be no parts
whose conductivity is finite—unless every finitely conductive
portion is enclosed by a perfectly conductive envelope.
   Before proceeding to the proof of this theorem, it may be
remarked that the presence of the last clause in no way
modifies any application of our result, since the space within
a perfectly conductive envelope is completely shielded from
    * Communicated by the Physical Society : read April 13, 1894.

56                   Dr. C. V. Burton on the
the influence of external charges, currents, or magnets. In
the present state of science, indeed, such words appear neces
sary to the completeness of demonstration, but they do not
need to be considered in any of our deductions from the
theorem, and for my own part I am persuaded that in reality
there is nothing corresponding to the possibility which they
suggest.
   Consider now the case of any body whatever, at any tem
perature other than absolute zero. We know that electro
magnetic radiations will spread out into the ether surrounding
the body, and we must suppose that the intermolecular spaces
within the body are also traversed by electromagnetic dis
turbances. Let us suppose then, for a moment, that in the
molecules of the body there are some finitely conductive
portions which are not enclosed in perfectly conductive en
velopes. The electromagnetic disturbances will give rise to
currents of conduction in these portions, and accordingly
energy will be degraded into a form which is not heat, since it
consists, not in the motion or relative positions of molecules
 or appreciable parts of molecules, or in electromagnetic dis
 turbances of the intervening ether, but in something much
 more fine-grained. We shall thus have a continual degradation
 of heat into energy of a lower form • for the electromagnetic
 " damping " of the finitely conductive bodies involves a con
 tinual drain on the energy of internal radiation, and hence
 indirectly on the energy of the molecules, so that heat will be
 automatically dissipated in the interior of the body. This
process, in which the radiative molecules are continually
imparting to the ether more energy than they receive in
return, may be compared to the surface cooling of an isolated
 body which radiates towards colder surroundings.
   Even if we suppose the finitely conductive bodies to be
extremely small and their conductivity to be either extremely
small or extremely great, it is not hard to see that the rate of
absorption of heat must be tremendous ; and when we con
sider (for example) the effect which even a very slow absorp
tion, continued for millions of years, would have had on the
temperature of our planet, we must admit that the absence of
that dissipation of heat implied in the denial of Theorem I. has
been established with an exactitude almost unparalleled. Thus
the theorem is established.
   3. In connexion with this result we are reminded that
Poisson's theory of dielectrics requires the molecules of in
sulating substances to possess some conductive portions, though
whether the conductivity of such portions is finite or infinite

                 Mechanism of Electrical Conduction.               57
is of no moment in electrostatics. On the other hand, both
Ampere's theory of magnetism and Weber's theory of dia-
magnetism suppose the existence of perfectly conductive particles,
and are thus strongly supported by our result.
    In discussing Weber's theory of diamagnetism, Maxwell *
points out that the currents excited in a perfectly conductive
 body by any external cause are entirely confined to the surface
 of the body. Thus the perfectly conductive bodies in Theorem 1.
 may be replaced by perfectly conductive surfaces, without
altering any of our conclusions ; but it would be hard to
decide whether a perfectly conductive geometrical surface is
or is not a physical possibility without knowing more of
 electromagnetism—not to speak of ordinary matter.
                             4. Theorem II.
    In metals, and in other non-electrolytes whose conductivity is
finite, the transmission of currents must be effected by the inter
 mittent contact of perfectly conductive particles.
    For if there were not these intermittent contacts, any given
 two of the conductive particles would be either permanently
 in contact with one another, or permanently out of contact,
 and there would be only two cases to consider. If through
 out the substance there extended continuous chains of (per
 fectly) conductive particles in contact with one another, the
 substance as a whole would be a perfect conductor ; while in
 the absence of such chains of particles, the substance would
 be a perfect non-conductor. Finite conductivity can only
 exist when the contacts are intermittent.
    5. An immediate corollary is
                              Theorem III.
    If we suppose that in a substance at the absolute zero of
 temperature tltere is no relative motion amongst the molecules or
 amongst their appreciable parts, it follows that every substance
 at this temperature must have either infinite specific resistance
  {which need not imply infinite dielectric strength), or infinite
 conductivity.
    For the denial of relative motion involves the denial of that
 intermittence of contact which in Theorem II. was shown to
 be necessary to finite conductivity.
    This conclusion is in accordance with the experiments of
           * ' Electricity and Magnetism,' 2nd ed. vol. ii. 5 840.

 58                  Dr. C. V. Burton on the
Dewar and Fleming * on the resistance of pure unalloyed
metals at very low temperatures. In the case of all the pure
 metals examined by these authors (platinum, gold, palladium,
silver, copper, aluminium, iron, nickel, tin, magnesium, zinc,
 cadmium, lead, and thallium), the temperature-resistance
 curves are almost straight lines, and these, being produced,
would pass very nearly through the point whose coordinates
are zero temperature and zero resistance.
   The same was not found to hold good for the temperature-
resistance curves for alloys; but if these curves could be pursued
far enough by experiment, they must be found, I think, to
terminate at the origin of coordinates, like those of the pure
metals.
    6. Dissipation of Energy in a Conductor conveying
                           a Current.
   In fig. 1 let A and B be two perfectly conductive particles
(whether molecules or parts of the
same or of different molecules we                     Fig. 1.
need not consider), and let them be                A            JL

also that there is an applied E.M.F.
acting from right to left (as indicated             <            (((((
by the large arrow) . Then, generally
speaking, A will be negatively electri-        _f~\           (^~\ >
fied, owing to a previous encounter "* V-/                    v_/
with some particle farther to the left,
and for a similar reason B will in general be positively electri
fied. When A and B collide, the usual effect is to leave A on
the whole positively electrified, and B negatively electrified.
   Remembering that the conductivity of A and B is perfect,
let us consider what transformations of energy are effected by
movements and collisions of this kind. Before the collision,
A being negatively electrified is urged towards the right
by the applied E.M.F., while B being positively electrified
is urged towards the left : that is, A and B are urged
together, and are gaining kinetic energy at the expense of the
source of applied E.M.F. After the collision, the electrifica
tions are, generally speaking, reversed, so that A and B are
now being urged apart by the applied E.M.F., and continue
to gain kinetic energy as before. Further, when particles
such as A and B come into collision, so as to cause a re
adjustment of their electrifications, and also when they are in
motion between two collisions, electromagnetic disturbances
will be produced in the intermolecular ether ; but since all

              Mechanism of Electrical Conduction.             59
the conductive particles are perfectly conductive, no electro
magnetic energy can penetrate within them. Thus the energy
expended by the source of E.M.F. which maintains a steady
current through a conductor is converted partly into additional
energy of the molecules, and partly into electromagnetic dis
turbances of the intervening ether : that is, the dissipated
energy takes the form of heat, as we know from experiment.
                         7. Ohm's Law.
   In the case of a metal wire (especially one at a bright red
heat), Ohm's Law has been verified with great exactitude,
the results of the experiments designed by Maxwell and curried
out by Chrystal being summed up by the latter in the following
words *:—" If we have a conductor [of iron, platinum, or
German silver] whose section is a square centimetre, and
whose resistance for infinitely small currents is an ohm, its
resistance (provided the temperature is kept the same) is not
diminished by so much as the 1/1013 part when a current of a
farad per second passes through it."
    Now when a current is conveyed through a substance by
intermittent contacts amongst a number of perfectly con
ductive particles, the effective conductivity depends firstly on
the properties of the intermolecular medium, and secondly on
the size, form, distribution, and movements of the particles
themselves. In order that the resistance of the conductor
may be sensibly constant—in order, that is, that the current
transmitted may be sensibly proportional to the impressed
E.M.F.—two conditions must evidently be satisfied: —
    (i.) For such values of impressed electromotive intensity
as exist in the intermolecular spaces (say about "003 volt
per cm.) the relation between electromotive intensity and
 electric displacement must be sensibly linear.
    (ii.) The forces which the particles of the substanco ex
perience owing to the impressed E.M.F. must bo very small
 in comparison with the ordinary intermolecular forces, ho that
during the time of a single molecular excursion the motion
 of no particle is appreciably influenced by the presence of the
 E.M.F. If we suppose that in the conducting substance wo
 can maintain a steady distribution of temperature which is
 independent of the current flowing through, this second con
 dition implies that the particles of the substance under tho
 steady distribution may be regarded as a system of perfect
 conductors, whose coordinates are explicitly given fiimtlinim
 of the time, and are sensibly unalterable by an E.M.l1'.

 60                     Dr. C. V. Burton on the
 impressed upon the system from without. This condition,
combined with (i.), will evidently give us Ohm's Law.
    Now the forces actually present and tending to modify the
 heat-movements are of two kinds : electromagnetic and
electrostatic.
    (a) Electromagnetic Forces.—The passage of a current
 through a conductor gives rise to a magnetic field, which
 may or may not appreciably affect the conductivity. The
 thin iron wire used by Prof. Chrystal was "0021 cm. in
 radius, and the greatest value of the magnetic force due to a
current of 1 ampere per square centimetre of cross section
 would be in absolute measure about "0013 (at the surface of
the wire), the square of the greatest magnetic force being
thus about "0000017. The average value of (magnetic
force)2 over the cross section of the wire would be half of
this, or -00000085; that is, about -0000039 of the square of
 the terrestrial " total force " in these parte.
    Now Lord Kelvin found * that the change of resistance
due to transverse magnetization of an iron plate by a powerful
Ruhmkorff electromagnet was only just decided enough to be
distinctly appreciated with the apparatus which he employed,
and we may therefore conclude that in Prof. Chrystal's iron
wire no perceptible change of resistance could have been
produced by the magnetic field of the current. In other
metals the effect must be still more insignificant.
    On the other hand, the longitudinal magnetization of an
iron wire perceptibly increases its electrical resistance, so
that it would be easy to construct a simple conductor whose
resistance at a given temperature was a function of the
current-strength. For let a flat bobbin be wound with iron
wire, so that each turn has the form of an elongated rectangle,
and then let a further quantity of iron wire be wound in a
similar circuit embracing the first. Finally let the coils be
joined in series with a source of E.M.F. When a current
is sent through the circuit, each coil will magnetize longi
tudinally some parts of the wire of the other coil, and so, for
a given temperature of the wire, the resistance will increase
with the current.
    (b) Electrostatic Forces.—Let us attempt to calculate the
electrostatic energy per cubic centimetre which a mass of iron
possesses in virtue of a current flowing through it with a
" density "'of 1 ampere per cm." To do this we must assume
some value for the specific inductive capacity of iron f, and
   * Phil. Trans. 1856, especially pp. 747-749.
   t In electrostatic measurements conductors appear to have an infinite
specific inductive capacity ; but here, where the potential really varies
from point to point through the metal, it is the true (finite) specific
inductive capacity which concerns us.

               Mechanism of Electrical Conduction.             61
in order to take a sufficiently unfavourable view of the
question, let us assume the value to be as high as 20. Taking
the specific resistance of iron in electromagnetic measure to
be 10,000, and remembering that 1 ampere ='1 absolute
unit, we have for the electromotive intensity 1000 electro
magnetic units of potential per cm., i.e. 1000-i-(3 x 1010)
electrostatic units per cm. Hence the electrostatic energy
per c. c. due to the impressed E.M.F.

                       ~8*(3xl07):,ergS;
while to calculate the thermal energy per c. c. at " a bright
red heat "—the temperature of the iron in the British Asso
ciation experiments—we have:—
    Temperature above absolute zero (say) = 727 + 273
                                            = 1000 Cent, degrees,
    Density of iron                         = 7"8,
    Specific heat                           =•113,
    One gram-water-degree of heat . =42 x 106 ergs.
 Thus (roughly speaking) the thermal energy per c. c. reckoned
 from absolute zero
                = 1000 x 7-8 x -113 x 42 x 106 ergs.
 A comparison of these results gives
     electrostatic energy due to impressed E.M.F.         1
                     thermal energy                  — 4xlOw
 only, even on our assumption that the specific inductive
 capacity of iron in electrostatic measure is as high as 20. If
 we suppose that half the thermal energy is potential and half
 kinetic, then the electrostatic energy would be 1-H (2 x 1022) of
 the thermal kinetic energy ; that is, would be equal to the
 additional energy required to increase the existing velocity of
 every particle by one part in 2 X 1023. When due account is
 taken of these results it is not surprising to find that in iron
 at a given temperature the specific resistance for a current-
  density of one ampere per cm.2 differs from the specific
  resistance for an infinitesimal current-density by less than one
  part in 1012.
     The same remarks apply with even greater force to platinum
  and German silver, the other metals examined by Prof.
  Chrystal, since the magnetic influence of the current on the
  resistances of these metals must be far less than even in the
  case of iron.
     From considerations similar to these, we should expect in
  all true conducting substances (even in those having marked

 62                    Dr. C. V. Burton on the
 magnetic properties) to find a sensibly linear relation con
 necting current-density with electromotive intensity in the
 neighbourhood of each point.
         8. Contact E.M.F. and the Peltier Effect.
    It will now appear that, by assuming in each molecule
 a mere arrangement of conducting and non-conducting parts,
 we may realize what is at all events a working model of
 contact E.M.F. and of the Peltier effect ; and even should
 our model serve no other purpose, it directs our attention to
 a possibility which seems so far to have been overlooked, and
 which must, indeed, continue to be overlooked so long as
 each metal is regarded as homogeneous. As it not my object
 to state with becoming vagueness an hypothesis as to the
 nature of Peltier's phenomenon, but rather to picture as
 clearly as possible a mechanism whose principle may perhaps
 be suggestive of the truth, 1 shall assume for the molecules
 such a structure and distribution as appear most favourable
to simplicity of treatment.
    Suppose, then, that in one of the metals with which we
have to deal, each molecule is of the form indicated in fig. 2 :
 a central perfectly conductive body, charged (say)       p. „
positively, being completely surrounded by an
insulating layer, and this again being partially            ~
 (though not completely) enclosed by a number
of perfectly conductive particles. It will be con
venient to suppose that in each molecule these outer
particles are all electrically connected with one another. When
two such molecules come into collision, the outer particles of
the one may not in general be reduced to the same potential as
those of the other, for the electrical oscillations occasioned by
the contact may not have time to subside into insignificance
before the encounter is ended. But the general tendency of
a collision between two molecules will be towards an equaliza
tion of the potentials of the outer particles, and the average
values of potentials and charges amongst any considerable
number of molecules will be the same as if, during each
molecular encounter, this equalization has been completely
effected.
   It will here be convenient to introduce the term " con
duction-potential," and as we proceed the following definitions
will be found useful:—
   Tlie conduction-potential of a molecule is the potential (or
average potential) of its outer conductive particles.
   The conduction-potential at a point within a metallic body
is the average conduction-potential of the molecules in the
neighbourhood of that point.

              Mechanism of Electrical Conduction.            63
   Let us now turn to the case of a considerable mass of metal,
made up entirely of such molecules as that sketched in fig. 2;
every molecule having the same structure and the same
internal charge. Let us suppose also that the mass of metal
is at the same temperature and in the same physical condition
throughout, so that the average distance between adjacent
molecules is the same in the neighbourhood of each point.
If the metallic body is subjected to electrostatic induction, it
is easy to see that no electric influence from without can
penetrate far beyond the surface ; for the outer particles
of the superficial molecules, owing to their intermittent
contacts with one another, will screen the interior of the
metal as a network of continuous wires might do, and at a
depth of a very few molecules beneath the surface the
screening will be practically complete. Thus any charge
communicated to the conductor will be confined entirely to
the superficial layers of molecules; and it follows that if
between any two points well within the metal there were a
difference of average conduction- potential, there would be a
general flow of electrification from the higher towards the
lower potential. The average conduction-potential within the
metal does not therefore vary from point to point, and account
being taken of the equality of the internal charges of the
molecules, it follows that the average potential of the inter-
molecular ether is similarly free from variation. This implies
that the total electrification of any considerable assemblage
of molecules within the metal is sensibly zero; so that the
average charge on the outer conductive particles of each
molecule is equal and opposite to the fixed charge on the
central particle. The conclusions of this paragraph have
been necessarily confined to molecules not too near the
surface; for .although the general tendency of an encounter
between two molecules is always to equalize their conduction-
potentials, these potentials change somewhat after the mole
cules have become separated, and near the free surface of the
body the change will be systematically greater for the
molecule which moves outwards after collision than for that
which moves inwards.
   We may now try to realize what will happen when contact
takes placo between two metals whose molecules are con
structed on the general plan of fig. 2, while those of the one
metal are not identical with those of the other. The most
simple and intelligible view will be obtained by supposing the
molecule of the one metal to have a positively charged central
particle, while the molecule of the other has its central
particle negatively charged (fig. 3). Consider what would

64                   Dr. C. V. Burton on the
occur if we could start from a condition in which each of the
border molecules, A, B, 0, D, &c., had on the whole no charge ;
a condition, that is, in which the outer particles of each
molecule had a charge equal and opposite to the fixed charge
                              Fig. 3.
of the central particle. (We have already seen that this
is true for the average molecule within a homogeneous metallic
mass.) Now when B and C come into collision, it is evident
that the outer particles of B will lose some of their negative
electrification, while the outer particles of C will lose some of
their positive; and thus we see that when the distribution
of conduction-potential has become steady, such border par
ticles as B or 0 will have on their outer particles a (negative
or positive) charge less than the (positive or negative) fixed
central charge, and to a smaller extent the same will be true
of particles (such as A, D, &c.) more remote from the border.
But when the settled condition has been reached, the passage
(say) of B backwards and forwards between A and C will not
change the distribution of charges amongst the molecules ;
and the condition that no change of the kind shall take place
is that when two molecules are in a position to collide their
conduction-potentials shall be equal. Now when B approaches
C (which has on the whole a negative charge) its potential
is lowered, and when B returns towards A its potential rises
again, so that if B in its backward and, forward motion is not
to act as a systematic carrier of electrification between A and
C, the conduction-potential of A must be higher than that of C
Similarly, by considering C as moving backwards and for
wards between B and D, we can see that B must have a
higher conduction-potential than D.
   This gives us a contact-difference of conduction-potential.
   If we suppose our analysis to become a trifle less pene
trating, such molecules as B (and to a less extent A, &c.) will
appear to be positively electrified, C, D, &c. will appear to be
negatively electrified, and molecules farther removed from
the border will appear unelectrified. With still less micro

                Mechanism of Electrical Conduction.                 65
  scopical vision, we shall find the conduction-potential constant
  from point to point throughout the mass of metal on either
  side of the surface of separation; hut as we approach that
  surface from the left, the conduction-potential begins to
  diminish, changing very rapidly by a finite amount as we pass
 through the boundary.
     We now come to a theorem which is certainly true for our
 model, and which seems to me as certainly true for any
  mechanism which could be devised to represent the Peltier
 effect ; but for the sake of avoiding questions of too con
 troversial a character, the statement may be made in this
 conditional form:
                            Theorem IV.
     In our model, the contact-difference of c<m&uct\on-potential
 between two metals is equal to the coefficient of the Peltier effect.
 For when a molecule at the junction is moving backwards
 and forwards between places of different potentials, provided
 no current flows through the junction, as much electrification
 is carried from the lower to the higher potential as from the
 higher to the lower, and on the whole there is no transforma
 tion of electric energy into heat, or vice versa. But when a
 current flows across the junction from the metal of lower to
 that of higher conduction-potential, the molecules at the
 junction are persistently carrying more electrification from
 the lower to the higher potential than they bring back with
 them on their return, and thus on the whole the movements
 of the molecules at the junction are systematically opposed
 by electrostatic forces. It is evident from elementary con
 siderations that the quantity of electricity which has crossed
 the junction, multiplied by the step of (conduction-) potential
 up which it has passed, is the measure of the total work done
 by the molecules against electrostatic forces, and is therefore
 the measure of the heat absorbed. Similarly, when a current
 has been flowing from the metal of higher to that of lower
 conduction-potential, the quantity of electricity which has
 crossed the junction, multiplied by the (negative) step of
 conduction-potential, is the measure of the (negative) heat
absorbed; that is, numerically, of the heat given out. Hence,
 in our model, the coefficient of the Peltier effect is equal to
 the contact- difference of conduction-potential.
    Again, generally speaking, we may expect a difference of
conduction-potential between a hotter and a colder portion of
the same metal, owing to the increase of molecular distances
which rise of temperature produces; and it is evident that (on
our model) the specific heat of electricity for any metal is equal
to the rise of conduction-potential for one degree rise of tem
perature.

 66                    Dr. C. V. Barton on the
    9. From these results we pass on to
                             Theorem V.
    For any pair of metals at the absolute zero of temperature,
 the Peltier effect vanishes.
    This is evidently true for our model, for when the molecules
 are all reduced to relative rest, and there is permanent
 instead of intermittent contact amongst their outer particles,
 the conduction-potential will be uniform throughout both
 metals, and at the junction there will be no Peltier effect.
 But whatever view we take of the nature of the phenomenon,
 the proposition is necessarily true. For if the Peltier effect
 had a finite value for a pair of metals at the absolute zero of
 temperature, we could cause an absorption of heat by sending
 a current through the junction in the proper direction; and
 this is impossible, since there is no heat to be absorbed.
                        10. Volta E.M.F.'s.
    We must now consider a possibility suggested by our
model, and referred to in the opening sentence of §8. It is
not difficult to see that, with molecules constructed on the
plan of fig. 2, even when all measurements are made in vacuo,
 the conduction- potential of a mass of metal is not in general
 the same as the potential estimated by work done on an
 external charged body, or by electrification induced on a
 second mass of metal insulated from the first,—potential
measured in the latter way being called for distinction the
induction-potential.
   We may realize this most easily by considering the case of
two metals in contact at the absolute zero of temperature, for
then, in accordance with the last section, the Peltier effect at
the junction vanishes, and the conduc-            p.
<«>n-potential is the same through
out both metals ; while on the other
hand the difference of induction- ¦
potential may be finite. Let fig. 4
represent diagrammatically a very
large number of molecules which are
at rest with their outer conduc
tive particles in electrical contact
throughout. Let the fixed central
charge of each molecule be positive.
Then, if the outer conductive par
ticles of each molecule formed a
complete envelope around the central charge, the induction-
potential of the metal would be identical with its condnction-
potential, and the same as if the fixed central charges did

                   Mechanism of Electrical Conduction.               67
 not exist. But since we suppose the fixed charge in each
 molecule to be incompletely screened by the outer particles,
 it follows that at external points in the immediate neigh
 bourhood of the metallic body the potential is raised above
 the conduction-potential by the fixed central charges. If
 these last were negative instead of positive, the potential
 just outside the metallic mass would be lower than the
 conduction-potential ; and we may suppose that at any
 given temperature (such as the absolute zero with which
 we are dealing) the difference between the conduction-
 potential of a metallic body and the potential just outside the
 body depends upon the nature of the metal. Thus, even
 in vacuo, if two metals at the absolute zero of temperature be
 connected together so as to have the same conduction-
 potential, their induction-potentials may be different; and in
 general, whatever the temperature of the metals in contact,
 we may expect an inequality between difference of conduction-
 potential and the difference of «Wwc</on-potential.
    Before attempting to devise a model of Peltier's phenome
 non and of electromotive forces of contact, I had held the
 opinion—in common, I believe, with the majority of dis
 putants in the contact-force controversy—that the inductive
 measurement of potential-differences in a sufficiently perfect
 vacuum must conclusively decide the points at issue. But if
 in reality there should be, as the model suggests, a difference
 between conduction-potentials and induction-potentials, we
 must not rely upon inductive experiments, even in a perfect
 vacuum, to determine the seats of electromotive force in a
 voltaic cell. For when we are dealing with the flow of cur
 rents through metals, it is the conduction-potential which
concerns us.
                 11. The Transparency of Metals.
    A difficulty in connexion with this subject is stated by
Maxwell in the following well-known passage * :—" Gold,
silver, and platinum are good conductors, and yet, when
formed into very thin plates, they allow light to pass through
them. From experiments which I have made on a piece of
gold-leaf, the resistance of which was determined by Mr.
Hockin, it appears that its transparency is very much greater
than is consistent with our theory, unless we suppose that
there is less loss of energy when the electromotive forces are
reversed for every semi-vibration of light than when they act
   • ' Electricity and Magnetism,' 2nd ed. vol. ii. § 800. Wien (Wiede
mann's Annalen, xxxv. pp. 41-62) found a silver film to have only such
an opacity as would be deduced from about 1/440 of its actual cmi-
ductivity.

68                  Dr. C. V. Barton on the
for sensible times, as in onr ordinary experiments." Now we
have seen that conduction is not a perfectly continuous
phenomenon, but is due to innumerable encounters among
perfectly conductive particles, and without entering upon any
calculations (which indeed would be a difficult matter) we
can see that there are, broadly speaking, two reasons why the
opacity of metals is so much smaller than is indicated by
Maxwell's analysis : these are, heterogeneity of structure and
intermittence of contact.
   To realize the influence of heterogeneity of structure with
out the complication of intermittent contacts, take the case
of a metal at the absolute zero of temperature. We have
then virtually to deal with a network of perfect conductors,
constituting a body which as a whole has perfect conductivity,
and of which even an excessively thin film would be an effectual
barrier to electromagnetic waves, provided that the wave
length were great enough to justify us in treating the metal
as homogeneous. But if we consider an extreme case, where
the wave-length of the disturbance is negligible in comparison
with the dimensions of a single conductive particle, a very
thin layer of the metal will be far from absolutely opaque.
For the conditions of the problem will then be the same as
if we had ordinary luminous radiations obstructed by an
agglomeration of perfectly reflecting bodies of appreciable
size. Of course these extreme conditions are not realized in
the case of the light transmitted by a metallic film ; but if we
may suppose that the diameter of a conductive particle is not
quite negligible in comparison with a wave-length of light, it
is clearly to be expected that very thin layers of the metal
will fall short of that absolute opacity which in this case
would follow from the assumption of homogeneity.
   When we pass to the consideration of metals at ordinary
temperatures, the conductivity for steady currents is finite ;
but for electromagnetic waves of short period we cannot even
treat the metal as an agglomeration of finitely conductive
particles continuously in contact with one another. It is
evident that the shorter we make the period of the electro
magnetic disturbance in comparison with the average inter-
collisionary period of a (perfectly) conductive particle, the
more nearly do the particles act as if permanently insulated
from one another, and the less efficiently does the metal per
form the functions of an electromagnetic screen.
   Further considerations might be added concerning the
average interchange of electrification between colliding par
ticles when the electromotive intensity tending to produce
such interchange is very rapidly alternating ; but enough has

              Mechanism of Electrical Conduction.               69
been said to show that the opacity of conductors must be far
less for luminous radiations than for electromagnetic dis
turbances of long period, and we may fairly expect, I think,
that the transparency of metals is to be explained without
attributing any new properties to the electromagnetic field.
    The second part of this paper will deal with electrolytic
conduction and disruptive discharge.
                      Note added April 30<A.
    In the course of the discussion Prof. S. P. Thompson ob
jected to the arrangement of molecules in rectangular order,
and he further suggested that the arguments might only be
applicable in two dimensions. I had omitted to mention that
 the figures were intended to be sectional views of three-
 dimensional models, while the rectangular arrangement of
 molecules was merely adopted to save prolixity in the descrip
 tions, and was so far from being essential to the investigation
 that the case of irregularly distributed coordinates and velo
 cities was constantly before my mind. Another point raised
 by Prof. Thompson must also be considered here : in § 6 it
 does not necessarily follow that two conductive particles
 oppositely charged like A and B (fig. 1), approaching one
 another and subject to the influence of an external E.M.F.
 acting from right to left, would have the signs of their
 respective electrifications reversed by a momentary contact ;
 in some encounters tho readjustment of electrifications might
 even bo in the opposite sense ; but I tbink we may safely
 admit that in the long run the effect of innumerable collisions
 amongst such conducting particles as A and B will be to
 transfer electrification in the direction of the impressed
  E.M.F.
     Prof. Riicker recalled a difficulty, which Lord Kelvin
 pointed out some time ago, in connexion with the collisions
 between molecules. If we suppose the molecules to be con
 stituted like little pieces of elastic solid, every collision will
 cause some additional amount of translational energy to be
 converted into energy of vibration, and heat-energy will be
  continually running down into energy of shriller and shriller
 vibrations, that is, into energy of a lower form. In the fore
 going pages, electrical contact between particles is supposed
 to occur during a collision, and Prof. Riicker remarked that
  the method suggested for avoiding an electromagnetic degrada
  tion of energy left untouched the corresponding mechanical
  difficulty. I have made some attempt to deal with this

70                      Mr. W. B. Croft : Some
mechanical question in a previous paper*, where it was shown
(§§ 10, 11) that, granted the fundamental assumption and an
infinite propagation-velocity for gravitational stress, we may
construct an atom having a finite number of freedoms. But in
whatever way mechanical degradation of energy were elimi
nated, the difficulty of electromagnetic degradation would
also have to be met, and without the doctrine laid down in
Theorem I. there appeared to me to be no means of escape.
Without making any assumption as to the constitution of a
molecule or the nature of a collision, we may admit that in
any body not absolutely cold there are particles in relative
motion, so that two neighbouring particles are sometimes
nearer together and sometimes farther apart. To realize the
intermittence of contact required by Theorem II., we have
only to suppose that when (but not until) the proximity of
two particles has reached a certain limit electrification is
 capable of passing freely from one to the other.
    The question of perfect or imperfect conductivity in the
ultimate particles of bodies must be of importance in relation
to the constitution of matter and. its connexion with the
ether ; and whether or not the demonstrations above can be
generally accepted as conclusive, the subject is certainly one
which will repay further investigation.
              V. Some Observations on Diffraction.
                         By W. B. Croft, M.A.\
                                [Plates I.-IV.]
IT is proposed to illustrate various forms of this phenomenon
        by photographs % produced directly from the wave-
interference.
    After the inauguration of the idea about 1665 by Grimaldi,
 Hooke, and Huygens, there was little progress, either in
 extended observation or in philosophical grasp of the prin
ciples, until the beginning of this century. Since that time
the subject has been treated in two ways.
        1st. The Diffraction of Fraunhofer and Schwerd.
    This kind is familiar to many through the observations
of Sir John Herschel of Diffraction in a Telescope. It is
sometimes described as the Diffraction from Parallel Light.

                    Observations on Diffraction.                71
Although more often named after Fraunhofer, as is dne to the
first great worker in this direction, high tribute is always paid
to the more perfect consummation of theory and experiment
which was published by Schwerd of Spires in 1835.
   A telescope is focussed to a star or a distant point of light,
and various limiting apertures are placed on the outer side of
the object-glass. Consider, first, the case of two or three narrow
parallel lines of light : they constitute an elementary grating,
and light from the star passing from them to the object-glass
will come as if from several stars lying on either side of the
real star, all being spectral images except the central one. The
object-glass focusses these at the usual place, then the eyepiece
magnifies them and transmits parallel rays of light ; so there
is a broken line of light across the field, consisting of the
plain image at the centre and the spectra of the successive
orders on either side. More complex limiting apertures give
these radial groups of images of the source of light, of which
the number and direction are regulated by the general form of
the aperture : thus a triangle will give three lines across the
field or a six-rayed star, a square will give a four-rayed star;
a circle concentric with the object-glass, however, will give
concentric circular spectra.
   The objects whose effects have been photographed consist
of combinations of thin circular lines of light on a dark glass
plate \ inch diameter ; this fits into a cap at the end of a
telescope, and each figure in turn is brought to a small
opening in front of the centre of the object-glass : this is
known as Bridge's apparatus, constructed some years back
for this form of diffraction. Fig. 8 almost represents these
figures ; it has slight traces of diffraction of the other kind.
Figs. 1-7 (figs. 2, 3, 4 on PI. I.) represent the Fraunhofer
diffraction of the seven more complex figures : the simplest
figure, which consists of two concentric circles, gives con
centric spectra by both methods of observation.
   2nd. The Diffraction in Shadows : Fresnel's Diffraction.
   This is described by Lord Bayleigh as the Diffraction when
the source of light is not in focus, or in Jamin's Cours de
Physique as Diffraction from a Spherical Wave. Light is
condensed on a minute pinhole in a thin metal plate ; about
a foot from this the diffracting object is placed, and at a
similar distance beyond a microscope eyepiece receives the
shadows : they may be observed with the eye or projected on
the screen of a camera for photography. The rays emerge
from the eyepiece parallel, and give an image on the screen
which varies in size but not in quality as the screen is moved ;

72                   Mr. W. B. Croft : Some
infinite changes, however, are made by variations in the
relative distances of the source of light, object, and lens or
eyepiece.
   In order to consider a fundamental principle of importance,
take at first more simple apparatus, a convex lens instead of
the Huygens eyepiece, and let the object, which is the glass
plate with circle combinations, be illuminated with parallel
uncondensed sunlight. If the lens is placed at its focal
distance from the object, rays emerge parallel and make
simple images of circles without any diffraction developments ;
they are always in focus wherever the screen is placed, and
are naturally greater when it is more distant. If the lens
 is slightly moved from this position in either direction, the
 emerging rays cross one another and produce interference
 developments. The figures made when the lens is moved
 towards the object are inferior in definiteness.
    A wave impinging on an edge gives rise to the secondary
waves of Huygens, and from each new centre waves spread
out in all directions, although the incident light may have a
plane front or be a parallel pencil ; but a pencil, after emerging
parallel from a lens, cannot be considered to have rays striking
 out obliquely so as to interfere. From this may be imagined
 the formation of diffraction-rings in a telescope directed to a
 star when the eyepiece is moved so that the image made by
the field-glass is out of its focus ; the image is nearly a point
of light ; while the rays emerged from the eyepiece parallel
they would not interfere, but directly they cross one another
on emergence they give rise to systems of concentric rings.
This phenomenon may be well seen by looking through the
eyelashes towards a distant lamp while a fine rain is falling :
minute spheres of water fall upon the eyelashes ; these short-
focus lenses make images of the lamp in front of the eye, and
the lens of the eye cannot focus or turn parallel the rays from
 these points ; for a moment a number of fine concentric rings
may be seen, which are constantly evanescent and constantly
 renewed by fresh-falling specks of water.
    There is another phenomenon sometimes revealed when a
 divergent pencil from a short-focus lens or spherical reflecting
surface falls upon the eye in such a way that the eye cannot
focus it : a small illuminated disk is seen with fine ramified
lines from the centre ; in this the eye sees its own blood
vessels : this is easily seen by holding a pinhole near to the eye.
    Abundant examples of diffraction may be observed without
any apparatus : a distant lamp viewed through the eyelashes
on a dry evening appears with many spectral images made by
this simple grating : an umbrella can be seen in the same way

                   Observations on Diffraction.                73
to act as a rectangular grating. If the eyelids are adjusted
to the lamplight, 8 or 10 horizontal exterior bands will easily
be produced. Most plate-glass windows have become gratings
through the scratching by repeated cleaning.
   To return to the main experiment. Stronger effects are
produced, of course, when sunlight is condensed on to the
pinhole, and in this case the position of the convex lens
for giving parallel rays on emergence, or for giving the plain
image of the object without diffraction, is not exactly its focal
distance from the object, for the divergence of the incident
rays has some influence ; but there always is such a position.
Moreover, the elementary experiment cannot be made with
the Huygens eyepiece which is now used, for it has not an
external focus. Fig. 8 shows the result of placing the object
close up to the eyepiece ; the beginnings of diffraction may
be seen. Fig. 10 (PI. I.) shows further developments when
the distance is increased, and figs. 9, 11, and 12, 13 (PI. II.)
give the best effects I have at present been able to produce.
In these and in most of the other figures a magnifying-glass
is necessary to reveal all the fine detail made by the crossing
waves in the shadows. It is clear that if the object is capable
 of giving spectra passing out with much obliquity, they can
never come into the field of the eyepiece by this method of
observation ; and the eyepiece can never focus them, as it
 does in the Fraunhofer method, in which case the field-glass
 brings them to the focus of the eyepiece.
    It may be said that the Fraunhofer diffraction gives nume
 rous images of the source of light set in radiating forms which
 depend on the shape of the object, while that of Fresnel com
 monly gives the main shape of the object embellished with
 fine detail in the spaces between its various parts, and some
 times curiously inverted in its leading features.
    A simpler form of this arrangement demonstrates a leading
 idea in wave theory : parallel sunlight falls upon a convex
 lens, while the diffracting object is between this and the
 screen of the camera, which has no lens. Fair diffraction-
 effects are made when the object lies in the converging rays,
 and they are better when it is moved to the divergent pencil,
 but when it is at the focus the plain original figure is repro
 duced. At the focus the several rays that started from one
 point of the sun have again all reunited ; so that in passing
 the object, although there are many separate rays, there are
 no two rays which came from the same original point ; and
 it is only such as these which can produce interference.
 Here may be seen, in a certain sense, an object and real
 image on the same side of a convex lens.

 74                   Mr. W. B. Croft : Some
                    Diffraction in a Microscope.
    Some notice of this important part of the subject is neces
sary, although it may not be supported by much illustration
 or experiment.
   It is well, first of all, to be clear as to compound pencils of
light which are more or less on the same axes. In a straight
line lie A, B, C, D, E, a candle, a device in wire, a convex
lens, the images of the candle and the wire : here are two
Eencils much intermingled : A is in focus at D, but the light
  ere is also impregnated with the shadows of B, which are
indefinite and unfocussed, covering a larger area than when
focussed atE ; and at this point there is also the indefinite
unfocussed light of A.
   Very often the object on the stage of a microscope diffuses
the illumination and becomes a new source of light, and there
is no need to consider pencils from tbe original source of
light. But here we will take the case of a microscope with a
diffraction-grating on the stage and a small opening in the
diaphragm below. Light passes on to the objective from the
grating as if from several small apertures ranged side by side,
in pairs of corresponding spectra on either sine of the central
point, which is white. The objective makes images of these
just above itself, and one image of the grating farther on at
the top of the tube. If the eyepiece is removed, the eye is
able to focus the rays diverging from these images and to see
them clearly. But the eyepiece when in its place could not
focus such diverging pencils : their light spreads out and fills
the field of the eyepiece with general illumination. The visi
bility of the detail of a finely divided object depends upon
shadows thrown by oblique rays. In the case of a grating
these oblique rays are so definitely arranged that they go
either to the first, second, or higher spectra, and to nothing
between. The central pencil comes through the grating nor
mally in parallel rays, and carries with it no appreciable im
pression of the detail ; experiment shows that on placing a stop
above the object-glass to cut off the spectral images, the lines
of the grating can no longer be seen, although there is still
good illumination. Now the first lot of oblique rays, while on
their way from the grating to its focus in the eyepiece, take
their course through the first spectra ; but they are un
focussed as regards the grating at that position just above
the objective, covering a larger area than the spectra. In
theory perhaps it is conceivable that by stopping out the
spectra alone, and not this larger area, there might be a
balance of rays which would betray the shadows at the eye

                   Observations on Diffraetion.                75
piece. In practice, however, the first spectra are necessary,
and perhaps often sufficient, to show the detail : sometimes
the higher spectra may be needed to add breadth to the
shadows. In fact, from ordinary objects rays of all degrees of
obliquity are available to mark the shadows, but from objects
capable of diffraction there is no degree of obliquity less than
that which tends towards the first spectrum, and the aperture
of the objective must not be too narrow to receive these rays.
   The question naturally arises, how far it is possible to know
whether an image is a reproduction of the general form of
the original object or a diffraction modification : so far as my
experience goes, the two appearances may be distinguished.
Of course in perfect theory, even if an image could be saved
from spherical and chromatic aberration, it must suffer
something from the waves : the image of a star in a telescopo
must be enlarged on this account ; but there is a great differ
ence between this falsification and that which arises when the
eyepiece is taken out of focus. Fig. 82 is a species of the
diatom Triceratiumfavus : it appears as a spotted framework
of ill-defined outlines with little groups in the spaces: but the
microscope can be adjusted so as to show a well-defined honey
comb with clear hexagonal spaces. In an experiment de
scribed above, figures known to be circles are reproduced in
their own true form when at one position with regard to a
convex lens, and more elaborate ili-focussed forms at positions
on either side of the former : it is reasonable, then, to apply
this test to distinguish between several images of an unknown
original. No doubt the simpler form, 'which is taken to be
the true one, might often be resolved into something more
complex by a stronger objective, but this one in its new
conditions would again be simple and well-defined amidst its
possible diffraction derivatives.
   I have not sufficient familiarity with the use of the highest
microscope powers, and can imagine that the foregoing tests
are not easy, if indeed possible, to apply in such cases ; but
I suppose that with £-inch and lower powers there is no need
for uncertainty as to the practical form of the original object.
        Fresnel's Diffraction from Geometrical Figures.
   Some interesting details can be observed from the shadows
about other figures of Bridge's series. It may bo here noted
that such objects may be made by drawing rather thick
figures in ink upon a card about 1 foot square and reducing
by photography to 1 inch square : the negatives so produced
give the desired transparent lines on a dark ground : it will
be understood that a circle means a circular Tine of light in

 76                   Mr. W. B. Croft : Some
distinction to a circular area. The play of light-waves in a
shadow gives rise to infinite paradox. The most notorious
is Arago's bright spot at the centre of the shadow of a cir
 cular disk, with which he astonished Napoleon Buonaparte:
squares and triangles turn about and point inwards : needles
seem to be split down with the light and the two parts point
 outwards, the thinner needle having the broader central cleft:
 lastly, lines inclined to one another have the effect of re
 solving one another into transverse flakes.
    Simple figures may be drawn to give a partial explanation
of these curious results.
                               Fig. a.
                                  c
                                    K fr^
    Fig. a illustrates the ordinary principle of Huygens, that
a wave-front, AB, goes on as a similar wave-front, C, if it
be supposed that each point gives rise to a secondary wave :
when this strikes upon an obstacle, DE, the waves at the
edge, being isolated and not supported by similar waves on
the one side, may pass forward so that in directions F, G, H
one is always J, §, £ of a wave-length in front of the other,
causing interference or darkness : these are the exterior
shadows : also there can be imagined the action of waves
from D and E about a position K which gives the interior
bands.
                            Fig. b.
                          F.r           GH
   Fig. b shows that waves from A and B must always reach E
in the same phase, so at the centre there is always light ; at F,

                   Observations on Diffraction.                 77
if the difference of AF and BF = -^, there will be darkness.
Now if CH and DH are more nearly parallel than AF and
BF are, then, in order to have CH— DH= g, the point H
must be farther from G than F was from E, so the smaller
obstacle C D gives the larger bright centre to its shadow.
This principle has many consequences: the thinner needle has
the broader bright central line, or as a needle is narrowing
towards its point the central line will be opening out : at the
 corner of a square or triangle there will be wedges of light
 pointing inwards. The enlargement of the image of a star
 at the focus of a telescope through diffraction is less in a
 telescope of large aperture, because the waves from the
 borders of the lens reach the focus at a greater inclination to
 one another. Again, the length of a wave of yellow light is
 about 24 millionths of an inch ; if the waves from A and B
 move straight towards one another at K, then the diameter of
 the bright spot here will be something less than '000024 inch,
 too small to be seen, from which it appears that the condition
 for making visible these phenomena which are connected with
 such minute quantities is that AF, BF must be nearly-
 parallel : the object must be narrow, or the screen for receiving
 the shadow must be distant.
    The following notes describe the original figures from which
 the photographs are the shadows : —
    14. A circle with four triangular areas.
    15. A circular area with four inscribed dark circles.
    16. Four circles touching one another ; the lines of the
 circles are gradually made thinner towards the inner part,
 but they are complete circles.
    19. Two ellipses, each through the focus of the other :
 Arago's spot at the common part.
    20. Three pentagons with a small pentagonal area at the
 common centre.
    24 and 29. A square with four external squares at the
 corners : the latter is the shadow taken at a greater distance
 from the object ; it is covered with fine interference detail.
    25 and 28. A square with inscribed square and diagonals.
    23, 26, 27, 30. Right-angled triangles put together in sets
 of four at an acute angle : the detail contains a number of
 round spots.
    31, 39, 40. A chessboard in various states : here again
 systems of spots are developed.
    33. Rows of equilateral triangles, set alternately in suc
 cessive rows : spots again.

  78                . Mr. W. B. Croft: Some
     35. Three equilateral triangles with a small triangular area
 at the common centre.
     41. Ten semicircles near to one another and parallel : the
 feature of this is the broken shaggy brushes at the ends of the
 semicircles.
     43, 44, 45. A parabola lying within another one of smaller
 parameter ; the lines of light being rather thicker about the
 vertices. In 44 each vertex has opened, turned the broken
 edge back and taken a small ball into the open mouth : the
 bands about the axis, which is not drawn in the original, are
 diffraction creations : the inner parabola is broken into flakes
 about the vertex by dark cross lines.
     42. An hyperbola and its conjugate, twice repeated, without
 asymptotes. The flaking appearance is noticeable.
    46. Two ellipses, side by side : as a larger circle gives a
 smaller central spot, the curve at the end of the minor axes
 gives a smaller spot, and that at the end of the major ones a
 larger spot : the result is the broadening white line in the
figure.
    47. Five diminishing circles with internal contact, where
 the lines are made thinner : here are the shaggy offshoots
 similar to those in 41.
    50. Three circles, near, not quite touching. Arago spots
 and flaking.
    48. 49, 51. Arago spots made by small arcs of circles.
    52. A square divided into 4 small squares, in each of these
a circle inscribed, not quite touching. Not to mention the
small detail, this figure suffers the curious inversion of ap
pearing as 4 circles with inscribed squares.
    53. Four circles.
    54. A square with an external semicircle on each side.
   55. Five small circles in a ring touching one another.
   56. Two circles, each through the centre of the other.
   57. Two unequal circles, near, not quite touching : the
larger spot in the smaller circle, and the flaking disturbance
of the larger by the neighbourhood of the smaller.
    60, 66. Eight small circles in a ring touching one another:
in each case there is the bright spot at the centre of each
circle, in 66 there is one at the centre of the whole figure :
the formation of the common tangents at the points of con
tact is not difficult to imagine.
   58. 59. The square and triangle which have turned about
and point inwards : their sides have been resolved entirely
into transverse flakes.
   62. A square with thicker lines of light.

                     Observations on Diffraction.              79
     61. Not quite a square, a bright square area with an in
  scribed dark circular area.
     65. A pentagon : here, as in several of the figures just
  above, there is a bright spot at the centre.
            Fresnel's Diffraction from Simple Objects.
     67. The inner part shows Fresnel's interference-lines ft;om
  a bi-prism, with Grimaldi's fringes at the sides.
     68, 69. Narrow slits ; 68, with the broader bands, is from
  the narrower slit. Both slits are so narrow that the exterior
  bands, through interference of parts of the same wave from
  one side, do not come in : the bands are given by waves from
  the two edges. It may be remarked that in exterior bands
  there is more indication of colour than in interior bands :
  the neighbouring rays which form exterior bands can travel
  almost parallel and make coarser bands with more chromatic
  dispersion. In the case of light passing on to an aperture,
 care is sometimes necessary to note which of the two effects
 is predominant.
     70, 81. The eye of a bodkin, one to show interior bands,
 the other to show the exterior bands : it is not easy to develop
 both effects at once. The bands within the eye are not inter
 ference of waves from the two sides, but the exterior bands
 of each side : it happens that the breadth is such that a band
 from one side is superposed on one from the other, so the
 central line is dark.
    79. Four round holes of increasing size. This is a case of
 exterior bands in the bright spaces ; the centre of the space
 may be white or not according to the breadth of the hole :
 also the rings and spots are brightly coloured. These holes
 varied from £ to 2 inillim. diameter. If a hole be taken
 £ millim. diameter, the phenomenon changes and becomes
 analogous to 68 and 69 : concentric spectra are formed in
 the shadow, and there are no rings in the projection of the
aperture.
     71, 72 (PI. III.). The points and eyes of ordinary needles :
 the one with the broadest central line is the shadow of the
 smallest needle which is made : here the interior and exterior
bands both appear.
     80. A quartz fibre about "0005 inch diameter.
    73. Wire gauze : each wire gives in shadow 6 dark bands:
the spaces give sometimes 2, sometimes 3 bands, showing an
inequality of distance. These bands are the exterior bands
from the sides of the wire, and give bright colours. The
general appearance to the eye is that of a Scotch tartan.

 80             Some Observations on Diffraction.
    77, 78. Perforated zinc. The former is developed to show
 the rings in the spaces ; these are coloured, and the centre
 may be white or not according to the size of the holes or
 their distance from the screen. The latter figure is developed
 to show the interior bands on the dark parts ; they naturally
 give hexagonal systems. This may illustrate the markings
 in Pleurosigma anyulatum, which are regarded as diffrac
 tion-bands made by the rows of white spots that form the
 real structure of the diatom ; but, in truth, this case can be
 realized without the aid of diffraction. Where there are
 such rows of spots, there must be the lines of shadow between
 them. The narrowest dark space marked over with dif
 fraction lines has two dark bars separated by a bright central
 line.
   74. Arago's experiment.—The shadow of a threepenny-piece,
showing the bright centre. Here parallel sunlight was thrown
uncondensed on to the pinhole. The coin was about 18 feet
from this, held by a thin wire, and the screen of the camera
 18 feet beyond, without any lens. The illumination was not
 uniform, so that the exterior rings are partly seen : if a lens
is used, several rings may be seen around the bright centre,
 but the complete shadow is too large for the field of view.
 According to Verdet, Arago employed a circular disk 2 mm.
in diameter.
    75, 76. Arago's experiment.—Shot fixed on glass; 3 millim.,
 2 millim., 1 millim. diameter. These were taken with the
eyepiece and the ordinary arrangement. In theory there are
concentric rings over the whole shadow, but they are more
difficult to see than the bright centre. They appear in fig. 76,
and in a strong light may be produced with the larger shot.
It should be noticed in fig. 75 (PI. IV.) and fig. 76 how large
a bright centre has been made in several places by specks of
dust.
    Both with the shot and the threepenny-piece, when they are
most accurately arranged, as evidenced by the regularity of
the rings, a faint dark spot may be seen at the centre of the
white spot, and in some positions of the disk relatively to
the eyepiece this opens out into a faint dark ring. At prei
I have not been able to ascribe with certainty a reason for
this secondary effect, but I think it arises because the source
of light is not a mathematical point.

VI. On some Experiments with Carbon Dioxide in the Solid
               Stale. By Dr. L. Bleekrode*.
"YytTHEN working of late with very low temperatures pro-
  TT       duced by evaporating solid carbon dioxide I met
with some facts which are perhaps not generally known, and
may I think prove useful for lecture experiments.
    I obtained the solid substance in the usual way from its
liquid state, now so easily to be had in large quantities in the
iron bottles prepared for industrial purposes.               If a cloth
bag (first used by Bianchi in 1870) is tied to the delivery-
valve, the solid may be readily collected inside, and this
method is as effective and more simple than the use of ebonite
or metal boxes, which are liable to have their parts frozen
together and then cannot be quickly emptied.
    Compressed Carbon Dioxide.—This substance on being re
moved from the bag presents itself in a very divided state and
therefore evaporates comparatively quickly ; but on submitting
it in suitable moulds of wood or metal to nigh pressure, either
by hammering, or still better with screw and lever (as for
instance the arrangement for regelation experiments with ice),
a most compact substance is obtained, in the form of
cylinders, disks, lenses, cups, &c. that can much longer endure
the heating-effect of surrounding air.
    Such compressed cylinders were described by Prof.
Landolt in 1884 1; he obtained them by hammering the
mass together ; the specific gravity of the carbon dioxide in
that condition was determined, first by calculating the
volume of the cylinder from the geometrical dimensions, and

 then by ascertaining its weight with the balance, taking care
 to collect the gas, which evaporated during the process, in a
 potash solution, connected with a delivery-tube to the vessel
 containing the solid substance, the whole arrangement of
 course standing on one of the scales of the balance. In this
 way the specific gravity was found to be 1*2 (in the liquid
 state, at 12°-5 C. it is 0*88), and accordingly the larger pieces
 of the dioxide sink in water ; the smaller ones remaining
 suspended on the surface owing to the evolving gas. I myself
 found in different experiments the number 1*3, and even 1*6 ;
 this greatly depending on the pressure exerted, which, with
 my apparatus, could be made very high ; at the latter density,
 the cylinders looked semi-transparent. The great advantage
 now gained lies in the very slow evaporation. Landolt men
 tions that he was able to keep a cylinder with dimensions of
 25 mm. and 26 8 mm., having a weight of 15"63 grammes,
 during one hour and a half ; I could maintain one, at a
.temperature of the atmosphere of 15° C, having a weight of
 41 grammes, during nearly the same time ; but he was even
able to keep a cylinder of 41 mm. diameter and 53 mm.
high during five hours. The surface, as is to be expected, soon
becomes covered with ice needles that are easily nipped off,
but Landolt is of opinion that a hydrate is also formed.
    Production of Electricity.—It has been remarked by more
 than one observer that a strong jet of carbon dioxide, obtained
 from its liquid, on expanding in the atmosphere, may produce
 an electric charge of marked intensity. Riess in his well-
known book on frictional electricity mentions that, as long
ago as 1852, Joly saw electric sparks given off by an iron
bottle which was filled with liquefied gas ; and also Ducretet
at Paris made a communication in 1884, on the appearance of
sparks, when he caused the gas to escape from its liquefied
state in a box of ebonite, in order to collect the solid substance.
 More recently Hausknecht * published the same observation,
but adds the important remark that it is necessary, when
 powerful effects are aimed at, to use a gas absolutely free from
air, and therefore that prepared by chemical means is better
suited for these experiments than that obtained from natural
sources, as manufactured on the Rhine. The cloth collecting-
bags show an intense electric charge, emitting a violet light
inside, and he got sparks of even 20 centim.; but they do not
appear before a dense layer of crust of solid matter has been de
posited. I found this confirmed, and after I had insulated the
iron bottle on paraffin supports, I applied a delicate gold-leaf
electroscope, and ascertained, when gas was strongly issuing,
              * Chemische Berichte, 1800, xxiv. p. 1032.

                with Carbon Dioxide in the Solid State.                  83
that in general it was negatively electrified. The gas jet,
escaping through the bag, charged the electroscope with posi
tive electricity when very near to the cloth, but frequently, when
at some distance, the instrument indicated a negative charge,
when struck by the gas-current. When the bag was inserted
in a cylinder of narrow copper gauze I got sparks of more than
2 centim. when approaching a metallic conductor. A year
ago Wesendonk * published an extensive research bearing on
the question whether electricityis actually generated by friction
of gases against metals, already treated by Faraday f, and he
came to the conclusion that the gaseous state does not develop
electricity, and if indeed a charge manifests itself in the
electroscope, it is due to the fact that the gas contains mois
ture or particles of dust. Experiments were made with air,
oxygen, and carbon dioxide under high pressure, and ho stated
that the latter gas is very apt to develop electricity, because
aqueous vapour so easily condenses from the surrounding air
about the expanding current of gas which is at very low
temperature.
    It seems to me that great importance is to be ascribed to
the minute particles of nolid carbon dioxide that certainly are
present in the escaping gas, when the liquid substance comes
in contact with the aperture and issue-valve, as this is opened.
I found, what I have not seen mentioned anywhere else, that
the solid carbon dioxide itself is a substance having a great
propensity to become electric, as the following experiments
show.
    When the snow-like solid matter, after it has been taken
from the receiving-bag, is put directly on the plate of the
electroscope, a strong charge of negative electricity is at once
apparent ; on placing this instrument under the receiver of
an air-pump, the divergence of the leaves rather diminishes
when the air is rarefied, and it increases again on admitting
air. A disk, formed by strongly compressing carbon dioxide
as indicated before, when rubbed with the hands or pressed
against the skin becomes negatively electrified and attracts
an electric pendulum in a very marked way, even when the
   * Wiedemann's Annalen, 1892, xlvii. p. 529.
   t Faraday examined air and vapour of water mixed with different sub
stances, and expressed the opinion that whpn pure they fail to produce
electricity ; otherwise they communicate a positive charge to the electro
scope when it is near to the exit valve, the gas then striking violently
against the knob of the instrument. At some distance below he states
that this becomes phnrged negatively, became it acts only as a receiver
to the gas already electrified on escaping, whilst in the former case
the knob of the electroscope is itself directly electriJied by the collision
of the gas particles.

84             Dr. L. Bleekrode on some Experiments
friction hits been feeble. Rubbing against a zinc or a copper
plate acts in the same way, these metals showing positive elec
trification, and the solid carbon dioxide gets negatively elec
trified ; this is also the case when rubbed with cloth. The
readiness with which this substance acquires an electric
charge is the more remarkable, as the surface of the disk or
cylinder, from the very low temperature, is soon covered with
moisture turning to ice particles, but these disappear on
moving the hands over the surface. A more complicated case
of electrification ensues when the compact disk is simply laid
down on the plate of the electroscope. When freshly prepared
immediately after the contact, the leaves diverge to art extent
corresponding to a difference of potential of at least 200 volts,
and more as compared with that effected by a zinc-wator-copper
battery. It is — E, and when the disk of carbon dioxide is now-
 removed without touching the metal, the leaves first collapse,
and diverge again directly, and now indicate + E. Sometimes,
when the substance has already been exposed to the atmo
sphere for a time, no charge is immediately produced on
touching the clectroscojw, but afterwards, when it is taken
from the instrument, this still shows a positive charge. It is
not at once evident how to account for the production of the
two opposite electricities in this case*, as several causes may
have been at work. It appears to me that the chief part is
played by the carbon dioxide escaping in the state of gas
between the disk and the spot where it is in contact with the
plate of the electroscope. At this place it is lifted up and
down somewhat rapidly by the gas evolved, and it gets a
negative charge, for the same reason as when rubbed with
the hand as before stated, and no strong motion is required,
 because of its high electric properties, as I have remarked.
The +E that is free is carried away with the current of gas,
and the negative charge of the disk may induce an opposite
one in the metallic plate, on which it is lying, and recom
bination is prevented, because a fresh layer of gas is present
and prevents actual contact ; the positive charge of course
becomes apparent in the electroscope as soon as its inducing
electricity is removed with the disk of carbon dioxide. That
the action after a certain time is much lessened may perhaps
be due to the fact that the copper plate of the electroscope
after prolonged contact has become too cold to provoke a rapid
evolution of gas, or perhaps the surface of the carbon dioxide,
by atmospheric influence, has lost, to some extent, its electric

neutral after each experiment: this may easily be done by^moving it
rapidly to and fro in a gas-flame.

              with Carbon Dioxide in the Solid State.           85
property. And the effect in general may be augmented by the
friction of the current of gas against the surrounding air of low
temperature and saturated therefore with moisture.
   Production of Sound.—The experiment just described,
demonstrating that a piece of strongly compressed carbon
dioxide on mere contact with a copper plate may acquire a
sufficient electric charge to attract an electric pendulum, and
that this should be originated by little impacts from the metal,
seems to obtain fresh evidence from another curious fact I
often observed on putting this substance in contact with metals,
and which consists in a loud sound produced for some time.
On further investigation it was soon ascertained that this is
due to the thermal conductivity of the metal, acting by increas
ing the rapid evaporation of the solid matter in different points
where the contact was best, and the gas evolved, more or less
prevented from easily escaping between the surfaces, was
alternately compressed and expanded, producing a vibratory
condition of the current of gas. A convenient way to perform
this experiment is to take a disk or cylinder of carbon dioxide,
very highly compressed, and to lay down on it a small brass
sphere with a diameter of 1 cm. ; if the whole system is placed
on the resonance box of a tuning-fork (for instance that of Ut4
answers very well), a loud sound of very high pitch makes
itself at once audible throughout the whole room ; if the
metal is pressed against the solid substance, it may even
become so loud as to be painful to the ear. It slowly dies
out as the metal grows too cold to accelerate the evaporation
in an effective way, but the sound is again restored when
the metal is heated for a moment. Things may be reversed :
that means, a cylinder or, still better, a lens of plano-convex
form may be set down on a metal surface, and if this consists
of a thin copper disk of 8 cm. diameter fixed in its centre, this
emits a loud sound, resembling the ringing of a bell. It is easily
perceived that the tone is produced at the place of contact wheie
the metallic sphere touches the extremely cold carbon dioxide ;
a little cavity is formed (as the metal is comparatively very hot),
and this is somewhat closed up by the sphere sinking slowly
down ; the occluded gas gets more tension till it can lift the
 metal, when for a very brief moment it again sinks down,
and so on in rapid succession. Of course the same state of
 things nearly occurs as with a steam-jet escaping downwards
 from a conical aperture, closed up more or less by a little
sphere. It is well known, when high pressure is used, it is
not blown away, but remains in front of the opening in a very
 rapid oscillating condition, and there is also a dull sound often
audible.

86            Dr. L. Blcekrodo on some Experiments
    When the disk of carbon dioxide is not very compact, no
sound is produced, because the gas can escape in different
ways through the little spaces left, otherwise the intensity of
the sound is dependent on the conductivity for heat of the
substance brought in contact.
    A silver coin, when touching the disk with the flat side,
does not act, because it is uneven and little interstices are left,
otherwise silver emits loud sounds, and so it is with copj>er,
iron, aluminium ; lead produces a dull note and bismuth none at
all, as being a very bad conductor unless it has been heated, and
then it sounds only for a moment. The carbon rods used in
electric lamps remained silent, and also wood, but quartz and
rock-salt gave an audible note when a lens of compressed
carbon dioxide was applied on them with some pressure.
Very beautiful sounds, of the character of those produced
 with the Trevelyan instrument, were heard when an iron rod
 was resting with one end on a horizontal cylinder of the
 compact solid substance and touching with the other a glass
 plate.
    As the escaping gas is the determining cause in all these
cases, it is to be expected that other substances, when capable
 of rapid evaporation, on touching heated metals will also
 emit sound, and indeed 1 obtained this very loud when a
 brass sphere brought to incandescence was firmly pushed
 down on a piece of mercury bichloride or camphor, and
 especially on sal-ammoniac, all substances subliming at a red
 heat ; accordingly dense vapours are evolved, when the metal
 came in contact, and sounded on perforating them.
    Crystallization of Mercury.—Though the freezing of this
liquid metal with the mixture of solid carbon dioxide and
sulphuric ether is easily effected, c^stallization is not apparent,
as the metal then solidifies too quickly. On trying the pro
duction of sound with this liquid, I found a very effective
method to obtain it crystallized. A disk of slightly com
pressed carbon dioxide with a cavity was used, and still better
was a little cup, 4 centim. high, such as could be formed in
a convenient mould of wood, and this I filled with mercury,
just as a crucible. A low and distinct sound was given off,
and very regular undulations appeared on the bright metal
surface, indicating the pulsations provoked by the escaping
gas. Though the mercury does not actually touch the sides
of the cup (or the cavity on the disk) as a gas layer keeps it
away, yet its heat is dispersed by radiation towards the
extremely cold surrounding matter, and gradually the vibra
tions cease. If at this moment the cup is emptied of its
still liquid contents, it is seen to be covered inside with

              with Carbon Dioxide in the Solid State'.         87
 beautiful and sharply defined needles of solid mercury,
 resembling fern leaves, of more than one centim. in length ;
 the whole mass is coherent and forms now a metal cup, of
 course with thin walls, that may easily be removed from its
 mould of solid carbon dioxide and maintains itself during
 some minutes.                                            .      i
    Effect of Gas and Vacuum Screens.— One of the most inter
 esting experiments demonstrated by Prof. Dewar at his
 admirable lectures on liquid air, seems to me the property
 of a very high vacuum of preventing the access of heat from
the surrounding medium to liquids placed inside. Lecturers
on losv temperatures will not likely have at command such
 splendid arrangements as Prof. Dewar could dispose of, but
 the principle of this fact may be illustrated, in a suitable
 way, with carbon dioxide. I had three glass tubes of 15
 millim. diameter constructed, and of equal capacity, and
 according to Prof. Dewar's device. The first, A, was inside
 an oblong glass bulb, remaining open, and consequently filled
 with air that could be exchanged, when desired, for another
 gas ; the second, B, had likewise this bulb, but rarefied with a
 mercurial pump, thus forming a vacuum-jacket; the third, C,
 was surrounded by two such concentric vacuum-jackets.
 Placing them in the same support, next to one another, I put
 in each the same amount by weight of a mixture of carbon
 dioxide with sulphuric ether; it is then soon observed, within
 the quarter of an hour, that A, provided with the air-jacket,
 is covered outside with a layer of hoar frost; B shows only a
 slight deposit of condensed aqueous vapour from the atmo
 sphere; audC remains transparent, having no deposit outside.
Thus the influence of convection and radiation with regard to
a vacuum are visible even at great distances from the lecturer's
 table.
    With the first vessel, A, I carried out another experiment
I found suggested in the report of Prof. Dewar's lecture, and
bearing on the property of different gases transmitting heat,
which they do not all possess to the same extent. In one
experiment 1 put 3 grammes of compressed carbon dioxide
in the inner tube of the vessel A, when air was in the bulb, and
collected the gas, given off by evaporation at the ordinary tem
perature, in a glass jar above water. I noted 170 cub. centim.
in five minutes. Supplying again the inner tube with the same
amount of carbon dioxide and replacing the air by hydrogen,
I could collect again in five minutes 250 cub. centim. This
increasing proportion shows the great conductivity and con
vection that hydrogen possesses. On removing the hydrogen
and taking carbon dioxide in gaseous form instead of it,

88     Experiments with Carbon Dioxide in the Solid State.
and working also with 3 grammes of solid matter, I now
collected only 150 cub. centim., and carbon dioxide in gaseous
condition is considered a bad conductor of heat. But the
difference in quantity of gas evolved depends also on the
power for convection, which will not be equal in the three
cases *.
    The following experiment, which is somewhat the reverse
of the former, demonstrates the influence of convection in
incandescent electric lamps in a striking way. Four similar
lamps (16 candle-power and same voltage) were connected
 in parallel to a dynamo ; the first was filled with gaseous
 carbon dioxide, the second with common coal-gas, the tbird
 with hydrogen, and the fourth was kept in normal condi
 tion, that is provided with its vacuum around the carbon
 filament. All carried a little piece of phosphorus at the top
 of the glass globe on the outside, and now admitting the
 current in all at the same time, it is observed that the
 phosphorus is set on fire at different rates; first it burns on
 the lamp with carbon dioxide, then on that containing coal-
 gas, and shortly after on the hydrogen lamp, but on the
 vacuum lamp it remains for a long time intact. In the latter
 case it may be inferred that the dark heat-rays are very
 imperfectly transmitted by the vacuum, whilst convection of
 course must also be very reduced; hence the glass can only
 receive a small amount of heat, and as in Prof. Dewar's
 experiment the vacuum prevents the ready access of heat
 to the extremely cold liquid, in the incandescent lamp,
 on the contrary, it is an obstacle to the cooling of the filament
 of carbon. It can therefore attain a high temperature and
 convert the electric energy it receives, chiefly into radiant
 light. As for the other lamps, the difference in heat trans
 ferred in the same time outside may find its explanation in
 the well-known experiments of Grove t and the investigation
 of Clausius; yet it is a curious tact to see the carbon brightly
    * Prof. Kundt described, as long ago as 1877, an experiment of a similar
 character, employing three vessels of the same size, enclosing at a
  distance of 3 mm. little tubes each filled with the same volume of
 sulphuric ether. The vessels were filled respectively with hydrogen, air,
 and carbon dioxide acting as jackets. Putting all three together in
  boiling water, heat is transmitted in a different way, as appears when the
 ether vapour is lighted, and the flame of hydrogen is seen to be the
 longest, that of the carbon dioxide the smallest, but convection may also
 influence.
    t Grove published his paper on this subject in the Phil. Trans, in
  1847, and he determined the amount of heat given off by a platinum wire
 in different gases to a surrounding mass of water ; the experiments with
 the lamps are in accordance with his results.

     Approximate Method of calculating Magnetic Forces.               89
glowing in the lamp wherein the phosphorus does not burn, in
the lamp with carbon dioxide the filament becomes only dull
red, and in the others it remains obscure, but still the phos
phorus burns there after a minute.
   Though the thermal conductive power interferes, I believe
convection to play an important part here, and I venture to
predict that, if the incandescent lamp, whilst glowing, could
be intensely cooled, by being immersed in liquid oxygen
or liquid air, that Prof. Dewar has so readily at hand, it
•would at once attain a higher illuminating power*; as
convection would still more be lessened, the remaining
particles of air and mercury vapour would have their motion
almost entirely exhausted. And hence it may be concluded
that such a lamp would absorb less electric energy for emitting
the same amount of light, when the degree of rarefaction is
made the highest possible.

VII. On an Approximate Method of finding tlie Forces acting
    in Magnetic Circuits. By Richard Threlfall, M.A.,
   Professor of Physics, University of Sydney; assisted by
    Florence Martin, Student in the University of Sydney t-
DURING the last three years I have had occasion to
           design a good many reciprocating electromagnetic
mechanisms, and have frequently felt the want of some
simple method of making the necessary approximate calcu
lations of magnetic forces.
    I have obtained very little satisfaction from the attempts I
have made to calculate tractions, proceeding bjr the method
of finding poles and applying the law of inverse squares.
   This ill success led me to investigate the applicability of
the methods established by Maxwell in the chapter " On
Energy and Stress in the Magnetic Field" ('Electricity and
 Magnetism/ vol. ii. §§ 641-644), with the following results.
    § 1. Theoretical Considerations.
    The problem for solution in its simplest form is as follows: —
 " Given an iron anchor-ring uniformly wound and inter
rupted at one point by an air-gap of any given dimensions—
   * I tried this effect with a mixture of solid carbon dioxide and ether
 on an incandescent lamp, but the globe becomes covered with frozen
 aqueous vapour and the mixture itself is a hindrance to judging the
brightness acquired ; a transparent cold liquid therefore is far more
 suitable.
   t Communicated by the Author.

 90     . Prof. R. Threlfall on an Approximate Method
 to calculate the forces tending to draw the ends of the iron
 ring together when the strength of current flowing in the
 magnetizing circuit and the data of winding are given.
     § 2. The position established by Maxwell is as follows: —
    (1) The laws x»f magnetic force are such that magnetic
 forces may be regarded as the expression of a state of stress
 in the magnetic medium.
    (2) The medium is stable under such a distribution of
 stresses.
    (3) A series of expressions may be found for the stresses
 at any point in the magnetic field.
    § 8. Maxwell's investigation does not explicitly include the
 case of a body with inconstant permeability; but I cannot find
 that this in any way vitiates the argument. Professor J. J.
 Thomson shows (' Applications of Dynamics to Physics and
 Chemistry,' § 33) that Maxwell's results may be considered
 as bejng derived from the existence of a term <t— HB in the
 Lagrangian function for unit volume of a magnetic field. If
 the permeability is a function of the induct ion, however, in
 any part of the field, the more general expression — fHt/B
must be substituted for the above and the results modified
 accordingly. I have uot succeeded in doing this. It appears,
 therefore, that Maxwell's system as applied to iron does not
 cover all the ground, because a modification must be intro
duced on account of the inconstancy of the permeability, and
also on account of the Vilhiri effect as shown by Professor
Thomson. There may also be other undiscovered additions
to make.
    § 4. A great step is necessary to pass from Maxwell's
position—that magnetic forces may be regarded as the ex
pression of stresses in the field—to the position that magnetic
forces are such an expression. There is all the difference that
exists between a theory and a fact.
    Everything, however, tends to show that the fact is that
the theory is probably true so far as it goes, and we will
therefore provisionally adopt it, and see first what additional
hypotheses are necessary. It is obvious at once that the
stresses are " stresses in a medium," while the forces are
mechanical forces acting on matter. We must therefore
consider that the medium is " attached " to matter so as to
allow the stresses to appear as forces. Now the stresses in
the medium depend on the nature of the matter which is
permeated by the medium. Thus in the cut anchor-riug

         offinding the Forces acting in Magnetic Circuits.   91
referred to above (§ 1), the stresses in the medium in the air-
gap are not at all the same as the stresses in the medium in
tho iron. In our entire ignorance of the connexion existing
between the medium and matter, it is not to me at all clear
that, in calculating the magnetic forces tending to close the
ring, we ought to consider the stresses in aether in air, and
those alone. It is at all events conceivable that the nature
of the connexion between the medium and the iron maybe
modified in some manner by the internal stresses in the iron.
Also the ordinary laws of magnetic and electromagnetic
action leceived their experimental demonstration at low in
 ductions ; and we have no right to say, without experimental
evidence, that some terms not contemplated by Maxwell
 might not begin to produce effects on the stresses in air at
high inductions. In the parallel case in iron such stresses do
in fact occur.
    I therefore attribute great importance to the experimental
verification of the results deduced from Maxwell's theory as
applied to the traction between iron bars in general, and
especially at high inductions.
    § 5. Experimental position. —The simplest case is that of
the traction between two plane faces of iron, tho faces being
 either the terminals of otherwise closed iron circuits, or of
 very long bars.
    The case of the ring has been implicitly investigated by
 Bid well (Phil. Trans. 1886) ; and the case of short bars by
 Bosanquet explicitly (Phil. Mag. 188(5, vol. xxii.). The
 latter is the only investigation 1 know of in which simul
taneous observations of Induction and Tractive force were
 made. In both cases Maxwell's theory leads to the expression
                                  8tt
for the force in air between two opposing plane faces of iron,
infiuitesimally separated, A being the area of the faces and
 B the (uniform) induction-density.
    The net result of Bosanquet's work was to show :—
    (1) When B is below 5000 the Tractions observed are
 generally much too large.
    (2) The formula does not hold when the air-gap is appre
 ciable.
    (3) It holds within about 5 per cent, up to very high
 inductions.
    It is obvious, therefore, that there is room for more work
 on the subject.
    § ti. For the reasons given I felt \cry strongly that it was

92        Prof. R. Threlfall on an Approximate Method
necessary to establish the truth, or rather the approximate
exactness, of the theory in the simple case studied by Bosan-
quet before going on to apply it to other and more compli
cated cases.
   Consequently I investigated the following matters :—
    (1) Influence of length of bars.
    (2) Influence of kind and size of pole-pieces.
    (3) Influence of imperfections in the ballistic method.
    (4) Cause of Bosanquet's failure to obtain agreement with
theory at low inductions.
    (5) Cause of similar failure (?) with an appreciable air-gap.
     § 7. Method of Experimenting. —I wound a number of
solenoids on brass tubes, placed the iron bars to be investi
gated axially in these solenoids, observing the usual pre
cautions, and measured the force (by calibrated spring-
balances) requisite to pull the bars apart, the force being
applied scrupulously parallel to the axis of the bars by means
of links, pulleys, and strings. Great attention was paid to
the state of the cut surfaces. I tried surfaces of all kinds.
   (a) Merely filed by watchmaker's finishing files.
   (b) Ground on flat whetstones to a surface-plate.
   (c) Scraped to a surface-plate.
   (d) Ground by emery wheels.
   (e) Turned flat—to a surface-plate. This takes a little
skill.
   (/) Optically ground by emery and diamond-dust and
finished with putty-powder.
   This requires a note. Of course the bars must be provided
with shoes of many times their diameter to make the process
a success, and these shoes must be of similar material to the
bars. In order to save circumlocution I may state that both
I and my assistant Mr. Cook are fairly expert at this kind
of work, and we met with no real difficulty. The use of
diamond-dust instead of emery saves a little time, but makes
it more difficult to get a good result. I obtained two sets of
bars with properly ground faces. One of these sets was of
hard iron, and was not so good as Brashear's celebrated test-
plates, on account of a slight convexity on the part of one
surface and a corresponding concavity on the part of the
other. The other pair of bars were of soft Swedish iron well
annealed ; they were less than 1 centim. in diameter, and
about 60 centim. long. The surfaces were as good as the
test plates, i. e. perfect according to the present state of the
art. I have little doubt that they are as good soft iron sur
faces as have ever been prepared. This means that there was
no inequality comparable with a wave-length of sodium-light
on either surface.

         offinding the Forces acting in Magnetic Circuits.   93
    The bars were kept straight and aligned by well-fitting
glass, or brass, or fibre tubes at the plane of contact. The
fit was always just so good that no correction for friction was
necessary. The magnetizing current was measured by a
Siemens dynamometer, which was compared with suitable
members of a chain of Kelvin balances. It was found that
in this instrument the readings were correct within the limits
of accuracy of reading. The current was supplied by storage-
cells.
   The induction-coils were wound on brass bobbins with
proper precautions. The bobbins were of different diameters,
and were compared ballistically, and found to give identical
results j hence it was concluded that they were all free from
leakage errors.
   The ballistic galvanometer was a fine instrument, specially
made for this kind of work. It was calibrated by turning
over a large coil which was splendidly wound, and which has
been checked in many ways. I made use of the values for
the vertical force obtained about nine months ago by Mr. Farr,
from a long series of experiments in my laboratory under the
best and most careful conditions, and with the Kew apparatus.
In all cases the induction-throw on the galvanometer was
checked by reversal of the galvanometer-corrections, except
when experiment showed that nothing was gained by such
reversals, the instrument being in another part of the labora
tory to the magnetic system. In all cases large resistances
from a box of coils, constructed and calibrated by myself
 from Cambridge standards, were inserted in the circuit so as
 to give the best range for the galvanometer.
    § 8. Results of Experimenting.—The general result was that
I got rather worse agreement than was noted by Bosanquet,
especially at low inductions. I therefore set myself to find
out the reason of this. I am ashamed to say how long it took
me to clear up the difficulty. I investigated the following
possible causes.
    (1) Imperfection of galvanometer law. This was got over
by adjusting resistances till the same deflexion was obtained
both on turning over the earth-inductor and on magnetizing
the iron.
    (2) Effects due to residual state of the iron. These were
got rid of by demagnetizing the iron by an alternator and slide-
resistance, and observing magnetizations with the current in
both directions, and also on reversal. By comparing the
three sets of deflexions I assured myself that the discrepancy
was not due to any error of this kind. A similar procedure
when taking the tractions led to a like result.

     (3) By using induction-coils of different diameters 1
assured myself that I was really measuring the operative
inductions.
    (4) The state of the surface of the bars is an important
matter. If the ends are rough, of course the contact is at
points. This leads to a concentration of induction at these
(daces, and is a very constant source of error. My best bars,
  lowever, gave just as anomalous results as my roughest ones,
so that the deviation could not be attributed to this cause.
    (o) Finally I tried, without much confidence, the effect of
a small indirectness of pull. This was done by winding two
wide solenoids and leaving sufficient space between their ends
to see what was going on at the point of junction ; a gas-
flame was put on the side of the junction, remote from the
observer.
    It was then found that one side of the bar which was being
pulled off invariably remained in contact after the other side
had slightly separated—when this was prevented by slightly
guiding the spring-balance by hand, the agreement was as
good as at higher inductions. The explanation is now obvious.
If the bars separate slightly just at one side, two things happen.
 (1) The total reluctance of the circuit increases. (2) The
induction concentrates at the parts in contact. At low induc
tions the effect of (2) overpowers that of (1). At high induc
tions, when the permeability of the iron becomes less, the
induction is less free to distribute itself, and also the traction
of the bars being greater, the phenomenon does not begin to
manifest itself till rupture is just about to be produced, or it
produces a very uracil smaller percentage error. Of course
all this might have been foreseen, but one's experience with
strong magnets—in which case it is notorious that it is much
more difficult to pull off an armature straight than sideways—
misled me.
    On examining other bars which had given similar results
at low inductions, I found I could similarly diminish or increase
the apparent traction by varying very slightly the direction
of pull. Thus with a pair of flat-ended bars and an induction
of about 3000 C.G.S. the calculated pull was one pound
seven ounces ; but the observed pull was always over two
pounds, and in some experiments about three pounds. On
guiding the bars so that no wedge-shaped gap appeared, the
traction could be got down to about one pound eight ounces.
I do not think it is possible to get much closer than this, for
if proper arrangements are made to absolutely ensure a really
true and rigid separation, friction would inevitably come in

        offinding the Forces acting in Magnetic Circuits.     \)h
to introduce errors. My results at higher inductions were
so similar to Bosanquet's that they are not worth reproducing.
   § 9. With regard to the formula not applying with non
 magnetic gaps of sensible dimensions parallel to the lines of
induction—as when Bosanquet separated the bars by wood
and paper—the explanation is obvious. The lines of induction
no longer leave the surfaces normally, and the conditions
postulated by the formula are not in existence.
   § 10. Resulting position of the Theory.
   When the bars are in contact, the stress theory, and what
I will call the magnetic fluid theory, lead to the same result.
Which is true certainly within about five per cent., and may
be exactly true.
   In any case, measuring tractions is not the way to get
accuracy, though I have no doubt that rather better results
could be got by going into the matter more elaborately than
was done either by Bosanquet or myself.
   In what follows I shall suppose that the theory is true, and
that the real cause of magnetic forces is to bo sought in some
condition of the aither mechanism which receives a sufficient
statistical definition from the Induction Diagram.
   § 11. The effect of varying the kind of iron employed should
be the same as varying the induction-density—at least in so
far as the phenomenon can be considered to depend on perme
ability. 1 used induction-densities of from 2000 to 18,000,
but could not detect any effect—when the cause of error
referred to above was eliminated. I also used all kinds of
iron, from annealed Swedish iron to ordinary cast iron. I
varied the lengths of the bars from 60 cm. to 6 cm.—and
the diameter from about 2 cm. to about '6 cm.
   In no case could I detect any deviation from the predicted
traction which could not be explained by unavoidable experi
mental errors. With short bars and high inductions necessi
tating the use of very strong fields, some induction is included
by the testing-coil which does not help the traction and which
tends to make the calculated traction appear too large.
When this source of error was eliminated, no greater dis
crepancies were observed with short bars than with long
ones.
   § 12. I conclude therefore
   (1) The traction produced by a given tube of induction
when running out of air into iron and crossing the surface
normally is independent of the nature of the iron, or of its
form. I had a difficulty in bringing myself to believe this,
but the conclusion seems inevitable.

     Corollary (1). The magnetic forces are independent of the
stresses in aether insirlc the iron.
     Corollary (2). Setting aside Professor J. J. Thomson's
stresses, the aether stress in air is less than that in iron—
assuming that Maxwell's " magnetic material " sufficiently
represents iron. The difference of tensions is
                        £-i<BH-m,
                              (B-H)2
or                            "18*    *
    This is an unbalanced stress ; and if the linos of induction
in the iron give rise to forces similar to those produced in
air, this must mean that the boundary tends to be pulled off
the iron. Taking Professor Thomson's stresses into account,
this effect may easily be reversed in any actual case.
    Eeferring to Professor Thomson's investigation (Physics
and Chemistry), I cannot avoid the impression that there still
remains a set of stresses depending on the variation of elastic
constants with temperature. This would further complicate
matters.
     § 13. Each tube of induction is therefore a tube of force
within the usual definition ; but it does not follow that the
only forces are those represented by the tubes of induction.
If the tubes leave the iron surface normally, then the pressural
forces are tangential and we get the formula we have been
using ; and similarly if the tubes of induction are tangential
 (i. e. when the infinitesimal air-gap separates similar poles),
the pressures operate alone, and we have a repulsion equal to
the former attraction as in the elementary theory. If the
tubes of induction leave the iron at any angle to the surface
between 0 and tt/2, we must consider the effect of the pressural
forces.
     To calculate these effects it is convenient and perhaps
correct to assume that just as the internal stresses of the iron
do not affect the forces which are the expression of the external
aether tensions, so they do not affect the forces corresponding
to the hydrostatic pressures. If, therefore, we consider a line
of force running out of iron into air and making an angle 6
with the normal, we can estimate the direction and magnitude
of the magnetic forces at once, thus :—
    Let AB be the trace of a plane boundary between air and
iron, and ON a normal drawn outwards into air. Let OP be
a vector in the plane of the paper representing the tensioual

        offinding the Forces acting in Magnetic Circuits.      97
 force per unit area at a point about 0. Draw OQ perpen
 dicular to OP and in the plane of the paper. Then the
pressural forces lie in a semicircle of which OQ is a radius,
and whose plane contains OQ. Since the pressures are
symmetrical with respect to OQ, OQ is their resultant, and
by the theory this is equal to OP—so that OQ is the vector
representing the pressures. A force represented by OM equal
and parallel to PQ is therefore the resultant force, and clearly
in this case is a repulsion whose magnitude along the normal
produced is
                     OP.^2cos(^-0Y
an expression which gives no normal component at all when
0=ir/i. The force is therefore an attraction or repulsion
according as 6 is less or greater than 7r/4—and a shear at this
[>oint. I tried to observe this, but could not get the lines to
 eave the surface at the exact angle. However, the above
way of looking at the matter is convenient when filings are
used to trace the direction of the induction. This expression
has been pointed out to me by Mr. Pollock as identical with
that given by Maxwell's general formula in § 643 for the
special case here considered.
   It is now evident why it was that Bosanquet got results
differing from those calculated from the formula for normal
inductions, because, as filings show, a very small gap is
sufficient to produce a marked spreading of the field.
   § 14. By observing the distribution of filings about different
air-gaps, it appeared probable to me that the following pro
position might be true—as referring to bars of different
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 38. No. 230. July 1894.          H

diameters : —" With similar pole-faees and the same perme
ability and induction-density, the induction (or filing) diagrams
are similar when the length of the air-gap is the same fraction
of a standard dimension of the pole- faces."
    If this be true, it follows as a consequence that with
similar air-gaps at similar induction-densities, the traction is
the same fraction of the traction with the poles in contact,
whatever be the actual dimensions of the poles.
    The greater part of the experimental work I have to offer
refers to this point, for, if established, we clearly have a method
which will enormously facilitate the calculation of magnetic
forces.
    § 15. The observations made on this subject are sufficiently
detailed in the Tables I. to XIII., and the results will be under
stood by looking at the curve.
    The tractions were measured by spring balances as before,
measured pieces of brass being inserted between the pole-faces.
In a series of observations the induction was kept constant by
varying the magnetomotive force.
    The observations were taken just as in the previous case.
A little care is necessary in defining what is meant by the
total induction. If the bars are long and thin, then of course
the solenoidal condition is fulfilled pretty closely, and there
is no ambiguity ; but with large air or brass gaps—say,
amounting to two diameters of the bars—the lines begin to
leave the iron just in front of the middle point of each bar
(at all events when the bars are about 50 diameters long).
The " total induction " therefore has no very exact meaning
with respect to the iron, unless it be specified where it is to
be measured.
    At the time the experiments were mado, I did not (as I
now consider) sufficiently attend to this point, though I used
a testing-coil of about four times the diameters of the bars,
 and kept the coil just to one side of the gap when the latter
 was large. It is probable, therefore, that I have considerably
overestimated the tractions with the larger air-gaps, for the
induction must have been greater than I took it to be. I have
decided not to re-investigate this point, for the curve is of use
in giving approximate ideas of tractions only; and no one, after
 looking at it, would design a mechanism with air-gaps as long
as those which are probably inaccurate. I have made a little
allowance for this (most unscientifically of course) in drawing
 the curve. In fact my suspicions were first aroused by
examining the part of the curve corresponding to the larger
air-gaps.
    It will be seen that I examined a good many cases, and the

        offinding the Forces acting in Magnetic Circuits.       99
results show that when the non-magnetic field is of sensible
dimensions, the differences in the permeability of the samples
examined do not lead to any very abnormal results. The
curve is drawn by reduction for a bar one centimetre in
diameter ; and the air-gaps, which must be expressed in
diameters, appear therefore in centimetres. The ordinates
give the values of the tractions at corresponding points in
terms of the calculated tractions when the surfaces are in
contact.
   One set of observations refers to square bars. In order to
utilize the results, I assumed that the field would be distributed
very much as if the bar were round and of a diameter equal
to the mean of the diameters of the inscribed and circum
scribed circles.
   To use the curve it is onty necessary to express the length
of the air-gap as a fraction of the diameter of the pole-
face, and refer to the table to find the proper factor to
multiply the traction with the bars in contact at the proposed
induction.
   It will be seen that the factor is practically the same for all
inductions—hence one curve only is given.
   § 16. In general it is more convenient to take the magneto
motive force as given ; and in this case the induction cannot
be estimated without a knowledge of the reluctance of the
circuit. Now methods of building up the characteristic curve
of the magnet have been given when the air-gaps are narrow
by Drs. J. and E. Hopkinson and others ; but I thought that
I might possibly be able to extend the method of similar
systems so as to include air-gap reluctances. In similar
induction systems at constant induction-density, the reluc
tances of the gaps should be, roughly, inversely as the linear
dimensions. I examined three sets of bars to see how near
such an approximation really was, but it will be noticed that
the results would not reduce so as to give a single curve by
any such simple process. The curves are therefore kept
separate ; they cover bars of from about one to three centim.
in diameter. The induction was in these cases correctly
measured at the centres of the bars. It was necessary to use
the ampere-balances to get a sufficiently accurate knowledge
of the magnetizing currents. The results are contained in
Tables XIV. to XVI., and are also plotted for the mean of
all inductions. The reluctance of the iron and air circuits
was measured before the bars were cut and plotted against
inductions. It was assumed that by using bars of the length
employed, the air reluctance (other than that at the gap)
would not be materially changed by pushing the bars up to
                                H2

100 Approximate Method of calculating Magnetic Forces.
2 diameters apart. The proper reluctance for the iron and
air circuits was taken from the curve in finding the reluctance
of the air-gap.
    Except with the largest bar, there is no definite indication
of the reluctance depending on the induction-density. In
this case separate curves might have been diawn, but I did
aot think it worth while to introduce a fresh sheet of curves.
    I am not sure that a real reduction in air-gap reluctance at
 about '2 diameter has not been smoothed out ; but as the
 observations are marked on the curves, any one will be able
to form his own opinion.
    It will be noticed that the curvature becomes very great
 when the air-gap amounts to about 1*5 diameter. It is,
 perhaps, not too much to say that the reluctance increases
 very fast as the gap increases to "2 diameter, after which it
 increases more slowly up to about 1 diameter, and then
 remains roughly constant.
    § 17. I do not know whether a unit of reluctance has yet
 been adopted. It has been necessary for me to use one,
 however, and I take as unit reluctance that reluctance
 through which unit magnetomotive force produces unit
 induction. By unit magnetomotive force I mean that
 magnetomotive force whose C.G.S. value is unity—i. e., that
 produeed by j— C.G.S. turns.      If the permeability of air be
 taken as unity, then one cubic centimetre of air has unit
  reluctance on this system. There are, of course, other ways
  of defining unit reluctance ; but this is, I think, the only one
  that gets rid of the Air and leads to an easily realizable
  material standard.
     § 18. The reluctance curves and traction curves are not
  unlike each other in general form, and enable us to draw
  some practically valuable conclusions as to the design of
  magnets intended to operate over air-gaps. For instance,
  with a given total induction the force at contact is inversely
  as the area, but the traction curve shows that this principle
  must not be pushed too far when we consider traction over
  an air-gap. Thus, I am told (though I do not believe it)
  that rock-drills will not work with a shorter stroke than five
  inches ; the traction curve shows at once that for a given
  induction (a case which does not practically occur in every
  instance) it is possible to make the pole-pieces too small, if
  we wish to get the maximum work done during the stroke.
  This is independent of considerations arising when magneto
  motive force, and not induction, is given.

    § 19. We can make a comparison between the work done
by a ring magnet when it is divided at one point with the
work done when the ring is divided at two points. The
 reluctance data show that though the mean air-gap reluctance
 may be larger than that of the iron, it is not very greatly so
 in any practical case, and we can therefore obtain no informa
 tion by supposing that one is much greater or less than the
 other ; but must proceed by actual trial from the curves to
 find out which is the most efficient arrangement.
    § 20. In the case of a mechanism represented by a ring
divided at one point only, we must remember that, the closure
of the induction curves involves a " sliding " magnetic contact,
and if friction on the bearings is to be avoided this practically
ties us down to iron of symmetrical form.
    § 21. Incidentally I had occasion to observe the change of
reluctance caused by catting a bar, and then grinding and
polishing the ends. This was not done quite so well as in
our most successful attempts. The reluctance corresponded
to a separation of the bars by about 20 wave-lengths of sodium
light, but I am certain that the bars could not have been half so
far apart as this, so the surface reluctance is still unaccounted
for.

              VIII. On a new Harmonic Analyser.
                  By Prof. 0. Henrici, F.R.S.*
§ 1.    A CCORDING to the theory of Fourier's Series any
      _£X. function y of x can, under certain restrictions, be
expanded in a series progressing according to cosines and
sines of multiples of x.
    This function may be represented graphically by a curve,
x and y being taken as rectangular co-ordinates, or it may
be defined by aid of such a curve.
   Anyhow, we shall suppose this curve given, and also that
it extends from x=0 to x=c (fig. 1). For this interval the
curve may be drawn perfectly arbitrary as long as it gives
for every x one single finite value of y. This implies that if
a point moves along the curve the corresponding value of x
always increases. The curve may, however, be discontinuous,
so that for a particular value of x the ordinate changes
suddenly from a value yx to a value ys, as from C to C in

For our purposes it is necessary to make the curve con
tinuous by joining the two points C and C by a straight

line. If the curve represents a periodic phenomenon with
period c, then the ordinate for x=c will, as a rule, equal the
initial ordinate for a'=0 (as in fig. 1). The curve when
 repeated along the axis of x will therefore be continuous.
                               Fig. 2.
 Otherwise there will bo a discontinuity as at B in fig. 2. In
 this case also the curve has to be continued from its end point.
 B' along the last ordinate to a point B" which has the same
 ordinate as the initial point A', so that the line A' B" is
 parallel to the axis of x.
    We can now express the equation to the curve in the form

It is the object of the Harmonic Analyser to determine the
other coefficients. Their well-known values are

The Analyser is therefore an integrator.
    If the paper with the curve be wrapped round a cylinder,
the ordinate y falling on the generating lines or edges, the
axis of x along a circumference, then the curve will run back
in itself and form one continuous line, provided the circum
ference of the cylinder equals the base c. That edge which
passes through the initial point A' of the original curve may
be called the zero-edge.
    Suppose the cylinder to lie horizontal with the zero-edge
at the top, then our angle 0 will be the angle through which
the cylinder has to be turned in order to bring that point P
to the top which corresponds to any given x. Each edge
contains one point on the curve, excepting in case of a dis
continuity where a finite length of the edge belongs to the
curve.
    § 2. The first instrument of this kind was constructed by
Lord Kelvin (Proceedings Roy. Soc. vol. xxiv., 1876). Since
then several others have been devised. With regard to these
I may refer to my article " Ueber Instrumente zur harmon-
isehen Analyse " in the Catalogue prepared by Prof. W. Dyck
of Munich for the Mathematical Exhibition which was held
last summer in Munich, and also to the descriptions in the
Catalogue of the various instruments exhibited.
   These instruments differ essentially either in the manner in
which the trigonometrical factor is introduced, or in the
arrangement by which the actual integration is performed.
Lord Kelvin uses for the latter purpose his brother's disk-
globe and cylinder integrator, whilst a simple harmonic
motion introduces the trigonometrical factor. Sommerfeld
and Wiechert * of Konigsberg make the cylinder on which
                    * See above Catalogue, p. 274.

 the curve is drawn rotate about an axis perpendicular to that
 of the cylindor, and thus avoid the simple harmonic motion,
 which is always a drawback, as it introduces a great deal of
 friction. Both instruments are also large and heavy, practi
cally fixtures in the room where they are used.
     §3. Clifford has given a beautiful graphical representation
 of Fourier's Series, which I knew more fully from personal
 communication than from the short paper published in
 vol. v. of the Proceedings of the Lond. Math. Soc.
     His result may be stated thus :—" If the curve to be
 analysed be stretched out in the direction of the x to n times
its base without altering the y, and then wrapped round a
 cylinder with circumference c so that it goes n times round,
then the orthogonal projection of this curve on that meridian
plane which passes through the zero-point of the curve will
enclose an area which is proportional to the coefficient B„.
In the same way A„ is got by aid of a plane perpendicular to
the first."
    It was this theorem which led me to the construction of an
 Harmonic Analyser. It can easily be put in the following
 form. Suppose the cylinder placed with its axis horizontal
and the tangent plane to its upper edge drawn. This edge
cuts the curve in n points. Let P be one of them. If now
the cylinder be turned, and if at the same time the tangent
 plane be moved in its own plane in a direction perpendicular
 to the edge of contact, the point P will trace a curve on it.
This plane will be the same as Clifford's curve in case the
 motion of the tangent plane is simply harmonic, completing
one period for each rotation of the cylinder. The curve will
be completed after n rotations of the cylinder.
    The same curve will be traced if the original, unstretched,
curve is wrapped (once) round the cylinder, whilst the tangent
plane completes n periods of its simple harmonic motions for
one revolution of the cylinder.
    We thus get in a fixed plane a curve whose area equals, in
some unit, the coefficients A„ or B„, and this area can be
determined by an ordinary planimeter. The curve, of course,
need not be drawn out, as long as the tracer of the plani
meter is always at the point P it will describe the curve.
    This can easily be realized. A flat board, whose upper
surface forms a platform on which the planimeter can rest,
is placed by the side of the cylinder so that its upper sur
face lies in the tangent plane. A straight-edge is fixed
above the upper edge of the cylinder. The tracer of the
  lanimeter is pressed against it and made to follow the point
t ' on the curve. After a complete revolution of the cylinder,

the planimeter will register a number proportional to the
coefficient A„ or B„.
    I had an instrument of this kind made early in 1889, bnt
it did not turn out quite as simple as its theory. It gives, of
course, only one coefficient at a time, though it would not be
difficult to construct it to give more terms if it were not for
the mechanism required to produce the simple harmonic
motion. This always introduces a certain amount of friction
if it is to work accurately. I therefore tried to do away with
this, and obtained my object in the manner now to be
described.
    § 4. If the definite integrals which determine the coefficients
A* and B„ be integrated by parts, we get for the former
               nwAn=\j/ sin nd] — I sin nd dy,
                                   o Jo
the limits relating to 8.
   If the original curve is continuous, the integrated part
vanishes. This is not the case if there is a discontinuity, at
least not if 8 is retained as the independent variable.
   To prove that in this case also the integrated part can be
neglected, let us consider the curve in fig. 2. Let 0 be the
value of 8 for which the discontinuity 0 C occurs, and let
t/i be the ordinate of C, and y2' that of C.
   The integral with regard to 8 has to be broken up into
two, the first going from 0 to 8', the second from 8* to 2ir.
The integrated part, therefore, gives
                       jfi sin n8'—yj sin n&,
and this, in general, does not vanish.
   The remaining integral has to be taken for the two parts
of the curve from A' to C and from C to B', if the curve is
not made continuous. But if the curve is made continuous,
we have also to take the integral for the intervals from C to C,
and from B' to B". For these dd vanishes, but not dy. This
gives in addition the integrals
     — I sin nd dy=— sin n& I dy = — sin nff (y2' —y/) ;
hence just the terms obtained before from the integrated
part.
   The second integral for the interval B' B" vanishes because
it is multiplied by sin 2mr. In case of the coefficient B„ this
is not the case, but then the integrated part also contains
more terms which equal it. Hence :—

                     new Harmonic Analyser.                  115
   If the integration is performed with regard to y we get
          nA, = — Isinntfd'y,      n B*=- I cos nBdy,
both taken over the whole continuous curve from A' to B". If
the integration be continued from B" to A' on the line parallel
to the axis of x nothing is added to the integral, because here
dy vanishes.
   For the Analysers now to be described this extension of
the integration should always be made in order to eliminate
certain errors of the instrument.
   These new integrals are of a very different form from the
old ones, and require accordingly a different mechanism. As
the tracer of the instrument follows the curve, each dy has to
be multiplied by sin nO or cos nd. In other words, we have
to decompose the dy for each element of the curve into two
components at right angles to each other, of which the one
makes an angle (/with the axis of x, and then add all com
ponents of each kind to get A„ and B„.
   Originally I did this by aid of a pair of registering-wheels
such as are used in Amsler's well-known planimeter, the axes
of the two being at right angles. If such a wheel moves
along a straight line of length p, making an angle nO with its
own axis, it will register not p but p cos nd, whilst the second
wheel at right angles to it gives p sin nd,
   A model of this instrument was made in 1889.
   The curve is wrapped round a horizontal cylinder. Parallel
to this a carriage runs on a rail carrying the tracer which
moves along the upper edge of the cylinder. It also carries
a vertical spindle which has the two registering-wheels at
tached to it. These roll on a horizontal platform. If, now,
this spindle is made to turn through an angle n8 when the
cylinder has turned through an angle 0, and if the tracer is
made to follow the curve, then the two registering-wheels
will give the coefficients An and B„. For the details of the
construction I must refer to Prof. Dyck's Catalogue, p. 213.
   § 5. The next improvement is due to Mr. A. Sharp, of
the Teaching Staff in the Guilds' Central Technical College.
Having used my model, he brought me a design in which the
principles explained were realized in a different manner.
Among the alterations introduced one struck me as being of
importance. It consisted in an inversion of the motion, the
curve being drawn on the drawing-board and the instrument
made to move over it whilst the registering-wheels rolled on
the paper.
  It seemed to me that we had now all the elements needed

116                   Prof. 0. Henrici on a
for a really good instrument, and only wanted a practised
instrument-maker to realize it. I therefore called in 1892
on Coradi in Zurich, well known for his planimeters and inte
grators. He set to work at once and sent me in a short time
a drawing of his construction, and it is due to his skill that
the instrument has, at last, reached a high degree of perfec
tion. One Analyser has been made for the Guilds' Central
Technical College, which I shall describe. But I must
mention at once that Herr Coradi has since greatly im
proved it, so much so that it is now one of the most perfect
integrators made.
   § b*. Fig. 3 shows an instrnment of Coradi's second design.
This will help to explain the first.
   There is first of all a solid frame whose base is a long
rectangle. It rests with three wheels on the drawing-board.
One of these, D, in the middle of the front, serves merely as
a support. The other two, E, E, are fixed to the ends of a
long axle which runs along the back of the frame. This may
be called the " shaft." It is placed parallel to the axis of x.
The instrument can, therefore, roll over the paper in the
direction of the ordinates y.
   If thus moved through a distance dy, the shaft will turn
through an angle proportional to dy. The shaft carries any
required number of short " cylinders." In the figure there
is one marked C situated in the middle of the shaft.
   Above each of these cylinders is a vertical " spindle " S,
whose geometrical axis cuts that of the shaft. In the new
instrument each spindle carries one or two disks, Hs, H4, in
fig. 3 ; but in the old construction one crown wheel with its
teeth pointing upwards, by aid of which the spindle is turned.
At the lower end the integrating apparatus proper is
attached, which is quite different in the two designs. But
before explaining this let me describe how the spindle is
turned.
   Along the front of the frame runs a carriage W, to which
the tracer F is fixed. This can be moved through a distance
equal to the base c to which the curve is drawn. To the
carriage a silver wire is also attached, which in the new
design is stretched along the front of the frame and then by
aid of guide-pulleys I, I over one of the disks H on top of the
spindle S (see fig. 3). By giving the disk H a suitable
diameter the spindle can be made to turn n times round,
whilst the tracer describes the whole base. In the old instru
ment the wire only drives an extra spindle in the middle of
the frame, which by aid of wheelwork drives all the working
spindles. If the tracer on following the curve has reached a

new Harmonic Analyser.

118                 . Prof. 0. Henrici on a
point P, then the spindle will have turned through an angle
nd, where 6 corresponds to the x of P.
    If, now, the spindle had at its lower end two registering-
wheels at right angles to each other rolling on the drawing-
paper, we should have in principle my old model (§ 4) with
 Sharp's inversion. Instead of this Coradi gave each spindle one
registering-wheel and made this roll on the cylinder C. This
requires for each registering-wheel a separate spindle, hence
two for each pair of coefficients A» and B„. It substitutes,
however, the rolling on a smooth surface for that on the rough
 surface of the paper. The instrument made according to
 this design for the Guilds' Central Technical College has five
 snch pairs, so that on going once over the curve the first five
 pairs A„ and B» are obtained. The extra spindle which is
driven by the silver wire contains, however, three extra disks,
making lour in all. If the wire is stretched over the top disk
we get, as stated, the coefficients for n=l, 2, 3, 4, 5. The
second pulley has half the diameter, iso that the spindles turn
twice as fast if the wire is stretched round it. Thus in going
over the curve a second time we get the new coefficients for
n=6, 8, 10. The remaining two disks give similarly the
 coefficients for n = 7 and 9 respectively. Hence on going
 four times over the curve we get ten pairs of coefficients. In
 most cases the five pairs obtained at once will be amply
 sufficient.
    For the details of the construction I must again refer to
 Prof. Dyck's Catalogue (Nachtrag, p. 34) and only mention
a few points. The axis of a registering-wheel lies in the
diameter of a horizontal ring which is attached to the lower
end of the spindle by aid of an elastic vertical steel plate.
This presses the wheel against the cylinder, securing contact.
On testing the instrument it was found that this plate was
liable to slight torsion which affected the readings. It
showed a number of other drawbacks of more or less im-
Eortance. One is that the registering-wheel not only rolls
  ut also slips. This slipping is absent in the Analyser of
Lord Kelvin, who has dwelt strongly on the importance of
avoiding it.
    There was also a serious difficulty in taking the readings.
The instrument registers up to 20 centim. If the zero-point
has passed the index which gives the reading, 20 centim.
have to be added or subtracted. Every one who has used a
planimeter is accustomed to this, and knows how to take
account of it, for he can either estimate the area sufficiently
to see which correction is necessary, or he can go rapidly
over the curve again, watching the zero-point. Neither
method is possible with an Analyser which gives a large

                     new Harmonic Analyser.                   11&
number of readings at once. The new instrument is there
fore constructed to record up to 200 centim.
   § 7. Last summer at the Munich Exhibition Herr Coradi
submitted a new arrangement to me to obviate some of the
imperfections of the instrument described, and this he has
since carried out with an ingenuity which 1 cannot enough
admire. He has practically got rid of all the imperfections of
the old Analyser, and has now produced an instrument which, I
fancy, leaves nothing to be desired. He himself says it is
the best instrument of any kind he has yet made. The
chief alteration is this, that he interposes between the register
ing-wheel at the lower end of the spindle and the cylinder a
perfectly free glass sphere.
                                Fig. 4.
   The " spindle " has now firmly attached to its lower end a
square frame K L M N (comp. figs. 3 and 4) by aid of two
solid rods K and M, instead of carrying the ring connected
by aid of an elastic spring. This frame holds two registering-
wheels R1 and Rz, whose axes K L and L M are at right
angles. Between these lies the glass sphere G, resting with
its lowest point on the cylinder belonging to the spindle. A
third wheel r at N is by aid of a spring pressed against the
sphere to secure contact between the latter and the registering-
wheels. If, now, the tracer follows the curve this frame will
turn with the spindle, the three wheels will carry the sphere
with it, which will turn pivot-like on its lowest point. If, as
in fig. 4, the plane of one wheel R1 makes with the axis of x
an angle n6, and if in this position the tracer, and with it the
whole instrument, is moved through the distance dy, the
" shaft " will turn proportionally to dy. This will set the
sphere turning about its horizontal diameter xx parallel to the

120                On a new Harmonic Analyser.
 shaft, and this motion will be communicated to each of the
 registering-wheels. It will be seen at once, if q denotes the
 radius of the sphere, the point of contact of the sphere and
 the wheel R1 is at a distance g sin nd from the axis of the
 sphere, that therefore the turning communicated to this wheel
 will be proportional to dy sin nd. Similarly the other wheel
 will turn proportionally to dy cos nd. If the tracer moves
 through the whole curve, these two wheels will therefore
 register numbers proportional to A„ and Bn. The dimensions
 are so chosen that the readings give nA„ and wB» in centi
 metres.
    It will be seen that now one spindle does the work of two
 in the old instrument. There is, further, no slipping of any
 kind in the integrating apparatus.
    Another improvement is that the wheelwork for turning
 the spindles is done away with. Each spindle is turned
 directly by the silver wire, and thus any slackness in the
 wheels is done away with.
    It has also been possible to introduce an arrangement to
 set all spindles to zero after the wire has been tightened.
    Lastly, the readings are taken with much greater ease as
 the registering apparatus is well exposed to the eye.
    In order that the instrument may work accurately it is
 necessary that the point of contact of the sphere with its cylinder
 should lie in the geometrical axis of the spindle. But it is
 practically impossible to secure this. This point will there
 fore describe a small circle on the cylinder and this will turn
the sphere about some horizontal diameter, and therefore also
the registering-wheels. It is of importance to eliminate the
error thus introduced. This is done by bringing the tracer
 back to the starting-point A on the curve by moving it from
 B to A (figs. 1, 2) parallel to the axis of x. The sphere will
hereby repeat the motion which produced the error, but in
the opposite sense, and therefore completely cancel it.
    § 8. The first instrument of this kind has been made for
Prof. Klein at Gottingen. It contains one spindle, as in
fig. 3. Going once over the curves it gives therefore one pair
of coefficients. To get more, disks of different diameter
have to be used to drive the spindle. Of these six are pro
vided. Since then two further instruments have been finished;
one with five spindles, which goes to Moscow, the other, with
three spindles, for Prof. Weber in Zurich. The experience
gained in the making of the Gottingen instrument has
enabled Coradi to introduce a number of small improvements,
with the result that the carriage runs in the Moscow instru
ment, where it has to .drive five spindles, as easily as in the
one for Gottingen with only one spindle.

            Mr. A. Sharp on an Harmonic Analyser.                 121
   He has also introduced a celluloid ring below the sphere,
which on being raised presses the sphere against a similar
ring above, thus preventing any damage to the integrating
apparatus when the instrument is not being used.
   Note.—At the request of Herr Coradi I add the statement
that the idea of the new integrating apparatus, consisting of a
sphere with two recording-wheels at right angles to each
other, is not his own, but is due to Herr Max Kiintzel, of
Charlottenhof, near Konigshutte in Silesia. Herr Kiintzel
invented the arrangement for an instrument designed to
determine the coordinates of the vertices of a polygon, and
submitted his design to Herr Coradi for the construction of
such an instrument.

OX the axis of the wheel W turns uniformly in a horizontal
plane, and the distance rolled through by the wheel during
any short interval is equal to the corresponding displacement
of the tracer P in the direction OY. If the axis of the rolling
wheel W makes one complete turn while the tracing-point P
moves over one complete period of the curve (fig. 1), the
point of contact of the rolling wheel will describe a curve
(WR (fig. 2).
   Let OY7 (fig. 2) be the initial direction of the plane of the

corresponding points infinitely close to P and p respectively.

   From (2) and (46) it is evident that OR (fig. 2) is equal to
7rC,, and the angle Y'OR is equal to at.
   If now the axis of the rolling wheel W makes n turns
while the tracer P moves over one complete period of the
curve (fig. 1) , the corresponding values of OR and the angle
Y'OR will be nirCn and <*n respectively.
   Various arrangements of mechanism are suggested for
connecting the rolling wheel with the tracer so as to satisfy
the above conditions ; the following seems the most suitable,
as it can be adapted for an instrument to give more than one
simple harmonic constituent term for one tracing of the
curve.
   The motion of the rolling wheel relative to the paper is
compounded of two simple movements :—(a) a pure rolling,
the distance rolled being equal to dy the element described
by the tracer P; (b) a motion of rotation, the point of contact
of the wheel with the paper being the centre of rotation, and
the angle turned through from the initial line being propor
tional to x the abscissa of P. The relative motion will,
therefore, be the same if the wheel be rolled along a straight
line fixed in the instrument, while the paper is made to turn,
the centre of rotation of the paper being the point of contact
of the wheel with it which is continually varying in position.
Fig. 1 represents diagrammatically the mechanism. The curve

124         Mr. A. Sharp on an Harmonic Analyser."
to be analysed is drawn on a flat sheet of paper and placed
on a drawing-board. The carriage FF, which forms the base
of the instrument, is supported by an axle with two equal
wheels Wj and a third wheel w which roll on the paper, the
direction of motion of the carriage being OX. A disk dx
mounted on a vertical spindle is driven by a pair of bevel
wheels by the axle «?i w^ A long key on the upper surface
of this disk fits into a groove on the under surface of a disk
d2, which is thus free to move in a straight line relative to
disk dt. A groove on the upper surface of disk d3 at right
angles to that on its lower surface has a key from the lower
surface of disk d3 resting in it. Thus the disk d3 always
turns with disk du although any point on disk d3 may be
made the centre of rotation ; the three disks being kinema-
tically equivalent to Oldham's coupling for the transmission
of motion between two parallel shafts. The keys and grooves
would be replaced, in an actual instrument, by wheels and
rails, in order to diminish frictional resistance.
   The tracing-point P is mounted on a smaller carriage /,
which is free to run in the direction OY relative to the main
carriage F. This smaller carriage carries also the rolling
wheel W which rolls on the disk d3. The rolling wheel W
should be spherical in form, and of as small diameter as
possible, so that its surface of contact with the paper on disk
d3 approximates to a point. The friction between wheel W
and disk d3 is great enough to prevent any relative sliding.
As the tracer P moves over the curve (fig. 1) the point of
the wheel W will describe on the disk d3 the curve Opp'R
(fig. 2). To ensure that, as the tracer P is moved in the
direction OY, the wheel W will roll on the disk d3 the same
distance and not displace it relative to disk du a wheel W of
the same diameter as W is mounted on the same spindle
and rolls on a fixed portion of the carriage FF. If W' be
compelled to roll, W must roll on the disk d3 an equal
amount.
   The actual shape of the curve Opp'H (fig. 2) is of no im
portance, the initial and final points being all that are required.
A needle or pencil n may therefore be carried at any con
venient part of the carriage /, and the initial and final posi
tions 0 and R marked by it. The direction of the initial
line OR will be recorded on the disk d3 by making two marks
with the needle n as the tracer P moves along the line OY
(fig- 1).
   The gearing must be such that the disk d3 turns once
while the tracer P describes one complete period of the curve.

    This instrument has the advantage over any Harmonic
 Analyser previously designed that it gives directly the quan
 tities—amplitude and epoch—of each simple harmonic term
 which are required ; all other instruments, as far as I am
 aware, giving the coefficients AB and BB, from which CB and
 «B are calculated.
    It is remarkable that no adjustments have to be made
 before using the instrument, the initial position of the disk d3
 having no influence on the curve Opp'R described on it.
 There is no part of the instrument which demands excessive
 accuracy of construction. The accuracy and delicacy of the
 instrument depends on the accuracy with which the line OR
 and angle Y'OR can be measured, and will be quite as great
 as that with which the original curve fig. 1 is drawn.
    In some cases there will be a danger that the disk d3 m;iy
 not be large enough to contain the complete curve Opp'R
 (fig. 2). If the rolling wheel W is about to roll off the
disk, a mark should be made with the needle n, and keeping
the tracer P in the same position, the disk d3 should be moved
by hand into any other convenient position relative to disked,
a new mark made with the needle, and the movement of the
tracer P may then be proceeded with. The final line OR
 can then be easily built up from its separate parts.
    Since writing the above I have designed an inversion of
the mechanism described above giving a simple compact
instrument, which I may have the pleasure of describing
later on.
  X. Remarks on Prof. Henrici's Paper made by Prof.
    Perry, F.R.S., in which he describes a Simple Machine
   which may be used to develop any Arbitrary Function in
    Series of Functions of any Normal Forms *.
I CONGRATULATE Prof. Henrici, first upon his success
       in these Analysers, with which I shall presently form a
practical acquaintance when the latest of them yet constructed
reaches me from Zurich, second on the admirably clear way
in which he described them to us.
   I have had no experience with the hatchet, that simples'
of all planimeters ; but with regard to the Robertson-Hyn.

126        Prof. Perry's Remarks on Prof. Henrici's
instrument, which conies to ns from America, and which in the
size here exhibited is well suited to Indicator-diagram work,
I can say that some of my students instituted a careful
comparison between it and the Amsler which they use for
Indicator diagrams, and they found that the average error
with it was about one third of that with the Amsler.
   We know that in mathematical physics generally the
development of an arbitrary function in a Fourier's Series is
often of great importance ; but I wish to say that this subject
is becoming of greater and greater importance to the practical
man—the engineer.
   Thus in alternating-electric-current work, all the disturbing,
distracting, dangerous troubles are considerably increased when
the currents are not simple harmonic functions of the time.
With two-phase or three-phase currents, if the amplitudes are
not equal, the rotating magnetic field neither remains of
constant strength nor has it constant angular velocity ; and if
there are overtones we have extra fields of changing
magnitude, which rotate irregularly at two or more times
the speed of the fundamental.
   I have long thought that mechanical engineers need such
instruments as Prof. Henrici has designed, if only to
familiarize them with the ideas of Fourier. It has for some
time been my habit, when studying with students any kind of
reciprocating motion of a piece of machinery, to resolve the
motion into its fundamental harmonic motion and overtones.
For example, if one is studying the forces causing the motion,
one ought to keep in mind that the reciprocating motion
which (speakiDg rather vaguely) requires the smallest forces
or moments of forces to produce it, is the simple harmonic
motion. The accelerating forces due to an octave are four
times as great as for a fundamental of the same amplitude.
The motion of the piston of a steam-engine is, with sufficient
exactness for practical calculations, a fundamental of amplitude
                                 r*
r and an octave of amplitude —., where r is the length of the
crank and I the length of connecting-rod.
   A special graphical method of study may be discovered and
employed for any special motion ; but for applicability to
reciprocating motions in general I know of nothing to
compare with the method of study which is based on finding
the fundamental motion and one or more overtones.
   Again, the difference between one kind of slide-valve
motion and another may be exceedingly great, practically,
and yet the theories found in books show no difference at all.
Indeed, the complete mathematical methods of study are too

               Paper on a new Harmonic Analyser.                         127
troublesome, but the mathematics of link motions and radial
valve-gears become very simple when we consider, not merely
the fundamental simple harmonic motion, which is all that is
usually studied, but the octave, which is found to help or hurt
in the various forms.
   I was first attracted to this subject when studying the
beautiful but little-known valve-motion invented long ago by
Sir F. Bramwell, in which the only overtone is three times
the fundamental.
    Given any function completely, we can bj' a numerical
method, and with as much accuracy as we please, develop it
in Fourier's Series. In the ' Electrician ' of Feb. 5th, 1892, I
published the numerical work of one example calculating from
23 ordinates. In the sheet which I here exhibit one of my
students, Mr. Fox, has done the same work by a graphical
method. Probably he is the very first to carry out the idea
of the late Prof. Clifford by descriptive geometry*. That is,
we have imagined the curve to be wrapped round the cylinder,
and it was surprising to find how rapidly its projections could be
drawn upon the two planes and their areas obtained by the
planimeter.       We then imagined the curve to be wrapped
twice round and the projections drawn and their areas taken.
I wish I had time to dwell upon the interesting problems that
arose during the work, for example as to whether the area was
to be taken as positive or negative. However many loops
such a figure may possess, the well-known rule for autotomic
plane circuits (Thomson andTait's 'Elements,' §445) is really
attended to by the planimeter.           The direction of motion of
   * Note added May 29th. —The descriptive geometry method is fairly
quick, and may be made as accurate as one pleases, but of course it
cannot compare in quickness with the Henrici Analyser.
   It is obvious that by properly shaping; one's cylinder, wrapping the
curve round it, and then finding the area of it, projected on a plane
parallel to the axis, one may develop an arbitrary function in a series of
any normal forms. Thus if Q(x) is any tabulated function of x, and y is
the arbitrary function of x, and we wish to find the integral \"y ¦ Q(x) . dx,
the shape of the curve which must bo used instead of a circle in the
Clifford construction is easy to find. It must be such that the cosine of
the angle which the short length Sx of the curve makes with the trace of
the plane on which the projection is to take place shall be proportional
to Q(.r), and several easy methodR of drawing the curve or a series of
such curves may be found. Once found, there is no more difficulty in
developing any new arbitrary function in any series of normal forms
than Mr. Fox found with his Fourier Series. A series of curves will be
needed for a development in Zonal Harmonics, but only one curve will
be needed for the Zeroth Bessels. These curves, or shapes of sections of
cylinders, I am now proceeding to draw on a sufficiently large scale for
exact work.

 128        Prof. Perry's Remark's on Prof. Henrici's
the tracer must be that in which x increases on the real curve.
I here give the results :—
     The values of the arbitrary function to be analysed were
 really calculated from
          # = 10 + 5 sin (— # + 30°) -sin (—*-60°\
     The result obtained numerically and published in the
 ' Electrician,' using 23 ordinates, was
y = 9-966 + 5-039 sin (^.r + 29°-9)- 1-053 sin (— x-h5°'%\.
     The result now obtained graphically is
 «/ = 10-01 + 5-0096 sin (^ + 30°-38Vl0099 sin (—#-59°-22\
     It is curious that Prof. Henrici should have based the
 construction of his first or 1889 instrument on the beautiful
 idea of the late Prof. Clifford, and not on what I call the
  Henrici principle. He gives the Henrici principle to explain
 the later instruments, and does not seem to see that his first
 instrument is the most beautiful example of its application.
 I take the Henrici principle to be thatjy . sin 0. d#=jcos 6 .dy,
 the integrations being for a whole period. Well, in his first
 instrument, whilst its tracer moves through the distance dy,
 the ordinarily fixed part of the planimeter now has a dis
 placement cos 8, and this is the same as if in the ordinary use
 of the instrument a curve is being traced whose ordinate
is cos 8.
    It is only on the assumption that the Henrici principle
applies to his first instrument, that I venture to say that the
following analyser is on the Henrici principle. We have at
present to develop functions in sines and cosines, spherical
harmonics and Bessel functions, because we know that when
we have effected such developments we can convert them at
once into the solutions of certain physical problems. As
time goes on we shall require developments in many other
normal forms. I propose to describe a machine which will
effect any such development. I mean, that my machine will
evaluate the integral I f(x).Q,(x) ,dx, where y=f(x) is an
arbitrary function of x and Q(x) is any tabulated function.
Following Henrici, we convert the required integral into
                   Jy(aO.H(*)]-JH(*).dy,

               Paper on a new Harmonic Analyser.                 129
where H(.r) is the integral of Q (x) and may be tabulated as
Q(.r) is tabulated. Now in many cases the part between the
square brackets is zero, but this is of little consequence in
comparison with the fact that the part JH (a) . dy may be
evaluated by a machine somewhat like Prof. Henrici's first
or 1889 instrument. I have worked with this 1889 instru
ment, and I am not disposed to think it so inaccurate as
its inventor thinks it. Its defects are really defects of
mechanical construction ; for example, the amplitude of the
simple harmonic motion of its table is very much too small.
    I have already put my machine in hand and hoped to
exhibit it here to-day in working order, but unfortunately the
Easter holidays have prevented it being finished in time. It
is arranged to develop an arbitrary function in Bessels of
the zeroth order, or rather Fourier cylindric functions.
Thus it is required to determine the constants A1} A2, &c., in
           J[r) = A1J0(fi1r)+A!!J0{(i2r)+ &c, . . . . (1)

roots of (3) .
   In every case the practical difficulty consists in finding the
integral. I exhibit to the Society an easy example of such
an analysis worked out numerically (I suppose that such a
thing has never been done before) by two of my students,
Mr. H. F. Hunt and Mr. W. Fennell.
   It will bo seen that the work is rather tedious. It was
made more tedious by their having found it necessary to
calculate numbers and tabulate them in a handy form,
interpolating between the numbers given in Lommel by
the use of his formula. Before this work was finished we
discovered Dr. Meissel's elaborate tables, from which the
remainder of our handy four-figure tables is merely copied.
These handy tables of J0{x) and Ji(#) are at the service of
the Society; they would occupy just four pages of the

 we write ^(r) for pi-J^pr), and y for our arbitrary function
f(r), the required integral I rf[r) .J0[fir) .dr is
 The part between the square brackets is usually 0, but
 however that may be, we see that we can evaluate the
 integral by the machine. A curve is drawn representing
f(r) from r=0tor=aona sheet of paper which is wrapped
 round a roller, a need not be equal to the whole circum
 ference of the roller and the scale of r,is unimportant. Of
 course the ordinate y or/(r) lies parallel to the axis of the
 roller. It is the measurement of y in inches which my
 instrument analysas, as my planimeter is graduated in square
 inches. A table whose upper surface is in a plane tangential
 to the roller carries the usually fixed part and rolling wheel
 of an Amsler planimeter. On turning through an angle 6 a
 handle which drives a shaft on which a properly shaped cam
 is keyed, the table is displaced in its own plane towards the
 roller, through the distance x Ji(x), 6 being proportional to
 x, and at the same time the roller is driven so that the paper
 moves circumferentially through a distance proportional to x.
 For this particular kind of problem a few different but
 definite trains of gearing might be used to connect the
 handle and the roller, but for genoral purposes I would
 prefer variable friction gearing to give any relative speeds
 that may be necessary. In my model now being constructed
 I am using two disks, one of which rests on the other at a
 point which may be altered, radially. As in Prof. Henrici's
 instrument, the tracing-point of the planimeter is held against
 a straight edge, so that it can only move along the tangent-
 line of roller and table whilst following the curve on the
roller.
    If /* is a root of Jo(^ia)=0 as in the well-known drum
head problem, a being the radius of the drum-head,—in the
first operation to find Au the gearing must be adjusted so
that when the whole curve on the roller passes under the
tracing-point of the planimeter, a graduated circle on the

               Level of no Strain within a Solid Earth.      131
   shaft turned by the handle indicates that it has turned
  through an angle proportional to 2*405, which is the first
  value of x which satisfies Jo(x)=0.
     It is advisable to have a pointer and a scale to indicate
  exactly the displacement of the table, so as to test the
  accuracy with which the cam performs its duties. Of course,
  when the graduated-circle indication is 2-405, the displace
  ment of the table is to be 2-405 Ji(2-405) or —1-249 inches.
  The area recorded on the planimeter in square inches
  must now be multiplied by 2(2-405)s/a4[J1(2-405)]s, and the
  answer is Ay.
     To find A2 : change the gearing so that when the whole
 roller-curve passes under the tracing-point of the planimeter,
 the graduated circle indicates 5'5201, and check the error of
 the cam by noting that the displacement indication ought
 now to be 5-5201 ^(5-5201) or 1-878 inches. The area
 recorded by the planimeter in square inches must now
 be multiplied by 2(5-5201)2/a4[J1(5-5201)]9. If variable
 frictional gearing is used, it is important that the roller
 should be placed on roller bearings of small resistance.
    To develop an arbitrary function in Bessels of any other
 order, or in Fourier's Series, or in zonal harmonics, or in
 series of functions of any other normal forms, we have only
 to replace the cam by one of another shape; so that this one
 simple machine is suited to quite general analytical use.

riori, considering the magnitude of the actually observed
features of the earth's surface."
    As regards the a priori objection, that it is improbable that
any critical change in condition should be demonstrable at
the small depth of from two to four miles, it may be replied
that no claim is made that such a change in condition exists
at that depth in the actual earth. But what has been demon
strated is, that, if the earth had cooled as a solid globe, a level
of no strain would be found in that position. In that case,
however, the surface-features would not have resembled in
size and arrangement those which we see. Consequently we
do regard the improbability of a critical change at so small a
 depth to be a reductio ad absurdxim, and conclude that one
 of the premisses, viz. that of solidity, is wrong. The a poste
riori objection involves a petitio principii ; for it assumes that
 the observed features are due to contraction through cooling,
 which is the very question that is being brought to the
proof.
    But it is in the method of investigation rather than in the
premisses that Mr. Blake appears to think a mistake has been
made; for he contends that the use of the "linear"9 equa
 tions for the conduction of heat in the calculation of the
 position of the level of no strain, as was done by Mr. Davison
 and Professor Darwin f, and also by me, is inconsistent with
 the introduction of the radius of the earth already assumed
infinite. The objection is primd facie plausible, and it had
 occurred to me ; but seeing that the changes of temperature
 involved occurred only near the surface, I did not think it
 necessary to take sphericity into account as regarded the
 temperature gradient ; and what follows will show that I was
justified. Using for convenience of reference the same
symbols as in my book J :—
    r = the radius of the earth considered spherical, 20,902,404

    Professor R. S. Woodward, U.S.A., gives the solution of
this, which is suitable to the case of a sphere initially at a
uniform temperature throughout, and cooling into a medium
such that its surface is maintained at a constant temperature
considered to be zero. The solution is *

This solution meets the objections raised by Professor Blake
to Lord Kelvin's solution, in which the radius was assumed
infinite.
    Prof. Woodward, with great ingenuity, transforms the above
expression into one or other of two rapidly converging series,
in either of which he says the first term is sufficient in the
case of the earth, if the time since the commencement of the
cooling is less than 100,000,000,000 years. The second of
these series (no. 20) written in our symbols is

   This differs from the expression for the corresponding time
rate (dr'dt) in the case when sphericity is neglected by being
multiplied by the factor r/(r—x). Hence the fall of tem
perature at a given depth goes on slightly more rapidly in
the case of the sphere, as might be expected.

   Lord Kelvin assumed the high value of 7000° F. for V,
the temperature of solidification, probably to allow for its
possible increment in the lower shells owing to the pressure.

   This differs from the expression when sphericity is not
considered, in the small terms. With the values 1/51° F. per
foot for the gradient at the surface, and 7000° F. for the
temperature of solidification, the depth of the level of no
strain was found to be 11,252 feet*. But the depth when
sphericity is taken account of in the cooling will be 11,071
feet ; so that the level of no strain is brought nearer to the
surface by 181 feet by this consideration. The resulting
difference, however, comes out so small as amply to justify
sphericity being neglected, as was done by Professor Darwin
and myself.
   It is obvious that the corrugations formed by compression
                   • < Physics &c.,' 2nd edit. p. I

136          Level of no Strain within a Solid Earth.
will consequently be slightly, diminished instead of being
increased by the more accurate hypothesis of sphericity.
    The present investigation is a sufficient reply to Professor
Blake's objection that " English writers have hitherto adopted
Lord Kelvin's assumption that the earth may be regarded as
of infinite radius, and have thus followed him in using linear
equations for the conduction of heat. But when later writers
go further, and at the same time introduce the radius of the
 earth, already assumed infinite, into the calculation, they are
obviously inconsistent, and it may well be that the whole
 of the results are derived from this inconsistency itself."
 Plausible as this criticism at first sight appears, I have now
 shown that it is altogether unimportant, seeing that the
 position of the level of no strain is not appreciably altered
 when the inconsistency complained of is avoided. At the
 same time, such alteration as its removal introduces tends
 in the opposite direction to that which Mr. Blake appears to
 expect, bringing, as it does, the level of no strain nearer to
 the surface, and therefore making the resulting elevatory
 corrugations smaller than before. It may be as well to
 remind the reader that the depth of the level of no strain
 in a solid globe does not follow the same law as the radial
 contraction. The former varies as the time, and therefore
 the rate at which it descends is constant. The latter varies
 as the square root of the time, so that the rate at which the
 surface sinks diminishes as the time increases.
    Professor Blake concludes his critique with a formidable
 list of difficulties to be overcome before " we can really face
the problem of a level of no strain." If it is required to
 find what its situation would be with accuracy, even within a
 mile or so, no doubt we are not, and probably even our
 remote descendants will never be, in a position to do so.
 But this is obscuring the real issue. The reference to " the
 Positive teachings of geological facts " is beside the question,
   n this connexion these merely tell us that the superficial
 strata have again and again been ridged up by lateral pressure.
 But some minds will not rest satisfied with this "positive
 teaching" without seeking the cauxe of this phenomenon.
 That it is due to the contraction of the globe through cooling
 is an hypothesis seemingly simple and by prescriptive right
 orthodox, but not necessarily true ; while the arrangement
 of the axes of elevation in lines following undeviating direc
tions for immense distances, instead of forming a network of
polygons, by no means favours it. But the discovery of a level
of no strain affords perhaps the strongest argument against this
theory, more especially if the earth is assumed to be solid, as

              Improved Form of Littrow Spectroscope.                  137
 in the preceding calculations. And it does not seem probable
 that a better knowledge of the varying conductivity of rocks,
 or of their contractibility on cooling, would give such altered
 values to the constants of the problem as to bring up the
 calculated amount of elevations so as to approach the actual.
 Dr. Murray estimates the mean elevation of the land of the
 globe at 1947 feet above the sea, and the mean depth of the
 ocean at 12,456 feet*, whereas, according to my estimate,
 the mean height of the elevations which would be caused by
 the compression of a solid earth, initially supposed at 7000° F.,
 would be only 6^ feet f.
     If we make the supposition that the crust rests on a liquid
 substratum, we shall still have a level of no strain f, and
 although the amount of the corrugations formed will in this
 case be somewhat greater, it will still fall far short of that
 which the " positive teachings of geology " require us to
 account for.

IT is rather remarkable that in the development of the
       prismatic spectroscope there have been no important
modifications in the general design of the instrument as first
used by Newton, progress having been marked mainly in
the mechanical improvements of the various parts. Various
modifications have, it is true, been proposed from time to
 time, but none of them has stood the test of usage, except
 perhaps the form which was first proposed by Littrow in
 1862 ||, and has since been modified and improved by Young
and Lockyerl, Browning**, Qrubbftj Bracketjf, and
others.
    In this form, as is well known, the rays from the slit, after
being rendered parallel by a collimating-lens, pass through
the prism or train of prisms and fall normally upon a plane

 138              Mr. F. L. 0. Wadsworth on an
 reflector, and after reflexion retraverse the train in the oppo
 site direction, and are brought to a focus by the same lens
 which acts as a collimator. To observe conveniently an
 image of the spectrum, a small right-angled prism covering
 one half the field is placed near the slit.
    In certain respects the advantages of this form over the
 ordinary one are unquestionably great ; for not only does it
 allow all parts of the instrument, save the prisms and plane
 reflector, to be fixed in position, but it also involves the use
 of only one lens, a consideration of some importance in the
 case of large instruments. Unfortunately in this, its original
 form, it has two very practical disadvantages :—1st, the
 general illumination of the field of view by reflexion of a
 portion of the light from the slit from the surface of the lens ;
 and, 2nd, the close proximity of the observing eyepiece to the
 slit. Both of these difficulties are avoided in the modified
 forms already referred to, in which the collimator covers only
 the lower half of the prism, the plane reflector being replaced
 by a right-angled prism, which is so placed as to return the
 ray after two internal reflexions through the upper half of
 the prism. The observing telescope is consequently entirely
 above and distinct from the collimator, and can be placed at
 any angle with the latter (usually it is placed at right angles)
 by the use of another reflector.
    This arrangement, while entirely avoiding both of the
 difficulties mentioned, introduces others of a different cha
 racter. In the first place the cost is considerably increased ;
 for two objectives are required, one for the collimator, the
other for the observing telescope ; the prisms for a given
aperture of telescope must be twice as large as before ; and,
finally, two right-angled prisms both of large size, one having
the same aperture as the telescope, the other an aperture
about 1£ times greater, are required. This makes the instru
ment more expensive even than one of the ordinary form of
the same dispersion.
    Again, the increaso in the number of optical surfaces
involved diminishes very considerably both the brightness
and the distinctness of the spectral image, and increases the
number of adjustments required for accurate spectrometric
work.
    For all these reasons it is not surprising that these instru
ments have failed to displace to any extent the standard form;
for the only advantage which they possess over that form is
their somewhat greater compactness and rigidity, both tele
scopes being fixed in position. But the simplicity of design
and cheapness of construction, which were distinguishing

              Improved Form of Littrow Spectroscope.                    139
characteristics of tho original Littrow form, have been entirely
lost in the attempt to overcome the difficulties already men
tioned in regard to the illumination of the field and the
inconvenient position of the eyepiece.
   More recently Prof. Bracket* has, without essentially
altering the original design of the instrument, overcome the
first and principal difficulty, by making the combined colli
mator and observing lens with faces of such curvature as to
reduce the quantity of light reflected to the observing eye
piece to a minimum.
    It recently occurred to me, in connexion with an attempt
to photograph the spectrum with a spectroscope of this form,
that tho difficulty could be completely overcome by tho use
of a concave mirror in place of the lens, and a trial of an
instrument so constructed showed that it possessed other
advantages also.
    The following brief description of this form of instrument,
which is, I believe, new, may therefore be of interest. Fig. 2
 (PI. VI.) is a plan view, the top plate of the containing box
 being removed to show the parts clearly, and fig. 1 is a side
view. A small right-angled prism a receives the light from
the slit s, and reflects it to a concave mirror b which acts as a
collimator. From b the collimated beam is reflected, to tho
prism c, behind which is the plane mirror d, which returns
the rays again through the prism to the concave mirror, by
which they are finally brought to a focus at the observing
 eyepiece /, which is placed just above tho plane of the slit
 and near the edge of the prism. A blackened screen L is
 placed between the prism and the eyepiece to cut off tho light
 reflected from tho faces of the former. A second screen, L,
 is placed between tho eye and the slit, or else the beam of
 light is brought to the latter through a tube or box, as indi
 cated by the dotted lines. Diaphragms m, n are also placed
 in front of the eyepiece to cut off any general light diffused
 from the walls of the enclosing box, which are of course
 carefully blackened.
    It will be readily seen that with this arrangement of appa
ratus, the only light which can reach the eyepiece besides that
which forms the spectral image is that which is diffused by
the reflecting surface of the mirror. If this mirror is pro
perly silvered f the general illumination due to this cause
will be insignificant, and the field of view will be quite as
   * Loc. tit.
   t In order to secure a non-diffusive coat of silver, it is necessary to so
manage the silvering bath that the deposited film is bright as it comes
from the solution and requires no subsequent polishing; for no matter

140                 Mr. F. L. 0. Wadsw.orth on an
dark as in the ordinary form of spectroscope. This con
struction, therefore, overcomes the main objection to the
Littrow form, and enables all the advantages of that form to
be realized, while it also possesses, as I shall proceed to point
out, certain advantages of its own in the way of greater
compactness, better definition, and, finally, greater cheapness
of construction.
    As all parts of the instrument save the concave mirror
are close together, they may all be placed on a small base,
which even for the largest instrument need not be more than
8 or 10 in. in diameter, as there are no heavy rotating or
overhanging parts, as in the other forms of spectroscope.
    The concave mirror itself may then be placed on a sepa
rate stand and connected with the rest of the apparatus when
the instrument is in use, by means of a paper tube or light
wooden frame covered with black cloth. Great focal lengths
may thus be easily employed without increasing the cost or
bulkiness of the instrument, with a corresponding gain in
brightness and in definition. Better definition also results
from the fact that the number of optical surfaces concerned
 is less than in any other form of the same dispersive power.
 Thus in the ordinary Littrow form (one prism) with an
 achromatic lens there are 8 optical surfaces, and the ray
 meets 6 of these twice, making 14 reflexions or refractions
 between the slit and eyepiece. In the ordinary form of
 equivalent dispersion (two-prism) spectroscope there are 12
 surfaces and 12 refractions, while in the concave-mirror form
 there are only 5 surfaces and 8 refractions or reflexions.
 Moreover, there is no change of focus for different parts of
 the spectrum, an advantage of some moment when photo
 graphs are being taken, and although the concave mirror is
 astigmatic when used as here shown, this astigmatism is no
 disadvantage when viewing the image of a slit, and may
 how great care is taken, minute scratches are sure to be made by the
 polishing pad.
     To obtain such a coat it is necessary:— 1st, that great care be taken
 in cleaning the glass surface ; 2nd, that pure chemicals be used for the
  silvering solution; 3rd, that the temperature of the depositing bath
  be the same as that of the mirror, and preferably below 70 degrees in
  order that the deposit may proceed slowly and uniformly. I have
  obtained good results with both the Rochelle-salts process and the
  Brashear process ; but for this purpose prefer the latter, as it gives a
  very hard film which may be vigorously rubbed with a pad of absorbent
  cotton while still wet. The former process, however, is, I think, prefer
  able for " half silvering," »'. e. for obtaining a very even semitransparent
  film.

             Improved Form. of Littrow Spectroscope.                   141
indeed, in some cases, be a real advantage, as pointed out by-
Ames in bis paper on the concave grating *. The amount of
astigmatism is exceedingly small in an instrument of the
dimensions and construction here shown, as the angle between
the incident and reflected ray and the geometrical axis is less
than one degree.
   In the first trial instrument which was constructed after
this plan, the focal length of the mirror was about 175 centim.
and its aperture a little less than 6 centim. The prism was
of white flint of about the same aperture, with a dispersion
of 3J degrees from A to H. Although the apparatus was
mostly made of wood, and the adjustments were in conse
quence rather rough and unsatisfactory, the results obtained
were even better than I had anticipated. The whole spectrum
from the extreme violet to the extreme red was very bright
and clean, with the lines very sharply defined. With an eye
piece having a magnifying-power of 70 and a slit-width of
•01 millim. (at which width the spectrum was almost too
bright for comfort), both the Ni line and the lines at 5892
between the D's could be seen, and the doubles in the tail of
A were clearly distinguishable f.
   The freedom from diffused light may be judged from the
fact that the a and A lines were both clearly seen without the
aid of a colour-screen, while with this the lines below A at
wave-length 8300 could be seen distinctly without taking
any unusual precautions. Better evidence of this point is
afforded by photographs of the lower end of the spectrum,
which have been taken on an ordinary Cramer Isochromatic
plate, whose maximum of sensitiveness lay in the yellowish
green. If any considerable amount of diffused light had been
present the plates would have been hopelessly fogged by it,
as the time of exposure was in some cases nearly an hour.
The linear expansion of the spectrum was so small (4-9 centim.
from A to D) that some of the detail which was present was
masked by reason of the coarseness of the grain of the plate,
and a second mirror having a focal length nearly three times
as great (470 centim.) was therefore substituted.
   * " Concave Grating in Theory and Practice," Phil. Mag. vol. zxvii.
p. 360.
   t If we define the purity of the spectrum by the relation P= -—-— R
(Encyc. Brit. Art. Spectroscopy), where D is the width of the slit, d> the
angular value of the collimator aperture, as viewed from the slit, we have,
in this case, for yellow light P=0'67R, viz. a purity of nearly 70 per
cent, of the theoretical resolving-power of the prism was obtained. With
the longer-focus collimator a purity of nearly 80 per cent, was reached.

  142          Improved Form of Littrow Spectroscope.
     With this new mirror the advantages of this form of in
  strument were still more apparent, and the results obtained
  leave little to be desired. With it photographs of different
  portions of the spectrum, extending from the violet to the
  red, have been obtained, which show an amount of sharpness
  and detail which is, I think, considerably greater than has
 heretofore been obtained with a single prism of the material
 and aperture of the one here used.
    Two other modifications of the form which have suggested
 themselves during the course of these experiments are shown
 in figs. '6 & 4.
    In the first of these the collimator is placed in the position
 occupied by the plane mirror, and the rays pass directly from
 the slit through the prism without collimation. The slit and
 spectral image are therefore situated at the two principal
 conjugate foci of the mirror. In this form, which has been
 given only a preliminary trial, the definition is, as might have
 been expected, decidedly inferior to that in the form of the
 instrument just described. The advantage which this form
 offers is simply its great simplicity and cheapness, the number
 of optical surfaces involved being only 4. In the second
 form (which is not properly a modification of the Littrow
 form at all, as the rays traverse each prism only once) separate
concave mirrors or lenses are used for the collimator and for
 the view-telescope. The arrangement is shown in fig. 4. A
fixed collimating telescope with slit at .? and collimator at a
sends the beam through a prism to a plane mirror m, by
which it is reflected to a second prism p placed by the side
of the first ; after passage through which it falls upon the
objective of the view-telescope T, which is also fixed in posi
tion, at an angle with the first equal to the angle between
the incident and reflected rays on the mirror m. The prism-
table on which the two prisms are mounted is connected with
the arm which carries the mirror m by a minimum-deviation
attachment, as in the previous forms. A little consideration
will show that the central ray in the field of the T will always
remain at minimum deviation as the arm carrying the mirror
m is revolved. This form has not been actually tried, but
would seem to offer certain advantages when it is desirable
for any reason to use separate telescopes for collimating and
observing.

           XIII. Geometrical Interpretation of log JJq.
                  By Alexander Macfarlane.
          To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
      Gentlemen,
   N the notice of Dr. Molenbroek's Anwendung der Qua-
1     ternionen auf der Geometrie, your reviewer says, " It
would probably baffle even a Hamilton to give a geometrical
interpretation of logUy" (Phil. Mag. vol. xxxvii. p. 333).
As this matter has been treated of in several of my papers, I
send you the interpretation required.
   The general quaternion q may be analysed into the pro
duct of a ratio and a versor ; by JJq is meant the versor.
Let a denote the axis of the versor and A its amount in
                                                                n
radians, then \Jq=a.A and log JJq=Aa'; but loga' = a3>
                         IT
therefore logU7 = Aa3. A more correct definition of A is
the ratio of twice the area of the sector to the square of the
initial radius ; for that definition applies also to a hyperbolic
versor.
   The geometrical meaning of the abovo expression will
become evident on considering the more general versor given
by an equiangular spiral. Let a quinion be denoted by q',
and let it be defined to be such that
                                                    w
              log U</=Aa'° = Acos w + Asinw.a^;
                                w
we then find that A sin w . «a is the logarithm of the angle
and A cos w the logarithm of the radius of an equiangular
spiral of axis a and constant angle w, the initial radius being
unity. Thus w is the constant angle between the radius-
vector and the tangent, or rather the difference of the angle
from the initial radius to the tangent and that from the
initial radius to the radius-vector. In the case of the circle
this difference angle is a quadrant: this is the explanation of
the quadrantal versor in log JJq. In the spiral the quantity
A is the magnitude of the complex logarithm, and a* gives
the components of the logarithm. The expansion depends on
the scalar component of the logarithm, while the rotation
depends on the vector component. In the case of the circle,
that is of JJq, the scalar logarithm vanishes.
   For further elucidation of this matter consider a hyperbolic
quaternion. Let p denote such a quaternion ; when the multi-
plier is removed we have JJp = aiA and therefore log Up=iAa>.

144                Dr. John Kerr on a Fundamental
Here A is the ratio of twice the area of the hyperbolic sector
                                            w
to the square of the initial radius, and a» is the constant sum
of the angle from the initial radius to the tangent and that
from the initial radius to the radius-vector. This leads us to
consider the hyperbolic analogue of the equiangular spiral.
Let p' denote the corresponding hyperbolic quinion; then
                                                   w
              log Up'=iA.a"=tA (cosw + sinw.ai).
   Here w denotes the constant sum of the angle between the
initial vector and tho radius-vector and the angle between
the initial vector and the tangent. The scalar term «A cos w
is the logarithm of the radius-vector, while the vector term
               w
t'A sin to . «» is the logarithm of the hyperbolic angle. Here
i is the scalar V — 1 ; in the papers on " The Principles of
Elliptic and Hyperbolic Analysis,' and on " The Definitions of
the Trigonometric Functions," I have shown that a quantity
which is the sum of a scalar independent of i and another
scalar dependent on i is represented along one straight line.

     XIV. On a Fundamental Question in Electro- Optics.
          To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
   Gentlemen,
WILL you kindly afford me space for a few remarks in
          connexion with Professor Quincke's letter, which
appeared in the May number of this Magazine. The object
of that letter was to draw attention to the fact that, in my
paper on Electro-Optics which appeared in the April number,
I made no mention of a paper of Professor Quincke's, pub
lished eleven years ago, which gives an account of experi
ments by him on the same subject and by similar methods. 1
think 1 should preface what I have to say on this matter
with an expression of regret for my forgetfulness.
   I was well aware of the existence of that paper. I received
a copy from the author, and perused it I think immediately
on receipt. With regard to the electro-optic effects there
described, as given by an interference-refractor, it was evident
to me then, as it is now, that they were in their nature and
immediate origin essentially different from those pure double
refractions that are given regularly by the common polari

                   Question in Electro- Optics.                  145
scope and compensator as effects of electrostatic stress. They
were evidently produced by mechanical disturbance of the
dielectric ; and effects of that kind are of no interest in electro-
optics, except as hindrances to exact observation. It may be
easily understood, therefore, that I omitted all reference to
Professor Quincke's experiments in my paper, not from any
positive intention, but hecause they did not occur to me as
contributing in any degree to the solution or illustration of
the question that I had in hand.
   In this connexion 1 may notice an old set of experiments
of my own upon the same question, which did not occur to
me as worth mentioning in my paper, though they had given
a clear and striking exhibition of the double refraction. The
dielectric was carbon disulphide, the electro-optic field was a
very obtuse and very thin prism which extended from end to
end of a large plate-cell, and the light (monochromatic and
unpolarized) entered and left the cell respectively through the
collimator and the telescope of an ordinary spectroscope, the
slit being parallel to the lines of force. As the mechanically
compressed prisms of glass acted in Fresnel's well-known
experiment, so the electrically strained prism of CS2 acted
here. At high potentials the telescope gave two parallel
images of the slit, clearly, though not very widely, separated
 from each other, and polarized in planes parallel and perpen
dicular to the lines of force ; but the mechanical disturbance
of the dielectric rendered this result useless for ray purposo,
as it kept the double image of the slit moving incessantly and
very irregularly, so that no probable inference could be drawn
as to the absolute retardations of the two component rays. I
hope to have something more to say about this method and its
results hereafter.
   There are two statements in Professor Quincke's letter which
require some qualification. The first is, that his methods
were identical with those followed by myself. This applies
truly to the kind of instrumental means employed, and to the
general conception of the arrangements, means and methods
of great delicacy, for which we are indebted to Professor
Jamin, by whom indeed they were put among the common
places of the higher experimental optics. But the method
 described in my paper includes something more : it deals
 with the chief difficulty of the subject by detaching the double
 refraction from the irregular and ever present effects of
 mechanical disturbance : and it brings out in this way the
 fact—clearly enough, perhaps, for a first and imperfect proof—
that electric stress acts exclusively on the (Fresnel's) vibra
 tion which is directed along the line of force.

146                Notices respecting New Books.
    The second statement is that Professor Quincke's results
were different from mine, that he observed sometimes an
increase, sometimes a diminution, of the velocity of light
whose plane of polarization is parallel to the lines of force.
Our results are not really inconsistent. The phenomena were
different because the physical actions examined were different,
perhaps as widely different as conduction and convection in the
somewhat similar experimental question of the conduction of
heat in fluids.                                     j0HN Kerr.

               XV. Notices respecting New Books.
          Electromagnetic Theory. By Olives Heaviside.
      (" The Electrician " Printing and Publishing Company.)
rPHJS work consists largely of definitions and summaries, and it
 -*- may be considered as giving something like a bird's-eye view
of the more theoretical and recondite portions of electromagnetic
science dealt with in Mr. Heaviside's previous, and most valuable,
work, ' Electrical Papers.'
    Omitting a comparatively short introduction, the present work
ma}' be said to contain three long chapters, whose titles are :
" Outline of Electromagnetic Connections," " The Elements of
Vectorial Algebra and Analysis," and " Theory of Plane Electro
magnetic Waves."
    "Within the limits of an ordinary review it would be impossible
to follow Mr. Heaviside in detail in his exposition of the processes
at work in the electromagnetic field, even if my knowledge were
so complete as to enable me to do justice to every portion of the
abstruse and elaborate work for which Mr. Heaviside is so well
known. I must therefore confine my remarks to comparatively
few of the interesting and important questions so ably dealt with
by him ; and it will, no doubt, be better if I select chiefly those
portions of the work in which he appears in opposition, sometimes
rightly and sometimes wrongly (according to my judgment) to
prevailing views.
    A reader of Mr. Heaviside's writings ia at once struck by the
extraordinary style which distinguishes him from every other
English writer on Mathematics or Physics ; and the impression
which is produced by this style is often the reverse of pleasing.
There is a complete absence of the conventionalities which are
generally recognized as proper to the writing of a scientific treatise.
Mr. Heaviside is the Walt Whitman of English Physics ; and,
like the so-called " poet," he is certain to raise aversion to his
peculiarities. A few typical instances must suffice for quotation.
Thus, in p. 142, he pays a well-deserved tribute to printers in the
words " Compositors are very intelligent, read mathematics like

                     Notices respecting New Books.                  147
  ¦winking, and carry out all instructions made by the author."
  Again (p. 203), when defining the potential produced at any point
  of space by a vector, he says, " We may use the same definition
  when it is a vector that has to be potted, or potential ised. Thus,
  if A is the potential of C, then A= pot C=2 C/4*t."             Again
  (p. 352), when discussing the magnetic flux relations, he presents
  us with the ethical maxim, " Different men have different opinions
  —some like apples, some like inions ' ! "We can easily imagine
  the difficulty of some thoroughly zealous and painstaking German
  translator of this work in his attempt to render this scientific
  principle into good German. In vain does he consult his English
  dictionaries for the word " inions " ; until, perhaps, after a week's
 labour, the happy solution occurs to him that " inions " is a mis
 print for " ions," which are, of course, preferred to apples by
 those endowed with electrical tastes,—and then the truth of the
 principle becomes at once obvious.
    It was pleasant to find in a previous work that Mr. Heaviside
 attaches due importance to clearness of expression, and even to
 grammatical accuracy. In a passage in which he severely criticises
 the language of a well-known experimentalist, he very truly says
 " The first step to the understanding of a writer is to find out
 what he means." Now, if lam not mistaken, this passage affords
 a key to Mr. Heaviside's peculiar style, and supplies, to a great
 extent, a justification of it. So far as my own experience of
 English writers is concerned, it is not a great exaggeration to say
 that by far the greater portion of my time is occupied in the work
 of ascertaining the meaning of the author and in overcoming the
 difficulties of ambiguous language. The intrinsic difficulties of the
 subject demand, in general, a comparatively short time. Thus,
 the typical English writer in opening up a mathematical discussion
on (say) an electromagnetic field, in some portions of which there are
 wires conveying electrical currents, there being in other portions
 magnets, dielectrics, conductors, &c., will usually assume the
following shroud of vagueness : " Let v be the velocity, C the cur
rent, E the electromotive force, K the specific inductive capacity,
V the potential, /a the permeability, B the induction, D the dis
 placement, H the magnetic force, L the inductance, T the kinetic
energy, &c., &c." After every one of which we exclaim " Of
what ? " But in vain, the typical author considers that he has
bargained to give us the whole bundle of facts and nothing more.
In the grave and stilted Scientific Treatise, or Solemn Homily,
there must be no touch of imagination to increase the interest of
the reader, nor any digression for the purpose of anticipating a
misunderstanding, however natural.
    It is this characteristic of some of our writers which renders a
treatise on the same subject, and with the same scope, by a French
author such a welcome relief. In the latter we almost invariably
find vagueness, ambiguity, and an illogical order of thought con
spicuously absent ; and very possibly it is this consideration that
has induced Mr. Heaviside to throw over the orthodox style of
                                   L2

  148                Notices respecting New Books.
  writing—though, in so doing, he has occasionally allowed his illus
  trations and his language to fall into an opposite extreme.
     As everyone knows, Mr. Heaviside has advocated many changes
  in scientific nomenclature, and has already succeeded in getting
  some of them adopted. The present volume teems with them ;
  but he does not appear (p. 34) to expect success for a very large
 number.
    It is an unfortunate (perhaps an unavoidable) circumstance that,
  on the appearance of any new branch of science, there is sure to
  be started a system of nomenclature which, with the advance of
  knowledge, is soon perceived to be unscientific and misleading. The
  science of Electricity is far from being an exception to this rule.
 Its most conspicuous term, Electromotive Force, is thoroughly
 misleading ; and this term Mr. Heaviside replaces, very happily,
 by the term " Voltage " (p. 26) ; for, that which is usually called
 the " electromotive force along any path " is, in reality, the line-
 integral of the [tangential compt. of the] electric force-intensity
 from the beginning to the end of that path, and this Mr. Heaviside
 habitually describes as the Voltage along the path. Analogously,
 the same integral for the magnetic force-intensity he calls the
 Gaussage—which, as he takes the trouble to inform us, is " pro
 nounced Goivsage, after Gauss (pronounced Gowee) "—this latter
 to replace the absurd " magnetomotive force." Can we imagine
the typical English author taking so much trouble to set us right ?
 Mr. Heaviside is usually most scrupulously precise and accurate ;
 but, for a moment, he forgets this characteristic when, at the end
 of p. 26, he continues : —" The Voltage or the Gaussage along a line
is the sum of the effective electric or magnetic forces along the line ;
the effective component being merely the tangential component of
the real " [i. e. the resultant] " force." He knows well that the
sum of such quantities (infinite in number, and each of finite mag
nitude) is infinite. The unskilful " practician " should be told
that he is not to take the sum of such components, but the sum
obtained by multiplying each of them by the element of length of
the curve, and then adding these products together. And is there
not a little slip of the same nature at the top of p. 151 (and else
where), where the surface-integral of induction is written 2NB
instead of 2NBdS ?
    With regard to another term in very common use with the
 practicians, viz., " lines of force," Mr. Heaviside is justly severe,
 more particularly in Vol. II. of his ' Papers ' (p. 328), where he
 says " It is quite painful to read of magnetic resistance to lines of
force." The worst of this matter with regard to lines of force is
that a line of force, in the strict Euclidian sense of a line (length
without breadth) is a mathematical reality with which the mathe
maticians cannot dispense, while the unit tube of force is also a
reality, and quite distinct from the line ; so that when the practi
cian talks of the number of lines of magnetic force passing through
a given surface, either he employs the notion of tubes while talking
of lines, or—and this is, perhaps, what generally happens—he is

                    Notices respecting New Boohs.                  149
talking simple mathematical nonsense, and picturing to himself a
charged electric body or a magnetic pole from a fairly large
number (!) of points on whose surface emanate lines, which may
pretty well occupy the space immediately round the body, but
which diverge so much from each other at a short distance from it,
that space is there practically devoid of lines. The surface of the
body, thus conceived, strongly resembles the head of a pepper-caster,
while a much more accurate representation would liken it to the
surface of a golf ball.
   In the same way, another glaring absurdity is visited with just
severity (p. 109),— " The utterly vicious misuse of pressure to in
dicate E.M.F. or voltage, by men who are old enough to know
better, and do."
   Some other terms put forward by Mr. Heaviside do not seem to
be so helpful. For example, the ratio of electric displacement to
electric force at any point of a dielectric he proposes to call the
" permittivity " of the medium, because it indicates " the capacity
tor permitting electric displacement." But a capacity for permit
ting is no more identified with electric displacement than with
magnetic ; and hence there is nothing definitely suggestive in the
word. It can scarcely be doubted that " coefficient of electric
elasticity," as applied to its reciprocal, in accordance with usage in
the general theory of Elasticity, is a better term—and it is, in fact,
explicitly used by Maxwell, vol. i., art. 60 ; but, unfortunately,
Mr. Heaviside expressly rejects this helpful term, which does not
tax the memory, on the ground (see ' Papers,' Vol. II. p. 328) that
" the prefixing of adjectives is just one of those things that we
should try to avoid in a convenient terminology." On the con
trary, I think, when the prefixing of an adjective secures clear and
proper definition, it should be adopted.
   The system of nomenclature is carried somewhat too far. We
do not want a name for every coefficient, and a wholly different
name for its reciprocal ; the list soon becomes too formidable ;
and it is a little amusing to find Mr. Heaviside, after telling us at
p. 21 that c in the equation D=cE is the " permittivity " of the
 medium, telling us at the top of p. 24 that " c is the coefficient of
compliance, or the compliancy "— as if he thought that c still
required a little artistic touching. But " compliance " and " com
 pliancy " fail in helpfulness just as much as " permittance " and
 " permittivity." The truth is that the problem to describe an
 assigned quality of a body in a single, perfectly definite, and appro
priate word no more admits of a solution than does at an arbitrary
 moment in a game of Chess the corresponding problem to play
 and mate in one move.
    Many people will, perhaps, think that in the word "forcive," for
 a system of forces, conciseness is again a little overdone.
    It must be noted as worthy of commendation that Mr. Heaviside
 systematically and in explicit terms always identifies the magnetic
 induction at any point in a medium with a flux or displacement, and
 thereby removes whatever obscurity is contained in Maxwell's

150               Notices respecting New Books.
general use of the term, besides bringing tbe subject more into
line with the theory of strain and stress in general. " So far we
have considered the two forces, electric and magnetic, producing
four fluxes, two involving storage and two waste of energy '^(p. 25),
the existence of one of these fluxes (namely, the magnetic conduction
current) being quite problematical, but nevertheless postulated (as
appears farther on) for the purpose of giving formal completeness
to the cross connexions of electric and magnetic phenomena, and
allowing us to dispense with Maxwell's Vector Potential.
   Thus, in Mr. Heaviside's notation, the systematic, concise, and
fundamental equations of the electromagnetic field are simply the
following :—
       D=cE,       B=/iH,         C=*E,       K=^H,
                    p=divD,          <7=divB,
                   C+D+p2= curl(H-ft0-ft),
                   K+B+(rq=— curl(E-e0— «),
in which p and v at a point are volume-densities of electrification
and " magnetification, q is the vector of velocity at the point if the
medium is moving, K is the magnetic conduction current at the
point, the other quantities being pretty generally recognizable,
while K, g, a are all of doubtful existence (see more particularly
p. 539 of Vol. II. of the ' Papers ').
   With regard to Mr. Heaviside's notation for vectors—viz.,
 Clarendon type—it may be said that its adoption is impossible for
 the simple reason that we cannot use it, or anything like it, in our
manuscript work ; unless, indeed, in addition to pen, ink, and
pencil, we keep beside us a camel's-hair brush with a plate of
iudian ink, and then paint in our vectors when they occur in the
work, after the slow manner of the Chinese. Mr. Heaviside is
conscious of this difficulty, and he suggests (p. 142) that in
manuscript work we should have some distinctive mark for vectors,
such as a suffix ; so that the vector of electric force-intensity
might be written E0. There are two objections to this : firstly in
the case of such a vector, for example, as that of intrinsic electric
force in a medium, for which Mr. Heaviside uses e. (in Clarendon
type) we should be obliged to write eM in MS.—which is intoler
able, as are also B10 <fcc. ; and secondly it is very undesirable to
have our ordinary work (with which we are most concerned, and
to which we become most accustomed) written in one language,
while our books are written in another ; there is a loss of time
generated by the unfamiliarity involved in the process. At the
same time, Clerk Maxwell's terrible German letters are not to be
tolerated for a moment. Perhaps a horizontal bar over the letters
is the best, though this is not good.
   We are now brought to the consideration of certain other pecu
liarities of Mr. Heaviside's work. Maxwell was, apparently, the

                   Notices respecting New Books.                .151
first to give a distinct title to the vector
             .fdw     dv\ ,fdu dw\ -.fdv           du\
                   ~ dz) +J \dl ~ fa) + k\dx ~ dy)'
which is derived from any given vector, ui+vj+wh. In the first
edition of the ' Electricity and Magnetism ' he proposed to call the
first of these the version or curl of the second, and subsequently
the rotation. Mr. Heaviside fixed on the term curl, and by this
name it is now fairly well known. These two related vectors are
of perpetual occurrence in all branches of mathematical physics,
and it is well that their relationship should be directly indicated
and recognized.
   Thus, for example, the condition that a liquid should be capable
of being in equilibrium under the action of any assigned force-
system (" forcive," as Mr. Heaviside would say) is that at each
point in the space occupied by the liquid, the resultant force and
its curl should be at right angles to each other. Hence, if we call
the primary vector p, Mr. Heaviside always denotes the first-
mentioned as " curl p." The intention is sound and good, but the
notation is rather troublesome in the ordinary work of writing,
and somewhat tedious in the midst of equations. At the same
time, the quaternion notation for the curl p, viz. Vvp, seems to
interpose in the mind an operation, v, between p and its curl, and
the strength and closeness of the relationship are consequently
 somewhat impaired. We may, I think, agree with Mr. Heaviside
 in adopting some simple symbol of direct relationship; and I
 would suggest that, for ordinary working purposes, the notation
                                     *
                                     P,
or something closely resembling it, is an improvement on " curl p."
    Again, the divergence of a vector at any point in space—the
amount of the vector, considered as a flux, which, per unit volume,
leaves space at the point, as Mr. Heaviside well puts it (Vol. II. of
' Papers,' p. 531)—is simply
                             du. dv      dw
                             di+d^ + d^'
or— Svpin quaternions; and this Mr. Heaviside always writes
" divp." For the same reason as before (inconvenience in work)
this notation should be improved. Perhaps we may with ad
vantage denote the divergence of p by the notation
   Mr. Heaviside devotes a large portion of the present work to
two fierce attacks—one on the British Association 4ir and the
 other on the Quaternionists.
    To begin with the first—it is, of course, well known that if the
 magnitude of the force exerted between two element-sources

  the normal flux of force-intensity due to any distribution of
  sources, whether forming a continuous " body " or not, taken at
  all points outwards through any closed surface in the field, is 4 x
  times the total " mass " (or quantity of source) contained within
  the surface. "With the above definition of the force between m
 and m', this 4tt will enter into many physical expressions : for
  example, the force between two electric charges in a dielectric of
  " specific inductive capacity " K is -rr-i, and the relation between
                                                        -vr
 displacemement and electric force-intensity is D = t- . E. This 4*
 seldom fails to excite the wrath of Mr. Heaviside. It is easy to see
  that its introduction into certain expressions can be avoided by
 assuming the force between two elements to be
                                 , mm'
                                 * IS-'
                                    T
 where, at first, k is undetermined. With this expression, the
 normal outward or inward flux of force-intensity through any
 closed surface will be 4*k times the contained " mass ; " and if we
 wish to make this flux of force the exact numerical measure of the
 contained mass, we must take 4&k=l, i.e. k=j-, and then the
 force between two elements is
                                  mm
 where the 4* is no longer irritating to Mr. Heaviside, although the
 B. A. authorities (quoted by Mr. Heaviside at p. 118) expressly
 rejected every constant, other than unity, in the expression for
 the force between two elements as " absurd and useless."
     The unit mass, or source, then, in this system is one which acts
 on an equal one (both supposed homogeneous spheres) with a force
 of 4r dynes when their centres are one centimetre apart ; or,
 again, the unit mass may be defined by saying that it is such that
 the flux of its force-intensity (£. e. force per same unit) through
 any closed surface surrounding it is unity. It is, then, on this
characteristic of giving a unit flux of force that Mr. Heaviside
founds the unit of quantity. But, however desirable it is to get rid
of 4b- in the expressions for a large number of physical constants, it
is just as well to point out that from the standpoint of funda
mental principles a flux of force is not a fundamental entity at all,
because it consists of an arithmetical sum of forces which act in all
possible directions in space, and therefore it is not of fundamental
value—unlike the sum of the components of such forces in a single
direction. In fact, the conception of such an indiscriminate sum

                    Notices respecting New Books.                  153
has resulted in the filling of our text-books on Hydrostatics with
almost interminable mathematical problems on that glaring unreality
and source of evil, the whole pressure of a fluid on a curved surface.
Of course a flux of electric force through a closed curved surface
in an isotropic dielectric acquires physical reality by means of the
fact that the " displacement " through the surface at each point is
proportional to the value of the force at the point, and thus the flux
of force is a measure of the total displacement through the surface.
   This is said, however, without any intention of opposing
Mr. Heaviside's proposed definition of a unit mass, or source, but
merely for the purpose of showing that something may be said on
the other side, and that if the 4a- is made to disappear from many
expressions, it is at the expense of its appearance in others which,
under the B. A. system, were free from it. Quite possibly,
Mr. Heaviside's system is, on the whole, the simplest and the
best.
   "With regard to his attitude of hostility towards Quaternions—
and especially towards Professor Tait's treatise—a little more
must be said.
   Maxwell is usually said to have made occasional use of Quatern
ions in his great treatise. It is, however, quite true (so far as my
general recollection goes) that he merely avails himself of the
employment of vectors, and that the only conception involved in
his vectors is that a vector is a mere carrier, translator, or directed
line of definite length in space ; that, in fact, there is nothing of
the rotation or versor nature involved in his vectors. Maxwell,
then, does not use Quaternions at all ; possibly he had no need to
do so ; he employs simply Vector Analysis— Orthodox Vector
Analysis, I shall call it, to indicate that it is in harmony with the
general principles of Quaternions as enunciated by Hamilton.
Now, the signification of a vector has been widened by Hamilton,
without in any way interfering with its vehicular nature, by endow
ing it with the power of commanding a rotatory operation. Every
unit vector is thus also to be looked upon as optionally standing
for the operation of quadrantal rotation in planes perpendicular to
the direction of the vector, if we desire so to employ it. Mr. Heavi-
side never desires to employ it in this way ; he finds it unnecessary
to do so in Electromagnetism. Hence he will have nothing what
ever to do with the versor property in the vector. " Once a
vector, always a vector" (p. 301). His vector is like the heir to a
title, or to a large property, who repudiates his hereditary advan
tage and insists on adopting poverty. Probably he would say that
it is rather to be likened to a man born with an ugly tumour who
insists on having it cut off. But " different men have different
opinions, &c." according to his own previously quoted maxim.
   Now, in the Hamiltonian system, if i is any unit vector, i3= — 1 ;
if a is any vector of length a, a?=—a!' ; and if a and (i are any
two vectors of lengths a, b, including an angle 6, Sa/3=— ab cos0.
The minus sign in these results is gall and wormwood to the
anli-quaternionists. Of course there is nothing at all strange in

154               Notices respecting New Boohs.
the equation i"= — 1 if we read ifc " i repeated equals — 1," t. «.,
equals complete reversal ; if we read it " i squared = — 1," our early
algebraic feelings are shocked—Mr. Heaviside is amazed at it
(p. 303) !
   Hence with the anti-quaternionist Sa/3=+a6cos0. Again,
with Hamilton the vector of the product a/3, i. «. Vafi, follows at
once naturally as a vector perpendicular to the plane of a and /3,
of length abshiO, because a/3=-vrj> which is the operation of
converting /3_1 into a. Now this is done by rotation round the
perpendicular to their plane ; and as a vector stands for rotation—so
that em signifies rotation through to right angles round the line
coinciding with the unit vector e—it is clear that Va/3 is perpen
dicular to both a and /3, and in a definite sense. With the anti-
quaternionists Vat/3 does not follow naturally at all ; it is perfectly
arbitrary— provided, of course, that there is something at once
definite and consistent in its representation. It might, for
                                                        a
example, be very well defined as being of length r tan 0, and as
lying in the plane of the bisector of 0 and the perpendicular to the
plane of a and /3, and inclined at (say) 0 to this perpendicular.
However, the anti-quaternionists agree to make Va/3 exactly what
Hamilton made it, and we need not stop to inquire whether any
adequate reasons for this can be found from their point of view.
   Hence, then, results Mr. Heaviside's system of Vector Analysis,
which we may call Heretical Vector Analysis, without necessarily
implying any censure, since what is orthodox is sometimes false
and bad, and what is heretical true and good.
   It is not very easy to discover whether Mr. Heaviside's opposi
tion to Quaternions is absolute or not ; that is, whether he thinks
that the subject is one which may be studied as a branch of pure
mathematics by advanced speculators, but postponed to the study
of Vector Analysis. If, on the one hand, he thinks that the
Hamiltonian Bystem (involving the versor property of vectors, &c.)
is not worthy of study, the quaternionists might, perhaps, show
what the system has achieved or is capable of achieving ; but even
this is not incumbent on them, for they may justify the study
simply for its value as a mental exercise—as other branches of pure
mathematics are accepted. The problem of disentangling the
quaternion q from the equation q*+aq + b=0, where a and 6 are
given quaternions, is a perfectly legitimate exercise of thought,
even though it has no application to telephony or to dynamo
machines. The utility of associating the versor property with
vectors is illustrated in a striking way in a fundamental case by
Hamilton (' Elements of Quaternions,' p. 370) thus : — If a, /3, y are
the vectors from the centre of a sphere of unit radius to any three
points, A, B, C, on its surface, and if, in addition, these last
denote the magnitudes of the angles of the spherical triangle, we
have (with the versor meanings attached to a, /3, y) the equation

                       y        /3         =«
which, as Hamilton observes, contains at a glance the whole
doctrine of spherical triangles. But if, on the other hand, we are
to understand that the study of Quaternions is to be merely post
poned, then Heretical Vector Analysis will not serve as an
introduction. No system which makes i2= + 1 and S*/3= -f ab cos tt
can possibly serve as a preliminary to Quaternions ; and as there
is nothing intrinsically base in the sign Minus, or in the notation
for a scalar, the reason for replacing Orthodox by Heretical Vector
Analysis disappears.
   Among the changes of quaternionic notation made by Mr. Heavi-
side we may further notice that he proposes (p. 157) to denote
the tensor of the vector of a/3, i. e. TVa/3, by the symbol V„a/3,
which surely is quite inappropriate and incapable of adoption.
   Again, he says (p. 135) " no amount of familiarity will make
Quaternions an easy subject." True—and necessarily true, more
over, when we consider the wideness of the field of thought in
which Quaternions work. But neither is it all child's play in
Heretical Vector Analysis. The expression a/3 is no more the
same as /3a in this department than in Quaternions, and the same
careful picking of steps is necessary in both.
   Most students of Professor Tait's treatise on Quaternions will,
I think, be satisfied that Mr. Heaviside's criticisms on this work
are not well founded. " After muddling my way somehow through
the lamentable quaternionic Chapter II., the third chapter was
tolerably easy" (p. 174). Farther on (p. 289) the objection
becomes more definite : " There is the fundamental Chapter II.
wherein the rules for the multiplication of vectors are made to
depend upon the difficult mathematics of spherical conies, com
bined with versors, quaternions, and metaphysics." This language
is surely a little loose and unjust. One article in Tait's Chapter
II., marked with a star to indicate its postponement, and there
fore unessential character for the reader, proves the simple
property of spherical conies involved. Moreover, to be accurate,
it is not the multiplication of vectors that is dealt with here, but
the multiplication, &c, of quaternions in general. There is a good
deal of difficult mathematics associated with spherical conies, as
any reader of Salmon's ' Geometry of Three Dimensions ' will see ;
 but not one particle of it is involved in this short Article of Tait's

156                 Notices respecting New Books.
book : the sum total of the mathematics employed is contained in
the text of the two propositions of the third book of Euclid which
assert that if any line drawn through a point O meet a circle in P
and Q, the rectangle OP . OQ is constant, and that the sum of a
pair of opposite angles in a quadrilateral inscribable in a circle is
two right angles.
   Mr. Heaviside concludes his third chapter with a discussion of
a linear operator in general (p. 283), and the means of inverting
it, together with a deduction of Hamilton's cubic. The linear
operator is treated all through by Mr. Heaviside exactly as it
appears in the general theory of strain and stress—namely, as
consisting of coefficients expressing the relations between the three
components of one vector and those of another, these coefficients
being, in general, nine, as when the components of strain in a
solid are expressed in terms of direction ; but sometimes reducing
to six, as when components of stress are expressed in terms of
direction.
   Mr. Heaviside's mode of treatment will be found to be a valuable
side-light to the discussion of the linear vector function in Tait's
treatise. Of course, the rather high-sounding phrase " inversion of
a linear operator " denotes nothing more than the solution of
three homely simple equations ; nevertheless, there are some neat
relations involved.
   This review has already gone much beyond the usual limits, and,
in confining itself chiefly to controversial matters, has omitted to
notice the most valuable portion of Mr. Heaviside's work, the
greater part of which appears in the last chapter. This part of
the work has recently been treated, with great commendation, by
Professor Fitzgerald in ' The Electrician.' All readers of this
volume will agree in regarding it as an able work, and, indeed,
one which is of immense assistance to advanced students in
Physics.
   One final instance of Mr. Heaviside's regard for accuracy and
desire for scientific completeness must be mentioned. It is found
in Art. 192, in which he justly objects to the equation by which
Maxwell expresses the relation between magnetic induction,
magnetic force, and magnetization at any point of a medium, viz.,
B=H + 4wI. To this Mr. Heaviside objects that it makes induc
tion and magnetization identical in kind with magnetic force, which,
as he says, " is more than mischievous in theory." His own form
of the equation, B=/i0(l + A.-)F, where F is the magnetic force, is
in all respects much better.

 ON THE DEPENDENCE OF THE PHOTOELECTRIC CURRENT ON THE
    POSITION OF THE PLANE OF POLARIZATION OF THE EXCITING
     LIGHT IN REFERENCE TO THE SURFACE OF THE KATHODE.
     BY DR. J. ELSTER AND H. GEITEL.
 "1 T is possible in many cases to lower the potential required for
 -*- the spontaneous discharge of an electric current in a gas by ex
 posing the kathode to the action of light. For the same difference
of potential the strength of the current depends on the nature of
 the kathode, the gas, and the light. While kathodes of platinum,
 mercury, copper, and several other metals require irradiation with
 ultra-violet light of high intensity, kathodes of sodium, potassium,
 rubidium, in an atmosphere of hydrogen of about 0'3 millim.
 pressure, give currents which can be measured galvanometrically,
 even with feeble light within the region of the visible rays.
    The question may be asked whether this action of light on the
 electrical discharge depends on the orientation of the vibrations
 with respect to the surface of the electrode struck.
    Experiments with polarized ultra-violet light of sufficient in
tensity arc difficult to make because it is absorbed by the ordinary
 polarizing arrangements, such as Nicol's prism, tourmaline plates,
 glass disks, &c., so that only polarization by reflexion remains ;
even with this method, however, great losses of light are un
 avoidable. Thus in an analogous phenomenon, the development
 of electrical sparks by ultra-violet light discovered by Hertz,
 M. Wauka did not succeed in establishing the influence of the
 direction of vibration of the light, which he had supposed to exist.
    This difficulty disappears with kathodes of the alkaline metals,
 since we can here work with ordinary polarized light ; but another
difficulty presents itself, that a polished and, if possible, a plane
 surface of these substances must be produced in a vacuum. This
requirement is, however, satisfied by using as kathode the alloy of
potassium and sodium, which is liquid at ordinary temperatures.
\Vhen placed in a roomy receiver a sufficient quantity sets plane
and horizontal in the central part of the surface.
    We have investigated the photoelectric action of polarized light
as follows.
    In the circuit of a voltaic battery of about 250 volts are a sensitive
galvanometer, a commutator, and a sensitive cell of the liquid
potassium and sodium alloy of the form shown in Wiedemann's
Annalen, vol. xlii. p. 5(J4, so inserted that the negative-pole
wire leads to the surface of the alkali metal. In order that the
active luminous pencil should have a constant section, the cell was
coated with opaque varnish, with the exception of a small circle of
15 millim. diameter turned towards the source of light. The cell
is so arranged that the rays entering this aperture centrally and
parallel Rtrike the centre of the metal surface under an angle of
about 65°. Between the source of light and the cell a lens was
introduced for the production of parallel light as well as a pola
rizing arrangement (a Nicol's prism or a set of glass plates).

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             159
    If the polarizing apparatus is turned while at the same time the
strength of the current is measured at the galvanometer, two
maxima and two minima are observed in the course of a single rota
tion. The minima occur when the plane of polarization of the light
is parallel to the plane of incidence of the rays on the kathode ; the
maxima are in positions at an angle of 90° with them. The ratio
of maxima to minima is about 10 : 1. If while the plane of
polarization is parallel to the plane of incidence, a quartz plate
about 2 millim. thick, cut at right angles to the optical axis, is
placed in the path of the polarized light, the current increases
about sevenfold, corresponding with the rotation of the plane of
polarization due to the quartz. When the plane of polarization is
at right angles to the plane of incidence, a quartz plate has tbe
opposite effect ; the strength of the current diminishes, as was to
be expected, in a corresponding ratio. Apart from a slight en-
 feeblement of the current due to the loss of light caused by its
 interposition, a clear glass plate has no effect in either position.
     According to the investigations of MM. Trouton ('.Nature,'
 vol. xxxix. p. 393), Klemencic (Wiedemann's Annaien, vol. xlv.
 p. 77), and llighi (Rend, delta B. Ac. dei Lincei, vol. xi. p. 161) it
 must be taken for granted that, in Hertz's rays of electrical force,
 the plane of polarization is at right angles to the direction of the
 electrical displacement. If the motion in the light rays is re
 garded as analogous, the result of the experiments described would
 be thus expressed.
     The luminous electrical current attains its maximum when the
 electrical displacements in the luminous ray take place in the
 plane of incidence, its minimum when they are at right angles
 thereto. In the former case the electrical vibrations contain a com
 ponent normal to the kathode, but not in the second. We might
 be tempted to seek in these changes of potential normal to the
 kathode, and induced by the electrical rays, the force which impels
 the negative electricity to leave the kathode. Whether this sug
 gestion is correct, can perhaps be ascertained by further experi
 ments on the dependence of the luminous electrical action on the
 angle of incidence of the polarized light, and their connexion with
 the quantities of light reflected from and retained by the kathode.—

            ON VORTEX MOTIONS IN AIR.        BY G. QUINCKE.
     At the meeting of the Natural History and Medical Society of
 Feb. 7, 1890, I discussed the motion of falling spheroids of oil
 in water, the specific gravity of which was increased somewhat
 by the addition of chloroform. Such a spheroid falls vertically
 in water at rest. But if two spheroids of oil fall simultane
 ously close to each other, they approach and recede from each
 other in falling. The path and the time of fall depend on the dis
 tance apart and the velocity of the falling spheroids. This peculiar
 motion is caused by the vortices which are produced by the
  falling spheroids of oil in the water about them* which had hitherto

 160            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 been at rest. The particles of water in the plane of symmetry
between the falling spheroids remain at rest.
   Instead of two spheres, one may be allowed to fall near a plane
vertical wall, which then acts as plane of symmetry. The spheroid
falls as it were with its image in the plane vertical wall, and
approaches and recedes from this.
   These experiments with heavy oil spheroids in water are tedious,
and can only be shown to a small audience.
   Analogous phenomena may be produced before a larger circle of
hearers by allowing two soap bubbles filled with coal-gas to ascend
near each other, or a single bubble near a vertical wall.
   In ascending, the distance of the two soap bubbles from each
other, or of a single one from its image in the vertical wall, is first
smaller and then greater, and the cause again is the vortex move
ments in the air due to the ascending soap bubbles.
   In order to fill two soap bubbles simultaneously with coal-gas
they are produced at the ends of a T-piece of glass, blown out
in the form of horizontal cups, to which the gas passes from the
centre tube through a T-shaped perforated glass stopper.
   Similar phenomena occur when small dust particles fall in air or
liquid at rest, or if a current of air or liquid strikes against
particles of dust at rest. The motion of the small particles is
influenced by the presence and form of the solid wall in the
vicinity.—Wiedemann's Annalen, July 1894.
ON A NEW APPARATUS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF HIGH PRESSURE.
                     BY PROF. S. W. STRATTON*.
   Not long since, while designing a piece
of apparatus for the production of high
pressure, it occurred to me that many of
the difficulties encountered in the measure
                                                                 ]
ment of such pressures might be avoided by
the employment of several short mercury-
columns connected in series by means of a
less dense liquid, as Bhown in the accom
panying sketch.
   Such a gauge would possess all the advan
tages of the ordinary mercury-column, and
be within the limits of space to be had in the
laboratory. For many purposes the last tube
only need be made of glass, and the scale
reduced accordingly.
   Thinking that this principle may be new,
and of value to some who are employing
high pressures in the laboratory, it is sub
mitted for publication.

§ 1. rpHE equilibrium of an isotropic sphere or spherical
       J- shell under uniform surface-pressure is one of the
oldest problems satisfactorily treated in elastic solids. It is
necessary, however, to consider it briefly here, as preliminary
to the main object of this paper, which treats from a physical
standpoint of a sphere or a spherical shell composed of several
concentric layers of different isotropic materials. This latter
problem is not altogether new mathematically f, but the points
to which attention is principally directed here have not, I
believe, been previously considered.
   The displacement u is at every point along the radius
vector r from the centre. The principal strains arc
                      -T- = s along the radius,

to r. Here k and n denote respectively the bulk modulus and
the rigidity.
   We shall in general find it convenient to consider instead
of rr the radial pressure ( — rr).
   For brevity a shell whose inner and outer surfaces are of
radii b and a, and whose elastic constants are k and n, will be
represented by (b . a . a) , where a. is adopted as representing
elastic quality. A solid sphere of radius a will be repre
sented by (0 . a . a) . When there is only one material the shell
will be termed simple, as opposed to compound when there are
two or more materials.
   § 2. In a simple shell (e. a. a) exposed to uniform pressures,
p over the inner and p' over the outer surface, the following
results are easily found :—

increase in radius when exposed to longitudinal traction, and
I am not aware that such a striking phenomenon has yet been
observed in an isotropic material.

dilatation, and the stresses for pressure over one only of the

and p'. The expressions for s &c. being linear in p and p',
the above table shows at once the signs of Ss/Sp &c. when
one only of the surface-pressures is altered.
    The two most important quantities are probably A and
( —rr). The value of A is constant, the volume expanding
uniformly under pressure at the inner surface, and contracting
uniformly under pressure at the outer surface. The radial
stress is always a pressure.

 164           Mr. C. Chree on the Local Alteration of
 the pressure is applied, the falling off in the radial pressure
 over a concentric spherical surface varies directly as the
 volume between the surface considered and that where the
 pressure is applied, and inversely as the volume within the
 surface considered. Of two equal volumes of the material,
 that nearer the centre is the more effective in reducing the
 radial pressure.
      Linear Relation between three Stresses or three Strains.
    § 3. It is hardly necessary to point out that if (e.a.a),
 instead of being a simple shell, were a layer of a compound
 shell, the results (4)-(10) would still apply to it, i£p and p'
 were taken equal to the pressures exerted on its inner and
 outer surfaces respectively by the material of the adjacent
 layers.
    Suppose, now, that in a simple shell, or in a single layer of
 a compound shell, we take any three concentric; spherical
 surfaces of radii ru rs, r3. Let us denote the volumes they
 contain, viz. f ^r/ &c., by Ylt Va, V3, and the radial pressures
 over their surfaces by pt, pt, p3 respectively. By means of
 (7) we easily find a linear relation between the three pres
 sures. This may be written in various equivalent forms, of
 which the most elegant is perhaps
     p{%-y-)+4k-T)+Pi(%-T)=0- • (12)
    Relations of exactly the same form hold between the values
of 86, or those of any the same strain, over the three surfaces.
 If >i, s3, *s, for instance, bo the values of s, or — f over the
 three surfaces we have
    If, then, we know the values of any strain or stress at any
two radial distances in a simple shell, we have at once its
 value at any other radial distance. The above results (12)
 and (13) apply equally to a solid sphere or to any single
 layer of a compound shell. They bear a distant family
 resemblance to the well-known '' theorem of the three mo
 ments " * in beams, usually associated with the name of
Clapeyron.

                   Three-layer Compound Shell.
     § 4. We now proceed to consider the effects arising from the
 application of the pressures p and p' over the inner and outer
 surfaces of the three-layer compound shell (e .a . e . «i . b . a . a).
 In this a layer (c .ax.b) of material ki, n± is intercalated
 between the layers (e . a . c) and (b . a . a) both composed of
 material k, n.
     The strains and stresses that would exist if the shell were
 all of the material k, n are given by (4)-(8). Our principal
 object is to find the additions made to the strains and stresses
 in (e.a.c) and (b . a . a) in consequence of the existence of
 the layer (c.a^.b), which we shall generally denote the
 " altered layer." To do this we have only to find the incre
 ments 8pi and Spc to the pressures pt, pe at the surfaces r=b
 and r=c of the altered layer. The changes in the strain and
 stress in (b.a.a) arise solely from the action of the pressure
 Spi over r=b, while the changes in the strain and stress in
 (e.a.c) arise solely from the action of the pressure h~pe over
 r=c. When Spt and Bpe are known, the corresponding
 strains and stresses may be written down at once from
 (4)-(8).
    The values of Spt, and Spe are easily found as follows:—The
 shell (b.a.a) is in equilibrium under the pressures pi, + Sp» and
 »' over its inner and outer surfaces, while the shell (c . al . b) is
 in equilibrium under the pressures pe + Spc and p^ + Spt over
 its inner and outer surfaces. We thus know by (5) the
 values of the strain «' in the two layers in terms of these
 pressures. But s'=u/r, and u is necessarily continuous at
 the common surface r=b of the two media ; thus we have
 y continuous, whence
    Similarly from the continuity of s' at r=c we find

   The existence of the common factor hpc 8_ 3 will be

    We shall consider the phenomena relating to the pressures
p and p' separately. By reference to Table I. we know the
signs of the strains and stresses in the simple shell (e.a. a),
and when the signs of Bpt and Spe are determined from (16)
and (17) we know the signs of the increments to the strains
and stresses in (b .a. a) and (e.a. c).
    § 5. If first pressure be applied over the inner surface only,
or p' be zero, the signs of Spi, and Bpc are shown in the
following Table II. for the cases most likely to arise in
practice.

cable to lay down concise general rules for what happens
when nl— n and ki — k have opposite signs, but the results in
any specified case may be derived of course from (16) and
(17).

     From Tables II. and III. we see that if nt—n and kt — k
be both positive, or if one be positive and the other zero,
 bpi, is negative and Sp„ positive when p only exists ; whereas
Bpi, is positive and ope negativo when p' only exists. This
signifies that if pressure be applied at either surface of a shell
the intercalation of a layer of greater k, n raises the radial
pressure at the surface of the layer nearest to the surface
where the pressure is applied, and lowers it at the other. In
other words, as we retire from the surface of the shell where
the pressure is applied the radial pressure falls more slowly—
 i. e. has a less steep gradient—throughout the material on
both sides of the layer of greater k, n than previous to the
 alteration of the layer, and makes up for this by an accelerated
 rate of falling throughout the layer itself.
     The phenomena when one of the two w,— » and A,— k is
negative and the other zero are exactly opposite to the above,
and the same is also in general true when nx—n and A,— A
are both negative ; but in the latter event an exception may
arise when e/c and b/a are both very small, especially when
the altered layer differs considerably from the remainder.
                         Effects on Dilatation.
     § 6. The effect on the dilatation due to the existence of the
 altored layer claims special attention. When n,— n and kt—k
 are both positive, or one positive and the other zero, we see,
 by reference to equations (21) and (27), and to Tables II.
 and III., that 5A is negative in both (b . a . a) and (e.a.c)
 when p only exists, and is positive in both when p' only exists.
 Thus it follows by (6) that 8A is opposite in sign to A in both
  (b . a . a) and (e.a.c). In other words, the presence of the
 layer of greater k, n reduces numerically* the dilatation—
    * To avoid complexity the statement in the text is limited to suit the
general case where the changes Sa are not large enough to cause a re
versal of sign in the dilatation. Such a reversal occurs, however, in one

       Isotropic Spheres wider Uniform Surface-Pressure.             169
whether expansion following internal pressure p, or contrac
tion following external pressure p'—throughout the unaltered
material both outside and inside of it.
   The exact opposite holds if ni— n and kl — k be one negative
the other zero, or if both be negative, a possible exception
arising in the latter case when ejc and bja are both very-
small.
    Whilst the changes of the dilatation in (b . a . a) and (e .a.c)
due to the existence of the altered layer agree in general
qualitatively, they usually differ quantitatively.
    For if A0 + 8A refer to {e . a . c) and (A0 + 6A2) to (b . a . a)
—the dilatation in the simple shell (e.a.a) under the same
pressures being A0—we easily find
8A8-gA = 3^n-^[/>{A1(3A + 4«)-4n(A1-A)^-3}
               -p-fcxZk + ^+Mk-k)^}].                            .   (31)
    Thus in general there is a difference between the dilata
tions in (b .a . a) and (e . a . c) which increases with the
volume of the altered layer, and is more conspicuous the
closer this layer to the inner surface of the compound shell.
    If                            w, = n,
then                            SA3=SA.
Thus if the altered layer retain the same rigidity as the rest
the dilatations in (b . a . a) and (e . * . c) remain equal, however
much the altered layer may differ from the rest in compres
sibility.
    The coefficient of p in (31) is easily shown to be essentially
 positive, and that of p is obviously so. Thus when n1 — n
is positive, and kt — k is positive or zero, SA2 — SA has the
 same sign as p when p' is zero, and the opposite sign to p'
 when p is zero.
    Now when p only exists A0 is positive, and 8A2 and 8A
are both negative when «i— n is positivo and kx—k is positive
 or zero. It follows that under these circumstances the
presence of the altered layer is more effective in reducing the
dilatation in (e .a.c) than in reducing that of (b . a. . a).
exceptional case when p only exists, viz. when the intercalated layer is of
 exceptionally large rigidity and lies close to the inner surface of the
shell, while a/b is large. The expansion naturally accompanying pres
 sure on the inner surface may then he converted into an absolute con
 traction throughout the thin inner layer (e . a . c).

170             Mr. C. Chree on the. Local Alteration of
    Again, when p only exists A0 is negative, and 8A2 and
8A are positive when n±— n is positive and kt — k is positive
or zero ; thus the presence of the altered layer reduces the
contraction in (e .a . c) more than that in (b . a. . a).
    Thus, whether there be pressure on the outer surface alone
or the inner surface alone, the presence of the layer (b . ax . c),
in which the rigidity exceeds and the bulk modulus equals or
exceeds that of the remainder, has a greater effect on the
density of the contained layer (e .a. .c) than on that of the
surrounding layer (ft . a . a).
    It is equally easy to show that the density of (« . a . c) is in
general more affected by the existence of the altered layer
 than is that of (b.a.a) when nY — n is negative, with a
possible exception in the case of pressure on the outer
surface when kt—k is also negative and e/c is very small.
    § 7. The general effect of the existence of the altered layer
is, as we have seen, to diminish or to increase the effects of
surface-pressure in changing the density of the unaltered
material according as the elastic constants of the altered layer
are greater or less than those of the unaltered material.
    The converse question naturally presents itself, viz., how
the change of density of the altered layer compares with
that in the simple shell (e . a, . a), all of the same material as
the layer, exposed to the surface-pressures p and p'.
    If we regard the dilatation as At in (e.al.a), and as
A, +SAX in (c.a^.b) when there is the compound shell
 (e . a . c . «i . b . a. a), we easily find from what precedes * that

       The coefficients of kx — k and of n^ — n inside the square
   brackets in the coefficients of both p and p' may be shown to
   be essentially positive.
       Having regard to the signs of A, in the several cases we
   at once obtain the result that when nx — n and k-^ — k are both
   positive, or one positive and the other zero, the layer (c . «i . b)
   suffers more alteration of density in consequence of the
   application of p or p' than if the whole shell were of material

   constants than the remainder it suffers more alteration in its
   density than if the entire shell consisted of the same material
   as the layer.

   tudes of {ki — k)/k and (ni — n)/n, provided these be neither

       The case when the material is nominally the same through
   out, but the elastic constants vary slightly with r, seems not
   unlikely to be of frequent occurrence in practice. The law
   of variation of the elastic constants in such a case is probably
   in general a continuous function of r, still the variation may
   not infrequently be practically restricted to a thin layer. It
   thus seems worth while glancing briefly at the special case
   when («! — n)/n and (A^ — k)/k are so small that terms con
   taining their squares or product may be neglected. In this

   Referring to equations (19) to (24) and (25) to (30) we
see this implies that the influence of the altered layer on the
strains and stresses of the remainder depends only on the
volume and not at all on the position of the layer.
   In the coefficient of {kx—k)\k in both (34) and (35) p'
occurs multiplied by a3 and p occurs multiplied by e3. Thus
a layer differing slightly from the rest only in compressibility
has a greater effect on the strains and stresses arising from a
pressure over the outer surface than on those arising from a
pressure over the inner surface of the compound shell.
   If in (34) and (35)

   Referring to equations (19) to (24) and (25) to (30) we
see that the effect of the layer of altered rigidity, 'when its
volume is given, is greater the nearer it is to the centre.
   The layer in this case, however, is as effective in modifying
the strains and stresses arising from internal pressure as those
arising from external pressure.

The value of hpc and the corresponding increments (25) to
 (30) obtained for (e.a.c.a^ .a), as explained above, would
give the effects of a similar alteration at the outer surface.

the fact that a change of rigidity is much more effective at

                           Solid Sphere.
   § 11. The results for a solid sphere under uniform surface-
pressure may easily be derived from those for a shell.
   In a simple sphere (0 . a . a) , under surface-pressure p', the
displacement is deduced from (5) by taking e zero, and the
strains and stresses are thence easily written down. We
thus get :—
                          -lj=:                               (43)

   These results may also be derived from the corresponding
strains and stresses in the shell (e . a . a), by omitting all
terms multiplied by e, even though a power of r occurs in the
denominator. Perhaps an even simpler method of reduction
consists in supposing p=p'.
   For the compound sphere (0 . a . e . a, . b . a . a) we may, as
in the case of the compound shell, proceed in either of two
ways. We may start with the results for the simple sphere
(0 . a . a) and find the increments in the displacements, strains,

 176           Mr. C. Chree on the Local Alteration of
The value of S in the compound sphere is thus of special
 interest. For it we easily find :—
    in (0 . a . c),

    Since S varies as b* — c* in (b.a.a), it follows that the
stress-difference will there remain small so long as the altered
layer is of small volume until p' becomes very large.
    In (c . ccl . b) , however, S depends on the volume of the
altered layer only in so far as that enters into II', and is thus
of importance, however thin the layer may be, provided it
differ considerably from the rest in compressibility.
    It is hardly necessary to point out the loophole this affords
to supporters of the stress-difference theory * of rupture, if
experiment should seem to decide against them.

 of which is included within the volume where the redistri
 bution has occurred. A particular deduction is that the
 increment of radius of a solid sphere, or of either surface of a
 shell, is unaffected by any redistribution in layers which

greater effect the nearer the altered volume to the centre.
We have already come across this phenomenon in § 8.

In a simple shell (e . a . a) it is otherwise : there is in general

which elements lengthen from those along which they shorten.
This cone has the diameter through the point considered for

     Now rr and u/r are continuous at a common surface of two

    This relation connecting 0 and 0' depends solely on the
 material of the layers, and not at all on the radius of their
 common surface. It should, however, be noticed that if a
 layer of material k', n' were intercalated between two layers
 of material k, n, the values of cos & at its two surfaces would
 differ, so that 0 has different values at the inner surface of
 the outer layer of material k, n and at the outer surface of the

    § 14. In conclusion, I would call attention to a simple and
 concise relation between the changes of volume or the dilata
 tions of the layers composing a compound shell or solid sphere
exposed to uniform pressure.
    If k be the bulk modulus of a volume v of an isotropic
 material exposed to surface-forces whose components at the
point a;,y, z on the element dS of surface are F, Q, H per
unit of surface, then the increment of the total volume, Sv,
due to the action of these forces, is given by

clearly vanish. Thus, summing the equations like (67) for
the several layers, nothing remains on the right-hand side but

   The relation we have established is of course insufficient
by itself to determine the dilatation in any one layer of a
compound shell or sphere, but it at least supplies a very
simple check on the accuracy of results otherwise determined.
For the three-layer shell (e . a . c . cty . b . a . a) it gives, de
noting the dilatations in (e.a.c), (c . ux . b), and (J) .a., a) by

dilatation supplied by (38), (39), and (40) for the three
layors.

    The principal results arrived at for the application of
 uniform surface-pressure are as follows : —

    (1) In any simple sphere or spherical shell, or in any one
 layer of a compound sphere or shell, there is a simple linear
 relation, independent of the elastic constants of the material,
 between the values of any the same stress or strain over any
 three concentric spherical surfaces.

    For the effects of altering a spherical layer so as to
 increase one or both of its elastic constants (the effects of
 diminishing one or both constants, generally speaking, being
 the exact opposite) :—

    (2) The radial-pressure gradient falls off in steepness both
  nside and outside the altered layer, making up for this by
  ncreased steepness in the layer itself.
    (3) The change of volume—whether expansion following
  nternal pressure, or contraction following external pressure
 —is reduced in the material both inside and outside the
 altered layer.
    (4) The altered layer itself suffers greater change of volume
than if the entire sphere or shell were composed of the same
material as the layer.
    (5) The alteration of compressibility only throughout a
 layer of given volume is equally effective for all positions of
the layer, but the alteration of rigidity only is more effective
 the nearer the altered layer to the centre.
    (6) The stress-difference vanishes at every point of a simple
 solid sphere ; but, if the compressibility of a layer be altered,
 the stress-difference attains a finite value both outside the
 layer and in the material of the layer itself, becoming of
 importance in the layer itself however thin that may be.

                         By John Trowbridge*.
                                [Plate VII.]
THE solution of the differential equations which express
        the distribution of electricity on conductors of various
forms and varying magnetic permeability is not always
simple ; and many assumptions have been made in regard to
the constants which enter these equations. Thus Poincare" t
assumes that the spark of a vibrator is dampened more
readily than that of the oscillator. This has been shown
independently by Bjerknes to be true when the oscillating
circuit is not closed by a spark-gap f . Stefan §, by making
the assumption that the oscillations are confined to the outer
layer of the conductor, reduced his differential equation to
the form treated by Lord Kelvin, in periodic heat move
ments. Analysis leads him to suppose that the formula
t = 2v \fL C applies only to a special case; and he gives a
more general law.

  of the subject should be more developed in order to decide, if
  possible, upon the truth of the various assumptions that have
 been made, I have continued my studies on the oscillations of
  electricity with the aid of more powerful methods of studying
  periodic currents than I had hitherto used. In a paper on
 the oscillations of lightning discharges*, I expressed the
 opinion that the method first employed by Spottiswoode, of
 exciting a Euhmkorff coil or transformer by means of an
 alternating-current dynamo, put in the hands of an experi
 menter a far more powerful method of studying electrical
 oscillations than the old method of charging Leyden jars by
 means of an electric machine, or by the use of a Euhmkorff
 coil with a battery. I have, therefore, in this investigation,
 employed an alternating machine capable of giving 120 volts
 and a current of from 15 to 25 amperes, and have employed
 suitable transformers to obtain the necessary difference of
 potential to produce the sparks which I wished to study.
    Generally I have employed one primary or exciting circuit
 between two entirely separate and disconnected resonating or
secondary circuits. The image of the three sparks thus pro
 duced could then be compared upon the same plate.
    Before entering into a more detailed account of the appa
ratus I employed, I will state the most striking results which
I have obtained. A unidirectional spark (non-oscillatory)
always excites an oscillatory discharge in a secondary circuit
if the self-induction, capacity, and resistance of this secondary
circuit permit an oscillatory movement. It is therefore not
necessary that the spark in a primary circuit should be an
oscillating one in order to excite oscillations in a neighbouring
conductor. In this respect two electrical circuits are not in
close analogy with two tuning-forks. It is difficult by a uni
directional movement of the prongs of one tuning-fork to
excite the vibrations of another fork which is not in tune with
the first fork. In every secondary circuit, or circuits neigh
bouring to the primary circuit, the first effect of the exciting
unidirectional primary spark is to make the secondary circuits
act as if there were no capacity in their circuits. In these
circuits a thread-like spark results which is exactly like that
produced when all the capacity in the secondary circuits is
removed. After a short interval of time the electricity rushes
into the condensers and begins to oscillate, the strength of the
oscillations rising, after one or two vibrations, to a maximum
and then decreasing ; the rate of oscillation finally assumes a
steady state, and is expressed by the formula t = 2w ^hC
                     * Phil. Mag. October 1893.

184               Mr. J. Trowbridge on Electrical
This formula, moreover, does not hold for the first instants.
The electricity seems to be separated only along the wires at
first, and the circuit vibrates more like a closed organ-pipe
than an open one.
    If a unidirectional primary spark excites oscillations in
neighbouring circuits which are slightly out of tune, the
phenomenon of electrical beats or interferences can be pro
duced in these circuits, and can be shown by photography.
    If the primary spark ceases to be unidirectional and is
allowed to oscillate, the oscillations of the primary spark tend
to compel those of the secondary or neighbouring circuits to
follow them ; if they are not sufficiently powerful to do this,
they beat with the oscillation of the secondary circuit. More
 over, if all capacity is removed from the neighbouring circuits,
 they oscillate in tune with the primary circuit, following the
latter exactly. The secondary circuits without capacity act
 like sensitive plates and exactly reproduce every disturbance
 in the primary oscillating circuit. Leaving for the end of
this paper a more detailed account of my results, I will now
describe my apparatus.
                              Fig. 1.
    In fig. 1, S, S', S" are three spark-gaps in the same vertical
plane, but not immediately over each other, in order that the
photographs may not overlap. B, A, C are three coils placed
vertically on the same axis. These circular coils consisted of
from one to four turns of well insulated wire. The mean
 radius of the coils was 915 centim. D, E, and F are the con
 densers respectively of the three independent circuits : these
condensers were made of hard sheet-rubber 03 centim. thick ;
the coated surfaces could be varied by rolling up the layers
 of tinfoil which formed the coating. In certain cases air-
 condensers were substituted for the india-rubber condensers
 both for the condenser E of the primary circuit and for the con
 denser D of one of the secondary circuits. The air-condenser

              Resonance and Electrical Interference.               185
employed for the primary circuit consisted of two large iron
frames, upon which sheets of tin were screwed. The con
denser-plates thus made were 210 centim. by 330 centim., and
were placed 2 centim. apart. The air-condenser employed in
the secondary circuit replacing at times the hard-rubber con
denser D is described, together with the photographic appa
ratus, in a previous paper on Electrical Oscillations *. It was
placed in a room provided with yellow window-shades (orange
fabric). It was found necessary also to construct a camera-
box about 10 feet long, which extended from the spark-gap to
 the revolving mirror. This box was so constructed that the
 direct light of the sparks was shielded from the sensitive plate
 which was placed directly below the spark-gap. The plate
 thus received only the light thrown by the revolving mirror,
 which was placed at the opposite end of the camera-box.
 The operator, seated at the spark-end of this camera, closed
 for an instant a key K (woodcut, fig. 1) placed in the circuit
 of the alternator M . Looking through the film of the sensitive
 plate, one could determine when a suitable photograph had
 been taken ; for the image of the sparks spread out by the
 revolving mirror could be clearly seen, the film acting like a
 ground-glass. It was thus possible to take a large number of
 photographs with the greatest ease, the rate of the alternator
 being so high that at each sadden make of the key several
  photographs could often be obtained at once upon the strips
 of sensitive plates, which were 25 centim. by 6 centim. It
  is evident that one of the circuits, for instance B, could be
  made a time-circuit. The self-induction and capacity in the
  circuit could be carefully determined and maintained con
  stant. The formula t = 2ir VL 0 could be thus printed, so to
  speak, on each negative. For this time-circuit I have
  employed a fine wire coil which was slipped upon the same
  electromagnet which formed the primary of the step-up
  transformer T. I had thus two stop-up transformers with a
  common primary : one produced the sparks of the vibrator,
  the other the spark of the time-circuit.
     In fig. 2 (Plate VII.) S' represents photographs of the
  unidirectional primary spark. S is the unidirectional spark
  produced in a neighbouring circuit B from which the capa
  city has been removed. S" is the oscillating spark in the
  circuit C : the condenser of this circuit was an air-con
  denser. The spark S shows that no oscillation is concealed
  by the heavy pilot-spark of the exciting spark S'. The
  photographs S" show that the unidirectional spark S' can

  186               Mr. J. Trowbridge on Electrical
  set the circuit C into oscillatory movement, and that this
  oscillatory movement continues long after the exciting blow
  has ceased. A careful study of many photographs of this
  nature shows that a circuit containing capacity and self-
  induction acts at the first instant as if no capacity were in the
  circuit. It then begins to oscillate with a higher period than
 it afterwards reaches, acting at first like a closed organ-pipe
  and subsequently like a pipe open at both ends.
     In fig. 3, S' represents an oscillating primary discharge.
  S represents the photograph of the spark produced in thecircuit
  B from which the capacity had been removed. The move
 ments in this circuit B exactly follow those of the exciting
 circuit A. S" is the photograph of the oscillating movement
 produced in the circuit C. It is of a different period from
 that of the exciting circuit S' and continues much longer. A
 secondary circuit without capacity acts like a sensitive plate,
 and accurately follows every movement of the exciting
 circuit.
     In fig. 4 S' represents again the oscillating primary circuit,
 S the oscillating secondary circuit C. The circuits are nearly
 in geometrical resonance.         Slight beats, however, can be
 observed. The duration of the secondary is nearly the same
 as that of the primary.
     Fig. 5 shows clearly the phenomena of beats. In this
 case the secondary circuit was 20 centim. from the primary
 circuit.
    Fig. 6 also shows the phenomenon of beats, and also the
 rise to a maximum in the oscillations of the secondary circuit,
 S. In this case an iron wire constituted a portion of circuit C.
 It seemed as if the effort to magnetize the iron diminished
 the power to produce the initial movement in the secondary
circuit with as much energy as was the case when a copper
 wire of inductance equal to the iron wire was introduced in
its place.
    I have stated that Stefan * has given a theory of electrical
 oscillations, and in his interpretation of Ins equation points
out the necessity of supposing under certain conditions an
 aperiodic movement superimposed upon an oscillatory move
ment, in conductors containing self-induction and capacity.
 In regard to this latter point, my experiments seem to sup
port his theoretical conclusions. I am inclined to believe,
however, that the behaviour of condensers in secondary cir
cuits, which are suddenly submitted to electrical disturbances,
cannot properly be explained by the theory in Stefan's paper.
Moreover, it results from his theory that electrical oscillations

              Resonance and Electrical Interference.           187
on an iron circuit of the same geometrical form and dimension
as a copper circuit have the same period as oscillations on
the copper circuit, supposing the capacity in the two circuits
to be equal. I am led to suspect that there is a change of
the period of electrical oscillations when an iron wire is sub
stituted for a copper wire of the same geometrical form. I
shall return to this subject of the change of period on iron
wires in a following paper.
    Oettingen * has given some beautiful examples of the
interference of electrical oscillations of different periods when
they are led, so to speak, to the same spark-gap. I believe
that my photographs are the first ones, however, which show
the existence of such electrical beats or interference between
independent circuits.
    In order to present electrical beats between two secondary
 circuits both of which were excited by a unidirectional move
 ment in a primary, I employed in certain cases two primary
 coils of one turn each, connected in series, and placed these
 primaries at right angles to each other ; tho secondaries
 corresponding to these two primaries were thus also at right
 angles to each other. This disposition of my apparatus
 enabled me to study the effect of two secondaries on each
 other ; for on varying the angle between the planes of the
 primary coils and their accompanying secondaries, the beats
 can be made to appear or disappear.
    It seems to me that we have in these photographs evidence
 of what may be termed the electrokinetic momentum of elec
 tricity. Something very like inertia is certainly shown by tho
 gradual rise to a maximum and the behaviour of secondary
 circuits to unidirectional impulses from a primary circuit. A
 mental picture of the disturbance produced in secondary
 circuits can be produced in my mind by analogies drawn from
 the subject of the motion of fluids. In such analogies, to my
 mind, the idea of inertia is always present. I remarked in
 the opening of this paper that the formula t = 2v VLC does
  not apply at the instant of starting an oscillating current in
  a secondary conductor by means of a unidirectional flow in a
  primary circuit. This formula is true only after tho full
  effect of the capacity of the oscillating circuit comes into play.
  My photographs show that at first neighbouring secondary
  circuits act Like circuits without capacity, the oscillations in
  such circuits rise to a maximum in intensity and then fall,
  after the rate is established. This is true also when air-
  condensers are employed, and cannot therefore be attributed
  to the action of a solid or liquid dielectric.
               • Ann. der Fhysik und Chemie, xxxiv. 1888.

  188               Mr. William Sutherland on the
      Bjerknes has shown * that the oscillations in a Hertz
  resonator are not damped out so quickly as those in the pri
  mary exciting circuit. My photographs also show that the
  oscillations in all neighbouring circuits continue long after
 the unidirectional spark in the primary or exciting circuit has
  ceased. This is true whether there is resonance or not, and
 is more marked when the circuits are not in tune, except so
 far as electrical beats tend to damp the oscillations of the
 secondary circuit.
     I am inclined to believe, therefore, that the conclusions of
  Bjerknes are true only for open circuits or circuits in which
 no sparks occur. When sparks occur in two circuits which
 are in resonance the duration of time-sparks appears to be
 the same. With periods ranging from "00001 to '000001 of
 a second, I have found it impossible to tune two circuits in
 which sparks occurred to perfect resonance. There were
 always indications of beats due, I believe, to the capacity not
 rising immediately to its full value.
     The method which I have outlined in this paper seems to
 offer a fruitful one for investigation ; for a large number
 of comparative photographs can be taken with far greater
 ease than by the arrangement of apparatus employed by
 Feddersen.

 XX. The Attraction of Unlike Molecules.—II. Tlie Surface-
     Tension of Mixed Liquids. By William Sutherland!.
THE most direct method of measuring the attractions of
         unlike molecules seems to be by obtaining a theoretical
expression for the surface-tension of mixed liquids involving
the attractions of the unlike molecules of the liquids as well as
the attractions of the like molecules for one another, and then
by experimental determinations of the surface-tensions of
mixtures to obtain the data wherewith to calculate the attrac
tions of the unlike molecules from the theoretical expression.
The present paper contains both a theoretical and an experi
mental part, of which the theoretical had better come first as
indicating the lines on which the experiments are to be
discussed.
    In a paper on the Law of Molecular Force (Phil. Mag.
[5] vol. xxvii. p. 305), which has been largely superseded by

a later one on the Laws of Molecular Force (Phil. Mag.
March 1893, [5] vol. xxxv. p. 211), there is given the esta
blishment of an expression for the surface-tension of a liquid
whose molecules attract one another with a force inversely as
the fourth power of the distance between them. If 3Am?/r*
denotes the molecular attraction between two molecules of
mass m at distance r apart in a liquid of density p, then it is
shown that the surface-tension
                            a&Ap'e,                             (1)
where e is a length of the order of magnitude of the average
distance of a molecule from its nearest neighbours and pro-
I)ortional to that distance ; for it represents the distance to be
 eft between two continuous distributions of matter on op
posite sides of a plane in order that the attraction between
them may be the same as that between two molecular distri
butions, the density and law of attraction in the continuous
and molecular distributions being the same.
    Suppose we have a gramme of a mixture of which a frac
tion px is a liquid of density pt and molecular mass nil, and
the fraction p3 a liquid of density p2 and molecular mass m2,
producing a liquid of density p ; if there is no shrinkage on
mixing the liquids 1 and 2, then
                           l'o=pi/pi+p.2/pi                     (2)
Now in the mixture px grammes of liquid 1 are distributed
through a volume 1/p, and by themselves form a medium of
density
                      Pip, to be denoted by p{ ;
similarly the other liquid 2 has in the mixture a density
                      PzP, to be denoted by p3'.
    Thus, then, if we draw a plane in the mixed liquid and seek
to represent the attraction between the molecules on the
opposite sides of the plane, the problem reduces itself to that
of finding the attraction between a liquid 1 of density px' on
one side (say the left side) on the liquid 1 of density p,' on
the right side, and the similar attraction between the parts of
liquid 2 of density p2' on the left and right sides, and the
attraction of liquid 1 of density p/ on left on liquid 2 of
density p2' on right, and the attraction of liquid 2 of density
{>2' on the left on liquid 1 of density p/ on the right. The
 ast two attractions are equal ; thus in place of the expression
AfPe in the surface-tension of a single liquid we shall have for
the mixture
               lA1p'?el' + iA2p1e'a+21Aip1'pi'le2', ... (3)

190              Mr. William Sutherland on the
where ei, ej, and ^ej are distances corresponding to e and
representing the distances to be left between continuums
which may be supposed to replace the molecular mediums
whose attractions have just been enumerated. For a single
liquid, for instance liquid 1 for which the value of e may be
denoted by eu ex is proportional to (»ii//3i) * ; and then for its
surface-tension relation (1) may be written
                       «i=*iA1/>i*(fMi/pOi,                    (4)
where k is the same for all liquids.    Similarly for liquid 2,
                      ua=k2Aipf(m?/pi)t                        (4)
Now if ex is taken as represented by (»ii/pi)*, we cannot take
ej as represented by [m\IP\) > because if we did so and then
in (3) put pi=pi and suppose liquid 2 to become identical
with liquid 1, in which case ei=et—\e2, we should find that
(3) would not reduce to \Aip*ev as it ought. The most
appropriate way in which to represent ej is to take it as given
by (w*i/pj')* reduced in the ratio of the cube root of the space
Pi/Pi occupied by liquid 1 to the cube root of the total space
 \jp. Thus <?/ is represented by (w*i/rV)*(PirV/1,i)*» e* Dy
(ma/p3,)^(pip/pi)^, and xe2 by («i' + *j')/2 ; so that for the
surface-tension of the mixture we get
    ¦•• l<*l/pi=Pl'al/Pl'+Pliai/p22
which is an equation for determining the ratio iA2/(1A1 jA2)4
by a measurement of the surface-tension of a mixture of the
liquids 1 and 2 of known surface-tensions «j and a^. In these
expressions, if we put p1=p2= 1/2 and suppose liquid 2 to
become identical with 1, we get the identity 1al=a1 as we
ought; also if we put p2=0 and pi=l we get the same
identity. There is doubtless something arbitrary in the
manner in which we have fixed the values of e', et, and ,£2',
but we must remember that, in the original establishment of
the relation a=kApie, there is an arbitrary step in the

                 Attraction of Unlike Molecules.             191
replacement of summation for separate molecules by inte
gration for a continuum ; the step is a piece of approximation
whose justification is this, that even if we endeavoured to
carry out the process of summation we should have to make
arbitrary arrangements of the molecules. If we tried to sum
for the molecules of a mixture, our suppositions as to the
arrangement of the molecules would be still more markedly
arbitrary ; as, for instance, if we tried to represent the space-
distribution of the spheres in a mixture of equal numbers of
two sets of spheres of different sizes. These considerations
seem to me to make the above expression for the surface-
tension of a mixture satisfactory enough for present appli
cations. When a higher degree of accuracy is required, it
will be an interesting piece of mathematics te devise arrange
ments of molecules as in nature and" convenient methods of
summation.
   In the paper on the Diffusion of Gases we have seen
reason to believe that iA2 = (jAi 2A2) ; and as the arithmetical
mean of the molecular radii {("!i/j0i)* + (w2//32),}/2 of most
pairs of liquids is little different from the geometrical mean
{(mi/Pi)i(nh/Pi)J\'') we cao write approximately
as the law which rules the surface-tension of mixtures if
iA2= (XA,. 2A2)*. But equation (6) is the fundamental one to
 be used in the discussion of the experiments, as it gives
 directly a value of iAj/GAjsAj,)*, which is the thing sought
 in these investigations on the attraction of unlike molecules.
   A fair amount of experimental work on the surface-tension
of mixtures has been published, but hardly any of it is of
immediate use in connexion with the present inquiry. For
instance, Traube (Ber. deut. chem. Ges. xvii. ; Ann. der
 C/tem. cclxv. ; Journ. far prakt. Cliem. xxxiv.) has investi
 gated the surface-tension of mixtures of water, and a large
number of organic liquids such as alcohols, acids, and amines ;
but as water and the alcohols and acids are exceptional in
their molecular structure in the liquid state, the surface-
tensions of these mixtures cannot be appropriately discussed
at the outset of this inquiry ; but Traube's numerous experi
ments will doubtless be of great value when the exceptional
nature of these substances is under systematic examination
 But before Traube, Rodenbeck (Wied. Beibl. iv.) measured
the rise in capillary tubes of a certain number of mixtures of

       In the table ethyl oxide is liquid 1 and chloroform is 2,
    and the surface-tensions are given in mgrms. weight per
    millim. The mean value of 1A2/(1A12AS)* is 1*0 ; or, ex
    cluding mixtures IV. and V., in which the proportion of
    ethyl oxide is too small to favour an accurate value of
    jAj/dAt jA3)* from equation (6), the mean value is 1*05.
     Thus the theoretical formula (6) is proved to apply well to
     mixtures of ethyl oxide and chloroform, for which also jAj is
     proved to bo equal to (jA^Aj)*.
        Two other sets of Rodenbeck's experiments may be dis
     cussed here, although they relate to mixtures involving
     petroleum, which is itself a mixture, for the equation
                          Ia2/P2 = (/W/Pi +/W/Wii
     can be generalized so as to apply to any mixture of any
     number of liquids. Suppose a gramme of any such mixturo
     to contain plt p2, p3 . . . gramme of liquids 1, 2, 3 ... , and have
     a density p and surface-tension a, then
                 «//a2 = (7W/P1 + /W/>2 +jW/Pa + • • • )2-
     If the liquids 2, 3, 4 ... in proportions p2, p3, pi . . . are sup
     posed to form a separate liquid n, as for instance Rodenbeck's
     petroleum, then
                  Vp'= (pi«i*/pi + (p* +p> + • • • )ai/pn}2 ;
     so that the law for a mixture of mixtures is the same as for a
     mixture of pure liquids, and we ought to be able to apply
     equation (6) to a mixture of mixtures. Thus we can utilize
     Rodenbeck's measurements on mixtures of rectified petroleum
     and chloroform, and also of ordinary petroleum and ethyl

   In these cases the theoretical formula (fi) is again verified
by the approximate constancy of iA2/(iAi2A2)*, and again
the ratio iA2/dAi „AS)1 has values close to 1.
   In my own experiments the method adopted for measuring
surface-tensions was by means of the rise in capillary tubes,
but carried out in a special manner. Elsworthy (Journ.
Chem. Soc. liii.) suggested inclining the capillary tube at a
large angle to the vertical, say 0, so that a liquid which would
rise a height h in the tube when vertical, while still rising
only h vertically, in the inclined tube rises a distance h/cos 9
measured along the tube ; so that the accuracy of reading is
increased in the ratio 1 to cos 9. It seemed to me that the
best way to take advantage of this method for a number of
liquids was to engrave a fixed mark on the tube, and then in
each case to vary the inclination till the liquid rose as nearly
as possible to the mark, reading the inclination in each case.
The advantage of this method is that it makes one almost
independent of variation in the bore of the capillary tube. It
would have improved the accuracy of the method if a fine
scale had been engraved on the tube near the fixed mark, so
that one could read in each case the small departure from the
fixed mark and allow for it in the calculations, but this was
not done. The capillary tube was fitted tightly into one leg
of a V-tube of 6 millim. internal diameter, the joint being
protected by a piece of india-rubber tube slipped over it : the
angle of the V was such that the other leg was nearly vertical
in the experiments with most liquids. A second mark was
engraved on the capillary a little above where it entered the
V-tube, and at a distance of 184 millim. from the other fixed
mark ; the level of the free surface of the liquid in the V-tube

  194                    Mr. William Sutherland on the
  was always brought to the level of this second mark, so that
  the length of the column raised by capillary action in the tube
  was always 184 millim. The open limb of the V-tube was
  provided with a loose cork to prevent evaporation. The
  capillary tube was clamped to a wooden lath hinged at one
  end to a stand, and provided at the other end with an index
  whose terminal point was G10 millim. from the hinge, and to
  the lath was hinged a wooden piece by which it could be sup
  ported at any angle. Instead of reading the angle of incli
  nation of the lath and its attached tube, I read on a vertical
  scale the height of the index above the point indicated by it
  when the tube was lowered to a horizontal position. The
  readings thus obtained were accordingly directly proportional
  to the capillary heights. In the case of water at 15° C. the
  reading was 1 96 millim. ; and as the mean result of previous
  experimenters is that at 15° C. in a tube of 1 millim. radius
  water rises 14"9 millim., it was only necessary for me to multiply
  my readings for various liquids and mixtures at 15° (really
  14° to 16°) by 14-9/196 to obtain the capillary height h as
  usually given, namely, number of millim. rise in a tube of
   1 millim. radius.
      The chief objection that I found to the method of experi
  menting was that I had two adjustments to make that depended
  on one another, namely, that of the level of the liquid in the
  wide tube and the level of the liquid in the capillary tube.
   In any further experiments I will take steps to make these
   two independent of one another.
       The capillary tube and the liquids (oxcept chloroform) in
   a state of sufficient chemical purity were given to me by
  Mr. W. Percy Wilkinson, analyst, of Melbourne. The fol
  lowing are the capillary heights h of the separate liquids in
  millim. in a tube of 1 millim. radius, their densities p and
  their surface-tensions a = kp/2 all at 15° 0.

      In working with mixtures of these liquids the general pro
  cedure was to make three mixtures in the proportions of

                       Attraction of Unlike Molecules.         195
about 3 or 2 to 1, 1 to 1, and 1 to 2 or 3 parts by weight of
 the two liquids, to measure the capillary height of each mixture
 immediately after it was made, and then to measure the
 density. In some cases where one of the liquids was very
volatile, and for any reason the level of the liquid in the
V-tube took longer than usual to adjust, so that the cork was
off too long, evaporation of the volatile ingredient altered the
proportions of the two ingredients a little from their original
values and altered the specific gravities a little. On account
of this occasional source of error, the values of px and p2 will
be given only to two figures, though measured to three ; as
Pi +/'2=:1) it is necessary to give only p2.

Some mixtures of ethyl oxide and CSS gave a precipitate
disappearing only with shaking ; so that perhaps they ought
not to rank as genuine mixtures of two liquids. We will
not enquire at present more closely into these exceptional
cases, nor discuss the great class of exceptions formed by
watery solutions and mixtures. In the " Laws of Molecular
Force " the method of treating watery solutions was pointed
out, and the method will be improved and developed in
another paper devoted to the surface-tensions of watery
solutions alone. As to watery mixtures it will suffice to
instance as the most extreme case of exceptional capillary
behaviour the well-known one of mixtures of water and amyl
alcohol, water with a surface-tension of 7'4 when mixed with
only 2 5 per cent, of amyl alcohol having a surface-tension of
3*7 has its surface-tension reduced to 2*8, which is even
lower than that of the small amount of added alcohol. It is
clear that cases of this sort are complicated with quite another
class of phenomena from those we are discussing in con
nexion with normal liquid mixtures, and that we have a fight
to set them apart for separate study.
    The result 1A2=(1A13A2)*, which is the outcome of this
investigation on the attraction of unlike molecules, has an
important bearing on the interpretation of the data as to the
attraction of like molecules contained in the " Laws of Mole
cular Force ;" for evidently the expression Aw2 for the attrac
tion of two like molecules must be regarded as the product of
two parameters A*m characteristic of each molecule. Tho
investigation of the attraction of like molecules from this
point of view will be taken up in my next paper, " Further
Studies on Molecular Force. "

XXI. On Electromagnetic Induction in Plane, Cylindrical, and
   Spherical Current-Sheets, and its Representation by Moving
    Trails of Images. By G. H. Bryan, M.A.*
       Part I.— General Equations—Plane Sheets.
                              Introduction.
1 . T T is well known that if a very tbin, indefinitely extended
     -L plane sheet of metal of finite conductivity is placed
in a varying magnetic field due to the presence of moving
magnetic poles in its neighbourhood, induction-currents
are set up in the sheet and the field of force due to these
currents may be represented by a moving trail of images.
    In the present paper the surface-conditions which hold at
the surface of a plane, cylindrical, spherical, or other con
ducting sheet of uniform small thickness are deduced directly
from the fundamental laws of electromagnetic induction.
By working directly with the scalar magnetic potential, and
avoiding the introduction of the vector potential and the
quantity which Maxwell denotes by P, the investigations are
much simplified. Moreover, in at least one comparatively
recently published paper the boundary conditions satisfied by
the vector potential at the surface of separation of two different
media have been erroneously stated, and for this reason it
is advantageous to employ a method which obviates the
difficulty.
    The results will be employed to show how the field due to
the presence of a magnetic pole of varying intensity in the
neighbourhood of a plane, cylindrical, or spherical current-
sheet may be represented by means of a moving trail of
images. By the principle of superposition the effect of any
number of poles of varying intensity can be deduced, and the
corresponding expressions for the field can thus be obtained
when the variable inducing system of magnets is of the most
general possible character, as, for example, one (or more)
 magnetic poles moving about in any manner whatever.
    In this way a synthetic solution of' the problem of induction
in current sheets is obtained. The phenomena of induction
in spherical and other current sheets have been treated at
considerable length from an analytical point of view by
Lannor, Lamb, and Niven, and the last-named writer has
made some attempt, in the case of a sphere, to interpret the
results by means of images ; but the present investigation
     * Coniinunicftti;d by the Physical Society: rend May 11, 1894.

      Electromagnetic Induction in Plane Current-Sheets.       199
seemed desirable for many reasons, and it is hoped that it
will overcome some of the difficulties, aud elucidate some of
the obscurities which present themselves in most treatments
of this interesting application of the principles of electro-
magnetism.
                      Fundamental Assumptions.
    2. The laws of electromagnetic induction assert that in
bodies at rest
    I. The total current across any enclosed portion of a sur
face which always contains the same particles is equal to 1/47T
of the line-integral of magnetic force round the curve bounding
the surface.
    II. The rate of decrease of t/te surface-integral of magnetic
 induction across any enclosed surface which ahcays contains
 the same particles is equal to the line-integral of electromotive
force rouiul the curve bounding the surface.
     In applying these laws to an infinite dielectric separated
 into two portions by a thin conducting sheet, it is usually
 assumed that the disturbance produced by the inducing system
 is not a very rapidly alternating one, so that displacement
 currents in the dielectric have no appreciable magnetic
 effect*. With this assumption, the magnetic force in the
 dielectric will always be derivable from a potential which will
  only depend on the inducing system and the currents in the
  sheet. In other words, the state of the dielectric will be
 given by an "equilibrium theory."
     It is also assumed that the induction-currents at any point
  distribute themselves uniformly throughout the thickness of
  the sheet. This requires that the disturbance shall not be a
  very rapidly alternating one, and also that the thickness of
  the sheet shall be very small compared with the other linear
  dimensions of the system (such as the distances of the moving
  poles, the radius of the sheet if spherical, &c.) .

     3. Let the plane of the sheet be taken as the plane of x, yt
  let the thickness of the sheet be c, and specific conductivity- C-
      Let ill, ^2 be the magnetic potentials on the negative and
  positive side of the sheet respectively, d> the current function
  in the sheet at any point. Apply Law I. to the circuit formed
  by going along the positive side of the sheet from the origin
  to any point and returning along the negative side from that

  Magnetism,' ii. § 405.

200     Mr. G. H. Bryan on Electromagnetic Induction in
point to the origin. Since the thickness of the sheet is small,
the terms contributed to the line-integral of the magnetic
force by the passage of the circuit from one side of the sheet
to the other may be neglected and we obtain *
                     ili — ili = iv(j) + constant                   (1)
   Now apply Law II. to any circuit s drawn in the plane of
the sheet. Let 8„ S2 be two surfaces drawn in the dielectric
infinitely near to the positive and negative faces of the sheet
respectively and both bounded by the curve *, and let P, Q
be the components of electromotive force at any point. Then,
assuming the magnetic permeability of the dielectric to be
unity, we have
and since corresponding elements of the near surfaces S,, S»
are equal, it is evident that

where dn is the element of the outward-drawn normal to s
and the surface-integral taken over the area S of the sheet
bounded by the curve *.
   * Maxwell, ' Electricity and Magnetism,' ii. 5 653.
   t The magnetic permeability of the sheet itself will not affect the
conditions oi the problem unless it is required to proceed to a higher
order of approximation by taking into account first powers of the thick
ness (or unless the sheet is formed of soft iron whose magnetic perme
ability may be large).

    7. When the sheet is of any form other than those above
 considered, it is necessary to assume a certain law of variation
 of the thickness in order to put the boundary conditions into
 a form similar to those given above *.
    Let us use orthogonal coordinates a, /8, 7; let the line-
 element be given by
                       .,_rf«'rffi!       rf7*
  and let the equation of the current sheet be
                            7 = constant.
     Equation (1) still holds, and by applying Law H. to the
  circuit enclosed on the sheet by the curves a, a + 8a, /9 and
                 * Compare Wutson and Burburr, §420.

    But Laplace's equation which is satisfied by I2j fi2 may be
written

        d«\hth3 da)+ (//SUs/r, d0j+ d7\/iji2 dy)
    Hence it is possible to eliminate differential coefficients
 with respect to a, $ from the surface-condition if, and only if,

    Hence the thickness of the sheet at any point must be
 inversely proportional to the distance between two neighbour
 ing surfaces of the family 7 = constant at that point. In the
 case of an ellipsoidal sheet this leads to the well-known con
 dition that the thickness must be proportional to the perpen
 dicular on the tangent-plane, or that the sheet must be a
 shell bounded by similar and similarly situated ellipsoids.

    The first term represents the effect of a pole equal and
opposite to the given pole at the point (x0, y0, z0), while the

between the times t and t + St is represented at time t by a
magnet of strength R/(t)8t situated at the point (<c0, y0,
z0-\-Ji(t— t)). The potential at the positive side is found
from the relation (5), or
                    a>\x,y,z)=-M{x,y,-z).
    When the pole is in motion the results thus arrived at
enable us to plot out the moving images contributed during
every time element St of the motion in the well-known way,
or they may be obtained as follows :—
    9. If, instead of a single magnetic pole, we are dealing
with a magnetic distribution on the positive side of the sheet
such that the volume-density of magnetism of the point

                f[t)—m from t = 0 to t=+<x>.
   We therefore have to write m for f(t) in the above ex
pressions and to reduce the inferior limit of integration with
respect to t from — oo to 0.
   The advantage of starting with a fixed instead of a moving
pole is more evident in the case of a cylindrical or spherical
sheet, especially in the latter, since we are thus enabled
to use zonal spherical harmonics only and the analysis is
consequently much simplified.
XXII. The Passage of Hydrogen through a Palladium Septum,
   ami the Pressure which it produces. By William Ramsay,
   F.R.S. *
IT has been frequently cited as an argument in favour of
     attributing the osmotic pressure exercised by a substance
in dilute solution on the walls of a vessel permeable to the
solvent but not to the dissolved substance, that if a vessel
were constructed of palladium, which, as Graham's researches
showed, is permeable to hydrogen, but not to many other
gases, such a vessel would be subjected on its interior walls to
a high pressure if it were filled with an indifferent gas and
exposed on its exterior to an atmosphere of hydrogen. The
gas confined in the vessel, not being able to escape, would
exert the pressure at which it was allowed to enter ; while

            Hydrogen through a Palladium Septum.              207
the interior of the vessel would be a vacuum to hydrogen ;
and as its walls are permeable to hydrogen, pressure should
rise by passage of hydrogen into the interior, until the pres
sure of the hydrogen on the interior walls became equal to
that on the exterior walls. The effect of this would be to
superadd the pressure of the hydrogen to that of the gas
originally contained in the vessel ; and if it be supposed that
the vessel was originally filled at atmospheric pressure, the
entry of hydrogen should increase that pressure by another
atmosphere, providing the hydrogen surrounding the exterior
walls of the vessel be at atmospheric pressure.
    It has been suggested that when pressure is raised by the
passage of water into the interior of a cell with semiper
meable walls containing a solution, the rise of pressure is
due, not to the pressure exercised by the molecules of the dis
 solved substance, but to that produced by the entering water.
 Gases present us with an exact analogy. It is idle to inquire
 what causes the rise of pressure in the interior of such a palla
 dium " cell." The total pressure is due to the hydrogen and to
 the gas with which the cell was originally filled ; the original
 pressure has undoubtedly been increased by the entry of hy
 drogen. But a portion of the pressure—and the effective
 portion, from the point of view of osmotic pressure—is due to
 the original gas, whether nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or any gas
 whatever to which the cell-walls are impervious, and which
 is not chemically attacked by hydrogen. It is therefore quite
 correct to ascribe osmotic pressure to the dissolved substance,
 although it is apparently produced by entry of solvent.
    The experiments to be described were made with the object
 of submitting this entry of hydrogen through the walls of a
 palladium cell to quantitative study. After considerable
 progress had been made, a paper by A. Biltz (Zeitschr. f.
 phys. Chem. ix. p. 152) was published, describing lecture-
 experiments devised to show the ordinary diffusion of gases
 without a septum, diffusion with a leaky septum of porous
 earthenware, and also diffusion with a semipermeable septum,
 permitting the passage of hydrogen, but hindering the
 passage of other gases. Biltz employed for the last-mentioned
 purpose an iron tube, and made a few rough quantitative
 measurements ; but he does not appear to have continued
 any experiment long enough to obtain a maximum pressure,
 nor was his apparatus designed with the object of quanti
 tative measurement, but only for the purpose of class demon
 stration.

208            Prof. W. Ramsay on the Passage of
                    Description of Apparatus
   The apparatus which was em
ployed is represented in the ac
 companying woodcut.
   AB is a tube of platinum, the
top portion of which, at A, is b -
of palladium and closed at its
upper end. At B the platinum
tube is sealed or cemented on to
a glass tube C, with a lateral
branch, represented in the figure
as drawn off and closed. Some
what lower down, the tube is
sealed to a capillary D, on which                       —i
graduations are etched. The
tube then widens to a bulb, and
is finally connected by thick
flexible tubing to a reservoir of
mercury E.
   The palladium tube is sur
rounded by a glass tube F, also
provided with a lateral exit at
G, and fitting tightly into a
jacket H, which may be heated
by boiling the liquid in the
bulb I. A gas, passed in at F, would thus surround the
palladium tube and escape at G ; or if heavier than air, if
introduced at G it would escape at F. The palladium cell
could be heated to any desired temperature by choosing an
appropriate jacketing vapour. The whole apparatus stood in
front of a glass mirror-scale, on which the level of the mer
cury at D and E could be read off. It was possible to read
to one tenth of a millimetre, but such accuracy of reading
was generally unnecessary.
                 Description of an Experiment.
   A clip was placed on the india-rubber tube joining D and
E, and the side-tube C, which at this time was open, was
connected with a reservoir of some gas, e. g. of nitrogen, by
means of a three-way tap. The palladium tube was pumped
empty, and then filled with dry nitrogen ; the operation was
repeated ten times, so as to ensure absence of air. The
nitrogen was finally allowed to enter the apparatus uuder
slight pressure, and the side-tube C was sealed. The liquid
in I was then boiled so as to jacket the tubes F and A, and

             Hydrogen through a Palladium Septum.           209
 the clip on the india-rubber tube was opened. When the
temperature had become constant, the reservoir of mercury
E was brought approximately to a level with a mark on the
capillary tube D, and the capillary tube at C was broken.
 Gas then escaped through C until the pressure in the tube A
became equal to that of the atmosphere. The capillary point
was again sealed. An accurato reading was then taken, the
mercury reservoir being placed so that an exact volume
of gas was contained in the palladium cell under a known
pressure.
   Hydrogen carefully purified by washing with potassium
permanganate, silver nitrate, and caustic potash, and dried by
passage through sulphuric acid and over phosphorus pent-
oxide, was then passed in through the tube F, escaping at G.
Pressure rapidly rose in the interior of the apparatus, and
was measured by raising the mercury reservoir. When it
had attained its maximum a reading was taken, the position
of the mercury in the capillary stem being so adjusted that
the capacity of the cell was accurately the same as at the
commencement of the experiments. The difference between
the initial and final pressure is due to entry of hydrogen.
   The success of such experiments depends on the condition
of the palladium. After having been used once or twice the
interior of the palladium tube became coated with mercury,
even although the level of mercury (which was cold) lay far
below the palladium top. It appears that palladium absorbs
mercury-vapour with avidity, thus rendering the palladium
cell a partial vacuum to mercury-vapour. Vapour rises from
the cold mercury to restore pressure, and is again absorbed.
It was therefore necessary to heat the palladium tube after
each experiment in order to expel mercury. This had the
effect of oxidizing the palladium and of covering it with a
brownish-black film. To remove the oxide, the tube was made
the negative pole of a battery, and dilute sulphuric acid was
electrolysed, both on the inside and outside of the palladium
tube. It was then dried at a low temperature ; the external
surface was polished with a little dry emery ; the tube was
cemented into its place, and was ready for a fresh experiment.
Without such precautions the passage of hydrogen is very
slow and incomplete. It should be mentioned that before
commencing an experiment it was necessary to jackst the
palladium tube at 220° and to pass a current of air over it for
some time. In this way the combined hydrogen was removed ;
hydrogen escaped from the exterior of the tube and was
replaced by air or some other gas in the interior.
   Phil. Mag, S, 5, Vol, 38. No. 231. Aug. 1894.         P

210            Prof. W. Ramsay on the Passage of
                     Account of Experiments.
   The experiments admit of classification under five heads:—
   1. Experiments with the tube filled with air.
   2. Experiments with the tube filled with nitrogen.
   3. Experiments in which the hydrogen passed over the
exterior of the tube was diluted with nitrogen or other gases,
when it exercised only a partial pressure on the exterior
walls of the tube.
   4. Experiments in which the palladium tube was filled with
other gases.
   5. Experiments with a nickel tube and carbon monoxide.
   Experiment 1.—The tube was filled with air and jacketed
with bromonaphthalene, boiling at about 280°. The baro
metric pressure during the experiment was constant at 743' 1
milliin. On passing hydrogen for three hours the pressure in
the palladium cell had become constant ; the rise of pressure
was 573 millim.
   Water appeared on the surface of the mercury in the capil
lary tube, showing that the hydrogen had combined with the
oxygen of the air. The rise of pressure measured should
therefore have been that of the nitrogen remaining in the
cell, viz. 585 millim.
   It may be concluded, then, that hydrogen combines with
oxygen in presence of palladium at 280°, and that the residual
nitrogen exerts nearly its partial pressure ; or, as will be
afterwards shown to be a more correct statement, the nitrogen
exerts its full partial pressure, and the hydrogen in the interior
exerts a large fraction of the pressure of the external hydrogen.
   Experiment 2.—The tube was filled with pure dry nitrogen,
and exposed to hydrogen, as before, at the same temperature.
The pressure, after it had become fairly steady, was 703'2
millim. in excess of that of the atmosphere (748'1 millim.).
The hydrogen was next removed by passing a current of air
 over the exterior of the tube, and the pressure was again
 raised by a current of hydrogen. After about three-quarters
 of an hour the pressure was (599*8 millim. in excess of that of
the atmosphere, a quarter of an hour later it was 721'1 millim.,
and in another quarter of an hour it had risen to 733*0 millim.
 It appeared then to be stationary. The barometric pressure
 was still 748-l millim.; it therefore appears that the pressures
 of the hydrogen on the exterior and interior of the palladium
tube were nearly equal.
    It was noticed during these experiments that when the gas
was changed the pressure invariably fell a little on admitting
hydrogen and rose a little on admitting oxygen ; the*xlirection

            Hydrogen through a Palladium Septum.               211
of the pressure then changed, and the usual rise with hydrogen
and fall with air occurred. I think that this is to be attri
buted to the fact that the palladium vessel increases its capacity
suddenly on exposure to hydrogen, and decreases it on ex
posure to air after having been exposed to hydrogen. But
the total change of volume is a very minute one ; it is notice
able only by the rise or fall of the mercury in the capillary
tube to the amount of one or two millimetres ; and the total
change of volume is certainly less than 0"1 per cent, of the
capacity of the vessel.
   Experiments 3, 4, and 5.—The next three experiments gave
readings much lower than those previously obtained. The
barometric reading was 748*6 millim. The rise in experi
ment 3 was 650*3 millim. ; in experiment 4, 654*2 millim. ;
and in experiment 5, 657*8 millim.
   This led me to suspect that the palladium tube had under
gone alteration. It was therefore disconnected and cleaned
as before described. It was finally filled with nitrogen.
   Experiments 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.—The barometric pressure
was 770*2 millim. The final pressure in experiment 6 was
698*5; in 7, 692*1; in 8, the barometric pressure being 768*8
millim., the final pressure was 686*4 millim. In experiment
9, with a barometer-reading of 762*2 millim., the reading
was 692*4 millim. ; and in 10, the barometer-reading being
759*2, the pressure was 688*4 millim.
   To summarize these results it is necessary to compare the
pressure of the internal hydrogen with that of the external
hydrogen. The following table gives their ratios :—
   Experiment.       (1)       (2)     (3)      (4)       (5)
   Ratio ....      0*9400 0*9798 0*8687 0*8739 0*8780
   Experiment.       (6)       (7)     (8)      (9)      (10)
   Ratio ....      0*9069 0*8986 0*8928 0*9084 0*9067
   These results do not exhibit any great degree of constancy,
but I am sure that their difference depends largely, if not
wholly, on the state of the surface of the palladium. The
mean result is 0*9053, a number closely approximating to
the last five determinations. This would lead to the con
clusion that the pressure of the internal hydrogen rises to
rather more than       of the pressure of the external hydrogen
at 280°.
   Experiment 11.—The temperature was now kept at the
boiling-point of quinoline (about 237°). The passage of hy
drogen through palladium is so slow at this temperature that
                                P 2

 212            Prof. W. Earn say on the Passage of
patience failed me to make more than one determination. It
¦was begun on May 4th. On May 10th pressure was still
rising, but very slowly. On May 11th it had reached 501*7
millim. ; on the 13th it was 525*2 millim., and on the 14th
531*2 millim. Taking the figure actually read, the fractional
pressure (barometer = 766*3 millim.) was 0*6932. Judging
irom this experiment, the pressuro would appear to depend on
the temperature of the palladium and of the hydrogen. Still,
it is possible that had the experiment been carried on sufficiently
far, the pressure might have risen much higher.
    Experiment 12.—The next set of experiments was made at
 a higher temperature—that of the boiling-point of dibenzyl-
 ketone (335 ). The pressure registered at a barometric
 height of 758*7 millim. was 681*6 millim. The ratio is
 0*8984, practically identical with that obtained at the boiling-
point of bromonaphthalene.
    Experiments 13, 14, and 15.—The hydrogen in these experi
ments was mixed with 50 per cent, of nitrogen, so that the
exterior of the palladium tube was exposed to a partial
pressure of hydrogen. The first of this set gave a pressure
of hydrogen of 367*9 millim., the barometer standing at
770-9 millim. ; the second, 352-9 millim., barometer at 771*8
millim. ; and the third 362"7 millim. at the same pressure.
   Experiment 16 was made with a mixture of one volume of
hydrogen to three of nitrogen ; the read pressure was 176*7
millim., the barometric height being 756*5 millim.
   The ratios are :—
   Experiment.         13       14       15
   Eatio .... 0*4771 0*4573 0*4700. Moan 0*4681.
   Experiment 16 : Eatio 0*2336.
   Multiplying the first mean ratio by 2, and the second by
4, the products are comparable with that from pure hydrogen.
The figures are :—
         Pure hydrogen                             0*9053
         Hydrogen + 50 p. c. nitrogen . . . 0*9362
         Hydrogen + 75 p. c. nitrogen . . . 0*9344
   The pressure, as might have been anticipated, is propor
tional to the partial pressure of the external hydrogen.
   It is obviously possible to test the percentage of hydrogen
in coal-gas by this means, provided the other constituents of
coal-gas are unable to pass through palladium. An experiment
with marsh-gas showed that it is not capable of permeating
palladium ; and the vapour of ether is also unable to pass.

              Hydrogen through a Palladium Septum.            213
     Experiments 17 and 18.—At 280° the pressures with a
  sample of London coal-gas were 364/4 millim., at a barometric
  pressure of 760-4 millim. ; and 361-8 millim. at a barometric
  pressure of 761-5 millim. The ratios are 0-4792 and 0-4751
 respectively. Supposing the highest attainable ratio to be
  0'9053, as deduced from the ten experiments with pure
 hydrogen, the percentage of hydrogen is easily found by the
  ratios (0-4792 x 100)/O9053,and (0-4751 x 100)/0-9053. The
 numbers are 52-94 and 52'49 per cent, respectively. It would
 be possible thus to have a continuous register of the percentage
 amount of hydrogen in coal-gas, provided the palladium did
 not alter its state. As it is, I am afraid that the apparatus
 will not retain its activity for a sufficiently long time. It
 should also be remarked that it is necessary to wash the coal-
 gas with a solution of potassium permanganate, in order to
 free it from sulphur compounds. If this precaution is not
 taken, the palladium becomes coated with a layer of sulphide,
 and it ceases to be permeable to hydrogen.
     Experiments were next made in which the palladium tube
 contained various gases.
     Experiment 19.—The tube contained carbon dioxide. On
 exposing it to hydrogen at 280° the pressure rose with great
 rapidity—much more rapidly than had previously been
 observed. The rise ceased at 735 millim., the barometric
 pressure being 764-0.       The quotient is 0-9621, a higher
 number than any yet obtained.
    Experiment 20.—Carbon monoxide was in the interior ; the
 pressure rose rapidly on admission of hydrogen to 734-5
 millim., the barometer reading 7(39'5. The quotient is 0-9545,
 also a very high number. In both of these experiments the
fall on passing air over the exterior of the tube was much
slower than the rise with hydrogen. The end point was
difficult to note, for the last change of pressure was very
slow. It may be that the exterior surface of the palladium
being exposed to hydrogen alone, little difficulty was experi
enced in molecules entering ; but that on reversing the
action, the contact of hydrogen with the interior walls was
interfered with by the indifferent gas present. The same
phenomenon had previously been noticed, but in a minor
degree. It is noteworthy that no trace of water was formed
in either case. Hydrogenized palladium is without action on
carbon monoxide or dioxide at 280°.
    Experiment 21.—The tube was filled with cyanogen. The
total pressure was 741 millim., the barometer standing at
764-5 millim. The quotient is 0-9693, a very high number.
On substituting air, the cyanogen exerted finally a pressure of

214            Prof. W. Ramsay on the Passage of
740 millim. This would appear to indicate that palladium is
quite impermeable to cyanogen, and is not attacked by it at
280°.
   Experiment 22.—Nitric oxide was introduced into the tube,
at a barometric pressure (corrected) of 765 millim. On passing
hydrogen the pressure rose 368 millim. ; the total pressure of
the gases in the tube was 368 + 763 = 1131 millim., the baro
metric height being 763 millim. The increase of pressure was
therefore 1131 — 765 = 366 millim. Supposing that the nitric
oxide had reacted with the hydrogen, forming nitrogen and
water, thus :—
               2NO + 2H, = 2H20 + N„
              4 vols.                        2 vols.
the pressure of the nitric oxide would have been halved, and
would have amounted to 765/2 = 382*5 millim. But it is to
be supposed that the resulting water would have exerted its
usual vapour-pressure ; and as its temperature was 22°, the
pressure of the water-vapour would be 18" 5 millim.
   We have thus :—                                      millim_
 Pressure of H2 + N2 + H20 vapour . 368 +763 =1131
 Pressure of Nj + HjO vapour . . 382-5+18-5=401
                  Hence pressure of hydrogen alone = 730
and the quotient 730/765 = 0-9543, a number almost identical
with those previously obtained.
   Experiment 23.—A similar experiment was made with
nitrous oxide. Here, too, reduction occurs at 280° ; but the
volume of the residual nitrogen is equal to that of the nitrous
oxide.
   The initial pressure of the nitrous oxide was 772 millim.
After passing hydrogen, the total pressure was 1489-5 millim.
The difference, 717-5 millim., is to be ascribed to hydrogen
and water-vapour. The barometer stood at 761 millim.
Deducting 18*5 millim., the pressure of water-vapour at 22°,
the pressure of the hydrogen alone is 699 millim. And the
quotient 699-0/761 = 0-9186.
   The hydrogen was then removed by a current of air on the
external surface of the palladium. The pressure of the
nitrogen was then 780'5 millim. Again restoring hydrogen
on the exterior, the pressure rose to 727-5 millim., the baro
metric pressure being 761 millim. The pressure ascribable to
hydrogen and water-vapour is thus 708 millim.; subtracting
the pressure of water-vapour, 22'5 millim., the remainder,
685-5 millim., is due to hydrogen. The quotient is 0;9008
Here again a reasonable correspondence is found.

              Hydrogen through a Palladium Septum.            215
    It is evident that in all cases the pressure of the hydrogen
 in the interior of the palladium tube is lower than the baro
 metric pressure, t. e. lower than the pressure of the hydrogen
 on the exterior. It will be convenient here to tabulate the
 ratios found :—
 a.  Mean ratio from hydrogen and nitrogen at 280° .       0'9053
b.   Ratio at 335°                                         0-8984
 c.  Ratio with 50 per cent, of hydrogen at 335° . .       0-9362
 d.  Ratio with 25 per cent, of hydrogen at 335° . .       0-9344
 e.  Ratio from hydrogen and carbon dioxide at 280°.       0-9621
/.   Ratio from hydrogen and carbon monoxide at 280°       0'9545
g.   Ritio from hydrogen and cyanogen at 280° . .          0"9693
    I omit the two last determinations, as uncertainty was
 introduced owing to the presence of water-vapour.
    On reviewing these results, it would appear that the ratio is
 not altered by rise of temperature above 280°. The same
 number was obtained at 280° and at 335°. But at a lower
 temperature the ratio is much smaller, if, indeed, the end-
 point was really reached. Dilution of the hydrogen appears
 to raise the ratio ; and the presence of carbon dioxide, carbon
 monoxide, or cyanogen in the interior of the palladium tube
 appears to be favourable to the passage of hydrogen.
    To what are these results to be ascribed ?
    Troost and Hautefeuille have determined the pressures of
 dissociation of tho definite hydride of palladium, PdaH ( Compt.
  rend, lxxviii. p. 686). At 130° the pressure is nearly equal
 to that of the atmosphere, it is 624 millim.; while at 140° the
 pressure is 812 millim. It rises rapidly with temperature, and
 at the highest temperature given, 170°, it amounts to the largo
 number 1840 millim. It is impossible to believe, then, that
 any hydride of palladium should exist even at the lowest of
 the temperatures employed, 223°. Yet palladium becomes
 quickly permeable to hydrogen only at a higher temperature.
    Two questions require answer :—(1) Why is palladium
 permeable to hydrogen ? and (2) Why is tho pressure of
 the internal hydrogen always less than that of the external
 hydrogen ?
     (1) It is hardly probable that the palladium acts simply as
 a filter, allowing small molecules of hydrogen to pass while
 blocking the passage of larger molecules of other gases.
  Graham, however, appears to regard this as in some measure
 the cause of tho passage. His words are :—" Such phenomena
  of gaseous penetration appear to suggest a progression in the
 degree of porosity. There appear to be (1) pores through which
 gases pass under pressure or by capillary transpiration, as in

 216            Prof. W. Bamsay on the Passage of
 dry wood and many minerals ; (2) pores through which gases
 do not pass under pressure, hut pass by their proper molecular
 movement of diffusion as in artificial graphite ; and (3) pores
 through which gases pass neither by capillary transpiration nor
 by their proper diffusive movement, but only after liquefaction,
 such as the pores of wrought metals and the finest pores of
 graphite."
    It is noteworthy that Graham considers that ¦ gases are
 liquefied in the pores of metals. But in the experiments here
 described this can hardly be the case. For at 270° and at
 higher temperatures hydrides of palladium do not exist, as is
 conclusively shown byTroost and Hautefeuille ; just as water
 does not exist in superheated steam. And yet it is at these
 temperatures that palladium is permeable to hydrogen, and
 not at temperatures at which hydride of palladium is stable.
    There are several facts which must be borne in mind in
 seeking for an interpretation for the phenomenon of the
 passage of hydrogen through palladium.
    First. The hydrogen in the act of passing is a reducing
 agent, as shown by its behaviour towards the oxides of
 nitrogen. At such temperatures as were here employed,
 hydrogen is without action on the lower oxides of nitrogen.
    Second. Bellati and Lussano have shown (Atti R. 1st.
  Ven. i. series vii. p. 1173) that hydrogen " diffuses " through
 an iron plate which is used as a negative electrode on electro
 lysing dilute sulphuric acid. Their observation has been
 confirmed and amplified by Shields (Chem. News, Ixv. p. 195).
 Shields has shown that neither lead nor platinum nor pal
 ladium allow hydrogen to pass under similar circumstances,
 and experiments made by myself show that nickel does not
 allow carbon monoxide to pass at temperatures at which that
compound is stable.
    Third. Iron and platinum, as shown by Deville and Debray
 {Compt. rend. lvii. p. 965), are permeable at a red heat to
hydrogen.
    I think these considerations prove that it is necessary to
 add a fourth class to the three classes suggested by Graham.
 Graham's first class involves actual holes, that is, passages
large in comparison with the molecular diameter ; his second
implies pores small compared with molecular diameter, but
still greatly exceeding that diameter ; his third class would be
termed " solid solution " in the present state of our knowledge,
i. e. when coal-gas passes through india-rubber, the latter
dissolves the gas on the side exposed to it, while the gas
evaporates from the other side, so as to render the pressure
of the dissolved gas equal on both sides of the membrane.

             Hydrogen through a Palladium Septum.             217
The case is precisely analogous to the passage of water through
a semi-permeable diaphragm. But, in order that hydrogen
may pass through iron, it must be in the state in which it is
liberated by an electric current, or it must be hot. That
hydrogen will not pass through palladium at the ordinary
temperature appears to show that the compound of palladium
and hydrogen has practically no dissociation pressure at
ordinary temperature ; otherwise the hydrogen would pass by
solution, in the same manner as coal-gas passes through
india-rubber, or water through a semi-permeable diaphragm.
That it will not pass, even when liberated by an electric
current on one side of the palladium membrane, shows that it
at once enters into combination with the palladium, and is no
longer in statu nascendi, to use a generally understood ex
pression which is independent of theory. But that it passes
through hot palladium appears to show that it is then in a
state analogous to that of electrically liberated hydrogen.
    It is known that electrified bodies are discharged if a flame
burns in their vicinity.       This may be attributed to the
liberation of atomic oxygen in a kind of Grotthus chain. For
it may be imagined that when a molecule of oxygen encounters
the oxidizable matter of a flame, it is dissociated : while one
atom serves to oxidize the carbon, the other exchanges with a
neighbouring molecule, and a succession of exchanges occur
till tho atomic oxygen near the electrified body receives or
communicates a charge, and restores the potential of the
charged body to that of surrounding objects.
    To ascertain whether a flame of oxygen burning in hydrogen
would similarly cause the hydrogen to assume the atomic state,
a piece of apparatus was contrived in which such a flame
burned in close proximity to a very thin iron plate, on the
other side of which a Torricellian vacuum was maintained.
No hydrogen passed through the plate : hence either the
hydrogen was not atomically transferred, as oxygen is sup
posed to be under similar circumstances, or such atoms were
unable to pass through the plate as they would have done if
liberated electrically. It must be noticed, however, that it is
conceivable that the double atom of hydrogen which we term
a molecule may have united directly with the oxygen, without
separating into its two components. The result of this ex
periment is therefore inconclusive.
    It appears to me necessary to suppose that at a temperature
far above that at which hydride of palladium is capable of
existence, the palladium has still the power of so attracting
the hydrogen that the molecule is split.         This necessarily
implies a gain of energy, so far as the splitting of the

218                    Prof. M. P. Rudski on
hydrogen molecule is concerned, for any energy lost by the
temporary and transient union of hydrogen and palladium
is at once gained during its escape on the other side of the
partition. But the hydrogen in expanding, which it does on
passing through the partition, loses energy, and hence, on the
whole, energy will probably be lost during the process. It
is to such theories, 1 think, that we must look to explain the
passage of hydrogen through a palladium diaphragm.
    (2) In answering the question why the pressure raised by
the entering hydrogen is never equal to that of the atmosphere,
I think it must be admitted that the gas contained in the
palladium vessel is not without influence on the passage of
the hydrogen. A diminution of the pressure of the external
hydrogen by the addition of nitrogen considerably increases
the partial pressure of the internal hydrogen. Here the
action of external nitrogen apparently neutralizes partially
 the effect of the internal nitrogen, and more hydrogen pene
trates the metallic diaphragm. With gases other than
nitrogen in the interior, the pressure of the hydrogen
becomes more nearly equal to that on the exterior. The
constancy of the results, however, proves that the deficiency
is not due to experimental error.
    This whole subject is full of difficulty. Experiments are
 in progress on the absorption of gases by platinum, and on
the passage of gases through other metallic diaphragms, which
may ultimately render an explanation possible. But I have
thought it desirable to place these experiments on record,
incomplete as they are, rather than wait for a complete
solution to the problem.
    I cannot conclude without acknowledging the able manner
in which my late assistant, Mr. Fercy Williams, has aided me
in carrying out these experiments.
             XXIII. Note on the Rigidity of the Earth.
                   By M. P. Rudski, Odessa*.
PROF. NEWCOMB f has estimated the Rigidity of the
        Earth from the observed 427 days' % period of the Vari
ations of Latitude, and found it to be somewhat greater than
that of steel. His estimation being a rough one, I have
undertaken a more precise calculation with the help of the
formulas of Thomson and Tait.

                     the Rigidity of the Earth.               219
   Prof. Newcomb begins with the remark that the condition
for the possibility of the 427 days' period is, that the pole of
the principal axis shall be at a distance from the North Pole
[that is from the point which wonld be the pole of rotation
and inertia if the perturbation did not exist] eqnal to 4 of the
distance between the pole of rotation and the North Pole.
(See fig. 1.) Thus the pole of rotation B revolves in nearly
                                  F«.l.

 305 days about the pole of inertia P', but this latter and also
 R revolve about the North Pole in 427 days. The little
 circle is rolling on the greater.
    The precise statement of the problem is the following :—
    The equations of motion relatively to axes revolving with
 angular velocities p, q, r are of course :
 Suppose that the body is elastic, that x0, yn, z0 are the coordi
nates of particles belonging to their undisturbed positions,
 suppose that f, tj, £" are the displacements, suppose that the
revolving axes are fixed relatively to the coordinates x0,y0,z0,
then x0, yoj eo are constants, and as
                                x=x0 + ^,

    Further, neglecting f, rj, f in comparison with x0, y0, z0,

 220                  Prof. M. P. Rudski on
 and writing again for a0, y0, z0, x, y, z, we have the equa
 tions :—
    The precise integration of these equations is impossible,
but we may avail ourselves of the circumstance that in the
 present problem the quantities
                            dt[ dv rf?
                            dt' dt' dt
are quite insignificant in comparison to other terms. We
put
                         dt dt dt         '
we remark further that the terms
                    -y-r +z<-t:, and similar,

the equations to the form :

where a> is the angular velocity about the axis R, which in
the present problem is evidently constant. Further, the
forces X contain the attraction of the particles and the com
ponents of elastic forces. So we may write our equations in
the form

  V4 is the known Laplacian symbol.
    V may now be divided in two parts, the first corresponding
to the potential of the unstrained body, the other containing
all the terms which arise in consequence of the deformation :
so we may write
                                v=v1+v2.
    On the other hand, with the help of the formula
                               a«+6s+ca=l,
we may write for

                              a* + &2,  l-c*.
Now if the Z axis of coordinates coincides with the polar
axis of the earth corresponding to the unstrained state, the
potential
exerts no deformation, so that in equations (I.) V reduces to
 V2 and <f> becomes
$= -         [>V + y262 + s2 (c2 - 1) + 2xy ab + 2xz ac + 2yz be] .
We see that (j> is a solid harmonic of the second degree.
     But the disturbing potential is

Here we have made the supposition that the body is incom
pressible. [R means the mean radius of the Earth.]
    We must now calculate the products and the moments of
inertia about old axes after deformation.
   As this calculation implies the knowledge of the displace
ments, we sball take the expressions of the displacements
given by Thomson and Tait* for the case of a sphere
   Before calculating the products of inertia we remark that
the deformation is evidently symmetrical with respect to the
plane passing through the axis of z and the axis of rotation.
   Hence, taking this plane for the plane XZ t, we obtain
first, if D, E, F are the products of inertia,

                     the Rigidity of the Earth.             223
   Now, by a known theorem, if
                             D = F = 0,
the moments of inertia about the new principal axes are the
roots of the equation
        (H-A)*a + (H-B)y4+(H-C)2* + 2E«=0, (V.)
where A, B, C are the given moments about the old axes.
   In the present case we may put
                               A=B.
   Now, if the angle between the axis of the new greatest
moment of inertia and the axis of z is 0, then by the trans
formation
                       x=Xi cos 0 + sin 0,
                       z= — Xx s'm 0 + Zx cos 0,
we may easily find the angle 0 from the formula V. We
obtain
                           tan 20=-~^                     (VI.)
    But by definition the angle 0 ({POP') is equal to f of
 the angle POR, and
                            c=cos(POR)
                           a = sin (POR)
   As the angles POR and POP' are very small, their cosines
 are nearly equal to unity, and their sines are nearly equal to
the arcs ; but the arc POR is equal to \ of the arc POP'
 [the arc ff]. Hence, neglecting small quantities of second
 order, we obtain from the formula VI.
                      i                                  (VII }
                      7~19n + fypR' 0 0011 ' ' ' ' ^          '
    But Prof. Newcomb thinks that one fourth of the angle
 POP' may be attributed to the influence of the Ocean.
 Further, as the product of inertia E standing in the nume
 rator of the right-hand member of VI. depends principally
on the deformation of superficial layers, and for that reason
the mean density in E must be smaller than the mean density
of the Earth—we must multiply the right-hand member of
VII. by a factor smaller than unity. We take, with Prof.
Newcomb, the mean effective density to be 0*6 of that of
steel, i. e. 4-68, and multiply the right-hand member of Vll.
with '       .  It is to be remarked that by the meaning of

224              Note an the Rigidity of the Earth.
mean densities p contained in VII., they are all to be
taken inferior to the mean density of the "Earth. Now the
formula VII. changes to
                   3_           2 x 4-68 x m8
                   7    5-5 x 0-0011 [i9- + 2#r]
       m = 46,500 centim. per sec,
      E= 637,000,000 centim.,
       <7 = 981 centim. per sec.
      p = 4-68 [Prof. Newcomb's effective mean density].
With these data,
                             n=1615xl09.
This coefficient of rigidity is nearly twice as great as the
coefficient of rigidity of steel after Everett [819 X 109] . By
certain combinations of the chosen effective mean densities
in the numerator and denominator of VII., also putting again
j- instead of f in the left-hand member, we may render the
coefficient of rigidity smaller. But it remains much greater
than the coefficient for steel.
    The proof of the rigidity of the Earth from the tidal pheno
mena was subject to certain doubts *, but now it is strongly
supported by the test of the phenomenon of Variation of
Latitudes.
    M. Gylden f has presented some objections to the views
of Lord Kelvin and Prof. Newcomb. Without discussing
his paper, we remark only that we can interpret his analysis
as corresponding to the case of an absolutely rigid earth with
certain fluid or generally mobile parts. Of course he has
found that these mobile parts must be greater than the
Oceans. We have taken the Earth as incompressible. It is
known that this assumption has a very little influence on
the final results. In a quite similar case, that of the tidal
problem, Mr. Love \ has obtained nearly the same results on
the hypothesis of compressibility [m = 2n] as on the hypo
thesis of perfect incompressibility [m=» j.

XXIV. On the Electrification of Air. Bi/ Lord Kelvin,
       P.R.S., and Magnus Maclean, M.A., F.R.S.E.*
§ 1. rr^HAT air can be electrified either positively or nega-
         JL     tively is obvious from the fact that an isolated
spherule of pure water, electrified either positively or nega
tively, can be wholly evaporated in airf. Thirty-four years
ago it was pointed out by one of us % as probable that, in
ordinary natural atmospheric conditions, the air for some
considerable height above the earth's surface is electrified §
   * Communicated by tho Authors ; having been read before the Royal
Society, May 31, 1894.
   t This demonstrates an affirmative answer to the question, Can a
molecule of a gas be charged with electricity ? (J. J. Thomson, ' Recent
Researches in Electricity and Magnetism,' § 36, p. .53), and shows that
the experiments referred to as pointing to the opposite conclusion are to
be explained otherwise.
   Since this was written we find, in the 'Electrical Review' of May 18,
on page 571, in a lecture by Elihu Thomson, the following:—"It is
known that as we leave the surface of the earth and rise in the air there is
an increase of positive potential with respect to the ground              It is
not clearly proven that a pure gas, rarefied or not, can receive and convey
a charge. If we imagine a charged drop of water suspended in air and
evaporating, it follows that, unless the charge be carried off in the vapour,
the potential of the drop would rise steadily as its surface diminished,
and would become infinite as the drop disappeared, unless the charge
were dissipated before the complete drying up of the drop by dispersion
of the drop itself, or conveyance of electricity by its vapour. The charge
would certainly require to pass somewhere, and might leave the air and
vapour charged."
   It is quite clear that " must " ought to be substituted for " might '' iu
this last line. Thus the vagueness and doubts expressed in the first part
of the quoted statement are annulled by the last three sentences of it.
   \ " Even in fair weather the intensity of the electric force in the air
near the earth's surface is perpetually fluctuating. The speaker had often
observed it, especially during calms or very light breezes from the east,
varying from 40 Daniell's elements per foot to three or four times that
amount during a few minutes, and returning again as rapidly to the lower
amount. More frequently ho had observed variations from about 30 to
about 40, and back again, recurring in uncertain periods of perhaps about
two minutes. These gradual variations cauuot but be produced by elec
trified masses of air or cloud, floating by the locality of observation."—
Lord Kelvin's ' Electrostatics and Magnetism,' art. xvi. § 282.
   § " The out-of-doors air potential, as tested by n portable electrometer
in an open place, or even by a water-dropping nozzle outside, two or
three feet from the walls of the lecture-room, was generally on these
occasions positive, and the earth's surface itself therefore, of course, nega
tive—the common fair-weather condition—which I am forced to conclude
is due to a paramount influence of positive electricity in higher regions of
the air, notwithstanding the negative electricity of the air in the lower

226         Lord Kelvin and Mr. Magnus Maclean on
and that the incessant variations of electrostatic force which
he had observed, minute after minute, during calms and light
winds, and often under a cloudless sky, were due to motions
of large quantities of positively or negatively electrified air in
 the immediate neighbourhood of the place of observation.
    § 2. It was proved* by observations in the Old College of
 Glasgow University that the air was in general negatively
electrified, not only indoors, within the old lecture-room f of
Natural Philosophy, but also in the out-of-doors space of the
College Court, open to the sky though closed around with
high buildings, and between it and the top of the College
 Tower. The Old College was in a somewhat low situation,
surrounded by a densely crowded part of a great city. In
 the new University buildings, crowning a hill on the western
boundary of Glasgow, similar phenomena, though with less
 general prevalence of negative electricity in the air, have been
observed, both indoors, in the large Bute Hall, and in many
other smaller rooms, and out-of-doors, in the court, which is
somewhat similar to the courts of the Old College, but much
larger. It is possible that the negative electricity found
thirty years ago in the air of the Old College may have been
due to its situation, surrounded by houses with their fires, and
smoking factory-chimneys. In the New College much of the
prevalence of negative electricity in air within doors has, how
ever, been found to be due to electrification by the burning
lamp J used with the quadrant-electrometer ; and more
recent observations, with electrification by flame absolutely
excluded, throw doubt on the old conclusion, that both in
town and country negative electrification is the prevailing
condition of natural atmospheric air in the lower regions of
the atmosphere.
    § 3. The electric ventilation found in the Old College, and
described in § 291* of ' Electrostatics and Magnetism,' accord
ing to which air drawn through a chink, less than £-inch
wide, of a slightly open window or door, into a large room
stratum near the earth's mrface. On the two or three occasions when
the in-door atmospheric electricity was found positive, and therefore the
surface of the floor-walls and ceiling negative, the potential outside was
certainly positive, and the earth's surface out-of-doors negative, as usual
in fine weather."—Ibid. § 300.

corresponding results. It has also been extended to the
drawing in of electrified air through a tube to the enclosure
represented in fig. 1 of the present paper ; with the result
that the water-dropping test indicated in the sketch amply
sufficed to show the electrification, and verify that it was
always the same as that of the air outside. When the tube
was filled with loosely packed cotton-wool the electrification
of the entering air was so nearly annulled as to be insensible
to the test.

the present communication was to find if a small unchanged
portion of air could be electrified sufficiently to show its elec
trification by ordinary tests, and could keep its electrification
for any considerable time ; and to test whether or not dust in
the air is essential to whatever of electrification might be
observed in such circumstances, or is much concerned in it.
   § 5. The arrangement for the experiments is shown in the
diagram (fig. 1). A A is a large sheet-iron vat inverted on
                              Fig. 1.

and one for the charging wire D. Both the water-dropper
and the charging wire, ending with a pin-point as sharp as
possible, are insulated by solid paraffin, which is surrounded
by a metal tube, as shown in half size in fig. 2. To start
                             Fig. 2.
with they were supported by pieces of vulcanite embedded in
paraffin. But it was found that after the lapse of some days
(possibly on account of ozone generated by the incessant
brush-discharges), the insulation had utterly failed in both of
them. The vulcanite pieces were then taken out, and solid
paraffin, with the metal guard-tube round it to screen it from
electrically influencing the water-dropper, was substituted.
This has proved quite satisfactory : the water-dropper, with
the flow of water stopped, holds a positive or a negative
charge for hours.
   § 6. A quadrant-electrometer E (described in 'Electro
statics and Magnetism/ §§ 346-353) was set up on the top
of the vat near the water-dropper, as shown in fig. 1. It was
used with lamp and semi-transparent scale to indicate the

                      the Electrification of Air.             229
 difference of potential between the water-dropper and the vat.
 The sensibility of the electrometer was 21 scale-divisions
  (half-millimetres) per volt ; and as the scale was 90 centim.
 long, difference of potentials up to 43 volts, positive or nega
 tive, could be read by adjusting the metallic zero to the
 middle of the scale. A frictional plate-electric machine was
 used, and by means of it, in connexion with the pin-point,
 the air inside the vat could be electrified either positively or
 negatively.
    § 7. The vat was fixed in position in the Apparatus Boom
 of the Natural Philosophy Department of the University of
 Glasgow on the 13th of December, 1893, and for more than
 three months the air inside was left undisturbed except by
 discharges from the pin-point through the electrifying wire,
 and by the spray from the water-dropper. Thus the air was
 becoming more and more freed of dust day by day. Yet at
 the end of the four months we found that the air was as easily
 electrified, either positively or negatively, as it was at the
 beginning ; and that if we electrify it strongly by turning
 the machine for half-an-hour, it retains a considerable portion
 of this electrification for several hours.
    § 8. Observations were taken almost daily since the 13th
 December ; but the following, taken on the 8th of February,
 the 12th of March, and the 23rd of April, will serve as
 specimens, the results being shown in each case by a curve.
 At all these dates the air must have been very free from dust.
 Both during the charging and during the observations the
 case of the electrometer and one pair of quadrants are kept
 metallically connected to the vat. During the charging the
 water-dropper and the other pair of quadrants were also kept
 in connexion with the vat. Immediately after the charging
 was stopped the charging wire was connected metallically to
 the outside of the vat, and left so with its sharp point
 unchanged in its position inside the vat during all the
observations.
    § 9. Curve 1. February 8, 1894.—The friction-plate
machine was turned positive for half-an-hour. Ten minutes
after the machine stopped the water-dropper was filled and
joined to one pair of quadrants of the electrometer, while the
other pair was joined to the case of the instrument. The
first reading on the curve was taken four minutes after
wards, that is fourteen minutes after the machine stopped
running (18 volts).
    Curve 2. March 3, 1894.—The friction-plate machine was
turned positive for five minutes. The water-dropper was
filled and joined to the electrometer immediately after the

machine stopped turning. The spot was off the scale, and
nine minutes elapsed before it appeared on the scale. The
first reading on the curve was taken one minute after
wards, or ten minutes after the machine stopped turning
(35-25 volts).
    Curve 3. March 12, 1894.—A Voss induction -machine
was joined to the charging wire, and run by an electric motor
for 4 hours 19 minutes. A test was applied at the beginning
of the run to make sure that it was charging negatively ; and
a similar test when it was disconnected from the charging
wire in the vat showed it to be still charging negatively.
The water-dropper was joined to the electrometer, and the
spot appeared on the scale immediately. The first reading
on the curve was taken half a minute after the machine was
disconnected (30"65 voltsj

232       Lord Kelvin and Mr. Magnus Maclean on
    Curve 4. April 23, 1894.—The friction-plate machine
was turned positive for 30 seconds, with water-dropper
running and joined to the electrometer. 20 seconds after the
machine stopped the spot appeared on the scale, and the
reading 1^ minutes after the machine stopped turning is the
first point on the curve (7"3 volts).
    Curve 5. April 23, 1894.—The friction-plate machine
was turned negative for 30 seconds, with the water-dropper
running and joined to the electrometer. 10 seconds after
wards the spot appeared on the scale, and the reading 70
seconds after the machine stopped turning is the first point
 on the curve (7-6 volts).
   The curves show, what we alwaj-s found, that the air does
not retain a negative electrification so long as it retains a
positive. We also found, by giving equal numbers of turns
to the machine that the immediately resulting difference of
potential between the water-dropper and the vat was greater
for the negative than for the positive electrification ; though
the quantity received from the machine was probably less in
the case of the negative electrification, because the negative
conductor was less well insulated than the positive.
    § 10. On the 21st of March, two U-tnbes were put in below
the edge of the vat, one on either side, so that it might be
possible to blow dusty, or smoky, or dustless air into the vat.
To one tube was fitted a blowpipe-bellows, and by placing it
on (he top of a box in which brown paper and rosin were
burning, the vat was filled with smoky air. Again, several
layers of cotton-wool were placed on the mouth of the bellows,
so as to get dustless air into the vat. The bellows were worked
for several hours on four siiccessive days, and we found no
appreciable difference (1) in the ease with which the air
could be electrified by discharges from the wire connected to
the electric machine, and (2) in the length of time the air
retains its electrification.
   But it was found that, as had been observed four years ago
with the same apparatus*, with the water-dropper insulated
and connected to the electrometer, and no electrification of
any kind to begin with, a negative electrification amounting
to four, five, or six volts gradually supervened if the water-
dropper was kept running for 60 or 70 minutes, through air
which was dusty, or natural, to begin with. It was also found,
as in the observations of four years ago, that no electrification
of this kind was produced by the dropping of the water
through air purified of dust.

in the drawing was made for the purpose of acting as a trap
to prevent the natural dusty air of the locality from entering
the vat when the water-dropper ran empty.
   § 11. The equilibrium of electrified air within a space
enclosed by a fixed bounding surface of conducting material
presents an interesting illustration of elementary hydrostatic
principles. The condition to be fulfilled is simply that the
surfaces of equal electric " volume-density " are surfaces of
equal potential, if we assume that the material density of the
air at given temperature and pressure is not altered by elec
trification. This assumption we temporarily make from want
of knowledge ; but it is quite possible that experiment may
prove that it is not accurately true ; and it is to be hoped that
experimental investigation will be made for answering this
very interesting question.
   § 12. For stable equilibrium it is further necessary that the
electric density, if not uniform throughout, diminishes from
the bounding surface inwards. Hence if there is a portion of
non-electrified air in the enclosure, it must be wholly sur
rounded by electrified air.
   § 1 3. We may form some idea of the absolute value of the
electric density, and of the electrostatic force in different parts
 of the enclosure, in the electrifications found in our experi
ments, by considering instead of our vat a spherical enclosure
of diameter intermediate between the diameter and depth of
 the vat which we used. Consider, for example, a spherical
space enclosed in metal of 100 centim. diameter, and let the
nozzle of the water-dropper be so placed that the stream
breaks into drops at the centre of the space. The potential
shown by the electrometer connected with it, being the differ
 ence between the potentials of the air at the boundary and
at the centre, will be the difference of the potentials at the
centre due respectively to the total quantity of electricity dis
tributed through the air and the equal and opposite quantity
 on the inner boundary of the enclosing metal ; and we there
 fore have the formula :—
                    V=4^Bp£ -£)*,,
where V denotes the potential indicated by the water-dropper,
a the radius of the spherical hollow, and p the electric density
of the air at distance r from the centre. Supposing now, for
example, p to be constant from the surface to the centre
 (which may be nearly the case after long electrification as
performed in our experiments), we find V = §n-pa2 ; whence
p = 3V/27ra2.

234               On tlte Electrification of Air.
   To particularize further, suppose the potential to have been
38 volts or 0-127 electrostatic C.G.S. (which is less than the
greatest found in our experiments) and take a = 50 centim. :
we find p = 2*4x 10-5. The electrostatic force at distance r
from the centre, being $ vpr, is therefore equal to 10~4r.
Hence a small body electrified with a quantity of electricity
equal to that possessed by a cubic centimetre of the air, and
placed midway (r=25) between the surface and centre of the
enclosure, experiences a force equal to 2*4 x 10~9 25, or
6 x 10~8, or approximately 6 x 10-5 grammes weight. This is
48 per cent, of the force of gravity on a cubic centimetre of
air of density 1/800.
   § 14. Hence we see that, on the supposition of electric
density uniform throughout the spherical enclosure, each
cubic centimetre of air experiences an electrostatic force
towards the boundary in simple proportion to distance from
the centre, and amounting at the boundary to nearly 10 per
cent, of the force of gravity upon it ; and electric forces of
not very dissimilar magnitudes must have acted on the air
electrified as it actually was in the non-spherical enclosure
used in our experiments. If natural air or cloud, close to the
ground or in the lower regions of the earth's atmosphere, is
ever, as in all probability it often is, electrified to as great a
degree of electric density as we have found it within our
experimental vat, the natural electrostatic force in the atmo
sphere, due as it is, no doubt, to positive electricity in very
high regions, must exercise an important ponderomotive force
quite comparable in magnitude with that due to difference of
temperatures in different positions.
   It is interesting to remark that negatively electrified air
over negatively electrified ground, and with non-electrified
air above it, in an absolute calm, would be in unstable equili
brium ; and the negatively electrified air would therefore rise,
probably in large masses, through the non-electrified air up
to the higher regions, where the positive electrification is
supposed to reside. Even with no stronger electrification
than that which we have had within our experimental vat,
the moving forces would be sufficient to produce instability
comparable with that of air warmed by the ground and rising
through colder air above.
   § 15. During a thunderstorm the electrification of air, or
of air and the watery spherules constituting cloud, need not
be enormously stronger than that found in our experiments.
This we see by considering that if a uniformly electrified globe
of a metre diameter produces a difference of potential of
38 volts between its surface and centre, a globe of a kilometre

         Electric Discharge in Liquid Oxygen, Air, §c.       235
diameter, electrified to the same electric density, reckoned
according to the total electricity in any small volume (elec
tricity of air and of spherules of water, if there are any in it),
would produce a difference of potential of 38 million volts
between its surface and centre. In a thunderstorm, flashes
of lightning show us differences of potential of millions of
volts, but not perhaps of many times 38 million volts, between
places of the atmosphere distant from one another by half a
kilometre.
XXV. Preliminary Note on tlie Spectrum of the Electric
   Discharge in Liquid Oxygen, Air, and Nitrogen. By
   Professors Liveing and Dewar*.
IN making the experiments here described we desired, if
      possible, to observe the emission-spectra of the several
substances, stimulated by the electric discharge, while at
temperatures of 1 80° to 200° below zero. It seemed probable
that the characters of these spectra would give some indica
tions of the physical state of the substances operated on.
   In order to prevent the rapid heating of the electrodes by
the discharge, they were made of considerable size. One was
a disk of platinum about one centimetre in diameter, convex
on one side, and having its convexity turned towards the
other electrode, which was made of a piece of platinum wire
about two millimetres thick. Even these electrodes were
much heated, became red-hot when they were not in the
liquid, but the spark passed through the gas immediately
above the liquid. When actually immersed in the liquid
they could hardly have been, except locally at the point of
discharge, at any temperature sensibly different from that of
the liquid. Experiments were made also with electrodes of
aluminium, but with no different results as regards the spec
trum except the introduction of the shaded bands due to
alumina instead of the lines of platinum.
   The liquids experimented on were contained in double test-
tubes of large dimensions, having the space between the two
tubes highly exhausted. The electrodes, insulated, except at
the extremities, by glass tubing and wax or gutta-percha,
were passed through a rubber-stopper which closed the tube.
Through this stopper was also passed a glass tube, which was
left open while experiments were made at the atmospheric
pressure, but was connected with a powerful rotary air-pump
when it was desired to exhaust the gas in the tube.

236       Profs. Liveing and Dewar on tlie Spectrum of
   Liquid oxygen, air, and nitrogen, like non-elect rolysable
compound liquids, offer very great resistance to the passage
of an electric discharge, so that with a powerful induction-coil
we could hardly make the spark pass through a thickness of
one millimetre of liquid. When the thickness of liquid tra
versed was less than this, a succession of sparks could be
maintained ; but the resistance appeared to be very great, and
the disruptive effect on the electrodes sufficient to discolour
the liquid by the particles thrown off their surfaces.
   The discharge through the liquid in all cases gave a con
tinuous spectrum and some bright lines traceable to the
electrodes, while the rays which we suppose to have been
emitted by the molecules of the liquid were less conspicuous.
It seems not unlikely, therefore, that the continuous spectrum
was due to the particles thrown off the electrodes.
                         Liquid Oxygen.
   When both electrodes were immersed in liquid oxygen
boiling at atmospheric pressure, and therefore at about
— 180° 0., and the distance between the electrodes about
one millimetre or less, the spectrum of the spark, without jar,
was chiefly a continuous one, brightest in the yellowish-green
but extending for some distance both on the red and on the
blue side. The absorption-bands of oxygen were conspicuous
on this bright background. A few bright lines were also
seen, of which the most prominent were three in the green
and yellowish-green, with the approximate wave-lengths
505, 533, and 547. These lines were not much brighter than
the continuous spectrum. Glimpses of other lines were seen,
but too faint and intermittent to be measured. Of these lines
that with wave-length about 533 is no doubt due to oxygen,
for it is described as a triple line of the discharge in vacuous
oxygen tubes by Piazzi Smyth, and as a double line by
Schuster. The other two lines appear to be lines of platinum,
5059 and two lines 5475, 5478, according to Thalen.
   The introduction of a Leyden jar into the circuit increased
the brilliance both of the continuous spectrum and of the
lines, or of some of them, and brought out some additional
lines ; but the intermittent character of the sparks made it
almost impossible to measure the places of any of the lines.
   When the discharge from a Wimshurst machine was used
instead of that from the coil, only a continuous spectrum,
with the usual oxygen absorptions, was seen. No bright
lines could be detected on the continuous spectrum.
   By keeping only the lower electrode (the convex disk)
immersed in the liquid, so that the spark passed partly

       the Electric Discharge in Liquid Oxygen, Air, Sfc.    237
through the liquid and partly through the gas immediately
above it, the discharge took place more easily, and the con
tinuous spectrum became, relatively to the lines, less bright.
Without the jar, however, the spectrum had generally the
same character as before. The three lines above mentioned
were still the most conspicuous bright lines. On putting the
jar into the circuit, however, many more bright lines came
out. The well-known orange line of oxygen, X6171, ap
peared expanded into a band with its sharper edge on the
more refrangible side at a wave-length of about 615, and
fading towards the red but traceable as far as A. 6 18. Schuster
and Piazzi Smyth give a compound line at about wave-length
X6156; and it is possible that this band may represent this
compound line. It will be noticed that, as to the shading, it
follows the character of A and B, but with the dispersion we
used it was not possible to Tesolve it into lines. Probably,
under the circumstances, the lines of which we may suppose
 the band composed would be so much expanded as to overlap
 one another. Besides this band, blue lines were conspicuous
 at wave-lengths about 435, 441, 459, 465, 470, all corre
 sponding to known lines of oxygen. The green lino of
 platinum at wave-length about 530 came out brightly, as
 well as platinum lines at about X583 and X580. Another
 line, less bright, appeared at wave-length about 557, and at
 times a second line near it at about 555. These have not
 been described as oxygen lines by other observers, but they
 fall within one of the green bands described by Schuster as
 seen in the negative glow in a vacuous oxygen tube.
    We next proceeded to exhaust the gas above the liquid in
 the vessel, until the pressure was reduced to about 1 centim.
 of mercury. The liquid, of course, boiled away fast until the
 temperature had fallen to something like — 200° ; and the
 gas at the reduced pressure offered comparatively little resist
 ance to the passage of the discharge.
    So long as both electrodes were immersed in the liquid, the
 reduction of pressure and of temperature did not make any
 marked difference in the appearance of the spectrum. But
 as the liquid evaporated and only the lower electrode was
 immersed, so that the discharge was partly through the gas,
 the continuous spectrum was much weakened, and two bright
 green bands came out extending from about X521 to X531,
 and from about X 553 to X561. This was without a jar in
 the circuit. The bands were nearly uniformly bright with
 both edges diffuse. They were much better seen when both
 electrodes were out of the liquid, and were brightest in the
 glow which surrounded the poles. They were equally well

238      Profs. Liveing and Dewar on tlie Spectrum of
seen in the glow about both poles, and equally well when the
electrodes were cold, and when they were hot, even red-hot.
There was a third much fainter band in the orange a little
less refrangible than the D lines of sodium. There is no
doubt that these bands are the same as have been described
by Schuster in the negative glow in a vacuous oxygen-tube.
   When a jar was put in the circuit, these bands disappeared
or nearly so. While one electrode remained in the liquid, a
good many bright lines came out on putting the jar into the
circuit. One of these was a line at wave-length about 557,
the same as previously seen, nearly in the middle of one of
the green bands. In fact, it seemed to replace the band when
the jar was put into the circuit. It was not, however, so
permanently seen as some of the other lines. Only a few of
these other lines were measured. One appeared to be an
oxygen line at about X 54-1 ; a pair at about \ 566 may have
been air-lines as the oxygen usually contains a little air.
Another was a platinum line about X 455.
   The line above mentioned, \ 557, appears to be of some
interest because it falls very near the place of the auroral liDe,
and the conditions under which it is produced resemble, in
regard to the low temperature, and to some extent in regard
to the pressure, those in which Auroras are produced.
The place of this line was measured several times, but the
circumstances of these experiments were not very favourable
for exact measurements. The measure which we marked as
the best gave a wave-length for the line 5572, but other
measures gave figures between that and 5578. It seems,
therefore, not improbable that this line may be identical with
the auroral line, of which the exact wave-length cannot even
now be said to be quite certainly determined, but which has
probably the value 5571.
   The identity of the line we have observed with the auroral
line cannot be said to be proved as yet. Further observation
is needed, and we hope to carry our experiments further.
The broad green bands do not seem to be connected with a
low temperature, but were produced by the discharge without
a jar ; this line was, so far as we observed, only produced
when one electrode was immersed in the liquid, and therefore
cold, and when a jar was in circuit.
   The passage of tlie discharge through the liquid produced
much ozone. Not only was the smell of ozone very strong,
but the liquid took the indigo tint, deeper than the blue of
ordinary oxygen, which is characteristic of ozone. On one
occasion, after the sparks had been passed through the liquid
for a short time, an explosion ensued which shattered the

       the Electric Discharge in Liquid Oxygen, Air, fyc.    239
vessel. We can assign no cause for this, unless it were an
explosion of ozone.
                           Liquid Air.
    The effects of a discharge through liquid air were very
similar to those produced with liquid oxygen, so long as the
pressure was that of the atmosphere, and no jar was in circuit.
There was the same continuous spectrum. When a jar was
used a much larger number of lines, generally resembling the
ordinary air-lines, were seen but not measured. When the
pressure was reduced, the usual banded spectrum of nitrogen
was seen, and was strong relatively to the spectrum of oxygen.
As the liquid evaporated, and thereby lost more nitrogen than
oxygen, the two green bands due to oxygen appeared to be
come stronger actually as well as relatively to the nitrogen
bands.
    In this case the discharge produced oxides of nitrogen,
 which were detected in the residual gas when the air had all
 evaporated.
                         Liquid Nitrogen.
    We next tried liquid nitrogen. At the pressure of the
 atmosphere, both electrodes in the liquid, and no jar, the
 spectrum was continuous with three bright lines in the green
 and yellowish-green, generally resembling the three lines seen
 in liquid oxygen. On taking measures of their wave-lengths
 it was found that they were platinum lines, the same as had
 been seen in oxygen at wave-lengths about 505, 530, and 547.
 The oxygen line at 533 was not seen. Besides these three
 lines, a faint very diffuse line was observed at about X 501,
 and glimpses of blue bands of the usual banded spectrum of
 nitrogen. When only one electrode was immersed in the
 liquid, the line at about X 501 was more distinct. We have
 no doubt that this represents the strong double line of nitrogen
 in that position. When the jar was in the circuit, the spec
 trum was a series of bright lines similar to those given by
 gaseous nitrogen at atmospheric pressure.
     When the gas above the liquid was pumped out until the
 pressure fell to about 1 centim. of mercury, one or both elec
 trodes being immersed, and no jar used, the band-spectrum
 of nitrogen appeared. On putting on the jar this was re
 placed mainly by the line-spectrum.
                 Spectrum of the Spark in Water.
     For the sake of comparison we next observed the spectrum
 of the spark between platinum electrodes in distilled water at
 the ordinary temperature and pressure. When no jar was

240                      Geological Society :—
used the spectrum was continuous, with the red line (C) of
hydrogen conspicuous, and the F line just visible, and
glimpses of the three platinum lines in the green and yellowish-
green. When the jar was put into the circuit the hydrogen
lines became very diffuse, but the platinum lines came out
much more distinctly, and the readings proved their identity.
There were no lines which we could identify with oxygen lines.
   The water became quite brown with the particles thrown
off the platinum wires used as electrodes.

Mr. C. J. Alford, F.G.S., in explanation of specimens of auriferous
rocks from Mashonaland exhibited by him, stated that several of
them were vein-quartz occurring as segregations in the slates,
generally forming veins between the cleavage-planes. Another
specimen was a mass of chromate of lead, with pyromorphite and
other lead minerals, occurring in masses in decomposed and dislo
cated talcose slate in the Penhalonga Mine near Umtali, and probably
resulting from the alteration of masses of galena by weathering,
as a broken vein of galena was found in close proximity. This
Crocoisite was supposed to be a somewhat raro mineral, but he
had found it and also the native red oxide, Minium, in several places
in South Africa. The most interesting specimen was, however, a
mass of Diorite showing visiblo gold throughout the rock, an assay
of which gave upwards of 130 ounces of gold per ton. From
information obtained from the prospector who made the discovery,
ho gathered that the deposit was a dyke of Diorite running for a
considerable distance, about 8 feet in width, flanked on one side
by granite and on the other by slates. There were extensive
ancient workings extending to a depth of about 60 feet, and the
prospecting shafts had not gone much below that depth, bo not
much information was obtainable at present. The Diorite showed
a development of Epidote, but little or no quartz ; and the gold
appeared to enter in an extraordinary manner into all of the com
posing minerals. Mr. Alford hoped, after his next visit to Mashona
land, to be in a position to lay before the Society more definite
information regarding these interesting rocks.

   1. ' On some cases of the Conversion of Compact Greenstones

 (Engadine) some masses of compact green schist are seen, inter
 calated in a rather crushed gneiss. They prove to be intrusive dykes
 modified by pressure. Microscopic examination of specimens from
these reveals no trace of any definite structure indicating an igneous
rock ; a slice, cut from one of the masses within an inch or so of a
junction, shows it to be a foliated mass of minute chlorite or
hydrous biotite, with granules of epidote (or possibly some sphene)
and of a water-clear mineral, perhaps a secondary felspar. An actual
junction shows a less distinct foliation and somo approach to a
streaky structure. A slide from the middle of another dyke (about
18 inches thick) exhibits a more coarsely foliated structure and
minerals generally similar to the last, except that it may contain a
little actinolite and granules of haematite (?) and the clear mineral,
in some cases, seems to be quartz. The structure and most of the
minerals appear to be secondary. Chemical analysis shows the rock
to have been an andesite. A specimen from a third dyke is generally
similar, but is rather less distinctly foliated.
   A somewhat similar, but rather larger intrusive mass by the side
of the Lago Bianco shows more actinolite and signs of primary folspar,
with other minerals. Here the rock retains some likeness to a
diabase. The resemblance of certain of these rocks to somewhat
altered sediments is remarkable. The Author considers the bearing
of this evidence upon other and larger masses of ' green schist '
which occur in the Alps, and expresses tho opinion that their
present mineral structure may be the result of great pressure acting
on more or less basic igneous rocks.
   2. ' The Waldensian Gneisses and their Place in the Cottian
Sequence.' By J. Walter Gregory, D.Sc, F.G.S.
   The lower part of the sequence of the Cottian Alps has been
universally divided into three series, of which the lowest has been
regarded as a fundamental (basal) Laurentian gneiss. It is the
object of the present paper to show that this rock is really intrusive
in character and Upper Tertiary in ago. The writer endeavours to
show this by the following line of argument:—(1) The gneiss con
sists of only isolated outcrops instead of a continuous band, and these
occur at different positions and not always at tho base of the schist
series ; (2; the gneiss is intrusive, because : (a) it includes fragments
of the overlying series instead of vice versa, (6) it sends off dykes of
aplite into the surrounding schists, (p) it metamorphoses the rocks
with which it is in contact, and (d) the schists are contorted near
the junction ; (3) the gneisses are further shown to be later than
the igneous rocks intrusive into tho ' pietre verdi ' series, as these
never traverse the gneiss.
   No positive opinion as to the age of the overlying schists is
expressed in tho paper, though it is pointed out that the recent dis
covery of radiolarian muds in the series may necessitate their
inclusion in the Upper Palaeozoic. The freshness of tho gneisses,
the fact that these have not been affected by the early Tertiary

their late Tertiary age highly probable.

    1. ' On the ^Relations of the Basic and Acid Hocks of the Tertiary
 Volcanic Series of the Inner Hebrides.' By Sir Archibald Geikie,
D.Sc., LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    After an introductory sketch of his connexion with the inves
 tigation of the Tertiary volcanic rocks of Britain, the Author
 proceeds to describe tho structure of the ground at the head of Glen
 Sligachan, Skye, which has recently been cited by Prof. Judd as
 affording inclusions of Tertiary granite in the gabbro, and as thus
 demonstrating that the latter is the younger rock. He first shows
 that the gabbro, instead of being one eruptive mass, consists of
 numerous thin beds and sills of different varieties of gabbro, some
  of which were injected into the others. These various sheets,
  often admirably banded, can be seen to be truncated by the line of
 junction with the great granophyre-tract of Glen Sligachan. A large
  mass of coarse agglomerate is likewise cut off along the same line.
  These structures are entirely opposed to the idea of the gabbro being
  an eruptive mass which has broken through the granophyre. They
  can only be accounted for, either by a fault which has brought the
  two rocks together, or by the acid rock having disrupted the basic.
  But there is ample evidenco that no fault occurs at the boundary-
 line.
     The granophyre becomes fine-grained, felsitic, and spherulitic
  along its margin, where it abuts against the complex mass of
  basic rocks. These structures continue altogether independent of
  tho varying distribution of the gabbros, and are seen even whero
  the granophyre runs along the side of tho agglomerate. Similar
  structures are of common occurrence along the margins of the
  granophyre-bosses and sills of the Inner Hebrides, being found
  not only next the gabbro, but next the Jurassic sandstones and
  shales. They arc familiar phenomena of contact in all parts of the
  world, and arc sufficient of themselves to show that the granophyre
  of Skye must be later than tho gabbro.
     Tho Author then describes three conspicuous dykes, from 8 to
  10 feet broad, which can be seen proceeding from the main body of
  granophyre and cutting across the banded gabbros. Oue of these is
  traceable for more than 800 feet in a nearly straight line. The
  material composing these dykes is identical with that constituting
  the marginal portion of the granophyre-maFB. It presents the most
  exquisite flow-structure, with abundant rows of spherulites. The

 Author exhibited a photograph of one of the dykes ascending
 vertically through the gabbros. Numerous dykes and veins of the
 same material, not visibly connected with the main granophyre-
 mass, traverse the gabbros of the ridge of which Druim an Eidhne
 forms a part. Some of these are described iu the paper, and
 it is shown that the flow-structure follows the irrogularities of
 the gabbro-walls and sweeps round enclosed blocks of altered
 gabbro. The ' inclusions ' described by Prof. Judd are portions
 of these dykes and veins. There is not, so far as the Author could
 discover, a single granite-block enclosed in the gabbro anywhere to
 be seen at this locality. Ho therefore claims not only that his
 original description of the relations of the rocks was perfectly
 correct, but that the evidence brought forward to contradict it by
 Prof. Judd furnishes the most crushing testimony in its favour.

    2. 'Landscape Marble.'       By Beeby Thompson, Esq., F.G.S.,
F.C.S.
    The Cotham Stone is a hard, close-grained, argillaceous limestone
 with conchoidal fracture. The dark arborescent markings of the
 stone rise from a more or less stratified dark base, spread out as
they rise, and terminate upwards in wavy banded portions of the
limestones. In some specimens two ' landscapes ' are seen, one
above the other, each rising from a distinct dark layer.
    The Author describes the microscopical and chemical characters
of the rock, and its mode of occurrence, and discusses the explana
tions which have been put forward to account for its formation,
especially that of Edward Owen, who in 1754 gave the first published
description of the Cotham Stone, and that advanced by Mr. H. B.
Woodward in the ' Geological Magazine ' for 1892. He then pro
poses a new explanation to account for the formation of tho rock,
and maintains that its peculiar characters are due to interbedded
layers of vegetable matter, which decomposed and evolved carbonic-
acid gas and marsh-gas. This decomposition continued while several
inches of new sediment were laid down, the result being that arbor
escent markings wero produced along the lines taken by the escaping
bubbles, and that the upward pressnre of these gases, after their
escape had been prevented by increasing coherence or greater
thickness of the upper layers of sediment, caused the corrugations

  illustrate his views.

     1. ' On the Origin of certain Novaculites and Quartzites.' By
 Frank Rutley, Esq., F.G.S., Lecturer on Mineralogy in the Royal
  College of Science, London.
     The novaculites of Arkansas have already been admirably
  described by Mr. Griswold in vol. iii. of the Arkansas Survey
  Report for 1890. One of the characteristic microscopic features
 in Ouachita stone is there stated to consist in the presence of
 numerous cavities, often of sharply-defined rhombohedral form,
 which Mr. Griswold considers to have been originally occupied by
 crystals of calcite or dolomite.
     The Author, while admitting that the cavities were no doubt
 once filled by the latter mineral, ventures to differ from Mr. Griswold,
 and some of the authorities he cites, concerning the origin of the
 rock. Crystalline dolomites, when dissolving, become disintegrated
 into minute but well-formed rhombohedra. As the process of
 dissolution proceeds these crystals may become so eroded that
 the rhombohedral form is no longer to be recognized. The Author
 points out that no inconsiderable proportion of the cavities in
 Ouachita stone present irregular boundaries, such as the moulds of
 partially eroded rhombohedra would show. He then offers a
 fresh interpretation of these cavities, so far as the origin of the
 rock is concerned :—
    1st. He assumes that bods of crystalline magnesian limestone
have been slowly dissolved by ordinary atmospheric agency and the
 percolation of water charged with carbonic acid or other solvent.
    2nd. That, as the limestone was being dissolved, it was at the
 same time being replaced by silica, which enveloped minute isolated
crystals and groups of crystals, some perfect, others in various stages
 of erosion.
    3rd. That the silica assumed the condition of chalcedony, its
specific gravity, as stated by Mr. Griswold and as determined by
the Author, being low in comparison with that of quartz.
    4th. The residuum of the original dolomite or dolomitic limestone
was removed, leaving the perfect and imperfect rhombohedral
cavities.
    A calciferous, gold-bearing quartzite from the Zululand gold-
fields is described and a similar origin is ascribed to it, but in
this case the original rock appears to have been simply a limestone,

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            245
 not a dolomite. The gold seems to occur chiefly in the calcareous
 portions of the rock. The Author has also been tempted to suggest
 a similar origin for the saddle-reefs of the Bendigo gold-field. In
 all of these cases the train of reasoning is based upon the con
 clusions arrived at in his previous paper ' On the Dwindling and
 Disappearance of Limestones.' He indicates that the stratigraphical
 relations of the Arkansas novaculites, as described in Mr. Griswold's
 Report, are such as to warrant the assumption that limestones once
 occurred in the position now occupied by beds of novaculite. Many
 collateral matters are dealt with in the paper which cannot be
 given in abstract : among them is an attempt to classify quartzites.
    2. ' Note on the Occurrence of Perlitic Cracks in Quartz.' By
 W. W. Watts, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
    The Author of this communication described some specimens of
 the porphyritic pitchstone of Sand}7 Braes in Antrim, which are
 deposited in the Museum of Science and Art in Dublin, and in that
 of Practical Geology in Jerrnyn Street. They exhibit admirable
 examples of perlitic structure in the brown glassy matrix and the
 presouce of polygonal, circumferential, and radial cracks is noticed.
 The porphyritic crystals of quartz are traversed by curved fissures of
 retreat, not so perfect as those fouud in the glass, but better than
 those usually produced by the rapid cooling of Canada balsam. The
 fissures in the quartz are frequently prolonged into the matrix,
 undergoing only a very slight and almost imperceptible deviation in
 direction at the junction. But in addition to this the quartz is
 often found to act as a centre of strain, the inner cracks of the
 perlito being wholly in quartz, the next traversing both, and the
outer ones in glass only. In other examples the outer cracks of a
matrix perlite sometimes enter the quartz, while in others polygonal
cracks occur, and join up in, the quartz and give off radial cracks
 precisely like those of the matrix. These observations lead to the
conclusion that the quartz and glass must have contracted at about
the same rate, and that the observation of perlitic structure in a
rock with trachytic or felsitic matrix by no moans proves that the
rock is necessarily a devitrified glass. References are given to
somewhat similar observations by Fouque and Michel-Levy, and by
Iddings.
         XXVII. Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
             ON THE THERMAL BEHAVIOUR OF LIQUIDS.
                          BY PROF. BATTELLI.
             To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
      Gentlemen,
T HAVE been prevented for a considerable time from attending to
-*¦ my usual studies by serious domestic trouble, and thus I was
not able at once to read and consider the observations of Professors

246           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
Ramsay and Young, in the February number of the Philosophical
Magazine, on the results obtained by myself and others on the
state of matter at the critical point.
  In the first place, the authors observe that there are contradictions
between the results arrived at by Galitzine, de Heeu, and Zambiasi,
and those obtained by myself ; and these contradictions are reduced
in the main to the two following :—
   (A) That according to my observations the meniscus disappears
during the heating at a temperature higher than the true critical
temperature, whilst according to the observations of Galitzine,
de Heen, and Zaiubiasi, the dimness forms during the cooling at a
lower temperature than the critical one.
   (B) That Zambiasi and I found that the dimness (or cloudiness)
during the cooling process is produced at a lower temperature
when the substance contained in the experimenting tube is in a
larger quantity, whilst de Heen found just the contrary, and
Galitzine came to the conclusion that the temperature of the
cloudiness is " practicallv independent of the relative quantity of
liquid."
   It will be well to examine more closely what are the foundation
and value of these contradictions.
   The first does not exist. In fact from the experiments both of
Galitzine and myself, in the most favourable conditions the dis
appearance of the meniscus to the last trace of it occurs at a higher
temperature than that which one perceives in the ordinary mode
of observation, and the disappearance itself takes place at a higher
temperature than that at which the cloudiness afterwards takes
place. Whilst also it results from my experiments that the
cloudiness takes place at a lower temperature than the true critical
temperature, in conformity with the result obtained by the other
three observers. That Zambiasi found the temperature of the
disappearance of the meniscus coincident with that of the cloudi
ness, must certainly be attributed to his mode of observing the
temperature.
   In regard to the second point, on the contrary, the difference
exists, and therefore merits fresh experiments iu order to arrive
at a definitive decision.
    I would notice that, in the many observations made by me
with several tubes containing various quantities of substance, I
had each time a couple of these tubes in identical conditions, and
the observation of these tubes was very clear and contemporaneous :
therefore it may be that the difference depends on the methods of
observation more or less adapted to the end in view, and thus it
seems to me that I am right in insisting on my conclusions, which,
however, I shall be ready to give up when decisive experiments
have settled the question.
   The reasons alleged by Professors Ramsay and Young for de
claring incorrect the experiments in question, which lead to conclu
sions differing from their ideas on the poiut, are the following :—

             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              247
   (1) That in our apparatus we could not have a perfectly uniform
temperature ;
   (2) That we did not make certain of dealing with perfectly pure
liquids and entirely deprived of air.
   As to the uniformity of the temperature, Signor Galitzine has
already replied, in the April number of the Philosophical Magazine,
that the criticism regarding him was not well founded.
   I can now repeat the same ; for I must remind the reader that
for heating I used petroleum distilled at determined temperatures,
the vapours of which circulated in a stove with double sides, in the
interior of which a closed glass globe contained the tubes. The
length of these was a little more than the fourth part of the length
of the entire globe, and they were placed in the middle of it, in
correspondence with the height of the mouth of the tubes which
conducted the petroleum-vapour into the stove.
   I have already noted that an even temperature was preserved in
the stove up to exactly -^ degree for ten or fifteen minutes before
hand, and sometimes even for a longer period ; thus it is abso
lutely impossible to suppose that there was not a uniform tem
perature in the globe, and especially in the small space occupied
by the little tubes.
   As regards the absolute purity of the liquids and the entire
absence of air, one cannot perhaps give a categorical reply ; from
all the memoirs on the subject, however, it would appear the
greatest care was taken to that end by every experimentalist.
   But admitting that the apparent difference depends on the
impurity of the substance or on the presence of air, still one could
not altogether impugn the conclusion at which we have arrived.
   In fact one could not explain merely by the hypothesis of
Andrews the fact described in § 7 of my first memoir (Nuovo
Ctmento Genn. for Feb. 1893), namely, that in two bulbs placed in a
stove at the same height, and connected by a small capillary tube
in the form of a r\, one of which contains liquid ether and not the
other, when they become heated above the critical temperature,
and then slowly cool, the characteristic cloudiness appears only in
the bulb which originally contained the liquid. Nor, according to
the same hypothesis, would the conduct of the isocores in regard
to the critical temperature be as it is in reality, as I demonstrated
in § 10 of the same memoir.
  Finally, the fact observed by Galitzine (Wied. Ann. vol. 50. p. 541)
is in contradiction to the ideas of Messrs. Eamsay and Young,
namely, that if the two branches of a tube are separated at the U
by a little column of mercury, and the one branch is filled entirely
with ether and the other partially, when the tube becomes heated
above the critical temperature the movement of the column of
mercury from the first branch towards the second does not cease,
even if the temperature is increased to 209o-5 C.
   I was proving the same thing when Galit/.ine's paper appeared,
using for this purpose a straight tube instead of a curved one, and

248           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
the observations were most carefully made, and some of them were
repeated by Messrs. Cagnato and Strapazzon.
   The result arrived at by me is considered incorrect by Messrs.
Ramsay and Young—that " the vapour-pressure at a given tempe
rature depends on the relative volumes of liquid and gas," because
it is "absolutely opposed" to their experiments, and they thus
maintain that my liquids must have contained some other liquid,
or that tbey contained a permanent gas.
   But I reply that the memoirs which describe my experiments
detail all the minute care taken by me in order to obtain pure
liquids ; and they also give the calculation (in the case of ether
and of carbonic sulphide^ which shows that the increase of pressure
could not be attributed to gas which might casually have remained
in the experimental globe.
   I would rather observe that, in order to observe such a pheno
menon, an apparatus is necessary which enables us—as in my
case—slowly to compress the vapour, and to maintain it for a
time under constant pressure.
        ON THE FORMATION OK FLOATING MKTAL LAMINJC.
                   BY F. MYLIL'S AND O. FBOMM.
   The following are the results of this investigation : —
   1. Oxidizable metals such as zinc, iron, cobalt, cadmium, copper,
silver, and antimony, have the property that when separated by
electrolysis they float on the surface of solutions of their salts in
coherent lamina;.
   2. This diffusion depends on two circumstances— firstly, the
presence of an impurity which does not mix with water; and,
secondly, the chemical action of the oxygen present. The same
effect is produced by sulphur on the halogens.

   4. The form of the bounding surface has no appreciable influence
on the phenomenon : henco the spreading occurs even when one
medium is in the form of drops.
   5. Oxides and sulphides which conduct the current have the
property of spreading out on the bounding surface ; thus, for
instance, the lower degrees of oxidation of silver and of cadmium,

capillary attractions which those parts of the liquid experience

   7. During the passage of the current a tension is often observed
which disappears when the current is broken, and apparently
depends on the difference of potential, like the surface-tension of
mercury when it is polarized.— Wiedemann's Annalen, No. 4, 1894.

XXVIII. On the Velocity of Sound in Air, Gases, and Vapours
    for Pure Notes of different Pitch. By J. Webster Low,
     Ph.D., B.A.*
                            § 1. Introduction.
BY the publication of Eegnault'sf great work and the
          immediate corroboration of his results by Lc KouxJ, the"
general confidence in the previously accepted value of the
velocity of sound was severely shaken. Since then several
experimenters have sought, by measuring the wave-lengths of
notes of different pitch, to arrive indirectly at the velocity of
sound. With this object Kundt§ and Kayser|| have utilized the
former's dust-figures, Schneebelilf and Seebeck** Quincke's
interference-tubes ft; ar>d all have agreed in finding a greater
velocity for the higher notes than for the lower ones, a result
the reverse of that found by Regnault and Konig JJ.
     From theoretical considerations, Helmholtz§§ and Kirch-
hoff || || have shown that friction and the conduction of heat

250        Dr. J. W. Low on tlie Velocity of Sound in
must greatly affect the wave-length and the velocity of sound
in narrow tubes. Their theory agrees only imperfectly with
the results of Kundt, who employed mixed notes ; with those
of Schneebeli, Seebeck, and Kayser, however, all of whom
used pure musical tones, the accord is somewhat better. The
methods of the last named inquirers, though correct in prin
ciple, arc, however, in detail liable to various objections ; I
have therefore subjected the whole question of the indirect
determination of the velocity of sound to a fresh investigation.
   The questions I set myself for answer were :—
   1. How does the velocity of sound vary in air and gases for
pure notes of different pitch in tubes of different diameter ?
   2. How can the true velocity of sound in unlimited space
be determined from that found in tubes ?
                   § 2. Method of the Inquiry.
   At the suggestion of Prof. Quincke I measured the wave
lengths for tuning-forks of known vibration-frequency by
means of his interference-tubes. I observed, not one minimum
of vibration-intensity, as Seebeck had done, but successive
maxima, by shortening the tubes by one, two, or more half
wave-lengths. My apparatus (fig. 1) consisted of a wide
glass tube 0 U, closed at the bottom with a cork and a stop
cock H. From H a long piece of guttapercha tubing led to
a water-bottle F ; a second piece of narrower tubing con
nected the side-tube A, distant about 5 centimetres from the
upper end of the main tube, with the ear of the observer at C,
ending in a glass pipe coated with sealing-wax, so as to fit
exactly into the outer passage of the ear. By raising and
lowering the bottlo F a swimmer B could be brought to any
desired point of the interference-tube, and the exact position
of its upper smooth surface could be read off on a millimetre-
scale fixed behind the tube. The swimmer consisted of a
cork 4 centim. long, loaded at the lower end with lead and
coaled with stiff paper and paraffin. The cork had almost
the same diameter as the tube.
    The theory of vibrating air-columns, as developed by
Kirchhoff, postulates a regular motion of the air-particles
parallel to the axis of the tube. In the course of my experi
ments, however, whether the bare prong or the resonance-
box of the tuning-fork was held over the opening of the tube,
or the fork-handle pressed firmly against any point of its
sides, or the fork, with box attached, removed to any part of
the room, I failed to observe any change in the positions of
the maxima. These positions could, however, be most easily

                                                                      1
            Air §c.for Pure Notes of different Pitch.           251
and distinctly found by using the flat side of the bare prong.
Some of the earliest readings were taken with the resonance-
box ; but I soon laid it aside, as the strong resonance of the
box obscured too much the maximum of resonance of the tube.
                                                  Fig. 2.
   In a tube like that represented in fig. 1 the air-column can
resonate in two different ways. In the one case a loop forms
at the side-piece A, and a minimum of intensity is heard
through the tubing A C. The distance of the loop from ¦ tho
reflecting surface of the swimmer is then an odd multiple of
a quarter wave-length. Raise the swimmer through a dis
tance equal to the length A 0, increased by the ainount of
Kayleigh's correction* for open pipes, then a loop forms at 0,
a greater change of density takes place at A, and a maximum
of intensity is heard through A C. The distance of tho

252        Dr. J. W. Low on the Velocity of Sound in
swimmer now from tbo end 0, increased by Rayleigh's cor
rection, is an odd multiple of a quarter wave-length. The
difference between two successive maxima or minima is thus
half a wave-length. After careful trial I found that the
maxima, at all events for my ear, could bo fixed with much
greater precision than the minima.
   From the observed half wave-length, v0, the velocity of
sound in dry air at 0° temperature and 700 millim. pressure
was calculated by means of the formula
                          _ X/t       at    3 S\
where
        n = the   vibration-frequency of the fork,
        X = the   observed wave-length,
        a = the   coefficient of expansion of air,
        I = the   temperature of the air in degrees Cent.,
         S = the  vapour-tension of water,
and      B= the   barometric height.
Any influence of the intensity or vis viva of vibration upon
the velocity of sound, which Regnault* thought ho had dis
covered, but which Rinkf has with justice disputed, I could
not observe. Kundt* also and Kayser* have found the
velocity of sound, invariable for different degrees of vibration-
energy of the sounding body.
   In making my observations I proceeded in the following
manner: —With the water-bottle in-th JL „.-,.' I raised and
lowered the swimmer a few times unt: i*»Ti<iU with tolerable
certainty ascertained the positions of the maxima. More than
 one reading of the same maximum at tho same time I never
 took ; I rather returned to it four or five times in order to
 get my observations as independent of one another as possible.
    The temperature was observed above and below at the
 beginning and the end of each experiment.
    The tuning-forks r,, e„ <jt, clr cm were all made by Konig,
 of Paris. The vibration-frequencies of the first four were
 found to be in the ratio of 4 : 5 : (5 : 8, but cm made 1023-25
 vibrations when cu made 512.
    I used three different tubes, which were of the same length,
 1250 millim., and of Viiich the diameters were 28 millim.,
 17*1 millim., and y-35 millim.
    In order to convey a clear idea of the degree of precision
 of which the method is capable, I shall quote the details of a

 tingle experiment taken at random from my journal. This
was ouo of a scries made at the beginning of the inquiry,
when I had joined two tubes together in order to follow the
 maxima as far down into the tube as possible. As was to be
 expected on account of the decreasing intensity, the readings
became more difficult the farther they were removed from the
 source of sound. After convincing myself in this way that
 the wave-length remained constant, I determined only the
 uppermost maximum and the lowermost that could be distinctly
 observed, divided their difference by the number of half wave
 lengths contained in the interval passed through, and arrived
 in this way at the mean half wave-length.

Kayleigh's coriection (157+0-82 radius), gives a velocity of 327--1 metre.

the same value as from the other readings. Such values were, however,
never included in the mean.

for a tyro, makes considerable pretensions to exactness ; after
many months of practice, however, the limits of error became
still closer.

    In the light of these results let us test KirchhofFs* theore
tical formula for the velocity of sound in tubes :—
                          v=a(1             %=~\
 where
          v — the observed velocity in tubes,
          a = the velocity in unlimited space,
          »• = the radius of the tube,
          rt = the vibration-frequency of the tuning-fork,
 and 7= a constant for friction and conduction of heat.
    For the same tube the product (a — v)V 71 must be constant,
 as also (a — v)2r for the same tone.
    Then from two results with the same fork and different
 tubes we get
                                              ty2

 where vx and r, denote the velocity and the radius of the
 wider tube, r2 and r2 the same quantities for the narrower
 one. Thus, by combining in pairs the results contained in
 the vertical columns of the above table, wo should always get
 the true velocity of sound in the open air. My results calcu
  lated in this way are as follows : —

           Air tyc.for Pure iVotes of different Pitch.        257
   My results for air may be summed up as follows :—
    1. The velocity of sound in narrow glass tubes is smaller
than in the open air ; it increases with the diameter of the
tube and the pitch of the note.
    2. The loss whioh the velocity of sound suffers in narrow
glass tubes is inversely proportional to the diameter and the
square root of the vibration-frequency. In other words, the
formula
                                       y
                                         iru
is correct if a, the true velocity, = 330*582 metre*, and 7, the
constant for friction and conduction of heat, = 0'007U8y.
     3. The ratio of the specific heats for air is l-3i)47 *.
                         § 4. Carbonic Acid.
    The alteration of tlie apparatus necessary for the application
 of this method to gases depends upon the density of the gas.
     For carbonic acid everything remained the same as for air,
 with the exception of a small change at the side-piece A.
     As the main tube had to remain open, the chief difficulty
 lay in keeping the gas pure. The air could either, by dif
 fusion, penetrate into the tube, or, by the lowering of the
 water-column, be drawn into it. The difficulty was over
 come in the following manner.
   • The three arms of a T (fig. 2) were fitted with pieces of
 gutta-percha tubing, of which the one led to the side tube A,
 the other to the gas-apparatus, and the third to the ear of the
 observer. The T-piece was fixed so high and so inclined to
 one side, that the heavy gas flowed in a natural manner into
 the main tube.
      The gas was generated in a Kipp's apparatus from oyster-
 shells and hydrochloric acid, and conducted through a system
  of wash-bottles and pearl-tubes saturated with a solution of
  sodium carbonate. The method of filling was as follows : —
  The swimmer was raised to A and tho stopcock H closed.
  After tho gas had flowed a short time through the ear-tubing,
  it was firmly clamped. The gas could now only escape
  through the side piece A, and thus the air still remaining in
  the upper portion of the main tube was rapidly expelled. Tho
  open end at 0 was then made air-tight and the stopcock H
  opened. The energy of the generation of the gas drove the
  water out of tho tube back into the bottle, but always against
  a small counter-pressure, as I always took care that the surface
                        * Corructed on pa^c 204.

   258           Dr. J. W. Low on the Velocity of Sound in
   of the water in the hottle stood higher than the surface of
   that in the tube. In this way it was impossible for the air to
   penetrate into the tube, even though the apparatus had not
   been air-tight. Everything was, however, always perfectly
   air-tight. When the tube was full, the stopper at 0 and the
   clamp on the ear-tubing were removed, the tuning-fork bowed,
   and the positions of the maxima ascertained exactly as in the
   case of air. While the observations were being made, the
   gas apparatus remained in action, so that a slow steady stream
   of pure carbonic acid poured through the upper portion of
   the tube and overflowed its edges.
      The observed half wave-length was corrected to 0° C. and
   760 millim. in dry gas by means of a formula analogous to
   the one used for air.

   The ratio of the specific heats, calculated in the same way
 as for air, I found to be 1"2883. Rontgen* gives T3052 and
 Muller t 1-2653.
   To recapitulate,—
    1. Kirchhoff's formula for the determination of the velocity
 of sound in tubes holds good for carbonic acid as well as for
air if the velocity in the free gas = 257'03 metre J, and the
constant for friction and conduction of heat =0004577.
    (2) The ratio of the specific heats for carbonic acid is
1-2883 f.
                           § 5. Hydrogen.
   The remodelling of the apparatus for gases lighter than air
caused much trouble. In its final form I simply inverted the
whole apparatus as employed for carbonic acid. It was
now in fact a siphon ; the open end of the tube was below
and the stopcock above. The few drops of water that trickled
out I led aside with a tail of lamp-wick. The method of
filling was the same as for carbonic acid, only here every
thing was inverted.
   On account of the extraordinary tenuity of this gas, the
wave-lengths are very great, and much longer tubes than
before were necessary. I soon found that the energy of' the
vibrating mass of the gas was too small to set the membrane
of the tympanum properly in vibration, and that exact readings
of the maxima were unattainable.
   The following readings were taken with tube II. and fork cu
at a temperature of 15° C. :—

   Regnault gives 1200 77 and 1166'67, but these numbers
are probably too small.
   According to a few experiments which I made later with
coal-gas. the form of tlie apparatus that was used for carbonic
acid seems also suitable for gases lighter than air. In (his
case, however, the observer must operate as rapidly as possible.
                              § 6. Mixtures.
   I also applied the method with good success to mixtures of
air and vapours. The form of the apparatus was the same as
for air, only that in this case the bottle was filled with the
evaporating liquid instead of with water.
   I raised the liquid in the tube as far as the side piece A,
then let it slowly sink and remain standing for a time, which
 varied from a few seconds to two hours. The temperature
 for all the experiments was constant (17° 0.). With tube II.
 and fork cm I took six sets of readings given below. At the
 beginning of each set, one or two half wave-lengths come
 where only very little vapour was present. Then with in
 creasing saturation the half wave-lengths gradually decrease,
 until in the immediate neighbourhood of the liquid they
 become constant.

   After my experiments were finished I had some doubt as
to whether the vibration-frequency of c, was exactly 256. I
decided the point by means of an electric registration method.
A small, thin, pointed piece of platinum-plate was attached
to the end of one of the prongs of the fork, and the vibration-
curves were traced on a metal cylinder coated with blackened
paper. A weak induction-current, with mercury contact with
the seconds-pendulum of a clock of known daily error, was
generated and conducted by the platinum point to the
blackened paper. The number of waves between the marks
of the sparks, taken two and two, gave the double vibration-
frequency of the fork. As a result I found that c, made
25(>-23 vibrations per second. This necessitated small cor
rections in my results, which are shown below.

   The experiments with hydrogen can only be regarded as
approximately correct.
   My results for the velocity of sound in air and carbonic
acid in glass tubes of different diameters are in full agreement
with KirchhofFs theoretical formula founded upon the con
sideration of the friction and the conduction of heat of gases.
   The velocity of sound izi free space for air and carbonic
acid is, according to my results, invariable for tones of
different pitch and intensity.
   It is my pleasant duty to express here to Professor Quincke
my heartiest thanks for his Kind support and instructive
counsel during the prosecution of the above inquiry.

     XXIX. T/ie Hatclwt Planimeter.        By F. W. HlLL*.
HPHE hatchet planimeter consists essentially of a tracing-
       point and a convex chisel-edge rigidly connected, the
 point and the edge being in the same plane. When the
 point is moved along any line, the edge describes a curve of
pursuit.
    The object of this paper is to investigate how the instru
 ment may be used to determine areas.
    Let the tracer start from a point 0 inside the area, move
 along any line to the perimeter, then rouud the perimeter and
 back along the same line to 0 ; the solution of the problem
 consists in finding an expression for the angle AOB be
 tween the initial and final positions OA, OB of the line
joining the tracing-point and chisel-edge.
    All attempts to express the area of the curve in terms of
 this angle proved futile except in a few special cases, such as
 the circle and square; but the magnitude of the angle may be
 found in the form of an infinite series, the most important
 term of which is a multiple of the area. The complexity
 of the result would seem to show that no simple geometrical
 explanation is possible.
    Let the tracer move a distance r along a straight line (fig. 1) ;
 then, if %, ^' be the initial and final inclinations of the rod to
 the line, c the length of the rod, it is easily proved that

best attacked by making the tracer move round each of these
triangles in turn, travelling along every radius-vector twice,
in opposite directions. Taking any triangle OPQ (fig. 2),

the expression

where A is the area of the curve, and the integrations extend
from 0=0 to &=2tt. Thus if the greatest breadth of the
 curve is less than the length of the planimeter, the most im
 portant term in the expression is A, and it remains to estimate
 the effect of the other terms.
   First, considering those terms which depend only on the
position of 0,
 where Ak* is the moment of inertia of the area about the
 polar axis through 0. This term is therefore least when 0 is
 the mass-centre of (he area.

 great as ^ , is less than one per cent, of the area.

 In these small terms the value of c9$ at any point may be
 taken to be the area of that part of tho curve already de
 scribed by the tracing-point, and the terms can be evaluated
 when the equation of the curve is known. If, however, the
 area of the curve is less than that of a square of side c, so
 that the greatest value of <j> is less than 1, it is easy to
 approximate.

other terms are multiplied by ( - \ , and being integrals of

    Thus
where P is very small.
    If 0 is the mass-centre of the curve A? is a minimum and

polar axis at the mass-centre.
    If 0 is not near the mass-centre, let the tracing-point be
moved again round the perimeter, following the same path
as before, but with the initial direction of the instrument
exactly reversed ; the effect of this is to change the sign of e
and to give
hence
c<l> being the distance between two indentations may perhaps
be measured to within 1Jw inch, so that there will be an
error in c*<l> of at least X sq. inch, if* e is 10 inches ; if,
therefore, A/5;2
             ^-j- is less than ¦£$ sq. inch, it may be neglected.
    Of curves with the same greatest breadth, the circle has the
                      A&2
greatest area, and 3-y- is less than ^ sq. inch for a circle of
radius 1^ inches.
    Finally, then, if 0 be near the mass centre, and the greatest
breadth be less than 3 inches, the formula c24>=A will give a
result as accurate as the nature of the instrument will allow ;
                                     A&2
for greater areas the value of 5-5- must be estimated and
taken into account. Also it is easily verified that if 3> is
less than -fy, or the area less than 23 sq. inches, it ia sufficient
to measure the chord of the arc c<E> instead of the arc.

 XXX. Magnetic Shielding In/ a Hollow Iron Cylinder. Simplest
               Case. By John Perry, F.R.S.*
 I CONSIDER going and return electric conductors each at
      a distance a from the axis in a diametral plane of the
 hollow cylinder, the current in each being C.
    As to the inducing magnetic potential, all over one half of
 the cylindric surface of radius a the potential is constant, irC,
 and all over the other half it is constant, being — ttC. At a
 point P whose distance from the axis is r, the angle made by
 the axial plane through P and the plane through the con
 ductors being 8, it is evident that V, the inducing potential,
         V = 4C (- sin 0 + 1 ~ sin 30 + \ ^ sin 50 + &c.\
                \r         or6          br                /
 as this becomes +7rC or — ttC where r = a, and also satisfies
 v2v=o.
   Let the coefficient of sin n8 in V be denoted by Ar~* ; let
the corresponding coefficients be A,?,n + A>,_" for the total
 (induced plus inducing) potential inside the tube; A2rn + B3r~n
total in the iron and B3?,_n in outside space. Let the inside
and outside radii of the iron cylinder be and «r2. Then, on
stating the equality of the potentials just inside and just
outside the two surfaces, and also that the normal induction
is the same on both sides, we have four equations, which
enable the coefficients Aj, A2, B3, and B3 to be calculated.
The two important ones are
                 B8=4MA/{(M + l)2-^-l)2},
where e stands for a12"/a22™,
and               A1=-Ap(l-*)/a1*V-<),
where p=(fi+ l)(fi — 1).
   If we take a2=a1 + 1, and t is small, since fi is large in iron,
we have approximately
                      b>=a/(1+K>
   The higher terms are unimportant. Taking the first : the
unshielded potential was 4Car-1 sin 0, and it is converted by
shielding into 4Ca sin 0/r{l+^/it/a1\.
   Thus, taking /a=1200, ^ = 150 cm., t = 5 cm., the first and
most important term is reduced to the l/21st part of its
    * Communicated by the Physical Society : read June 22, 1894.

             The Clark Cell when Producing a Current.              271
 unshielded value. The other terms are reduced to l/(51st,
 l/101st, l/141st, &c., parts of their unshielded values.
     In this case the potential inside is very little less than
 when there was no iron, A! being— A/a,2" for all values of t
 until t is small ; of course Aj is 0 when t is 0.
     It is easy to extend the reasoning to several enveloping
 cylinders of iron, or to the case of any distribution of inducing
potential which does not vary in a direction parallel to the
axis.
XXXI. The Clark Cell when Producing a Current. By
    S. Skinner, ALA., Lecturer at Clare College, and Demon
    strator at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge*.
                         § 1. Introduction.
THE electromotive force of the Clark cell when not pro
        ducing any current has been frequently determined, and
has been found to be of so constant a value that it is now used
as a standard. These values of E.M.F. are for the cell when
 its poles are not united by a conductor. In the following an
 account is given of a series of experiments made on cell
when producing currents, with the view of ascertaining,
 (I) how far the total electromotive force round the circuit
differs from that of the open cell, and (2) how this new value
 for the E.M.F. changes when the current is maintained. If
 these quantities can be accurately measured, it follows that a
cell might be used for producing currents of known value.
Some experiments have been made on subject (2) by Threlfall
and Pollock (Phil. Mag. November 1889), and their results
are compared with mine in Sect. 8.
                          § 2. The Cells.
    The experiments were made on three cells, all much larger
than the ordinary Board-of-Trade pattern of Clark cell.
    Cell B, made July 1891, is the cell no. 90 described on
p. 558 of the paper by Mr. Glazebrook and the author, Phil.
Trans. 1892, A. The area of its exposed zinc surface is
approximately 14-4 square centimetres.
    Cell L, made November 1892, is a much larger cell fitted
up in a cylindrical jar 22 centiin. high and 13 centim. in
diameter. The zinc plate exposes an area of about 95 square
centimetres.
    Cell N, made July 1893, is intermediate in size and
exposes about 29 square centimetres of zinc surface.
      * Communicated by the Physical Society : read June 22, 1894.

272              Mr. S. Skinner on the Clark Cell
   In all throe cells the zinc plate, a piece of common zinc
sheet, is placed horizontally, and they have tbe same E.M.F.
within 2 parts in 5000.
          § 3. The Effect of Uniting the Poles of a Cell.
    Let a cell of electromotive force E and internal resistance
R have its poles joined by a wire of resistance r ; then,
providing It and r are constant, and there is no polarization,
 the potential-difference between tbe poles will be ^ —-.       If,
 however, there is polarization, then this potential-difference
 will be .„—— , where e is the value of the electromotive force
 required to produce the observed current.
    The value of — (E— e) is the electromotive force of polari
zation.
    In the large Clark eel Is ''described above E and e are nearly
 equal when the current is not larger than *01 ampere ; this
 small difference is the subject of the following measurements.
 To obtain it, it is clearly necessary to find the value of the
 potential-difference „       , and of the resistances R and r.
                       Jt + r
 The measurements for R are contained in Sect. 4 ; r
 consisted of thick wire coils or of a special wire resistance
 immersed in a large tank of paraffin oil ; and the measure
 ments of the potential-differences are contained in Sect 6.
    We shall now give an illustration, taken from an actual
 experiment, of what happens when the poles of a cell are
 united. On July 25th the cell L had an electromotive force,
 with its poles open, represented by 5009 on the compensator.
 The poles were then joined by a resistance of 1000 legal ohms,
 and their potential-difference, taken as quickly as possible,
 was then rather more than 4983 and rather less than 4984.
 Then a resistance of 500 legal ohms was substituted for the
  1000 ; the potential-difference fell to 4959. Next, with 200
 legal ohms the potential-difference was 4885. Lastly, the
 poles were opened, and the electromotive force of the cell was
 found to be 5009.
    It is seen from these numbers that the eel] recovered its
 electromotive force ontirely after the various operations, and
 this is a typical instance of the behaviour of the cells. It
 should be mentioned here that these tests, as well as tests on
 two other cells, were made in the interval between the two
 sets of resistance observations recorded in the column of the
table §4, headed " July 25th, Before—After."

    § i. Measurement of the Internal Resistance of the Cells.
   The important determination of the resistance of the colls
was made by the method of Opposition, and by the use of an
Alternating Current. By opposing any two of the cells, the
resulting electromotive force was so small that, making them
an arm in a Wheatstone's arrangement, there was no deflexion
in the bridge-galvanometer. The bridge was fed with an
alternating intermittent current by means of the commutator
used by Mr. T. C. Fitzpatrick in his electrolytic measurements,
B. A. Report, 1886, p. 328.
   In this method the commutator is arranged to supply the
currents in the galvanometer-circuit always in the same
direction, so that an ordinary sensitive mirror-galvanometer
can be used. The drum of the commutator nas on each
circular face eight insulated sectors of brass, those on one
side being larger than those on the other. The larger sectors
are connected by brushes to the battery-circuit, and the smaller,
to the galvanometer-circuit. They are arranged so that the
battery connexion is always closed before that of the galvano
meter, and is always broken after that of the galvanometer.
A more complete description of the commutator, which works
excellently, will be found in the paper already mentioned.
Two or three Leclanche cells were used as the battery.
   The method of connecting two cells together so as to have
small resulting electromotive force is particularly applicable
in the case of Clark cells, for they may be obtained of nearly
equal electromotive force. In the case of the cells we are
discussing, as mentioned in § 2, the greatest difference was
never more than 2 in 5000.
   The errors to which this method of measuring battery-
resistance is liable are two : first, from self-induction, and
second, from polarization at the electrodes. The only con
ductor containing self-induction of any magnitude is the
galvanometer- coil, and as the method is a zero method this
does not matter. . The second error is eliminated by using an
alternating current. However, following Fitzpatrick's method,
tests were specially made for polarization by varying the ratio
of the arms and by varying the speed of the commutator.
For instance, on one occasion the resistance was between 1 1*0
and 11*1 with the usual speed for working; when the speed
was more than doubled, the resistance retained the same value.
   The three cells were measured in pairs, and the results in
legal ohms are given in the following table, where C is the
resistance of the connecting wires.
   The words " Before," "After," refer to the relation of these
measurements to those recorded in § 6.

   The temperatures are those of the water-hath in which the
cells stood ; the cells were not moved during the whole of
the measurements. It will be noticed that the resistance of
the cells is lower at high than at low temperature. This
agrees with the fact that electrolytes decrease in resistance
with increase of temperature.
     § 5. The Resistances, and Apparatus for Comparison of
                           Electromotive Forces.
   The compensating apparatus was the same as that de
scribed in § 8 of the paper by Mr. Glazebrook and the author
already quoted. However, in the place of the Leclanche
cells there described to produce the main current, I used
one or two large Clark cells. The reason for this change
arose from the irregular behaviour of the Leclanche cells,
when changes were made in the amount of current taken from
them. The results of eleven series of observations were
rendered useless on this account. When only one Clark was
used in the main circuit, the standard cell for reference was
a Helmholtz mercurous-chloride cell, § 7. When two Clark
cells were used, the standard was some other Clark cell which
was kept at rest.
   The circuits, through which the currents from the cells
under test were taken, consisted of thick wire coils from a
legal ohm resistance- box for the values 1000, 500, 200 legal
ohms, and of a german-silver wire of 147 legal ohms wound
on an ebonite frame, which was placed in a tank of paraffin
oil.      This german-silver wire was always used when the
current was maintained for any length of time, as from its
construction its temperature could be very accurately observed.

      The simplest way to examine these results will be to cal
   culate the electromotive force required to produce the observed

   It will be observed that for a given cell the electromotive
force of polarization is directly proportional to the current-
density.
      § 7. Effect with Time, the Current being maintained.
   The experiments to be described in this section show how
the potential-difference varies when the cell is allowed to
produce a current for some time. For these experiments the
standard of reference was a set of Helmholtz cells described
in the paper quoted above, p. 618 ; they were immersed in a
tank of paraffin oil. On January 17th they were submitted
to a very rigorous test for constancy, extending over four
hours, a Clark cell being the standard. It is not necessary
to say anything further about them.

the general order of magnitude of the effect with the other

                          § 8. Conclusion.
   Throughout the calculations it has been assumed that the
total electromotive force round the circuit is equal to that of
the cell at rest ; and therefore that the electromotive force
overcoming polarization can be obtained by subtracting from
the electromotive force of the cells at rest the observed cur
rent. With the exception of small Peltier effects, I know of
nothing against this assumption.
   The results of the experiments are :—
       (a) The electromotive force of polarization varies directly
             with the current-density in a particular cell.
       (/<) The electromotive force of polarization slowly in
             creases when the current is maintained.
   From the magnitudes of the quantities found in these
experiments, it follows that small currents of approximately
known value can be obtained by the use of large Clark cells
of small internal resistance, which may be neglected in com
parison with the large external resistance. The experiments
show that the large cell L when producing "01 ampere was
not at all disturbed. This corresponds to a current-density

XXXII. On a Relation between the Surface-Tension and
   Osmotic Pressure of Solutions. By B. Moore, M.A.,
   Exhibition Scholar, Queen's College, Belfast *.
AT present the cause of osmotic pressure in solutions is
      unknown, although the laws regulating it and connecting
it with the kindred solution phenomena, viz. the lowering of
the freezing-point and of the vapour-pressure, have been well
worked out within the last few years.
   This paper is an attempt to show that it may be produced
by difference in surface-tension acting along the exceedingly
fine capillary openings of almost molecular dimensions which
place the solution in connexion with its solvent in the pores
of the semipermeable wall which separates them.
   If two liquids which mix and have a different surface-
tension be placed each in one of two wide tubes communi
cating beneath by a capillary, as shown
in the figure, there is a surface over
which capillary action will take place,
between each liquid and the wall of
the tube containing it. Suppose that
the surface-tension of the liquid con
tained in A is the greater, and that .
the end of the capillary next A is
filled with the pure liquid contained
in A, and the end next B with the
pure liquid contained in B, while
between these two points there is a mixture of the two
liquids. Then if T{ be the surface-tension of the liquid in A,
and T2 that of the liquid in B, the tension along the walls of
 the capillary will diminish from Ti at the end next A to T2 at
 the end next B ; and the skin of liquid forming the surface
 of contact with the walls of the tube will be urged from B
towards A by a force of (T1—T2)27r/-, where r is tho radius of
 the capillary tube.
               * Communicated by Prof. Fitzgerald.

280         Mr. B. Moore on a Relation between the
   It might be supposed that the action of this force would
cause a rise of level in the tube A. And so it would if the
whole cross-section of the capillary were within the range of
capillary action ; but in a capillary tube, even as fine as one
can draw it out, the greater part of the section is still outside
the radius of capillary action, and as soon as any difference
in pressure is caused by the action of surface-tension, it is
effaced by a back flow along the central part of the capillary
from A towards B.
   However, under the circumstances in which osmotic pres
sure becomes evident, it is extremely probable that the
diameters of the capillaries placing solution and solvent in
communication are so exceedingly small that the whole of
their cross-section is well within this radius of capillary
action. That this is so appears to be proven, not only by the
usual mode of formation of such semipermeable walls by
causing a precipitate in a finely divided condition in pores
already minute, so that the two fluids are only in communi
cation by minute passages between the molecules of this pre
cipitate which must most probably be of molecular dimensions,
but also by a simple calculation based on the assumption that
osmotic pressure is due to difference in surface-tension acting
as above described.
   This calculation leads to an interesting value for the dimen
sions of the pores and may be stated as follows :—Let T be
the difference between the surface-tension of a solution and
that of the pure solvent, P the osmotic pressure in this solu
tion, supposed to be due to the action of this difference in
surface-tension, and r the radius of a capillary opening placing
the solution and the solvent in communication. Then, for
a position of equilibrium, the difference in surface-tension
acting on the perimeter of the capillary must balance the
osmotic pressure acting on its cross-section, and we therefore
                                                   2T
conclude that the equation 27rrT=7rr2P, or r= -p, must hold
good.
   From this equation, the necessary value which r must have,
to account for osmotic pressure in the manner suggested, can

the equation into a more convenient system of units, it
becomes T = 72'17 + 1*382 n, where T is the surface-tension
in dynes per centimetre, 72'17 the surface-tension of water
expressed in the same units, and n the number of gram-
molecules dissolved per litre.
   Taking n equal to 1, the equation gives for the difference
in surface-tension between a normal solution of sodium chlo
ride and pure water, a value of l-382 dynes per centimetre.
   It is also easy to calculate approximately the osmotic pressure
in a normal solution of the same salt, the amount of its dis
sociation at this concentration being known from Kohlrausch's
conductivity determinations. Such a calculation gives for
the osmotic pressure in such a solution the value of 21 x 106
dynes per square centimetre. Substituting these values in
                     2T
the equation r= -p, the value obtained for the radius of the
capillary opening is r=18x 10-7 centimetres.
   Now the limits of the radius of capillary action have been
determined by various observers and by different methods,
and are found to be much greater than this. Thus Plateau's
determinations give, for /, the radius of capillary attraction,
I>        ,    millim. =6 X 10~8 centim. ; and the mean of four
determinations of Quincke's for different substances give
 I > 6-1 X 10-fi centimetres.
    These results show that the radius of the intercommuni
 cating capillaries necessary to give to the osmotic pressures
 of solutions the values which they possess by means of capil
 lary action, lies well within the radius of capillary attraction ;
 so that the whole section of liquid in the capillary would be
 urged by difference of surface-tension in the direction of the
 liquid of greater surface-tension, that is from the solvent
 towards the solution, and thus give rise to a difference of
 pressure, in other words cause osmotic pressure.
    Consider, again, for a moment the relative values of the
 capillary openings here calculated, and that found as a mini
 mum for the radius of capillary action. The former is 18 X 10~7
 and the latter 6 X 10-6 centimetres ; and it follows that, under
 the given conditions, the capillary opening is smaller than
 the radius of capillary action, and hence only a portion of the
 surface-tension will come into action, viz. that acting up to
 the radius of the capillary instead of to the radius of capillarv

 diminished, and r will have a still smaller value than that

282          Mr. B. Moore on a Relation between the
calculated for it above. This alteration in the value of T will
not be so great as the ratios of the two values 6 x 10-6 and
18 x 10-7 indicate ; for the value of the force of molecular
attraction varies inversely as some high power of the distance,
according to Laplace inversely as the fifth power of the dis
tance. And it is the portions where the molecular attraction
has its smaller values that are shut out as the capillary gra
dually narrows past the value of 6 x 10~6 centimetres.
   It follows from these considerations that the capillaries or
pores must have a radius of somewhat less than 18 X 10-7
centimetres. Now it has been determined by several different
methods that the diameters of molecules lie between 10-7 and
10-8 centimetres ; and it is extremely probable that this is the
value to which the diameters of these capillary openings in
semipermeable walls must approximate. This result is ren
dered probable, not only by the reasoning here given, but by
the experimental method employed for producing such semi
permeable walls, by producing an insoluble precipitate in the
minute channels of a porous cell. It seems reasonable to
suppose that after such a process communication takes place
only in the intramolecular spaces or meshes of the precipitate,
and such meshes must have about the dimensions found for
them by the theoretical considerations here given.
   If the molecules of the solvent do pass in this manner, in
single file as it were, through the innumerable intramolecular
spaces of the precipitate forming the semipermeable wall, it
follows that the molecular attraction will have a constant
maximum value, viz. its value just at the surface ; and there
fore, provided the meshes are so small that the molecules of
the solvent can only pass through in single file, the osmotic
pressure is unaffected by variations in the diameter of the
intramolecular meshes. In fact in this condition, instead of a
surface-tension acting only for a short distance inward from
the perimeter and rapidly falling off in amount, there is a
constant molecular attraction acting over the entire cross
section and of maximum value ; and instead of the equation
27n'T = 7n/iP, the equation Tr>aT=-jrrl'P or t=P, where t is
the difference in this maximum value for solution and solvent,
holds, which shows that the osmotic pressure really is equal to
the difference between the molecular attractions at the surface-
layer of molecules of the solution and of the pure solvent.
   With regard to the support furnished by experiment for
connecting osmotic pressure with surface-tension, it may be
premised that all experiments made on salt or other solutions
in water or other solvents have been made with strong solu
tions, normal and multiples of normal; and it caunot be

      Surface-Tension and Osmotic Pressure of Solutions.           28o
 expected that the laws deducible theoretically for the surface-
 tensions of such solutions can be proven more rigorously
 than they can in the case of such concentrated solutions for
 the allied phenomena of solution, such as lowering of vapour-
pressure and depression of freezing-point.
    It will be better to tabulate the results that may be expected
to follow in case surface-tension is as closely connected, as
here suggested, with osmotic pressure and the other solution
 phenomena, before discussing them.
    (1) The surface-tensions of all solutions, obeying the other
solution laws, should be higher than those of the solvents.
    (2) For solutions of the same substance in the same solvent,
the surface-tension, after correcting for dissociation, should
increase directly as the concentration within certain limits of
concentration, that is to say, within the same limits as those
within which osmotic pressure obeys the gas law.
   (3) For solutions of different substances in the same
solvent, after correcting for dissociation, the differences in
surface-tension between solution and solvent should be the
same for equi-molecular solutions of these different substances.
   (4) For equi-molecular solutions of either the same sub
stance or different substances in different solvents, after cor
rection for different amounts of dissociation in the different
solvents, the differences in surface-tension in each case be
tween the solvent and its solution must be equal, no matter
how the surface-tensions of the different solvents may vary.
   The only exception to the first law seems to be that of
solutions of liquids, themselves possessing surface-tensions of
their own, in water and in other liquids ; in all such cases
the surface-tension lies between the surface-tension of the
components. But this is not a real exception : such solu
tions do not obey the vapour-pressure law either ; the vapour-
pressure of a solution of alcohol in water is not lower, but
higher than that of pure water. On the other hand, all salt-
solutions, both in water and other solvents, have a surface-
tension higher than that of the solvent.
   With regard to the second law, Quincke* found, although
working  O with concentrated solutions,t                       illin
                                             3 that the • increase
surface-tension is very nearly directly proportional to the
concentration of the solution, and this result is confirmed by
Volkmannf.
   Upon the third law the experimental evidence varies.
Quincke J and the earlier experimenters state the law that

the increase in surface-tension is the same for equi-equivalent
not equi-normal solutions as the law here described requires;
but their results were uncorrected for dissociation, and besides
do not agree very closely with the law given by these ob
servers, when so corrected (by dividing the increase in each
case by the corresponding value of Arrhenius's coefficient of
dissociation i) ; they agree almost as closely with one law as
the other, and cannot be said to agree with either.
   In considering this point of variance, it ought to be remem
bered that the experiments quoted were carried out with
concentrated solutions ; for which analogy teaches us, from a
consideration of the irregularities shown in depression of
freezing-point and vapour-pressure under like conditions, no
close agreement can be expected ; and besides the quantity
to be measured, viz. a small variation in surface-tension, is
infinitely more difficult to obtain accurately than the corre
sponding quantities which are measured in freezing-point
and boiling-point determinations, that is to say, than small
differences in temperature.
   In the case of dilute solutions these differences would
become so small as to be impossible to measure with any
approach to accuracy, so that from experimental difficulties
this deduction cannot be tested with certainty.
   Goldstein *, in a recent paper, states a law which, though
expressed differently, is practically the same as the third
deduction here given, viz.:— In solutions of equal percentage
concentration the difference in capillary rise is proportional,
after correction for dissociation, to the molecular weight.
But as there is no account whatever taken of the densities of
the solutions, and the correction for dissociation is made by
multiplying the observed difference in capillary rise by i,
Arrhenius's Coefficient of Dissociation, instead of, as all
reasoning and analogy show ought to be done, dividing by
that factor, it does not seem to me that much reliance can be
placed on the result.
   The results given by Quincke for solutions of chlorides in
water and alcohol are, when corrected for dissociation, in
remarkably close agreement with the fourth deduction stated
above.
   Quincke's t figures give as the increase in surface-tension
of a normal solution of lithium chloride in water, T534 dynes
per centimetre, and for a normal solution of the same salt in

 alcohol an increase of '908 dyne per centimetre. Correcting
 the former result for dissociation, the result is a rise corre
 sponding to '953 dyne for a non-dissociated substance in
 water ; and the number "968 for solution in alcohol would
 undergo but a slight diminution on account of the very small
amount of dissociation in alcoholic solution.
     Thus it appears that the rise, after this correction has
been applied, is almost the same for these two solvents, as it
ought to be in accordance with the fourth of the theoretical
deductions stated above.

28fi          Lord Bayleigh on the Minimum Current
the Fourier series representative of the actual current were
effective. On this account the quantities in the third column
should probably be increased, for the presence of overtones
could hardly fail to favour audibility.
    Although a considerable margin must be allowed for vary
ing pitch, varying acuteness of audition, and varying con
struction of the instruments, it is scarcely possible to suppose
that all the results above mentioned can be correct, even in
the roughest sense. The question is of considerable interest
in connexion with the theory of the telephone. For it
appears that a priori calculations of the possible efficiency of
 the instrument are difficult to reconcile with numbers such as
 those of Tait and of Preece, at least without attributing to
the ear a degree of sensitiveness to aerial vibration far sur
 passing even the marvellous estimates that have hitherto been
 given * .
    Under these circumstances it appeared to be desirable to
 undertake fresh observations, in which regard should lie paid
 to various sources of error that may have escaped attention
 in the earlier days of telephony. The importance of de
 fining the resistance of the instruments and of employing
 pure tones of various pitch need not be insisted upon.
    As regards resistance, a low-resistance telephone, although
 suitable in certain cases, must not be expected to shdw the
same sensitiveness to current as an instrument of higher resist
 ance. If we suppose that the total space available for the
 windings is given, and that the proportion of it occupied by
the copper is also given, a simple relation obtains between
 the resistance and the minimum current. For if 7 be the
current, n be the number of convolutions, and r the resistance,
 we have, as in the theory of galvanometers, nj = const.,
 7«-2r=const., so that 7 V=const., or the minimum current
 is inversely as the square root of the resistance.
    The telephones employed in the •experiments about to be
narrated were two, of which one (1\) is a very efficient in
 strument of 70-ohms resistance. The other (T2), of less
finished workmanship, was rewound in the laboratory with
comparatively thick wire. The interior diameter of the
 windings is 9 milliin., and the exterior diameter is 2G millim.
The width of the groove, or the axial dimension of the coil, is
8 millim., the number of windings is 100, and the resistance is
•8 ohm. Since the dimensions of the coils are about the

same in the two cases, we should expect, according to the
above law, that about 10 times as much current would be
required in T2 as in Tx. Both instruments are of the Bell
 (unipolar) type, and comparison with other specimens shows
that there is nothing exceptional in their sensibility.
    In view of the immense discrepancies above recorded, it is
 evident that what is required is not so much accuracy of
 measurement as assured soundness in method. It appeared
to me that electromotive forces of the necessary harmonic
 type would be best secured by the employment of a revolving
 magnet in the proximity of an inductor-coil of known con
 struction. The electromotive force thus generated operates
 in a circuit of known resistance ; and, if the solf-induction
 can be neglected, the calculation of the current presents no
 difficulty. The sound as heard in the telephone may be re
duced to the required point either by varying the distance
 (B) between the magnet and the inductor, or by increasing
the resistance (R) of the circuit. In fact both these quan
tities may be varied ; and the agreement of results obtained
with widely different values of R constitutes an effective test
 of the legitimacy of neglecting self-induction. When R is
 too much reduced, the time-constant of the circuit becomes
 comparable with the period of vibration, and the current is
no longer increased in proportion to the reduction of R.
This complication is most likely to occur when the pitch is
high.
    In order to keep as clear as possible of the complication
due to self-induction, I employed in the earlier experiments a
resistance-coil of 100,000 ohms, constructed as usual of wire
doubled upon itself. But it soon appeared that in avoiding
Scylla I had fallen upon Charybdis. The first suspicion of
something wrong arose from the observation that the sound
was nearly as loud when the 100,000 ohms was included as
when a 10,000-ohm coil was substituted for it. The first
explanation that suggested itself was that the sound was being
conveyed mechanically instead of electrically, as is indeed
quite possible under certain conditions of experiment. But a
careful observation of the effect of breaking the continuity of
the leads, one at a time, proved that the propagation was
really electrical. Subsequent inquiry showed that the anomaly
was due to a condenser, or le}den, like action of the doubled
wire of the 100,000-ohm coil. When the junction at the
middle was unsoldered, so as to interrupt the metallic conti
nuity, the sounds heard in the telephone were nearly as loud
as before. In this condition the resistance should have been

288          Lord Rayleigh on the Minimum Current
enormous, and was in fact about 12 megohms * as indicated
by a galvanometer. It was evident that the coil was acting
principally as a leyden rather than as a resistance, and that any
calculation founded upon results obtained with it would be
 entirely fallacious.
    It is easy to form an estimate of the point at which the
 complication due to capacity would begin to manifest itself.
 Consider the case of a simple resistance 11 in parallel with a
 leyden of capacity C, and let the currents in the two branches
 be x and y respectively. If V be the difference of potential
 at the common terminals, proportional to e'f', we have
             x = V/E,            y = C dV/clt = ?>VC ;
 so that

                              V ~        R      ¦
    The amplitude of the total current is increased by the
  leyden in the ratio V (1 +/>9R2Ca) : 1 ; and the action of the
  leyden becomes important when pRC = 1. With a frequency
  of 640, j9 = 4020 ; so that, if R = 1014 c.g.s., the critical value
  of C is 4^j x 10~15 c.g.s., or about ^ of a microfarad.
     It will be seen that even if the capacity remained unaltered,
  a reduction of resistance in the ratio say of 10 to 1 would
  greatly diminish the complication duo to condenser-like
  action ; but perhaps the best evidence that the results obtained
  are not prejudiced in this manner is afforded by the experi
  ments in which the principal resistance was a column of
  plumbago.

  As fitted to the wind-trunk the axis of rotation was horizontal.

  coil at the place occupied by the magnet is given by

  The axial dimension of the section is 1*4 centim., and the
  radial dimension is "97 centim. The mean radius A is
  10"25 centim., and the resistance is about 10J ohms.
     In making the observations the current from the inductor-
  coil was led to a distant part of the house by leads of doubled
  wire, and was there connected to the telephone and resistances.
  Among the latter was a plumbago resistance on Prof. F. J.
  Smith's plan * of about 84,000 ohms ; but in most of the
  experiments a resistance-box going up to 10,000 ohms was
  employed, with the advantage of allowing the adjustment of
  sound to be made by the observer at the telephone. The
  attempt to hit off the least possible sound was found to be
  very fatiguing and unsatisfactory ; and in all the results here
  recorded the sounds were adjusted so as to be easily audible
  after attention for a few seconds. Experiment showed that
  the resistances could then be doubled without losing the sound,
  although perhaps it would not be caught at once by an
  unprepared ear. But it must not be supposed that the ob
  servation admits of precision, at least without greater pre
  cautions than could well be taken. Much depends upon the
  state of the ear as regards fatigue, and upon freedom from
  external disturbance.
     The pitch was determined before and after an observation
  by removing the added resistance and comparing the loud
 sound then heard with a harmonium. The octave thus esti
 mated might be a little uncertain. It was verified by listen
 ing to the beats of the sound from the telephone and from a
 nearly unisonant tuning-fork, both sounds being nearly pure
 tones.
    When the magnet was driven at full speed the frequency
 was found to be 307, and at this pitch a series of observations
 was made with various values of C and of R. Thus when
 B=7*75 inches, or C=8'7 inches, the resistance from the
 box required to produce the standard sound in telephone T,
 was 8000 ohms, so that 11=8100 x 109. The quantities re
quired for the calculation of (5) are as follows : —

    The method of the revolving magnet seemed to be quite
 satisfactory so far as it went, but it was desirable to extend
 the determinations to frequencies higher than could well be
 reached in this manner. For this purpose recourse was had
 to magnetized tuning-forks, vibrating with known anvplitudes.
 If, for the moment, we suppose the magnetic poles to be con
 centrated at the extremities of the prongs, a vibrating-fork
 may be regarded as a simple magnet, fixed in position and
 direction, but of moment proportional to the instantaneous
 distance between the poles. Thus, if the magnetic axis pass
 perpendicularly through the centre of the mean plane of the
 inductor-coil, the situation is very similar to that obtaining
 in the case of the revolving magnet. The angle <f) in (2) is
 no longer variable, but such that sin$ = l throughout. On
 the other hand m varies harmonically. If I be the mean
 distance between the poles, 2/3 the extreme arc from rest to
  rest traversed by each pole during the vibration, niQ the
 mean magnetic moment,

The formula corresponding to (5) is thus derived from it by
simple introduction of the factor 2/8//.
   The forks were excited by bowing, and the observation of
amplitude was effected by comparison with a finely divided
scale under a magnifying-glass. It was convenient to ob
serve the extreme end of a prong where the motion is greatest,
but the double amplitude thus measured must be distinguished
from 2/3. In order to allow for the distance between the re
 sultant poles and the extremities of the prongs, the measured
amplitude was reduced in the ratio of 2 to 3. The observa
tion of the magnetic moment at the magnetometer is not
embarrassed by the diffusion of the free polarity.
   In order to explain the determination more completely, I
will give full details of an observation with a fork c of
frequency 256. The distance I between the middles of the
prongs was '875 inch, and the double amplitude of the
vibration at the end of one of the prongs was "09 inch. Thus
2/8 is reckoned as *06 inch. The inductor-coil was the
ebonite coil already described, and the sound was judged to
be of the standard distinctness when, for example, B = 15
inches, or C = 15"5 inches, and the added resistance was
1000 ohms, so that 11 = 1100 x 109. The quantities required
for the computation of (5) as extended are
             n=242,        ^ = 2ttx256,      H = -18,

and they give for the current corresponding to the standard
sound 9'8 x 10" 8 c.g.s., or 9'8 X 10-7 amperes.
   A summary of the results obtained with forks of pitch
c, c', e', g', /', e", g" is annexed. As the pitch rose, the
difficulties of observation increased, both on account of the
less duration of the sound and of the smaller amplitudes
available for measurement. In one observation with tele
phone T2 at pitch e", the resistance, estimated at 11 ohms, was
that of the coil, telephone, and leads only. No trustworthy
result was to be expected under such conditions, but the
number is included in order to show how small was the
influence of self-induction, even where it had every opportunity

     It would appear that the maximum sensitiveness to current
 occurs in the region of frequency 640 ; but observations at
 still higher frequencies would be needed to establish this
 conclusion beyond doubt. Attention must be paid to the fact
 that the sounds were not the least that could be heard, and
 that before a comparison is made with the numbers given by-
 other experimenters there should be a division by 2, if not
 by- 3.      But this consideration does not fully explain the
 difference between the above table and that of Ferraris
 already quoted, from which it appears that in his experiments
 a current of 5 X 10~9 amperes was audible.
    It is interesting to note that the sensitiveness of the
 telephone to periodic currents is of the same order as that of
 the galvanometer of equal resistance to steady currents f,
 viz. that the currents (at pitch 512) just audible in the
 telephone would, on commutation, be just easily visible by
 a deflexion in the latter instrument. But there is probably
 more room for further refinements in the galvanometer than
 in the telephone.
    If we compare the performances of the two telephones T^
 and T», we find ratios of sensitiveness to current ranging from
 13 to 30 ; so that T2 shows itself inferior in a degree beyond
 what may be accounted for by the resistances. It is singular
 that an experiment of another kind led to the opposite con
 clusion. The circuit of a Daniell cell A was permanently
 closed through resistance-coils of 5 ohms and of 1000 ohms.
The two telephones in series with one another and with a
resistance-box C were placed in a derived circuit where was

The adjustment was made by varying the resistance in C until
the sound was just easily audible in the telephone under trial.

noticed, however, that the sounds, though as equal as could
be estimated, were not of the same quality, and in this
probably lies the explanation of the discrepancy between the
two methods of experimenting. In the latter the original
sound is composite, and the telephone selects the most
favourable elements—that is, those nearly in agreement with
the natural pitch of its own plate. In this way the loudness
of the selected sound becomes a question of the freedom of
vibration of the plate, an element which is almost without
influence when the sound is of pitch far removed from that of
the proper tone of the telephone. There was independent
 reason for the suspicion that T, had not so well defined a
 proper pitch as was met with in the case of some other
 telephones.
    P.S.—Measurements with the electro-dynamometer have
been made by Cross and Page* of the currents used in
practical telephony. The experiments were varied by the
employment of several transmitters, and various vowel sounds
 were investigated. The currents found were of the order
2 X 10~4 amperes.

Unfortunately such an estimate is a matter of extreme diffi
culty, partly on account of imperfection in our knowledge of
the magnetic properties of iron, and partly from mathematical
difficulties arising from the particular forms employed in
actual construction ; and indeed the problem does not appear
to have been attacked hitherto. In view, however, of the
doubts that have been expressed as to theory, and of the
highly discrepant estimates of actual sensitiveness which have
been put forward, it appears desirable to make the attempt.
It will be understood that at present the question is as to the
order of magnitude only, and that the result will not be with
out value should it prove to be 10 or even 100 times in error.
    One of the elements required to be known, the number (n)
of convolutions, cannot be directly observed in the case of a
finished instrument ; but it may be inferred with sufficient
accuracy for the present purpose from the dimensions and
the resistance of the coil. Denote the axial dimension by |f,
the inner and outer radii by 7)l and %, the section of the wire
by a- and its total length by I, so that la- is the total volume
of copper. The area of section of the coil by an axial plane
is 5(V2—Vi); and of this the area no- is occupied by copper.
If we suppose the latter to be half the former, we shall not be
far from the mark. Thus
                        no-=M-{vs-Vi)                         (1)

    We have now to connect the periodic force upon the tele

phone-plate with the periodic cnrreDt in the coil. As has
already been stated, only a very rough estimate is possible
a priori. We will commence by considering the case of an
unlimited cylindrical core, divided by a transverse fracture
into two parts, and encompassed by an infinite cylindrical
magnetizing coil containing a turns to the centimetre. If y
be the current, the magnetizing force SH due to it is
                           8iL = 4Trny                       (5)
If we regard the core as composed of soft iron, magnetized
strongly by a constant force H, the mechanical force with
which the two parts attract one another per unit of area is in
the usual notation
                        I(H + 2wI);
and what we require is the variation of this quantity, when H
becomes H + SH. This may be written
                   SH {l+(H + 47rI)jg}                       (6)
   The value of dl/iiK to be here employed is that appropriate
to small cyclical changes. It is greatest when I is small,
and then * amounts to about 100/47T. As I increases, dl/dH.
diminishes, and finally approaches to zero in the state of satu
ration. In order to increase (6) it is thus advisable to
augment I up to a certain point, but not to approach satura
tion so nearly as to bring about a great diminution in the
value of dl/dH. In the absence of precise information we
may estimate that the maximum of (0) will be reached when
I is about*"half the saturation value, or equal to 800 f; and
that dl/dH. also has half its maximum value, or 50/Att. At
this rate the force due to 5H is about 40,000 SH, reckoned
per unit of area of the divided core, or by (5)
                         40,000 xiirny                       (7)
   But before (7) can be applied to the core of a telephone
electromagnet it must be subjected to large deductions. For
in the telephone the total number of windings n is limited to
about one centimetre measured parallel to the axis, whereas
in (7) the electromagnet is supposed to be infinitely long, and
n denotes the number of windings per centimetre. If we are
to suppose in (7) that the windings are really limited to one
centimetre, lying immediately on one side of the division,
there must be a loss of effect which I estimate at 5 times.

We have now further to imagine the second part of the
divided cylinder to be replaced by the plate of the telephone,
and that not in actual contact with the remaining cylindrical
part. The reduction of effect on this account I estimate at
4 times*. The force on the telephone-plate per unit area of
core is thus
                              2000x4™?;                               (8)

In (9) the force is in dynes, and the current 7 is in C.G.S.

and this must be supposed to be operative at the centre of the
plate.
    We shall presently consider whut effect such a force may
be expected to produce ; but before proceeding to this I may
record the result of some experiments directed to check the
 applicability of (10), and made subsequently to the theoretical
 estimates. A Bell telephone, similar to T1; was mounted
 vertically, mouth downwards, having attached to the centre
 of its plate a slender strip of glass. This strip was also
 vertical and carried at its lower end a small scale-pan. The
 whole weight of the attachments was only "44 gram. The
 movement of the glass strip in the direction of its length was
 observed through a reading-microscope focused upon acci
 dental markings. The telephone, itself of 70-ohms resistance,
 was connected through a reversing-key with a Daniell cell
 and with an external resistance varied from time to time. In
 taking an observation the current was first sent in such a
 direction as to depress the plate, and the web was adjusted
 upon tho mark. The current was then reversed, by which
 the plate was drawn up, but by addition of weights in the
 pan it was brought back again to the same position as before.
 The force due to the current is thus measured by the half of
 the weight applied.
     The results were as follows :—

was still just visible. We may conclude that a force of
1 gram weight corresponds to a current of about ^^ of an
ampere. Now, 1 gram weight is equal to 981 dynes, so that
for comparison with (10)
                          force = '6xl06r                  (11)
The force observed is thus about the third part of that which
had been estimated, and the agreement is sufficient.
   Although not needed for the above comparison, we shall
presently require to know the linear displacement of the
centre of the telephone-plate due to a given force. Observa
tions with the aid of a micrometer-eyepiece showed that a
force of 5 grams weight gave a displacement of 10-4x 6"62
centim., or 10-4 x 1'32 for each gram, viz. 10~7 x 1*34 centim.
per dyne. Thus by (11) the displacement x due to a current
r expressed in amperes is
                             tf = -080r                    (12)
   We have now to estimate what motion of the telephone-
plate may be expected to result from a given periodic force
operating at its centre. The effect depends largely upon the
relation between the frequency of the imposed vibration and
those natural to the plate regarded as a freely vibrating body.
If we attempt to calculate the natural frequencies a priori,
we are met by uncertainty as to the precise mechanical con
ditions. From the manner in which a telephone-plate is
supported we should naturally regard the ideal condition as
one in which the whole of the circular boundary is clamped.
On this basis a calculation may be made, and it appears* that
the frequency of the gravest symmetrical mode should be
about 991 in the case of the telephone in question. But it
may well be doubted whether we are justified in assuming
that the clamping is complete, and any relaxation tells in the
direction of a lowered frequency. A more trustworthy con
clusion may perhaps be founded upon the observed connexion
between displacement and force of restitution, coupled with
an estimate of the inertia of the moving parts. The total
weight of the plate is 3"4 grams ; the outside diameter is
5"7 centim., and the inside diameter, corresponding to the
free portion of the plate, is 4-5. The effective mass, supposed
to be situated at the centre, I estimate to be that correspond
ing to a diameter of 2-5 centim., viz. '6b gram. A force of
restitution per unit displacement equal to (10-7 x T34)-1, or
10s X 7#5, is supposed to urge the above mass to its position

                    2tt
    With the aid of a special electric maintenance the plate
may be made to speok on its own account. The frequency so
found, viz. 896, corresponds undoubtedly to a free vibration,
but it does not follow that the vibration is the gravest of
which the plate is capable ; and there were indications point
ing to the opposite conclusion.
    As it is almost impossible to form an a priori estimate of
 the amplitude of vibration {x) when the frequency of the
force is in the neighbourhood of any of the free frequencies,
 I will take for calculation the case of frequency 256, which
 is presumably much lower than any of them. Under these
 circumstances an " equilibrium theory " may be employed,
 the displacement coexisting with any applied force being the
same as if the force were permanent. At this pitch the
minimum current recorded in the table* is 8'3 x 10-7 amperes;
 so that by (12) the maximum excursion corresponding
 thereto is given by x = "080 x 8'3 x 10-7 = 6-8 x 10-8 centim.
    The excursion thus found must not be compared with that
 calculated formerly j for free progressive waves. The proper
 comparison is rather between the condensations s in the two
 cases. In a progressive wave the connexion between * and
 v, the maximum velocitv, is v = as, where a is the velocity of
 propagation. But in the preseut case the excursion x takes
 effect upon a very small volume. If A be the effective area
 of the plate, and S the whole volume included between the
 plate and the tympanum of the ear, we may take « = Aar/S.
 This relation assumes that the condensations and rarefactions
 are uniform throughout the space in question, an assumption
justified by the smallness of its dimensions in comparison
 with the wave-length, and further that the behaviour is the
 same as if the space were closed air-tight. It would seem
 that a slight deficiency in the latter respect would not be
 material.
    For the numerical application I estimate that A=4 sq.

  sufficiently good agreement with (13) *.
      But if the equilibrium theory be applied to the notes of

 decidedly smaller than that (4'5 x 10-9) deduced from the
 observations upon progressive waves. The conclusion seems
 to be that for these frequencies the equilibrium theory of the
  telephone-plate fails, and that in virtue of resonance the sen
 sitiveness of the instrument is specially exalted.
     I will not dwell further upon these calculations, which
 involve too much guesswork to be very satisfactory. They
 suffice, however, to show that the " push and pull " theory
 is capable of giving an adequate account of the action of the
 telephone, so far at least as my own observations are con
 cerned. But it is doubtful, to say the least, whether it could
 be reconciled with estimates of sensitiveness such as those of
 Tait and of Preece.

THE experiments of which we give an account in the
         following pages are of two kinds :—first, they relate to
 the trustworthiness of measurements by means of the McLeod
 gauge ; and second, they deal with the thermal expansion of
 gases at low pressures. The behaviour of the ingenious gauge
 invented by Professor Herbert McLeod has, so far as we know,
not been carefully investigated. The thermal expansion of
 gases at low pressures has been the subject of two investi
gations, one by MendeleefF, and one by G. Melander. But
many researches have been made on the relations of volume
   *  I hope shortly to publish an account of the observations upon which
this  statement is founded.

302    Mr. Baly and Dr. Ramsay an the Relations of Pressure,
to pressure at constant temperatures ; and as there is an
intimate connexion between the compressibility of gases and
their thermal expansion, we think it desirable to give a short
summary of the work which has already been done on the
subject. It is obvious that if the product of pressure and
volume of a gas diminishes with the degree of rarefaction,
it is to be expected that its coefficient of expansion with rise
of temperature will increase ; whereas, if the pv increases as
observed by Mendeleeff and others, its coefficient of expansion
will probably diminish.
                      Historical Resume.
  1. Relation of Volume to Pressure at Constant Temperature.
    For more than twenty years the question of the validity of
 Boyle's Law, applied to rarefied gases, has been the subject of
 frequent articles in scientific journals. In 1873 Siljestrom
 (Biliang till K. Svensha Vet. Akad. Handlirujar, ii. p. 1)
 published in Swedish an account of experiments to test this
 important law. His method consisted in exhausting one of
 two stout cylindrical metal vessels connected together by
 means of a tube provided with an air-tight stopcock. Both
 vessels were placed in a large reservoir of melting ice in order
 to maintain temperature constant at 0°. Each vessel was
 provided with a mercury manometer ; and while the larger
 of the two had no opening except the tube already men
 tioned, which connected it with the smaller vessel, the latter
was joined by means of a brass tube with a stopcock to an
ordinary exhausting air-pump, also furnished with a mercury
gauge.
    The plan of operation was as follows :—The pressure of
 gas in the smaller vessel was reduced by means of the
air-pump, communication with the larger vessel being cut off
by means of the stopcock, and the pressure of the gas in both
 vessels was read on the mercury gauges attached to them, and
 also on that attached to the air-pump. The pressure registered
 by the gauge of the smaller vessel and by the air-pump gauge
 should of course be the same. Communication with the air-
 pump was then shut off. The stopcock between the two
 vessels was then opened, and gas passed from the larger to
 the smaller. After time had been allowed for equilibrium of
 temperature and pressure to be re-established, the pressures
on the gauges were again read. The capacities of the vessels
 being accurately known, the product of pressure and volume
could be calculated.
    Sixteen series of experiments, each consisting of fourteen

           Volume, and Temperature of Rarefied Gases.         303
individual readings, were made with air ; the diminution of
pressure varied in these series from that of the atmosphere to
1-4 millim. ; and by means of an accurate cathetometer the
pressure was read to the second decimal place. The ratio of
V (the volume of the closed reservoir) to V + V (that of both
reservoirs) was calculated by means of the formula
                        E(Y + nr) _         eV
                 * _V + Y' + nV V + V' + n'/i'

   E is the original pressure of the gas ;
   e, pressure read on gauge of second cylinder or of air-pump
      after exhausting ;
    E', pressure in cylinders after opening the stopcock ;

       in total volume of apparatus owing to rise of mercury in
       the gauges, n is a number of centimetres, fi the capacity
       of one centim. of the gauge.
   /S (in following equation) = fJ-/V.     Hence
                    V _ E(l +r*/3)-E(l + n'/3)
                    V ~              E'-e
    If the ratio ( V + V')/V remains constant, Boyle's law holds ;
if, on the contrary, (V + V')/V be too great or too small, the
pressure E' would be either less or greater than corresponds
with Boyle's law.
    The results were averaged, series a and b being compared
with series c and d ; the latter with series e and /, and so on.
This process yielded six sets of average values of (V + V')/V
for air. The results follow :—

                 18 „        7     „     . . 1-46511
    These values of V + V'/V decrease with falling pressure ;
 the higher its value the lower the value of E', and vice versa.
 Assuming from Regnault's observations between 1 and 30
 atmospheres that at a pressure of 1 atmosphere the value given
 above, 1-4720K, is correct, and that Boyle's law holds under
 such a pressure, it follows that the pv of the air increases
 with decreased pressure. This conclusion, too, Siljestrom

304    Mr. Baly and Dr. Ramsay on the Relations of Pressure,
considers to be rendered probable by Begnault's own work.
For he, too, found that air is up to a certain degree more
compressible at pressures higher tlian that of the atmosphere.
For example, if Kegnault's results for pressures between 3
and (5, between 6 and 12, and between 12 and 24 atmospheres
be termed k', k", and k"' respectively, then
              k"/k' = 0-997 128 ; *"'/*" = 0*999386.
 The question of course is, Can these and similar ratios
 increase to above unity ?
    Siljestrorn found from similar but less numerous experi
 ments with oxygen and with carbon dioxide that the variation
 in the ratio (V + V)/V was in the same direction. His results
 with hydrogen are :— 1-47247 at 759-351 millim. ; 147302
 at 351-162 millim.; 1-47258 at 162-75 millim. ; and 1-46895
 at 75-17 millim.
    Siljestrom's results are criticised by Mendeleeff and by
 Amagat. Any error which he might have made is cumulative,
 as pointed out by Van der Ven, whose work will be sub
 sequently considered.
    Mendeleeffs work is at present unfinished, or at least a
 description ot it in full has not yet appeared. His main work
 appeared in Russian in 1875, and the first part consists of
 267 pages folio ; the second part is not yet published. We
 owe to the kindness of Dr. Jas. Walker an account of the
 contents of this large volume. Short accounts of MendeleefTs
  general conclusions are to be found in French in the Melanges
 Physiques et Chimiques tire's du Bulletin de VAcade'mie 1m-
 periale des Sciences de St. Pitersbourg, ix. ; also Annates de
  Chimieet Physique, [3] ix. 1876. These abstracts leave much
  to be desired.
     Mendeleeff slates that he tried nearly a dozen different
  forms of apparatus before a satisfactory one was devised.
 This, he says, is figured in volume ii. table 15 (unpublished)* ;
  but he gives the following description of it in a lecture
  delivered before the Imperial Russian Technical Society in
  January 1881 . It consisted of an ovoid glass vessel, with a
  capacity of about 3£ litres, placed in a trough of water. The
  lower portion of this vessel terminated in a tube, one metre in
  length, provided at its lower end with a stopcock ; the volume
  of air was determined by weighing the mercury run out from
  this vessel. A tube was sealed to this vertical tube, which
  served to fill the measuring-vessel with mercury when re
  quired. A capillary tube was attached to the upper part of the
    * Professor MendeWefF informs us that a large part of the second
  volume is now in manuscript.

         Volume, and Temperature of Rarefied Gases.          305
measuring-vessel ; it communicated with two lateral descend
ing tubes, through one of which gas could be introduced
at will. It was closed by raising a reservoir of mercury,
and covering an opening more than thirty inches below the
top of the measuring-vessel ; but when the reservoir was
lowered, gas could be passed into the measuring-vessel,
through the capillary tube. The second descending tube
counected the measuring-vessel with a wide manometer
formed like a siphon ; and by means of a reservoir it was
possible to raise the mercury in the open limb to a mark
with great accuracy. Corrections were introduced for tem
perature, measured by a differential air-thermometer, and
also for the varying volume of the apparatus due to the
different heights of the mercury in the manometer. It is
easy to see how this apparatus could be employed to test
Boyle's law. To test Gay-Lussac's, he describes the operation
thus :—
   " The mercury is run out of the measuring-vessel to a
mark on the capillary tube, and weighed. Let this be done
at the temperature of boiling water. Now cool the bath
 to 0° by surrounding the vessel with ice—the pressure begins
 to diminish as is indicated by tbe manometer ; but we will
 not allow it to do so. By means of the stopcock and the
 other capillary, we let mercury run into the vessel until the
 pressure of the gas at 0° becomes the same as it was at 100°.
 The apparatus is then raised to the ordinary temperature, and
 the mercury which entered the tube at 0° is run out and
 weighed. This weight and the previous one give us the
 data necessary for calculating the true coefficient of expansion
 of gases."
    No final numbers are given in Mendeleeff's published
 papers, so far as we have been able to discover ; but the
 general result is stated thus :—
    The product of pressure into volume, pv, which according
 to Boyle's law should be constant, varies considerably with
 diminution of pressure; at low pressures pv/dp is positive, i. e.
 the gas is less compressible than it would be if it followed
 Boyle's law. Stating the case broadly, it may bo said that at
 low pressures gases approach the state of a liquid or a solid ;
 or py increases with decrease of/>; or e/d increases, for d= 1/v.
    We have thought it advisable to give a tolerably full
 description of Siljestrom's and Mendeleeff's experiments,
 because they are described in languages not generally known;
 we may discuss the remaining researches on the subject in
.much shorter space, seeing that they are described in French
 and in German.

306    Mr. Baly and Dr. Ramsay on the Relations of Pressure,
   Amagat, in 1883 (Annates de Chirnie et Physique, xxviii.
p. 480), undertook experiments to test the results obtained by
Siljestrom and Mendeleeff, but was unable to confirm them.
His conclusion is, that for the lowest pressures measured
(6"54 millim.) the differences were sometimes positive, some
times negative ; and that the necessary error of experiment
was of an order of magnitude equal to that of the differences
tcmnd. One of the main difficulties of observation was found
in the diffraction of the walls of the manometer in which he
measured the pressures to which the gases were exposed.
He appears, however, to have been successful in overcoming
this difficulty, by the use of polished plane surfaces ; but it is
noteworthy that a suspicion of this source of error does not
appear to have occurred to either of the former experimenters.
Amagat also states that the utmost limit of measurement is
probably overestimated at 0-01 millim. ; and indeed it is
very difficult, if not impossible, to judge of the contact of two
lines, the cross-wriro of the cathetometer and the meniscus of
the mercury in the gauge, to within such a minute distance.
One of his criticisms of MendeleefFs paper is worth quoting:—
   " In M. MendeleefFs experiments, a set of values of pv are
obtained corresponding to a tolerably limited range of pres
sures ; this would seem favourable to a knowledge of the
direction in which these products alter ; but it is necessary to
guard against possible illusion in this matter.
   "A constant cause of error may affect all these products ;
for as they deal with smaller and smaller values the effect
will be more and more marked, and a regular variation may
be conceived to exist, with no foundation in fact. Such an
effect would be produced, for example, if the vacuum in the
barometer were not absolute. It is certain, that whatever
precautious be taken, this vacuum is not absolute ; the effect
of this is to diminish the real value of the pressures, that is to
say, too small pressures are read : hence the value of p/p' is
 reduced, and since p is smaller than p', the values of pv/p'v'
are rendered too small ; and as the error increases with
reduction of pressure, they will ultimately be less than unity.'''
   Amagat proceeds to point out that even the vapour-pressure
of mercury ceases to be negligible when a few hundredths
of a millimetre cause the supposed deviation.
   In 1886, C. Bohr (Wied. Ann. xxvii. p. 459) measured the
pressures and volumes of rarefied oxygen. His conclusions are
that at a temperature of llc,4 oxygen deviates from Boyle's
law. For values of pressure greater than 0*7 millim.,
(p + 0"109) v=k ; and for lower pressures, (p + 0'Q1Q)v=k.
At 0'7 millim. therefore oxygen undergoes a sudden change

         Volume, and Temperature of Rarefied Gases.         307
and becomes more compressible. This is a very strange
conclusion, but it has been confirmed by our work.
   In criticising Bohr's work, it is to be noted that he em
ployed very wide tubes, one as barometer, the other to contain
the rarefied gas. His method of reading was ingenious.
Finding it impossible to read the level of the mercury in such
wide tubes with accuracy, he placed in each a glass ball, and
read its upper surface. The readings therefore appear to be
very accurate. But the shape of the meniscus of mercury is
different in a nearly perfect vacuum and in a vessel contain
ing gas ; it is always flatter in the vacuous tube. Hence the
volume read was probably always too small ; and increasingly
smaller as the gas was more compressed. This would render
the value of the product />y increasingly smaller, and necessi
tate the correction he applies. It would, however, not explain
the breach of continuity which he observed.
   Jsext in order of time conies a paper by F. Fuchs (Wied.
 Ann. xxxv. p. 430) in 1888. The lowest pressure which he
measured was 248 millim. : but though he found deviations in
the case of sulphur dioxide, hydrogen was normal.
    In 1881), E. van der Ven carried out experiments by a
method nearly identical with Siljestrom's, but avoiding the
possibility of cumulative errors which Siljestrom's method
involved. His conclusion is opposite to that of Mendoleeff
and Hiljestrom; it is :—If a volume of air under low pressure,
contained in a closed space, be doubled, it behaves as if its
pv decreased with decrease of pressure. Thus he finds
              At 62 millim. pressure, /w = 0-9873,
              At 31 „ '         „      pv= 0-9811,
              At 16 „           „      jw=0-9740.
   Van der Ven used iron cylinders with walls 6 millim. thick,
 and it is unlikely that any appreciable alteration in their
 volume would be caused by the differences in pressure which
 occur in his experiments. He appears also to have been
 careful about the temperature of the vessels. But the latter
 part of his paper is occupied with a discussion of the
 capillarity of his mercury-gauge ; and it appears to us
 that a possible source of error lies here. For the height of
 the meniscus of mercury in a gauge is undoubtedly altered
 by the pressure of the gas in contact with it; and as the gas
 was rarefied, the apparent difference in height of the mercury
 in a narrow gauge like the one he emploved would be in
 fluenced not merely by capillarity, but also by the form of
 the meniscus. We regard it as probable that the capillarity
 of mercury, like that of other liquids, is altered by the gas in
                                                                    /"
                                                                  f

308    Mr. Baly and Dr. Ramsay on the Relations of Pressure,
contact with it. In the empty, or comparatively empty part
of the gauge, the capillary depression of the mercury is
almost certainly not so great as in that limb exposed to gas ;
and the alteration of the pressure of the gas doubtless also
alters the capillary depression. It would be worth while

                         of Temperature.
   The last paper falling under onr notice is one by G-. Me-
lander, published in 1892 (Wied. Ann. xlvii. p. 136) . It
deals with the thermal expansion of gases under reduced
pressure. He concludes that the coefficient of expansion of
air decreases from 0003066 at 752 millim. to 0-0036594 at
232 millim., and again increases, with reduction of pressure,
until at 6'6 millim. it amounts to 0*0037627 ; the turning-
point of carbon dioxide is 76'2 millim. ; with hydrogen there
is no change in direction, but the coefficient increases from
0-0036504 at 764"5 millim. to 0-0037002 at 9'3 millim.
These conclusions are opposed to those of Siljestrom and
Mendeleeff ; for if the pv increases, as stated by these
authors, it is to be expected that the coefficient of expansion
should decrease with decrease of pressure.
   Before concluding this historical sketch, we feel it neces
sary to point out that it is exceedingly unlikely that these
experimenters were dealing with pure gases. It is true that
their apparatus were filled with comparatively pure gases ;
but they do not seem to have realized the fact that on reduc
tion of pressure, gas different from that with which they
were dealing comes off the walls of the containing vessel.
When this is of glass, a very considerable amount of carbon
dioxide is always evolved. At high pressures, of course, this
would make a small difference, probably inappreciable ; but
as the pressure becomos lower, a gas like hydrogen will be
partly removed, and its place taken by carbonic anhydride.
One can never be certain of the purity of the gas measured
unless its vacuum-tube spectrum is free from that of other
gases.
   Another source of error, small in itself, but possibly im
portant when the small deviations which the experimenters
are endeavouring to measure are taken into consideration, is of
the nature of that pointed out by Lord Rayleigh as applying to
ltegnault's determination of the comparative weights of ny-
drogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. It is that the volume of a glass
(and presumably of an iron) vessel is considerably diminished

          Volume, and Temperature of Rarefied Gases.        309
if it be partially exhausted, owing to the external pressure of
the atmosphere not being balanced by equal pressure in the
interior. In MendeleefFs experiments, for example, in which
glass vessels were used, and in which the volume of the gas
was ascertained by weighing the mercury run out of the vessel,
it appears not unlikely that at low pressures the vessel con
tained less gas than at high pressures. The values of the
products of pressure and volume, pv, might really remain
constant with decrease of pressure ; but as he read pressure
directly, and assumed a volume which was probably too
great, he registered an increase. We are informed, how
ever, by Professor Mendeleeff, that he introduced a correction
 for this possible deviation.
    All the researches described aim at a direct measurement
 of pressure. Now there is a limit to the possibility of such
 measurement, and when the pressure is low, the readings
 necessarily involve considerable relative error, the extent of
which is difficult, if not impossible, to gauge.
    We have therefore adopted a different plan, which admits
 of the observation of the behaviour of gas at pressures much
 lower than most of those previously employed. We have
 met with difficulties, subsequently to be alluded to, which
 may vitiate the results for some gases ; but for hydrogen the
 results are fairly trustworthy.
    To describe the method in a few lines :—Two McLeod
 gauges are exhausted in communication with each other : one
 is heated to a known high temperature ; and at the same in
 stant, both are closed ; after cooling the pressure is read in
 both. The readings afford data from which the expansion of
 the gas may be calculated.
                 Description of the Apparatus.
    The apparatus used for these experiments consisted essen
 tially of two McLeod gauges placed side by side on a stand.
 These gauges were connected on the right to apparatus for
 exhausting them, and on the left to apparatus for admitting
 into them, when exhausted, measured quantities of the gas
 under examination.
    The apparatus for exhausting shown on the right-hand side
 of the diagram consisted of a water-pump A worked by high-
 pressure water, and capable of giving a vacuum of 11 inilliui.
 of mercury.
    The exhaustion of the apparatus was commenced by this
 pump and completed by the mercury-pump B. This mercury-
 pump discharged the gas taken out at each stroke into a
                                                                /

310    Mr. Baly and Dr. Ramsay on the Relations of Pressure,
Torricellian vacuum which was sealed by two siphons a and b.
By this means the gas in the large chamber of the pump
suffered at most compression up to 4 millim. of mercury, so
that the possibility of any considerable condensation of gas
on the glass walls was eliminated, and each stroke of the
pump removed as nearly as possible the theoretical quantity
of gas.
   For the preliminary exhaustion of the apparatus the water-
pump A was connected with the top of the mercury-pump
through the tubes and drying apparatus txa. When this
preliminary exhaustion was complete, the mercury-pump was
brought into action. The lowering and the raising of the
mercury in the pump was brought about by alternately ex
hausting and filling with air the reservoir C which held the
mercury. This could be clone by hand : the exhausting by
connecting it with the water-pump through the tube /S , the
admitting air by opening the tap 7; or, if preferred, by
means of an automatic apparatus D through tubes 88. In
this apparatus a three-way tap was turned through 90° by a
lever, from one side of which was hung a cup fitted with a
curved siphon and from the other a counterpoise, water
being run into the cup through a flexible tube. The working
of this apparatus was quite constant, and was accurately
timed so that if it were left working for a known time the
number of the strokes of the pump could easily be calculated.
The mercury-reservoir C was placed at such a height that
under atmospheric pressure the mercury would run over the
top siphon a, care being taken that the distance from the
siphon a to the T-piece c was considerably less than 30
inches. In the pump used it was 24 inches.
   The mercury in the two MeLood gauges B and F was
regulated for purposes of reading by coarse and fine adjust
ment-screws G; there was also a connexion with a movable
mercury-reservoir H. The tube I contained pentoxide of
phosphorus for drying purposes, and J was a vacuum-tube.
This last was absolutely necessary, as it otherwise would have
been utterly impossible to ascertain whether or not the appa
ratus was full of the gas under examination.
   The gas to be examined was admitted through the tap K
out of the chamber L. By means of the apparatus shown in
the drawing any amount, large or small, of the gas could be
admitted. The chamber L could be exhausted by the con
nexion through the tap M to the water-pump ; a wash-bottle
N containing mercury was interposed to prevent any diffusion
backwards of air or water-vapour into the gas.
  The amount of gas admitted was regulated by means of

          Volume, and Temperature of Rarefied Gases.     311
the siphon 0 which could be sealed by the mercury in the
reservoir P. The mercury-level was adjusted by exhausting
or filling with air the reservoir P in the same manner as
with the reservoir C of the mercury-pump. The amount of
gas admitted could, if desired, be measured in the gas
volume-meter Q, which was designed on the model of the
McLeod gauge. By means of this apparatus as small a
quantity of gas as ^^ of a cubic centimetre could be accu
rately measured and admitted.
   The two gauges E and F were placed close together on the
stand in order to bring them as much as possible under the
same conditions of temperature and exhaustion, and were
almost exactly of the same size. They consisted of a large
volume-chamber (A) about 90 cub. centim. in capacity, with
a pressure-tube (B) at the side and volume-tubes (G) and (D)
at the top. The tube (B) was about £ inch internal diameter;
(C) consisted of a somewhat large capillary tubing, and (D)
of a tube of very small boro. (C) and (Dj were each about
 250 inillim. long. The volume and pressure tubes were
accurately graduated in millimetres, the divisions on each
exactlv corresponding. The zero-points of the scales were
placed at the top of (D) and at the corresponding place on
 (B). (B) was graduated 500 millim. below and 250 millim.
above the zero-point. The total length of the volume-tube
was of course 500 millim. A trap (E) was sealed below the
 chamber (A) in order to more accurately determine the
volume of the gauge.
   The calibration of the gauge was a most important point
and was most carefully done. Every centimetre division on
the volume-tube was taken as a reading-point, making fifty
possible. At each of these points the capillary depression of
the mercury had to be determined, /. e., the difference in
reading between the mercury levels in the pressure and
volume tubes when both levels were under the same pressure.
In order to measure these differences the extreme top of (D)
was drawn out before a blowpipe to a fine point and the tip
cut off. The gauge was then placed in an exactly similar
position to that which it would occupy when finally fixed on
the stand. Mercury was run in from the bottom and readings
taken in the pressure-tube, with the mercury standing at each
of the 50 reading-points on the volume-tube. After this had
been done both with rising and falling mercury, the actual
volumes corresponding to each of the 50 reading-points on
the volume-tube measured from its upper end were deter
mined. The tip of (D) was sealed, and accurately weighed

312    Mr. Baly and Dr. Ramsay on the Relations of Pressure,
quantities of mercury were run in from a fine capillary tube
which was pushed up (0) and (D). From the numbers thus
obtained the volumes represented by each reading-point could
easily be calculated. Lastly, the total volume of the gauge
from the top of (D) to the trap (E) was found by weighing
the gauge empty and then filled with mercury. From the
data thus obtained a table was constructed giving the capillary
corrections and volumes in cubic centimetres for each of the
fifty reading-points, due allowance being made for the
meniscus. A column was also added of the values of R for
each graduation, R being the ratio of the total volume of the
gauge to the small volume at each point, or —.     This ratio is
used in calculating the vacuum in millimetres in the appa
ratus from a reading of the gauge. McLeod has shown that
if a pressure p bo read, and R be the ratio at a point on the
gauge, then the vacuum will be found from the expression
4 , or, if a second approximation be required, from
                               R *
   The method of calculating the numbers read on the gauges
was to multiply each pressure by each volume.
   The following table shows the accuracy to be expected : —

the pressure-tube (B) . Then follow the volumes represented
by the reading-points v', and lastly the product of pressure
and volume. In addition to this, if the original pressure in
the apparatus before reading the gauge is over -1 millim. or
thereabouts, this must be taken into account as the pressures
found will be too small by this amount. The original pressure
must therefore be found from the expression
                                R
as before shown and added to the values given in column
headed p above.
   When the calibration of the gauges was finished they were
ready for use. In fitting up the apparatus it was absolutely
necessary to seal all joints with a hand blowpipe so as to
prevent any possibility of leakage. The tap K for the
admission of the gas to be experimented on was an exception
ally good one of oblique bore. It was lubricated with gummy
phosphoric acid, and though in constant use for over a year
never once showed the faintest trace of any leak whatsoever.
   During the experiments the mercury of the gas volume-
metro Q was kept at a known point x, so that the volume of
the apparatus to be exhausted was from the point x to the
T-piece c of the mercury-pump, the tubes ee, together with
the two gauges and the vacuum-tube J. The gauges when
read had their volume-tubes jacketed with cold water ; and
fitted on gauge E on the diagram is shown the jacket-tube
used in the experiments at high temperatures.
   Whilst working with these gauges we noticed the following
points amongst others. First, when the gauge is not in
use, the mercury should be kept as close as practicable to the
trap, for if it be kept some way below, the gas between the
mercury and the trap will, on raising the mercury, inevitably
be driven into the gauge and considerably disturb the accu
racy of reading, even as much as seven per cent, error having
occurred from this cause.
   Secondly, the ' sticktion ' of the mercury in the capillary
tubes of the gauges is very apt to introduce large errors into
the results, especially at high vacua, when the pressures and
volumes to be read are very small. To overcome this difficulty
the tubes were continually tapped before reading, and many
readings were taken both after ascent and descent of the
mercury. That this was necessary may be shown by the fact
that the before-mentioned capillary corrections when measured

314    Mr.-Baly and Dr. Ramsay on (he Relations of Pressure,
after ascent and descent of the mercury sometimes differed
by as much as four millimetres.
   It is also to be noted that the mercury must be raised very
slowly, or gas will be trapped between the mercury and the
glass. We also found it necessary to make the gauges of
English lead-glass, as we found this to be the only glass that
would stand the high temperature jackets without cracking.
         Experiments to test the Accuracy of the
                          McLeod Gauge.
   In order to determine once and for all the value of the
McLeod gauge as a means of measuring vacua, some experi
ments were made with air. Many sets of readings were
obtained, and they show the absolute failure of the gauge to
measure vacua. It fails more and more as the vacuum
improves. If the gauge had given trustworthy readings, the
values of pv obtained at all reading-points should have been
constant. We give here a set of values of pv measured at a
moderate vacuum (p here refers to pressure in the gauge ;
not to the vacuum in the apparatus) :—

   The other sets of values of pv obtained during this exhaus
tion varied from 100-95, 100-74, 100-65, 100-38, 100-18,
100-14. In each of these sets the first and highest pv is
raised to 100, and all other values in that set raised in pro
portion.
   The set of values of/w given above, decreasing from 100 to
9 was plotted against pressures and the curve (No. I.) drawn
which gives the value of pv constant for minimum pressure
somewhere about 270. This gives a vacuum of 9 millionths
of an atmosphere, instead of -3 millionth.
   But the curve, as thus drawn, is not correct, for the
decrease in the values of pv is due to two causes. First, to
the condensation of the gas on the glass as the pressure rises ;
and secondly, to the fact that Boyle's law does not hold good

 readings of the two gauges at the same vacuum were obtained
 with carbon dioxide. These two series were calculated for
 the same volume and were plotted against pressures. The
two curves crossed at a point (Nos. IE. & III.). Now this
 point, pressure and volume being the same, should be a point
of equal surface, but it is very far from being so. We see,
therefore, that equal pressures may condense quite different
volumes of gas on two equal surfaces of glass ; or, in other
words, that two equal surfaces of glass may have quite different
capabilities of absorbing a gas at a given pressure, owing
apparently to want of uniform porosity. A curve drawn for
a set of readings is, therefore, not to be depended upon.
Indeed, with some gauges, the readings are so erratic that it
is exceedingly difficult to draw a curve at all, and one of the
gauges made for these experiments had actually to bo dis
carded for this very reason. Such results as these put beyond
a doubt the total worthlessness of the gauge as a means of
measuring low pressures with air or with carbon dioxide.
    With hydrogen, however, the case is different. After the
apparatus was absolutely filled with hydrogen, the sets of

    Many series of values of pv were obtained, and they prove
 that hydrogen expands quite normally between the limits 650
 and 2'5 millim. of mercury pressure. We found it impossible
 with any accuracy to make readings in the gauges with a
 pressure smaller than 2"5 millim. These results also prove
 that hydrogen does not condense on a glass surface between
 these limits of pressure. By measuring the rate of exhaustion
 of an apparatus of known volume by a reservoir pump whose
 volume is also known, wo found that hydrogen suffers no
 condensation on glass down to as low a pressure as '000076
 millim.
     Let the volume of the apparatus be called V and the volume
 of the pump V, then the pressure after a stroke of the pump
 will be v      v, times the pressure which existed before the
 stroke. This value may also be found experimentally by
 dividing the pressure after a stroke of the pump by tho pre
 viously existing pressure. We have called this ratio the
  Factor of Exhaustion. It is evident that the constancy of
  this factor of exhaustion depends not on the expansion of the
  gas but on the possibility of condensed gas coming off tho
  walls of the apparatus, in which case its value would increase.
  We made many scries of measurements to obtain the factors
  of exhaustion, and found that they were quite constant and
  equal to theory down to the extreme limit of exhaustion.
     We give here the results tabulated.
     In the column headed ratio of gauge readings are given
  the ratios of the readings of the two gauges obtained at each
  measurement. As these, of course, ought to be constant,
  tbey may be looked upon as a measure of the experimental

  the deviations observable in the values of the factors of ex-

    The last series vary a great deal owing to difficulties of
 reading, and also to the fact of the extremely high vacuum,
 pumping is performed by diffusion. The presence of mercury-
 vapour makes no difference in these experiments at all. When
 the mercury is raised in the gauges and the pressure on the gas
 rises, the mercury-vapour becomes condensed, and readings
 are only made of the hydrogen in the apparatus. When the
 mercury is lowered again, mercury-vapour doubtless mixes
 with the hydrogen till a state of equilibrium is reached, the
 Percentage of mercury-vapour depending on the pressure,
  n working the pump also the presence of mercury-vapour
 has no effect, for the pump-chamber when the mercury falls
is empty of hydrogen, and if there is any hydrogen in the
apparatus it will diffuse in through the mercury-vapour.
 This explains how it is possible to exhaust an apparatus lilled
with hydrogen so far that the pressure of the gas left is con
siderably below the pressure of mercury-vapour, though of
course the actual pressure in the apparatus is not below that
of mercury-vapour, for as fast as the hydrogen diffuses out of
the apparatus into the pump, its place is taken by more
mercury-vapour. Apparently, however, there is a limit to
this, for we were not able to take out any more hydrogen
than is represented by the last reading of the table above.
The pressure of hydrogen in the apparatus was about #000076
millim., while the vapour-pressure of mercury is about
•0002 millim.

          Volume, and Temperature of Rarefied Gases.        319
   An interesting calculation may be made with this value.
If the gas under examination were air and not hydrogen,
then a great quantity of air would have condensed on the
glass when the mercury was raised in the gauge to take the
reading. If the curve (No. I.) were applied to this value, we
should obtain the reading of the vacuum '0000022 millim.
This curve, however, was obtained for air at greater pressure
than the above, and the condensation would be still greater
at "000076 millim., so that this is probably the highest
vacuum that has yet been measured.
   These results provo that hydrogen does not in any way
condense on to a glass surface on rise of pressure, and that
therefore in working a McLeod gauge with hydrogen all the
gas in the gauge is measured and nono lost 7°   by surface-con
densation. The McLeod gauge is accordingly trustworthy to a
certain extent when working with absolutely pure hydrogen.
   With carbon dioxide, however, the case is different. Several
series of factors of exhaustion were obtained with this gas,
and it was found that they steadily increase in value as the
exhaustion proceeds. This is owing to condensed carbon
dioxide coming off the walls of the apparatus. It seems even
possible to reach to a pressure which is equal to the " vapour-
pressure " of the carbon dioxide which is condensed on the
walls. For in a particular experiment the factors of exhaustion
increased steadily till they reached -y97, and 188 pumps more
failed to make tho slightest difference in the vacuum, as
evidenced by tho electric discharge in the vacuum-tube and
by the gauge-readings. It would appear therefore that the
pressure in the apparatus just equalled the pressure of the
condensed carbon dioxide, and that as fast as tho pressure
was lowered by more pumping it was restored to its equilibrium
by more carbon dioxide escaping from the pores of the con
taining walls. Tho vacuum was not very high, the apparent
pressure being about one millionth of an atmosphere.
   We found the converse of this when admitting measured
volumes of carbon dioxide into a vacuum. In these experi
ments a gauge-reading was first taken and the pv calculated ;
then a known volume of carbon dioxide also calculated to pv
was admitted. This last value multiplied by the ratio which
the gauge volume bears to the rest of the apparatus will give
the amount of carbon dioxide taken up by the gauge. This
added to the previous value of pv read in the gauge ought to
agree with the gauge-reading taken after the admission of
the carbon dioxide. But we found that the measured pv was
always smaller than that calculated. This shows therefore
that some of the carbon dioxide condenses.

    We give one series of measurements together with the
 values calculated from the known volume admitted:—

                       21-2                 19-6
    These results aro a further proof that tho McLeod gauge
 is of no value in determining the amount of rarefaction of
 carbon dioxide.
    We also found it very easy to exhaust all hydrogen out of
 tho apparatus if there were any condensed carbon dioxide on
 the containing walls. When the pump was started at about
  10 millim. pressure, the spectrum of the gas in the vacuum-tube
 was only that of hydrogen. As tho exhaustion proceeded the
 factor of exhaustion steadily increased while hydrogen slowly
 disappeared from the vacuum-tube and carbon dioxide ^became
 in eyidenco, till in a short time all the hydrogen had been
 pumped out and only carbon dioxide remained.
    These facts may give an idea of the great difficulties we
 met with in filling the apparatus absolutely with hydrogen.
 This was a most length}- and tedious operation. In spite of
 the fact that the apparatus used for the hydrogen experi
ments never had carbon dioxide put into it, the glass and the
phosphorus pentoxide nevertheless contained great quantities
 of this gas condensed on them, the removal of which took a
 very long time. First of all the apparatus was exhausted as
highly as possible and then the glass, especially the phos-
phorus-pentoxide tube, was raised to a high temperature
 with a Bunsen-burner, the exhaustion being kept very high
in the meantime. Hydrogen was then admitted, and the
 apparatus again exhausted, the heating being still continued.
 This was repeated until no further carbon dioxide could be
 brought off the walls by the heating in the vacuum and
 until, after leaving it for a night, very highly exhausted, no
 spectrum of carbon dioxide was visible in the vacuum-tube
when a current was passed. This process sometimes lasted a
fortnight.
    The foregoing results and the difficulties we met with in
filling the apparatus with hydrogen emphasize our criticism
on all previous work. For this fact of the condensation of
carbon dioxide does not appear to have been noticed by
previous experimenters. It would tend to make the read

          Volume, ami Temperature of Rarefied Gases.       321
pressure too high, for carbon dioxide, being evolved from the
glass with decrease of pressure, would mix with the gas under
experiment and increase the apparent pressure. It is prob
ably the reason why the product of pressure and volume has
so often been found to increase with reduction of pressure.
   To measure the expansion of hydrogen below the pressure
of 2-5 millim. the thermal method was adopted. One of the
two gauges was jacketed at a known temperature, and the
expansion of the gas thus determined. Readings were taken
on both the gauges, and the ratio of the two sets of values of
pv obtained. When the mercury is lowered in the gauges
the gas expands, and though its expansion below 2'5 millim.
may be abnormal, this ratio of the values of pv remains the
same. One of the gauges is then jacketed and the other
read. This reading multiplied by the ratio before obtained
gives the pv of the hot gas in the other gauge. The hot
gauge is then shut off and allowed to cool, when it is read.
The ratio of the readings of the gauge when hot and
when cold is equal to the ratio of tho absoluto temperatures.
To give an idea of the accuracy of the method we quote an
example :—

322     Mr. Baly and Dr. Ramsay on tlte Relations of Pressure,
   When gauge F was hot the reading of gauge E was
         379-71.
   Therefore the reading of gauge F was
                  379-71 x T05 =396-80.

                                Vacuum =3-47 millim.
   In making these experiments the readings were taken at
the same reading-points throughout the whole operation so
as to ensure accuracy. It will bo evident that the volumes
represented by the divisions on the gauge do not influence
 the result, and provided that the whole calculation is made
from readings at the same points, the volumes at these points
 may be given any value whatever. The accuracy of the
 experiment therefore does not depend in any way on the
 accuracy of the volumes at the reading-points, but only of the
pressures, which were very carefully read to within 0-l
millim.

 obtained :—

   The purity of the hydrogen in these experiments was
satisfactorily proved by both the constancy of the gauge-
readings in each experiment and by the factor of exhaustion
being equal to theory.
   If the above results be plotted on a curve it shows that
hydrogen expands quite normally till a pressure of "4 millim.
is reached, when its elasticity increases with further decrease
of pressure. Many other experiments were made, with similar
results.

   Having thus satisfactorily proved that this method of
determining the thermal expansion of hydrogen is capable of
giving accurate results, we proceeded to apply it to de-
terming the expansions of oxygen and nitrogen at reduced
pressures.
    In the case of oxygen the gas was made by heating per
manganate of potassium, it was washed in caustic potash and
dried by means of sulphuric acid and phosphorus pentoxide.
Oxygen proved to be an exceptionally difficult gas to deal
with, as it was found impossible to determine its purity by the
electric discharge in the vacuum-tube, as the presence of dust
or other combustible material led to the formation of carbon
dioxide. This method therefore was of no use, and the purity
of the oxygen was determined by the result obtained, as will
be seen further on.
    The coefficient of expansion of oxygen was found to be
from very careful experiments :—
                         5-1 milliin. m,
                         V3           ±
                         00     )!    2t>0>
 These results are very fairly good, and being at such high
 pressures as 4 and 5 millim. may be said to demonstrate the
 absence of carbon dioxide, especially inasmuch as they give
 evidence of oxygen being too expansible while carbon dioxide
 is the opposite. Each of these results, too, was obtained after
 a fresh filling of the apparatus, which in each case was most
 carefully done. Therefore the proof that they are measure
 ments of the expansion of pure oxygen may be regarded as
 conclusive. As the results next obtained gave evidence that
 with decrease of pressure the coefficient of expansion still
 further increased, and as on the slightest sign of presence of
 carbon dioxide the apparatus was most carefully filled again
 with oxygen, there is no doubt that the expansion of pure
  oxygen was in each case measured. The presence of a small
 quantity of carbon dioxide would materially alter the results,
 as the value of the coefficient of expansion of this gas is so
 small at the pressures here dealt with.
     The anomaly in the expansion of oxygen, first noticed by
 Bohr, was brought very strikingly under our notice in working
 with oxygen. The vacuum was at one time 1*4 millim., when,
 on a stroke of the pump being taken, the remaining gas, now
 at a pressure of about "75 millim., behaved in a most extra
 ordinary fashion. For example, the two gauges E and F,

324    Mr. Baly and Dr. Ramsay on the lielations of Pressure,
which are of the same volume within "1 per cent., gave values
of pv which instead of being equal had a ratio to one another
of 1 to 8 8. We give the values :—

   A large number of experiments were made, in which the
gauges were continually opened and again closed and read,
but the right ratio was not obtained until after 78 hours' rest.
Then the readings in the gauge became normal, and an
experiment was attempted to measure the coefficient of
expansion, but the equilibrium of the gas was instantly dis
turbed, and the result came out about            When the ap
paratus was exhausted beyond this particular point, the
behaviour of the gas became quite regular again, and two
measurements of expansion were made. This same anomaly
was met with again in subsequent experiments.

   It will be seen, therefore, that the coefficient of expansion
of oxygen decreases with decrease of pressure. Having a
valuo of about ^ at 5 millim., it increases steadily to where
the change takes place. At a rarefaction greater than at this
point, the value of the coefficient is again smaller, but it still
appears to increase with further diminution of pressure.
   It is difficult to account for the abnormal behaviour of
oxygen as regards distribution in the gauges at a pressure of

           Volume, and Temperature of Rarefied Gases.         325
0-75 millim. The only possible explanation appears to be that
the temperatures of the two gauges must have differed to a
small extent, and that the smallest difference in temperature
produces quite an unusual disturbance in equilibrium.
    Nitrogen was next experimented upon. The gas was pre
pared by absorbing the oxygen from air, first as far as possible
by means of pyrogallate of potassium, and then by passing it
over red-hot copper-gauze.
    The experiments were carried out in the usual way, and
there was no special difficulty connected with the filling of
the apparatus with the gas.
    The great difficulty in working with nitrogen was that
experienced in obtaining satisfactory and concordant results
in measurement of the ratio between the gauge-readings
preliminary to the jacketing. This difficulty increased as the
vacuum improved, and it was found impossible to obtain
results of any value whatever at a less pressure than -6 millim.
The readings for the ratio were always taken with the utmost
care, but in spite of this ratios sometimes differed amongst
themselves as much as 2 per cent., which means a difference
 of 9 or more per cent, in the values of the coefficient of
 expansion.

apparatus with nitrogen. The two values in each set have
been calculated with the two extreme values of the gauge ratio
that have been obtained during the experiments at this pressure
 •6 millim. Though the results are not good, they nevertheless
 show that the coefficient of expansion of nitrogen for ono
degree Centigrade decreases with decrease of pressure.
    To sum up the results •.— (1) The coefficient of expansion
of hydrogen with temperature decreases as pressnre is lowered.
It is normal down to a pressure of O'l millim. (2) The co
efficient of expansion ol oxygen is greater than the normal
one, being 1/262 instead of 1/273 ; it increases with decrease
of pressure to 1/233 at 1'4 millim. pressure ; at 0 7 millim.
pressure it is erratic ; but at lower pressures it again becomes
more constant, still showing, however, a tendency to increase
as pressure is decreased. (3) With nitrogen the coefficient
of expansion is lower than the. normal (1/304) at pressures
between 5 and 1 millim. ; at lower pressures, like that of
hydrogen, its coefficient of expansion decreases ; that is the
gas becomes more elastic. (4) So far as it was possible to
experiment with carbon dioxide, its behaviour appears to
resemble that of hydrogen and nitrogen ; but owing to the
tendency which it has to condense and cling to the gauge,
trustworthy measurements were impossible to attain. These
results corroborate those of Mendeleeff and Siljestrom, although
they are deduced from thermal expansion, while theirs were
deduced from the compressibility of the gas. And Bohr's
results as regards the abnormality of oxygen were also con
firmed, although likewise by a ditferent method.
    If it may be taken for granted, then, that the rate of expansion
of gases decreases with decrease of pressure, it is necessary to
inquire why this is the case. From the point of view of the
kinetic theory, pressure is caused by impacts on the walls of
the containing vessel of the molecules which it contains, due
to their translational motion. The internal motion does not
give rise to pressure. If, on communicating to a gas energy,
by raising its temperature, it does not respond by a sufficient
rise of pressure, it appears to us that the conclusion is inevi
table that its internal energy is increased to a greater than
usual extent compared with its translational energy. It is
perhaps idle to speculate on the extreme final state of rarefac
tion ; but if this diminished rate of expansion were to continue
to increase with tenuity, a point might conceivably be reached
where all received energy would result in internal motion.
Can this be the cause, or one cause, of phosphorescence in
high vacua ?

 Ostwald treats of the limiting phenomena of volume-energy.
 He suggests that if it bo conceivable that the volume of a gas
 is increased indefinitely, the volume-energy obtainable from a
 gas would also increase infinitely, involving the consequence
 that from a finite quantity of gas an infinite amount of heat
 of constant temperature could be converted into kinetic energy.
 He therefore suggests thatat some very great, yet finite volume,
 the pressure should become zero, and the gas should therefore
 refuse to increase its volume. Instead of the expression for
 Boyle's law, pv = c, {p + k)v = c, where k=       , i.e. at a volume
                                             ''max
 where p = 0. Such a supposition would place an upper limit
 to the atmosphere. Similar considerations are also applied by
 him to gravitational energy.
     The abnormal behaviour of oxygen is, if not more, at least
 equally difficult to explain. Some profound change must take
 place suddenly at the pressure 0*7 millim.             Whether this
 change is of the nature of dissociation or not, cannot readily
 be determined ; but the spectra of oxygen appear to show tbat
 it is able to exist in several modifications at low pressures.
     The work described appears to us very incomplete ; yet it
 has not been for want of time and trouble epent on it. The
 experiments are of extreme difficulty, and it has taken close
 on two years to arrive at the results chronicled, imperfect as
 they are. We are, however, somewhat cheered to learn that
 the experience of Professor Mendeleeff has in this respect
 been like ours ; that a short column of figures can express
 the results of the labour of years.

 The Steam-Engine and other Heat-Engines. By J. A. Ewing,
    M.A., B.Sc., F.B.S., M. Inst. C.E. Cambridge : at the Uni
    versity Press.
PROFESSOR EWING'S article on the Steam-Engine in the
       Encyclopedia Britannica reads like a set of most excellent
lecture-notes. In the present book the Encyclopedia article may
easily be recognized ; but if we may dare to say so, it is like
recognizing the features and manners of a clever Scotch medical
student in an accomplished and experienced London physician.
   Although short for such a great subject, its style is polished ;
and because the author has not only studied his subject, but also
his students, the book reads very easily. Only in a very few
places does there seem to be any of that useless mathematics with

328                Notices respecting New Books.
which many modern engineering hooks are stuffed. On the other
hand, it would be easy to point out places in which a somewhat
fuller treatment of the subject would have been an improvement.
Every statement will stand examination, there being nothing
slipshod either in the author's knowledge of the principles of
science, or in his application of these principles to the exceedingly
complicated phenomena with which the practical engineer has to
deal. It is just possible that exception might be taken to the
author's way of speaking of the absolute zero of temperature and
of absolute temperature, as if we knew its scale at very low tem
peratures. In this, if he is in error, he errs w ith 99 per cent, of
the writers of books.
   The book is illustrated with many woodcuts, and gives a good
general idea of the most recent engineering practice ; but the
author has very rightly left out such illustrations and descriptions
of mere details as are far better studied in shops and in drawing-
offices and their usual books of reference.
   "We are glad to see a clear description of the uses of the tem
perature-entropy diagrams which Mr. Macfarlane Gray has for
so long been endeavouring to make engineers understand. It is
certain that no educated engineer who practises with it for an hour
will ever dispense with its help in his study of a heat-engine. For
the study of steam-engines we have a curve whose vertical ordinate
is 0 the temperature and abscissa f the entropy of 1 lb. of water,
and we have another curve for 1 lb. of dry saturated steam. An
adiabatic line in this diagram is a vertical straight line and areas
represent amounts of energy as heat or work. Assuming no
standing water in the cylinder, or assuming that the whole mass is
at the same temperature, and giveu the feed-water per stroke as
well as the indicator-diagram, it is astonishing how much infor
mation as to rate of reception or loss of heat and condensation or
vaporization is given easily by the 0, <f> diagram.
   That the alternate heating and cooling of the cylinder is the great
source of waste in a steam-engine was clearly pointed out by Watt.
That high temperature (and therefore pressure) of the entering
steam leads to greater efficiency has been more or less correctly
known since the time of Carnot. But these two principles are
antagonistic, because the second necessitates great expansion, and
this implies great range of temperature, and hence eacli of these
principles has been lenrnt and forgotten again, eulogized and con
demned, several times during the last eighty years. The valuable
work of Bankine, which might have been of enormous use to the
practical men, could not be recognized by them because the actual
waste in well-made engines was unaccounted for by his theories ;
yet Clarke's experiments were made in 1855 and Isherwood's in
] 803. Just before Bankine's death he was beginning to take the
missing water into account, as is evident in his memoir of John
Elder. Elder, in a paper read before the United Service Insti
tution in 1866, showed that it was advantageous to employ a
compound engine with two cylinders when expanding steam to five

                    Notices respecting New Books.                  329
 times its volume, and one with three cylinders for successive ex
 pansion to ten times the volume.
    We read the history of the steam-engine with much humility.
 It is a history of the work of theorists without practical knowledge
and of practitioners without theoretical knowledge, entirely out of
sympathy with one another because each side of them could see
that the other side was wrong. This is even now only slowly
being replaced by a better state of things, a number of young
practitioners being fairly well equipped with scientific knowledge;
but the prejudices of the " rule of thumb "engineer are not by any
means dead ; and many of his sneers at the so-called theorists are
not altogether undeserved.
    The solution of the problem which is now generally adopted is
 that of expanding the steam successively in a series of cylinders
 so that the range of temperature in each shall be small, and to
 shorten the periodic time to take advantage of a well-known fact
in heat-conduction—that the amount of heat entering the metal
 when its skin is higher in temperature than the portions inside or
 leaving the metal when the skin is lower in temperature, say,
during a half period, is inversely proportional to the square root of
this periodis time. The phenomena are very complicated, and we
are only gradually getting to understand how to make experiments.
Theie can be no doubt that the film of water which adheres to the
metal surfaces performs a most important function ; for no ordi
nary einissivity of surface will account for the great rapidity with
 which the entering steam gives up its heat ; but it can be explained
by the evaporation or condensation of water and steam at their
surface of separation. If we take it that the whole of this water is
always at the temperature of the steam and consider the metal to be
nonconducting, the work per stroke will now be proportional to the
amount of water present, and will be independent of the periodic
time. ISuch experimental results as we have seem to indicate that
 the loss per stroke is not inversely proportional to the square
root of the periodic time, but it is not independent of the periodic
time.
   If the water alone wrere operative, it is an interesting inquiry,
 Ought not the amount of water present to go on increasing ? The
calculation is more difficult than it seems at first sight. How
much steam will condense when it enters the cylinder ? How much
will condense in the adiabatic expansion ? These are easy erough,
although the first is an irreversible process ; but in the irreversible
phenomenon of release to the condenser there is a step-by-t.ep
approximate integration to be performed, which is very tedious ;
we know from actual experiment that the average mathematical
physicist needs ten days to find out the difficulty of this problem-.
It is difficult to see why, as a rule, in all engines there is so little
condensation or vaporization during the expansion when there is
such enormous condensation during the admission, and yet the
piston is continually exposing fresh cold surfaces. Condensation
is probably going on at these cold surfaces, and nearly equal

330                Notices respecting New Books.
vaporization is going on from the now warmer surfaces. It is just
possible that condensation and vaporization due to such causes as
adiabatic expansion and free rushes of steam do not affect the
amount of water deposited on the metal surfaces ; the)* only affect
the quantity of finely divided cloud.
    All engineers are now convinced that it is important to diminish
the amount of water present before admission ; and three methods
have been adopted for this which are all effective. One which was
tried about thirty years ago, and abandoned for insufficient
reasons, was to superheat the steam : this will probably be tried
again. The second was the invention of Watt : it is to heat the
cylinder from the outside by a steam-jacket, or a flue-jacket, or a
gas flame-jacket. Among all the experiments carefully carried out
during the last twenty years to discover whether the waste of
steam in the jacket was less than the saving effected by its use, we
think that there is not one in which the use of the jacket did not
lead to economy. The economy effected by the use of the jacket
is very much more noticeable in cylinders, which without it were
very wasteful.
    The third plan is that of facilitating the drainage of the cylinder.
We may not be able to drain off the water-film which adheres to
all the inner surface of the cylinder, but we can prevent the
collection of water in pockets ; and there can be no doubt that it
is to this that the engine of the late Mr. Williams owes most of
its efficiency.
     We do not know that there has yet been much of an attempt to
hinder the condensation by the use of paint or varnish or a lubri
cator ; but a very much more promising plan, which has not yet
been tried, and which might be of special use in non-condensing
engines, is that of mixing with the steam air or some vapour whose
 condensing temperature is much less than that of steam. The
 experiments of Prof. Osborne Reynolds about twenty years ago
 showed that a comparatively small amount of air very greatly
 retarded the condensation of steam when suddenly admitted to a
 cold vessel. In this connexion it will be interesting to see the
 results of some experiments of which we have heard in which a
 cylinder is, in alternate strokes, that of a steam-engine and that of
 a gas-engine.
     The use of steam-engines to drive electric-lighting dynamo-
 machines with loads which vary greatly during the twenty-four
 hours, and especially in places where space is valuable, has given
 prominence to the study of the behaviour of engines in which
 nothing varies but the initial pressure of the steam. Mr. AVilliams
 found that in any trial with very varying loads, when plotting
 " water per hour W " and the indicated horse-power II, his points
 lay in a straight line. The result is rather striking, so striking,
 indeed, that " W a linear function of H " has already been called
 41 the Williams law." Knowing, as we do, that the missing heat
is proportional to the range of temperature, and using the Eankine
 method of calculation from Hypothetical Diagrams, it is easy to

                   Notices respecting New Books.                 331
see that, mainly on account of the volume of 1 lb. of steam being
nearly inversely proportional to the pressure, the curve connecting
W and H is very nearly straight within the limits of such ordinary
pressures as are used in engines. It is unfortunate that there are
engineers who forget that the law is an empirical one, and who
are already speculating on the meaning of the Williams law when
the II is negative. The useful horse-power given out by the crank
shaft and the electrical horse-power given out by the driven
dynamos are known to be linear functions of the indicated horse
power II with considerable accuracy ; and hence Wis a linear
function of each of these powers also.
    Any general law like this which simplifies calculations is of
enormous use to practical men. It is of importance to note that,
from theoretical considerations, it is probably to be relied upon
as being generally true ; for the practical man is very provincial,
and he is a little too apt to assume a general law from his own
restricted experience.
    On the subject of gas- and oil-engines Prof. Ewing has given
just enough to make us wish that he had devoted three times the
space to it. Except in the noisy Otto-Langen of 1866—now
seidom seen — no one except Mr. Atkinson has made a serious
attempt to get rid of the enormous waste due to the water-jacket.
In the usual working of gas- or oil-engines the water-jacket carries
 off just half of the total available energy of the gas or oil. The
avernge velocity with which each part of a cycle is performed is pro
bably now as high as it conveniently can be made to be, consistently
with certainty that each operation shall be properly performed. But
after ignition of the charge, if there is not too much inert matter
present, and if the mixture of air and gas was sufficiently intimate,
we have no reason to believe that four times the present velocity
in the expansion-stroke would do any harm, whereas the cooling
due to such a rapid expansion would probably do away, almost
altogether, with the necessity for a water-jacket. It is known,
indeed, that exceedingly rapid cooling of red-hot, and therefore
dissociated, carbonic acid allows it to remain partially dissociated
at the lower temperature, like the carbon in steel (possibly) ;
but experiment would easily settle the rate of expansion which
produced maximum economy.
    Besides Mr. Atkinson's method of giving rapid expansion, we
might effect the same object by the use of a springy attachment of
the fly-wheel to the crank-shaft. It is unfortunately the difficulty
of balancing reciprocating masses which now troubles the gas-engine
maker, as it troubles also the steam-engine manufacturer ; and it
is possible that the large gas-engine of the future will consist of a
pump pumping a mixture of air and gas or oil at great pressure
into a white-hot firebrick chamber from which it will issue, driving
a turbine on the Parson's steam-turbine principle.
   The steam-engine constructor seems rather to dislike statements
of the actual thermodynamic efficiency of his engines. Rightly
enough, his standard of comparison is a perfect steam-engine

 332            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 working with the same limits of temperature. But even here he
takes as his lower limit of temperature the usual temperature of
 the exhaust in the actual steam-engines, and not the lowest tem
perature possible, say, the average atmosphere temperature ; and
 in the case of the condensing-engine he makes his standard de
 fective in another way by limiting the maximum volume of the
 standard engine's cylinder.
    Instead of speaking of pounds of coal per hour per indicated
 horse-power, he prefers to speak of pounds of steam ; and the
manufacturer of our generation is rightly proud to have reduced
this from numbers greater than 30 lb. of steam per hour per indi
cated horse-power to numbers less than 14. To those of us who
lament the waste of our fuel, it is more instructive to consider the
 absolute efficiency of the steam-engine. It is only the very largest
and best of steam-engines which can be said, even by their con
structors, to give, during an exceptionally well-stoked trial, one
actual horse-power for l-6 lb. of coal per hour. This means that
the energy utilized is only about 17 or 18 per cent, of the supply
in the very largest and best of steam-engines ! There is some
comfort in the thought that even in small gas-engines 1 actual
horse-power is obtained from very little more than 1 lb. of
anthracite per hour when Dowson gas is used. In the animal
machine over 90 per cent, of the supply of energy in the fuel may
be converted into useful mechanical work. The man who first
shows us how, in a small space and without excessive cost of plant,
we can convert the chemical energy of coal and air into electrical
energy, ps zinc is burned in a voltaic cell, will be the greatest
benefactor of his race—;f he only comes soon enough.

HEAT OF DISSOCIATION ACCORDING TO THE ELECTROCHEMICAL
                       THEORY. BY H, ECERT.
"CWERY stage in the development of chemistry can show experi-
-" ments made to account for the forces which hold together the
atoms in compound bodies. In immediate connexion with
Kekule's doctrine of Valency, von Helmholtz, on the basis of
Faraday's law of Electrolysis, was the first to show in the case of
electrolytes, that each valency must be considered charged with a
minimum quantity of electricity, the " valency-charge," which like
an electrical atom is no longer divisible*, so that chemical affinities
   * That for electricity also there are minimal quantities wliich can be
no longer divided, and which are associated with the smallest particles
of ponderable masses, may be differently expressed. Lot e be this
elementary quantity, and X, Y, and Z the components of the forces
exerted by it, then
                   e=-l,4;r(dX,cyl'-t-aY/di/-|-dZ g:).
The expression within the brackets i«, however, nothing more than the

                   Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                333
    are in fact determined by the eleetrostatical situation of these
    elementary charges which attach to corporeal atoms of various
    fluids. According to this theory, the work of dissociation which
    must be expended in order to decompose an electrically-neutral
    molecule into its constituents which are charged with electricities
    of opposite polarity, must be identical with the work to be
    expended in removing the electrical valency-charges from their
    actual distances in the molecule to such distances that we can
    regard the molecules as dissociated. The heat of dissociation must
    then be partially or wholly equivalent to electrical work. AVe shall
    see that this is actually the case, that the heat of dissociation is
    already entirely consumed in overcoming the electrical attractions
     of the valency-charges, so that, compared with the electrical,
     purely chemical forces altogether recede.
        If the valency- charges +e and — e at the position of valency
    adhere each to an atom united to form an electrically neutral
     molecule, they would attract electrostatically at the distance r with
     the force /= —e'/r* dynes.
        How these elementary quantities are arranged in the atoms we
    are ignorant. From the fact of radiation, which we may refer to
    vibrations of the valency-charges, we must conclude that they must
     oscillate about certain mean positions, yet nothing exact is known
    as to the distance of these centres of oscillation in the molecule.
        As a first approximation we may regard the atoms as spheres
     which lie close to each other in the molecule. The diameter d of
     what is called the sphere of action of the molecule is then of the
     order of the sum of the diameters of the spheres. The simplest
     assumption which we could make as to the oscillations of the
     valency-charges would be that we regard them as taking place in
     each atom symmetrically about the centre. The mean reciprocal
     distance of the valency-charges in the non-dissociated molecule is
     then = ^d. Accordingly, in order to move the valency-charges from
    their distance from each other in the molecule, to such a distance
     that they no longer act on each other, the work required for each
     molecule would be a= — e'/($d) ergs> a,,d f°r the molecular weight
     the work A=— a?j{\d) ergs', z being the number of molecules.
        If, therefore, in comparison with the electrical forces those of
• »
    " convergence of electrical lines of force " (Maxwell, Treatise, i. § 25,
    ?. 29, 2nd edition ; compare also Heaviside, Electrical Papers, i. p. 210,
      892). So that we may also say, the convergence of electrical rays of force
     towards an atom of ponderable matter cannot sink below a certain limit.
     According to this the existence of electrical elementary quantities is
     closely connected with the geometrical properties of our space and its
    being tilled with matter. By resting on definite mechanical representa
    tions further reasons may be adduced : thus, for instance, tubes of
    force are identified with vortex threads of the aither, as in some
    mechanical theories of the electrical field. Such threads can return to
    themselves, or may end in the corporeal atoms in the a.'ther. But as
    they must have a definite cross section, only a limited number can ter
    minate on a smallest corporeal particle.

334           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
another kind, such as chemical affinity, and the gravitating forces
 of ponderable masses are quite insignificant, the work of dissocia
tion must be quite defined by valency-charge, number of molecules
in the molecular weight, and molecular diameter. As regards the
work of gravitation von Helmholtz has shown * that it quite dis
appears in comparison with the electrical work, since the electrical
forces of the charges are many million times greater than the
gravitating forces of the corresponding material carriers. As it will
be seen that the work of dissociation calculated from the magni
tudes mentioned agrees in the order of their magnitude with those
determined experimentally, specially chemical forces can play no
great part in comparison with electrical forces, and we must con
clude that chemical affinity is essentially an eleetrical property of
the smallest particles.
    M. F. liicharzt has formerly shown that in the case of
nitric tetroxide we arrive at plausible values for the sphere of
action of the molecules, if we consider the work needed for dis
sociation of N204 into iiNOj as an electrical one done against the
attractions of the elementary charges ; in this be assumes that
such elementary charges attach to the free valency of the
monovalent group
                                   —o
   It must be of interest to make such a calculation for the im
portant case of an elementary gas. In this respect hydrogen
and iodine vapour have the recommendation that we have definite
values for the heat of dissociation. According to Hchnholtz's
electrochemical theory in the case of hydrogen t he two atoms hold
together in the molecule, because one of them possesses at its
position of valency a positive quantum of electricity, which it would
have for example in an electrolyte; the other, on the contrary,
has had to change its positive charge, in an electrolytic process for
instance, for an equal negative charge, and is thus negatively
charged. Hence the hydrogen molecule is externally electrically               y.
neutral. Iodine is analogous. The conception of a molecule con
sisting of a positive and a negative atom has been successfully               t '
applied by MM. W. Giese, A. Schuster, J. J. Thomson, Elster

value for the heat of dissociation of H2, for in it that quantity of
heat is contained which must be used to bring the hydrogen to the
boundary of dissociation. Yet this value is in auy case very near
 the true heat of dissociation.

   That it is smaller agrees with the fact that iodine vapour is dis
   sociated at temperatures at which this is not the case with hy
   drogen, that the band-spectrum of iodine vapour is very difficult
   to obtain, and so forth.

    a totally different way the assumption that the energy of radia
    tion of a luminous vapour depends on electrical vibrations of
    these valency-charges «=0-14x 10-10 C.G.S. ; a number, therefore,
    which in the order of magnitude is quite comparable with the first,
     and therefore conversely justifies the assumption in question.
        The kinetic theory of gases gives for the molecular diameter
     rZ=10-8 cm., and for the number of hydrogen molecules in the
     unit of weight 6*7 X 1023 ; in the molecular weight of any gas or
     vapour there are thus z=l-3x 102' molecules.
        If these values, taking Richarz's for e, be placed in the above

    This value is quite of the order of the value above given for
 hydrogen AH^1-1 x 10'3, and that for iodine-vapour Ai =1-2 x 1013
 ergs ; it is indeed somewhat greater than the latter.
    From this it results that the whole, work required for the dissocia
 tion of hydrogen and iodine molecules is used in overcoming the purely
 electrical attraction forcrs of the valency-charges.
    That this heat of dissociation is so completely spent in elec
 trical work shows, in agreement with many other facts, that the forces
 of chemical affinity are essentially of an electrical character ; that the
 electrostatical forces which the charges exert on each oilier at the
positions of valency are " by far the most powerful among the forces
exerted among the atoms ; " and that iu H. v. Hemholtz's ' Faraday
 Lectures,' particular possible chemical forces of the charged atoms can
be but infinitely small in comparison with electrical forces. This
 seems of great importance for the theory of chemical forces in
general.— Wiedemann's Annalen, No. 10, 1893.
ALTERATIONS OF THE ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE OF AQUEOUS
    SOLUTIONS AND OF GALVANIC POLARIZATION WITH PRESSURE.
    BY BRUNO PIESCH.
    A large series of liquids were investigated, both acids and solu
tions of salts. The method of measurement was such that the
resistance and the polarization could be determined simultaneously.
    The great pressure was produced by a Oailletet's apparatus,
which held up to 600 atmospheres. The resistance-vessels con
sisted of a combination of glass tubes, which could be connected
externally by means of ebonite cemented in the metal cap, which
was firmly screwed iu the iron cylinder.
   The measurements gave the following results : —
    Change of pressure produces a change of resistance, which
decreased in all cases with increase in the pressure. No regular
influence of concentration could be observed, but with most sub
stances thp variations of a less concentrated solution were greater
than of a concentrated solution.
   As the pressures increased the decreases of resistance were less.        /*~
Polarization also showed a change of value with higher pressure.
These, however, are for the most part small. An increase of
polarization with the pressure was in general observed. The
irregularities here shown were greater than with the measure
ments of resistance.
   In conclusion, a solution of NII.NO., in alcohol was investi
gated, and alterations in the same direction were here met with.—

        IN prismatic spectroscopes and spectrometers of the usual
 i
              construction it is necessary, in order to observe different
        portions of the spectrum under the same conditions, to vary
        the angle between the axes of the observing and collimating
        telescopes by the rotation of the arm which carries one of
        these telescopes about an axis parallel to the refracting edge
        of the prism. Usually ^he arm which carries the slit and the
        collimating-lens is fixed, and that carrying the observing
        telescope is movable ; but sometimes the apparatus which it
        is necessary to carry on the observing arm is so massive, or
        else requires such a degree of stability, that it becomes neces
        sary to fix it in position and make the slit-arm the movable
        one. Then difficulties are at once encountered in the illu
        mination of the slit, if a fixed source of light such as the sun
        or a star is under examination. Even if terrestrial sources
        be employed, it is ofttimes extremely undesirable to have a
        complicated system of collimator, slit, condenser, and source of
   V'   light, swinging about on a long arm, and in particular cases
        such an arrangement is absolutely inadmissible. In such cases
        where both arms of the spectroscope are necessarily fixed, we

may easily bring different parts of the spectral field to the
cross wires of the observing telescope by a rotation of the
prism alone ; but in none of the usual forms without violating
the usual condition imposed in spectroscopic work, viz., that
the prism shall always be in minimum deviation for the
central ray in the field.
    Heretofore the only forms of " fixed-arm " spectroscopes
which fulfil the latter condition have been of the Littrow
type, in which the ray is, by a system of reflecting surfaces, <.->
made to traverse the prism twice in opposite directions, and
to emerge finally in a direction parallel but reversed in
direction to that in which it entered.
    The original form and the various modifications of this
instrument have been already described *.              While they
fulfil the condition of bringing any part of the spectral
field into the field of the observing telescope without changing
the angle between the latter and the collimator, there are
certain objections to all of them. The most serious objection
to the original form, that of a general illumination of the
field, has been simply and successfully overcome in the
manner already pointed out by the author f, but the second
objection, that of a close proximity of the slit to the observing
eyepiece, remains. Young's and Browning's modifications
overcome this latter as well as the former difficulty ; but
they are both complicated and expensive, necessitating as
they do the use of at least three reflecting-surfaces and
two independent telescopes, in addition to the usual prisms.
Moreover, with all instruments of this general type, it is
necessary for the beam of light to pass twice through the
prism or train of prisms, and this, where brightness is of more
importance than large dispersion, as with very taint sources
of light for example, is a disadvantage. For these reasons
 I have thought it would be of interest to describe some
simpler forms of " fixed-arm " spectroscopes, which I have
recently devised and used, and in which the usual arrange
ment of parts may be preserved, viz., a separate collimating
and observing telescope, on opposite sides of a prism-train,
through which train the light is passed but once. The slit and
observing eye-piece are thus far removed from each other,
and the axes of the observing and collimating telescopes
may be arranged to make any fixed angle with each other.
    The general solution of the problem is effected by the
introduction into some part of the spectroscopic train, between

the slit and the focal plane of the observing lens, of a re
flecting surface, which has an angular motion equal to one-
h;ilf the change in angular motion of the ray refracted at
minimum deviation. In the instruments of the Littrow type
a reflector is also used, but for an essentially different
purpose (to return the ray through the prism) and in an
essentially different way from that here indicated. It hardly
seems possible that the use of a reflecting surface in this way
can be new, as it is something which would naturally suggest
itself to anyone who might consider the problem ; but no
reference has been found to its employment, perhaps because
the necessity for a " fixed-arm " spectroscope does not often
seemingly arise. I hope to show, however, that at least some
of the forms which have been developed during the last
three years are simpler, more convenient, and less expensive
than the ordinary form, and for spectrometric work quite as
accurate. 1 will briefly describe these forms in the order of
design and use, for this, perhaps, naturally is also the order
of increasing simplicity.
    Case I.—The case which first led me to a consideration of
the problem was one in which it was desired to examine the
radiations from a Geissler tube by means of the wave-
comparer*. Here the instrument which took the place of the
usual observing eyepiece was a massive apparatus weighing
about 500 pounds, which required great steadiness of mount
ing, while the Geissler tube, which itself served as the slit,
was attached to a mercury-pump on one side and to a sodium-
amalgam generating apparatus, with its attached drying-
tubes, mercury-valves, &c, on the other, in such a way as to
make its movement impossible. At first, indeed, the tube
was mounted on a slit-arm of the spectroscope, sufficient flexi
bility being secured to allow of different lines being brought
on the slit of the wave-comparer by the use of long lengths
of glass tubing, but experiments soon showed that it was
necessary to keep the passage from this Geissler tube to the
pump as short and large as possible. If any considerable
length of tubing intervened, unusual precautions had to be
taken to keep all parts of it perfectly dry and clean, for only
under these conditions, which, as the tubes were frequently
changed, were almost impossible to maintain, could the
McLeod gauge attached to the pump be relied upon to give,
even approximately, the true pressure in the tubes, particu
larly when the electric discharge was passing.
   The arrangement adopted in this case was that shown in plan

as the source ; m a mirror, mounted on a vertical axis on
the movable spectroscopic arm R ; and S the slit of the wave-
comparer, which separates out the radiation which is to be
analysed by the latter. To the lower end of the shaft which
carries the mirror m is fixed a drum connected with a
second drum a, fixed on the axis of the spectroscope by two
 steel cords. The drum a is just one half the size of b, and
 hence, as the arm R revolves about the axis of the spectro
 scope, the mirror m revolves on its own axis with an angular
 velocity just one half that of the arm, but in the opposite
 direction. Hence, if tbe mirror is once adjusted so that the
 direction of the reflected ray is parallel to the axis of colli-
 mation, it will remain parallel to that axis for all positions of
 the arm, and we have therefore a virtual rotation of the slit.
 There will be a slight lateral displacement of the ray, which
 can be easily investigated.

    For a certain position of the arm, say a b, fig. 1, the re
 flected ray b a will lie in the principal axis of the collimating
 lens, which we will suppose passes through the centre of
 rotation of the mirror m. Let 0 be the angle of deviation
 for this position, then for any other position of the system in
 which the deviation is 0 + e, the reflected ray will be parallel
 to the axis of collimation, but will be displaced laterally from
 it a distance Ay. Finally, let a be the angle between the
 mirror-face and the axis of collimation in the position a b,
then, from the construction of the apparatus, this angle for
any position V a will be a + e/2. From the two small triangles
V b" d and b b' b" we get at once
           Ay = b' b" cos (« - e/2) = 2r sin ^ cos (| + 2a),

where r is the distance between the spectroscope axis and the
mirror axis. If e he small this expression is a minimum for
a =45°, when the angle between the incident and reflected
rays on m is a right angle. Under the conditions
                             Ay=-2r sin8|,
the angular error in the reading will evidently be

where R is the focal length of the collimator. For most
prisms e will not exceed 6C from end to end of the spectrum,
and hence, if we suppose a =45°, for the position of mean de
viation we have for the maximum error 8 = -0013r/R, or if
r/R=^, 8=25".
   It is evident that there will be a change in the focal distance
S, b, C as the arm revolves, which, under the conditions just
assumed, would amount to about ^fa R. This was not
altogether a disadvantage, for when the lenses 0 and C are
either or both of them simple lenses, we can, by choosing
a value of r/R suitable to the particular prism used, very
nearly compensate for the optical change in focus in passing
from the violet to the red, or vice versd, by the mechanical
lengthening or shortening of the path S b C. From an
inspection of (1) it will be seen that the correction will
diminish as the ratio r/R diminishes, and will become 0
for r=0, or for R=oo . This indicated at once two methods
of eliminating the error. The first and simplest is to place
the mirror between the prism and collimator instead of be
tween tube and collimator, as indicated in dotted lines in
fig. 1 (PI. VIII.). The second is to make r=0 by placing the
mirror-face in the axis of rotation of the spectroscope. To
do this we must either place the prism considerably out of
centre, fig. 2 (PI. VIII.), or else we must place the mirror
above or below the plane of refraction (fig. 3, PI. VIII.). In
either case a second reflector must be used to receive the
beam from the first reflector m and return it to the prism.
This second reflector may conveniently be a concave mirror
of a focal length sm+mc, which will at the same time serve
as collimator, or as objective of the observing-telescope. As
the motion of the mirror is in this case the same in direction
as that which must be imparted to the prism in order to keep
it in minimum deviation, the mirror may be attached directly
to the prism-table or to the prism itself*. Which of these
   * The back of the prism may be polished and silvered, and arranged
to act as the first reflector, as in fig. 2 b, PI. VIIT.

342               Mr. F. L. 0. Wadsworth on
two latter forms is to be used will be determined by the
conditions of nse. The second form was the one employed
when the wave-comparer was used in connexion with a spec
trometer in experiments on wave-length measurements in the
infra-red solar spectrum. In this form the ray is reflected out
of the plane of incidence and refraction, and the spectrum is
consequently inclined at a small angle to the horizontal, but
in this case this was of no disadvantage as it involved only a
slight rotation of the observing-slit in order to bring it parallel
to the spectral lines.
    Case II.—In the forms so far considered, no special
conditions were imposed other than the general conditions
of a fixed slit and a fixed observing instrument, it being
possible to move the latter to meet the requirements of the
particular optical systems which have been described. But
in the next application of this system to the great spectre-
bolometer of the Astro-physical Observatory, an instrument in
which the collimator has a focal length of nearly thirty feet,
and the observing telescope a focal length of nearly twelve
feet, another condition was imposed, viz. that the observing
instrument (in this case the bolometer) should be in the
prolongation of the axis of collimation. It was therefore
necessary to avoid the lifting of the spectrum above the plane
of incidence and refraction, and to place the mirror m at one
side of the prism at such an angle to the latter that the direc
tion of the reflected ray was parallel to the line of collimation
 as required. This throws the mirror-face out of the axis of
 rotation, and there is therefore a lateral displacement of the
ray as the system rotates. A plan view of this arrangement
is shown in fig. 2. It will be seen that the arrangement of

                      Fixed-Arm Spectroscopes.                  343
 parts is essentially that employed in the first case described,
 except that a concave mirror is now used instead of the lens.
 The calculation of the lateral displacement, although not quite
 so simple as in the first case, is easy.
    In fig. 2,
      let d = distance o a from axis of rotation to the face of
                the concave mirror ;
          r = perpendicular distance o b from the axis to the
                plane of the reflecting-mirror ;
          to = angle oac ;
           0 and a have the same meanings as before.
When in adjustment the line of collimation passes through
 the axis of the rotation, and the deflected ray o a will fall on
 the centre of the concave mirror. Then we have from ana
lytical geometry the following equations : —
    For the line a c,
               y = tan (0 + a>) [%— d cos 0] + d sin 0
                 = — tan2«[^— dcos0]+dsin0, ... (2)
since                    0 + w=18O°-2a;
and for the line d c,
                      y-to-W+JLj.                               (3)
    The lateral displacement (At/) of the ray will be the ordi
nate of the point of intersection of these two lines. Solving
( 2) and (3) for y we have
                   Ay = d sin (2* -f 0) — 2r cos a.
If the system be turned through a small angle e, 0 becomes
0 + e, and * becomes ot — e/2. Hence 0 + 2a = const., and
               Ay' = d sin (0 + 2a) - 2r cos (a - e/2) ,
      Ay — Ay' — 2r[cos<x — cos (a— e/2)] s r cos (0 + co) sine;
or the lateral displacement is directly proportional to r, to the
cosine of the angle of deviation, and to the angle of dis
placement. Since e is fixed by the prism used, and » must
be small in order to secure good definition, the only way in
which the error of displacement may be reduced is by redu
cing r ; hence the object in placing the mirror just as close
to the prism as possible. In the actual case, the values of r,
0, and a) were
          rslO centim., 0s 50° (for D lines), and ws3°.
Hence for e = 3° we have Ai/=S millim., and the angular
error is, as before, 3/R= „-fir( =3' nearly.

344                Mr. F. L. 0. Wadsworth on
    It will readily be seen that if we do not impose the con
 dition that the reflected ray shall be parallel to the line of
 collimation, wo may place the mirror so that the displacement
 will be almost nil for even very considerable values of r. This
 general case may be readily worked out by introducing into
 the above another angle, /S, which is the angle between the
 axis of collimation and the ray reflected from the mirror,
connected with the angles 8 and a by the relation
                     0 + a>=18O-(2a + /S).
 In this case it will be found, as might have been expected,
 that the displacement is a minimum when the angle a. is as
nearly as possible equal to 8, viz., when the angle of incidence
on the mirror is as nearly as possible 90°. In the most
 unfavourable case, however, the correction, although con
 siderable, is not of sufficient magnitude to become objection
able in spectroscopic work. In such work it is not even
necessary to apply the correction, as the effect is the same as
would be produced by a slight change in the optical pro
 perties of the prism. The displacement might in this, as in
the former case, have been eliminated by making R=ao , viz.,
 by substituting for the concave mirror at a a plane reflector
 and placing the image-forming objective beyond the reflecting
 surface m ; but the additional reflecting surface was ob
jectionable as diminishing the brightness of the spectrum.
     Case III.— The arrangement last described was used with
 a considerable degree of success for some time, but when
 some very accurate angular measurements were attempted
 with it a difficulty of a mechanical character presented itself.
 It will be noted that the correct working of this—as of all
 systems so far described—depends on the maintenance of an
 exact ratio of 2 to 1 between the angular motions of the
 spectroscope-arm and of the reflecting mirror. It is necessary
 to maintain the prism at minimum deviation in all spectro-
 metric measurements ; but not with any great degree of
 exactness, as an error of 2' or 3' in the angular position of
 the prism will not affect the deviation by more than £§ of
 this amount. But with the mirror any error in angular
 position with respect to the arm will change the angular
 direction of the refracted and reflected ray by double that
 amount; and hence if we wish to determine any angle of
 deviation to within 10", we must be sure of the position of
 the mirror to within less than 5". To secure this degree
 of accuracy mechanically and automatically with any ordi
 nary minimum deviation attachment is out of the question,
 for an error of 5" in angular position means in linear measure
 ment an error of only xifbTj millim. at the end of an arm

                         Fixed-Arm Spectroscopes.                     345
 40 millim. long. Probably this degree of accuracy could be
 secured if necessary by the use of a minimum deviation attach
  ment of pure linkwork, like that shown in fig. 4 (PI. IX.),
  which is far superior in every respect to the ordinary sliding
 link-form usually placed on a spectroscope*. It may also be
 secured by the system first described, because in it any
  required degree of accuracy may be reached by an increase
 in size of the drums a, b.
     It was at first thought that a return to this system would
  be necessary ; but while considering how this could best be
  done, the idea of another simple system, which did away with
  all mechanical arrangements, presented itself. It is derived
  from the first modification of the earlier system (fig. 1,
  PI. VIII.) very easily by suppressing entirely the movable
  spectroscope-arm and securing the reflecting mirror rigidly
  to the prism. It will evidently have the same angular motion
  as before, and will therefore reflect a ray which passes through
  the prism at minimum deviation in the same direction for all
  positions of the latter, or vice versa. With this arrangement
  it is evident that there will be no error due to mechanical
  inaccuracies of the moving parts because there is no longer
  any relative motion between them, both prism and mirror
  being fixed relatively to each other. But it would appear at
  first sight that for large angles of deviation the light would fall
  upon a very different part of the reflecting mirror to that which
  it would for small angles, and that a large lateral displacement
  of the reflected ray might be expected in consequence. The
  lateral shifting is no great detriment if a collimator is used,
  and the beam which passes through the prism is a strictly
  parallel one, for then its effect is simply to necessitate the
  loss of some light, or else the use of larger lenses to provide
  for this shifting. But where only one objective is used, as in
  the simpler forms of instruments, or for some special reason
  in the better onesf (see fig. 7, PI. IX.), and the beam
  through the prism is in consequence conical, the lateral dis
   placement gives rise, as already explained, to an angular
   error depending on the radius of curvature of the wave-front
   of the incident beam. This error, or, more properly, cor
   rection, was especially objectionable in the particular work
   then in hand, in which it was very desirable to maintain an
, exact relationship between the angular reading of the spectro
   meter-circle (in which prism and mirror were mounted), and
   the wave-length of the radiation falling on what corresponded
      • Kempe, ' Lecture on Linkages,' p. 40.
      t In this case it was desirable in order that there might be as little
   loss by reflexion and absorption as possible.

346                Mr. F. L. 0. Wadsworth on
 to the cross-wire of the observing telescope. On examination
 of the geometrical path of the ray through the system just
 indicated, it was unexpectedly found that if two simple con
ditions were fulfilled, the refracted ray was, after reflexion,
not only constant in direction but also constant in position,
viz., that there was no lateral displacement for different wave
lengths, and consequently no angular correction required for
either plane or spherical waves. To find these necessary
conditions, let us first consider the general case in which the
axis of rotation and the reflecting-mirror are in any position
with reference to the line of collimation.

   Let the axis of collimation be the X axis, and let a line
passing through the axis of rotation R be the Y axis. Let d
be the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the
plane of the mirror-face ; let b be the perpendicular distance
from the same point to the plane bisecting the angle of the
prism (and hence bisecting also the angle of deviation of the
ray at minimum deviation), and let a be the y coordinate
of this point. Then the equation of the line E F (the inter
section of the plane of the reflecting surface with the X Y
plane) will be
                                 d + a cos a.

Substituting the values of and y, reducing, and introducing

we finally obtain
              p = 2a cos2 /8/2 + 26 sin 0/2 + 2d cos (« + 0).
 The term 2a cos2 /8/2 is a constant, but the last two terms are
 variable. It will be seen at once that we may make p a
 constant, viz., prevent any lateral shifting of the ray, by
 simply making both b and d equaHo zero. In other words, if
 we simply fulfil the condition that the axis of rotation of the
 system shall be at the intersection of the plane bisecting the
 refracting angle of the prism with the plane of the reflecting
 mirror, there will be no lateral displacement of the ray which
 passes through the system at minimum deviation, for different
 values of 6, viz. for different wave-lengths. There is one
 case in which this does not hold, viz., when these two planes
 are parallel. Then we have
                     a=9O°-0/2, ora+0=18O°-a.
 Hence
                  6sin0/2 + dcos (a + 0)= (b—d) cos a ;
 and therefore we may in this case make p constant by making
 b = d : in other words, by making the two planes coincident.
 Then the second half of the prism becomes useless, and we

 348               Mr. F. L. 0. Wadsworth on
 have the original half-prism form of Littrow, fig. 5, which
 is now seen to be only one special form of a general class.
 It is evident that by varying the angle awe may make the
 angle /S anything we please from 0 to 360°. Four special
 cases only are considered :—
    (1) When £=90°, then for 0=45° we have a=22£°. The
 arrangement of the parts is shown in fig. 4.
    (2) When £ = 180°, u = ±0, and we have the Littrow half-
 prism arrangement already referred to (fig. 5).
    (3) When £ = 270°, for 0=45°, « = 112i°, and we have
 the arrangement shown in fig. 6.
    (4) Finally, when $=0 the reflected ray is parallel to the
i»»incident, and now «= —0/2 (fig. 7).
    In all these last forms the prism-mirror system is mounted
 directly on the graduated circle of the spectrometer and
 revolves with it. Since the angular rotation of the prism
 is exactly one half that of the refracted ray which passes
 through it at minimum deviation, it follows that we may
 determine angular deviations from the readings of the spectro
 meter circle, just as in the ordinary forms of the instrument,
 except that the angular readings must be multiplied by 2 to
 obtain the angular deviations. The movable parts of the
 instrument (the mirror and prism) are therefore rendered
 extremely light and mobile, without any sacrifice in accuracy,

                       Fixed- Arm Spectroscopes.                        349
while incidentally the more or less troublesome minimum-
deviation attachment is done away with. The last arrange
ment, which is in one sense a direct-vision spectroscope with
but a single prism, fulfils the condition of parallelism be
tween the refracted reflected ray and the incident ray, and
it is therefore the one which has been finally adopted for
the spectro-bolometer of the Observatory in place of the form
first used on that instrument*.
    A plan view of the mounting in this particular form of
instrument is shown in fig. 5, PI. IX., and a side view
(photograph) in PI. X. It will be seen that the prism and
mirror are mounted together in a single frame AA, provided
with three levelling-screws which rest, one in a conical hole,
the second in a slot, and the third on a plane ; so that the
whole frame may readily be removed from the spectrometer
table and then replaced in exactly the same position. The
triangular prism-table B is arranged to slide vertically in the
fuides a b, and thus provide for prisms of different heights,
  he table has a motion of adjustment regulated by the screw
c, about a line parallel to the mirror-face, for the purpose of
bringing the refracting edge of the prism parallel to that face,
and is provided with screws e, f, g, h, which serve to adjust
the prism laterally and in angle, so that in the first place the
plane bisecting the refracting angle may pass through the
axis of rotation, and, secondly, so that the prism-faces may
make equal angles with the faces of the mirror (the minimum-
deviation condition). It will be observed that when these
 screws are once adjusted they serve as stops which will bring
 any prism (of standard 60° angle) that may be used into the
correct position ; for, if smaller than the prism for which they
   * Since writing the above my attention has been called to an article
 in Zeit. fur Instntmentenkunde for November 1881, describing this
 particular " direct-vision " arrangement of the prism and mirror. There
 was, however, no indication of the general class of which this is but a
 particular type, and hence, of course, no indication of the conditions
 which it was necessary to fulfil to prevent a lateral shifting of the beam ;
 indeed, the author seems to accept this lateral shifting as a necessary
 condition, for he says " Der im Minimum der Ablenkung durchgehende
 Strahl wird also bei dieser Anordnung nur seitlich etwas versclioben."
    Professor Langley had also quite independently used this particular
 arrangement of prism and reflecting mirror in a modification of ioucault's
 " Lifting Prism " for separating different orders of superposed grating-
 spectra. In his use of it the lateral displacement was recognized as
 objectionable, and was mechanically corrected for by an ingenious
 arrangement, designed by Mr. C. T Child, then assistant in the Obser
 vatory, which imparted to the mirror a small angular motion, just
 sufficient to correct for the angular displacement of the spectral image,
 as the whole system travelled down through the spectrum.

 were adjusted, it is only necessary either to turn each one in
 a measured amount, or, more simply, insert a thin piece of
 flass or metal between the screws on each side and the prism.
   l still better plan, if many prisms are to be used, is to have
 each prism mounted on a base of the required size on which
 it has been adjusted once for all and then cemented. The
 adjustment, as will be shown hereafter, does not need to be
 particularly accurate.
     The mirror and prism having been adjusted to each other
 and to the spectrometer axis once for all, the other adjust
 ments preliminary to the use of the instrument are very
 simple. The first operation is to make the axes of the colli-
 mating and observing telescopes parallel. This is most simply
 done by removing the prism-mirror system and allowing the
 beam for the collimator to fall directly on the objective of the
 view-telescope. Since the constant lateral displacement of
 the beam by the system will be 2a, it follows that if the
 aperture of the telescope is, say, 2£a, sufficient light will fall
 upon the second objective to form a distinct image of the slit.
 Since, however, the use of such a small portion of the objective
is apt to cause a lateral shifting of the image, it is better
either to mount the view-telescope on a short cross slide, or
on a rocking arm, the motion of which is accurately rectili
near, or, what is better, to use a small double- reflection prism,
fig. 6 b (PI. IX.), which will laterally deflect the beam by the
amount required. If a system like that in fig. 7 (PI. IX.) is
used, the simplest method of initially setting the direct imago
on the cross wire of the observing telescope is to set up at the
side of the slit and at an accurately measured distance 2a
from its centre, a second slit or fine point, and bring the
image of this to the centre of the field.
    The second step is to determine the zero of graduation,
which is done by replacing the optical system and revolving
the mirror until it is perpendicular to the line of collimation.
With the first form of instrument this is accomplished simply
by bringing the image of the slit into coincidence with the
slit itself ; in the second form it is most conveniently done
by setting up a point at a distance from the mirror equal to
the principal focal distance, bringing this point into the line
b ms by removing the eyepiece and sighting with the eye past
the cross wire at the distant point s, and then revolving the
mirror until the image of this illuminated point coincides
with the point itself. The reading of the circle correspond
ing to this position of the mirror is called the zero reading.
The prism is then replaced in position by being brought
against the screws e, f, g, h, and the whole system revolved

            On the Higliest Wave of Permanent Type.           351
until the desired part of the spectral field is brought into the
observing eyepiece. If the spectrum is now either too high
or too low, it shows that the refracting edge of the prism is
slightly inclined to the mirror-face, and the screw c is turned
until the spectrum is centred. Then, if all the preliminary
adjustments have been properly made, the angular deviation
of the central ray in the field will be given by the relation
                         0=2O8-(9O°+«)),
where jQ is the circle-reading for a deviation 6, and a is the
zero-reading determined as already described.
   In very accurate spectrometric work it is important to
determine just what degree of accuracy is required in making
the various adjustments of parts to each other in order to
attain a given degree of accuracy in the final result. The
theory of these adjustments is comparatively simple, but some
what lengthy, and it will therefore be briefly indicated in a
future paper.

      XXXIX. On the Highest Wave of Permanent Type.
  By J. McCowan, M.A., D.Sc, University College, Dundee*.
IN a previous communication f, in which 1 discussed the
      general theory of the class of waves in water or other
liquid which have no finite wave-length but which are of
permanent type, that is to say, which are propagated with
constant velocity without change of any kind, I gave a rough
estimate of the maximum height to which such waves might
attain without breaking. The paper dealt chiefly with an
approximation which was specially suitable for waves of small
 or moderate elevation, and it is the object of the present
paper, therefore, to supplement this by investigating an
approximation better adapted to the discussion of the extreme
case of the wave at the breaking height, and sufficiently exact
for ordinary purposes. I trust, however, to be soon able to
communicate a fuller discussion of the general theory of the
 solitary wave which I have almost completed.
             1. The General Equation of the Motion.
    The highest wave which can bo propagated without change
 in water of any given depth is obviously the highest solitary

352                Dr. J. McCowan on the Highest
wave for such depth ; for the height to which waves can
attain without breaking must evidently increase with their
length, and the solitary wave may be regarded as the limiting
type to which each individual wave, reckoned from trough to
trough, in a permanent train of finite waves approaches as
the wave-length indefinitely increases. In fact this paper
and the former, " On the Solitary Wave," may be regarded
as giving a very close approximation to the form and motion
of the individual waves in a train of finite waves if the wave
length is even so small a multiple of the depth as ten or
twelve.
   It will thus be convenient to follow to some extent the
methods and notation of the paper " On the Solitary Wave,"
and references to it will be briefly indicated by an S prefixed.
   Consider, then, a solitary wave propagated with uniform
velocity U along the direction in which x increases in an
endless straight channel of uniform rectangular cross section,
the axis of x being taken along the bottom and that of z
vertically upwards.
   Let the motion be regarded as reduced to steady motion by
having superposed on it a velocity equal and opposite to the
velocity of propagation of the wave, and take x=0 and z=c
as the coordinates of the crest. Let u and w be the horizontal
and vertical components respectively of the resultant velocity
q in the steady motion at x, z, of which, further, <f> is the
velocity potential and ifr the current function.
   We shall now, referring to the " General Theory of the
Wave," (S. § 1), seek to determine a form of the relation
between -ijr + i<f>, or, as we shall here find more convenient,
u + tw and z + ix corresponding to S. (1) and (2), but only
containing so many disposable constants as will suffice for
the degree of accuracy at present desired.          Noting that
for the limiting form the velocity at the crest must vanish,
and remembering Sir George Stokes's expression* for the
leading term in the velocity near the crest of a wave at
the breaking-limit, we shall assume (compare S. (6)): —
u + iw= — U{ 1 —/Fsec2^m(2 + ix) } V\ — W sec2 \m{z + ix) , (1)

by (1): for w vanishes with z, and when x= +00 , u—— U

have z=7i + 7j at the surface. Substituting these values in
the expression for yjr involved in (6) , we obtain as the equation

by (20) that the curvature of the surface vanishes close to

other equations determining the constants we have at our
disposal will make B very approximately vanish.
         4. Numerical Determination of the Constants.
   There is still one important condition to be satisfied. To
ensure the connexion between our separate treatment of the
neighbourhoods of the crest and mean level, we must secure
that the stream-line ty= — UA, bounding the distant surface,
shall pass through the crest : or, in other words, the flow
across any infinitely distant section must be equal to the flow

 which gives, remembering that k=cos fync,
            mA = 7r{l — cos %mc — ^/sin^mc . sin mc}.     .  (29)
    We may now proceed to evaluate the constants in (1) in
 terms of h the mean depth of the liquid in the channel.
    Eliminating U2 between (22) and (13) we get
                        mc = mh + £ tan mh,                  (30)
 while (13) and (26) give
                      (1—/)2=cotwiAcot \mc                    (31)
 If now we solve equations (29), (30), and (31) for m, c, and
/, we shall find mh = 1 "0025 approximately : hence, remembering
 that at best the surface-pressure is only to be approximately
 constant, it will be sufficient to take for our present purpose
                               mh=l,                          (32)
and it is just possible that this may be the exact value.
    Substituting this value in (30) we get
                             c = l-78A                       (33)
This gives for the maximum wave-height
                         c-h=r)0=-78h,                       (34)
which differs by less than the experimental error from the
value "75 h which I have already {S. § 10} given as a fair
average of some experiments I made in connexion with my
former paper.
   Again, from (13) and (32), or (22) and (34), we obtain for
the velocity
                            U2=1-56^A,                       (35)
which shows that the maximum wave travels about 25 per
cent, faster than low waves in the same depth of channel.
   Finally, substituting from (32) and (33) in (31) we get
                              /=-28                          (36)
   We have now only to substitute the values of the constants
just determined in our general equations.

u + ito= -1-25 \V*{1- -11 sec?i(* + «)/A} Vl-,40seo,i(8 + «)/A, . (37)
      which completely determines the motion of the fluid.
         It is convenient, however, to consider the formulae specially
      suitable to the regions near to, and fairly distant from, the
      crest. Thus for regions fairly distant from the crest (where
     exp( — x/h) is small) (5) and (6) give
                    -(u+M0)/U=l-l-24e-<—">/*+&c., . . (38)

     in which U has the value given by (35).
         The equation to the free surface, as given by (7), becomes
                       97/A = l-04e-^*--44e-ite/*&c., . . . .(40)
     and for the pressure-error given by (14) we have
                             bp=- -89 e-Wgph                      (41)
         Again, for the neighbourhood of the crest (16) and (17)

            - (w + iw)/U=-80 vU- mt)/A{1 + -084(C- ue)lh) . (42)

         We have already seen that the crest is formed by two
     surfaces, equally inclined to the bottom, meeting at an angle
     of 120°, so that the summit of the wave has the form of a
     blunt wedge. We have also seen that in the free wave these
      surfaces must be plane or have an infinite radius of curvature
      at the crest ; we have, however, made no effort to satisfy this
     condition, but on substituting the values of the constants in
      (20) we find that it gives the radius of curvature at the crest
     about equal to thirty times the depth of the water, a result
     sufficiently indicating the closeness of our approximation.
         The pressure-error near the crest, as given by (27), is
                                Sp=-<%pr7/j                       (44)
         By (41) and (44) we see that the deviation from constant
     surface-pressure is everywhere very small ; there is a very
     slight excess near the crest but vanishing at the crest, and a
     slight defect near the mean level. The deviation has in fact
     only an appreciable value over a very limited region, say
     from x='bh to ai=l'5h ; (41) and (44) are hardly applicable

358                Prof. J. J. Thomson on the

defect of pressure is less than that of a head of water, or
whatever other liquid the channel may contain, of one tenth
of the mean depth.
   The accompanying figure shows the form of the wave, only-
half of it heing drawn, however, as the wave is symmetrical
about the crest. The thicker straight line indicates the bottom

  XL. On the Velocity of the Cathode-Rays. By J. J.
    Thomson, M.A., F.R.S., Cavendish Professor of Experi
    mental Physics, Cambridge*.
 THE phosphorescence shown by the glass of a discharge-
        tube in the neighbourhood of the cathode has been
 ascribed by Crookes to the impact against the sides of the
 tube of charged molecules driven off from the negative elec
 trode. The remarkably interesting experiments of Hertz
 and Lenard show that thin films of metal when interposed
 between the cathode and the walls of the discharge -tube do not
 entirely stop the phosphorescence. This has led some phy
 sicists to doubt whether Crookes's explanation is the true one,
 and to support the view that the phosphorescence is due to
 setherial waves of very small wave-length, these waves being
 so strongly absorbed by all substances that it is only when
 the film of the substance is extremely thin that any per
 ceptible phosphorescence occurs behind it. Thus on this
 view the phosphorescence is due to the action of a kind of
                  * Communicated by the Author.

                 Velocity of the Cathode-Rayit.              359
ultra-violet light, which possesses in an exaggerated degree
the property possessed by the ultra-violet rays of the sun of
producing phosphorescence when incident upon such sub
stances as German or uranium glass. It is perhaps worth
while to observe, in passing, that the light produced in an
ordinary discharge-tube by an intense discharge is very rich
in phosphorogenic rays. I have been able to detect phos
phorescence in pieces of ordinary German-glass tubing held
at a distance of some feet from the discharge-tube, though in
this case the light had to pass through the glass walls of the
vacuum-tube and a considerable thickness of air before falling
on the phosphorescent body.
   The view, to which Lenard has been led by his experi
ments, that the cathode-rnys are retherial waves demands the
most careful consideration and attention; for if it is admitted,
it follows that the tether must have a structure either in time
or space. For these cathode-rays are deflected by a magnet,
which, so far as our knowledge extends, does not produce any
effect on ultra-violet light unless this is passing through a
refracting substance : thus if the cathode-rays are supposed
to be ultra-violet light of excessively small wave-length, it
follows that in the aether in a magnetic field there must either
be some length with which the wave-length of the cathode-
rays is comparable, or else some time comparable with the
period of vibration of these rays.
    It might be objected that it is possible that the action of a
magnet on the cathode-rays is a secondary effect, and that
the primary action of the magnet is to affect the main cur
rent of the discharge passing between the positive and negative
electrodes, and thus to alter the distribution of the discharge
entering the cathode: this would affect the distribution of the
places of greatest intensity over the cathode, and thus in
directly the distribution of the waves emerging from it. To
test this point I shielded the cathode from magnetic forces by
means of a magnetic screen consisting of a ring made of soft
iron wire : the length was about 1*5 inch, its thickness was
about *75 inch. When this ring encircled the cathode a
magnet was brought up to the tube : the phosphorescent
patches inside the ring were not now affected by the magnet,
but those on the parts of the tube farther away from the
cathode and outside the iron ring were very much displaced
 by the magnet; thus proving that the magnet acts on the
cathode-rays through the whole of their course, and does not
 merely affect the place on the cathode at which they have
 their origin. There thus seems no escape from the conclusion
 that the establishment of the hypothesis that the cathode-rays

360                Prof. J. J. Thomson on the
are aetherial rays would also prove the finiteness of the
structure of the aether.
    The following experiments were made with the view of
determining the velocity with which the cathode -rays travel,
as it seemed that a knowledge of this velocity would enable
us to discriminate between the two views held as to the nature
of the cathode-rays. If we take the view that the cathode-
rays are setherial waves, we should expect them to travel with
a velocity comparable with that of light ; while if the rays
 consist of molecular streams, the velocity of these rays will be
the velocity of the molecules, which we should expect to be
very much smaller than that of light.
    The method I employed is as follows :—The discharge-tube
 was sealed on to the pump, and the two electrodes were placed
 at the neck of this tube. The discharge-tube was covered with
 lampblack, with the exception of two thin strip's in the same
 straight line from which the lampblack was scratched : these
 strips were about 10 centim. apart ; the one nearest to the
 negative electrode was about 15 centim. from the electrode,
 the other was 25 centim. from the electrode. They were chosen
 so as to phosphoresce with, as nearly as could be judged, equal
 brilliancy when the discharge passed through the tube.
    The light from the phosphorescent strip fell upon a rota
 ting mirror about 75 centim. from the tube. This mirror is
 the one used by me in my experiments on " The Velocity of
 Propagation of the Electric Discharge through Gases " (Proc.
 Roy. Soc. 1890) , and is described in that paper. The only
 change made in the mirror was to replace the single piano
 strip of silvered glass which was used in the previous ex
 periments by six strips of mirror fastened symmetrically
 round the axis. The mirror was driven by a large gramme-
 machine.
    The images formed by reflexion from the mirror were
 observed through a telescope, of which the object-glass was a
 large portrait photographic lens of 4-inch aperture, the eye
 piece a short-focus lens : when the mirror was at rest the two
 images of the phosphorescent strips were seen in the same
 straight line, and the adjacent ends of the two images were
 brought into coincidence by inserting between one of the
 phosphorescent strips and the mirror a very acute-angled
 prism. The point of the experiment was to see if the images
 of the two phosphorescent strips remained in the same
 straight line when the mirror was in rapid rotation. If, for
 example, the cathode-rays travelled with the velocity of
  sound, they would take about $£$¦$ of a second to pass from
  one strip to the next ; if the mirror were rotating 300 times

                  Vehcity of the Cathode-Rays.              361
a second it would, in the interval taken by sound to pass
from one strip to the next, rotate through about 33° ; the
displacement of the image produced by a rotation one
thousandth part of this could easily be detected.
   When the phosphorescence was produced by the discharge
of an ordinary induction-coil, the images seen in the tele
scope after reflexion from the revolving mirror were drawn
out into very faint ribands of light without definite begin
nings or ends; so that it was impossible to say whether or
not there was any displacement of one image relative to the
other.
   I tried a considerable number of phosphorescent substances
in the hope of obtaining sharp images, but without success.
The substances I tried were ordinary German-glass, uranium-
glass, lead-glass, the cyanide of magnesium and platinum,
asaron, sesculine, and Schuchardt's " Leucht-farbe."
   The gradual fading away of the phosphorescence after the
exciting cause has been removed, is one reason why one of
the edges of the image formed by the revolving mirror should
be indistinct : this cannot be remedied unless some substance
can be found which ceases to phosphoresce immediately the
incidence of the negative rays ceases. I was unable to find
any substance possessing this property : of the substances I
tried, uranium-glass was the one whose phosphorescence died
away most quickly.
   I tried several experiments with a specimen of asaron. This
substance was found by Lenard to cease to phosphoresce
so quickly after the cessation of the phosphorogenic rays that
he could not detect its duration in his very sensitive phos-
phoroscope. My specimen of asaron must, I think, have been
impure, as it phosphoresced a coral-pink instead of violet as
described by Lenard, and its phosphorescence showed a very
appreciable duration ; in addition to this, it did not give out
nearly enough light to be of any use in experiments of this
kind.
   But even though the images of the phosphorescent strips
have one edge (that corresponding to the end of the phos
phorescence) indistinct, we can get the information we require
about the velocity of the cathode-rays if we can get the
image of the edge corresponding to the beginning of the
phosphorescence sharp and distinct.
   After unsuccessful attempts with several methods, I found
that this could be done in the following way, using the oscilla
tory currents produced by the discharge of a Leyden jar :—
The electrodes of the discharge-tube were connected with the
ends of the secondary coil of a transformer, whose primary

362                Prof. J. J. Thomson on tlw
circuit consisted of a coil of wire with the ends connected to
the outside coatings of two Leyden jars, the inside coatings
of which were connected with the extremities of an induction-
coil : the secondary coil of the transformer had about 30 turns
for each turn of the primary coil. It was heavily insulated,
and both primary and secondary were immersed in an oil-
bath. This transformer easily gave sparks 7 or 8 inches long
in air, and when connected to the terminals of a discharge-
 tube made of uranium-grass produced a very vivid phos
 phorescence. When the phosphorescence was produced in
this way, the images after reflexion in the rotating mirror
 had one edge quite sharp and distinct, though the other edge
 was indeterminate in consequence of the duration of the
phosphorescence.
   When the images of the two bright, phosphorescent strips
were observed in the telescope, after reflexion from the
rapidly revolving mirror, their bright edges were seen to be
no longer in the same straight lino : if the images came in
 the field of view from the bottom and went out at the top,
then the sh;rp edge of the phosphorescent strip nearest the
electrode was lower than the edge of the other image ; if the
direction of rotation of the mirror was reversed so that the
images came in at the top of the field of view and disappeared
at the bottom, then the bright edge of the image of the
phosphorescent strip nearest the negative electrode was higher
than the bright edge of the image of the other strip. This
shows that the luminosity at the strip nearest the cathode
begins to be visible before that at the strip more remote ; and
that the retardation is sufficiently large to be detected by the
revolving mirror. This retardation might be explained, (1) by
supposing it due to the time taken by the cathode-rays to
traverse the distance between the phosphorescent patches ; or
(2) we might suppose that, though the cathode-rays reached
the two phosphorescent patches almost simultaneously, it took
longer for the rays falling on the patch at the greater dis
tance from the cathode to raise the patch to luminosity. In
other words, there may be an interval between the incidence
of the cathode-rays and the emission of the phosphorescent
light ; this interval being greater the further the phos
phorescent patch is from the cathode. This latter sup
position cannot, however, explain the displacement of the
images for the following reasons :—The sharpness and bright
ness of the edge of the image show that the phosphorescence,
when once it is visible, must attain its maximum brilliancy in
a time very small compared with the time taken by the mirror
to rotate through an angle large enough to produce the

                 Velocity of the Cathode-Rays.                  363
observed displacement of the images. Again, the two phos
phorescent patches are as nearly as possible of equal bright
ness, so that there can be very little difference in the intensity
of the cathode-rays falling upon them : it was for this reason
that both the phosphorescent patches were taken some dis
tance down the tube. Again, I took a tube which was bent
so that that the cathode-rays fell more directly upon the patch
farther from the cathode than upon the other patch, so that
in this case the phosphorescence of the moro remote patch
was brighter. The displacement of the images with this tube
was just the same as for the previous, i. e. the phosphorescence
commenced at the patch nearest the cathode sooner than at
the other patch ; whereas if the displacement of the images
was due to the interval between the arrival of the rays and
the beginning of the phosphorescence it shoidd have com
menced at the patch furthest from the cathode, as this was the
most exposed to the cathode-rays and phosphoresced with the
greatest brilliancy.
   I conclude, therefore, that the displacement of the images
is due to tbe time taken by the rays to travel from one patch
to the other. This displacement enables us to measure the
velocity of the cathode-*ays. The amount of displacement
observed through the telescope is not constant : even though
the mirror is turning at a uniform rate, there are quite appre
ciable and apparently irregular variations in the amount of
the displacement of the images seen in the course of a few
minutes. I think these are due to irregularities in the sparks
discharging the jar, and the consequent irregularities in the
electromotive force acting on the discharge-tube.
   When the mirror was rotating 300 times a second, the
bright edges of the two patches were on the average sepa
rated by the same distance as the image of two lines 1*5 millim.
from each other placed against the discharge-tube. Since the
distance of the discharge-tube which contained hydrogen from
the mirror is 75 centim., the mirror must, in the time taken
by the cathode-rays to pass from one patch to the other, have
                                                              1*5
turned through the angle whose circular measure is——=Trr.

   Since the mirror makes 300 revolutions per second, the
time it takes to rotate through this angle is
                       1-5                 1
               2 x 750 x iir x 300     67rxl05'
and since the distance between the patches is 10 centim., the

velocity of the cathode-rays is
                         6tt x 108 cm./sec,
or about
                         1'9 x 107 cm./sec.
   This velocity is small compared with that with which the
main discharge from the positive to the negative electrode
travels between the electrodes (see J. J. Thomson, Proc.
Roy. Soc. 1890). I verified this by inserting an electrode
into the far end of the tube used in the previous experiment,
and observing the images formed when a bright discharge
passed down from the electrode at the beginning to the elec
trode at the end of the tube. The light from the luminous
gas shines through the places where the lampblack has been
scraped from the tube, and we get two images, which when
the mirror is at rest coincide in position with the images of
the two phosphorescent patches in the previous experiment.
These images, however, unlike the phosphorescent one, re
mained in the same straight line when the mirror was rotating
rapidly, thus proving that the velocity of the main discharge
is very large indeed compared with that of the cathode-rays.
   The velocity of the cathode-rays is very much greater than
the velocity of mean square of the molecules of gases at the
temperature 0° C. Thus, for example, at 0° C. the velocity of
mean square of the molecules of hydrogen is about 1'8 x 10s
centimetres per second : the velocity of the cathode-rays is
about one hundred times as great. The velocity of the
cathode-rays found from the preceding experiments agrees
very nearly with the velocity which a negatively electrified
atom of hydrogen would acquire under the influence of the
potential fall which occurs at the cathode. For, let v be the
velocity acquired by the hydrogen atom under these circum
stances, m the mass of the hydrogen atom, V the fall in
potential at the cathode, e the charge on the atom; then we
have, by the conservation of energy,
                            mv*=2Ye.
Now e has the same value as in electrolytic phenomena, so
thate/m = 10\
   Warburg's experiments show that V is about 200 volts, or
2 x 10lu in absolute measure. Substituting this value, we find

The very small difference between the two is of course acci
dental, as the measurements of the displacement of the
images on which the experimental value of v was founded
could not be trusted to anything like 5 per cent.
     The action of a magnetic force in deflecting these rays
shows, assuming that the deflexion is due to the action of
a magnet on a moving electrified body, that the velocity of
the atom must be at least of the order we have found.
    Consider an atom projected parallel to the axis of the tube
 which is situated in a uniform field of magnetic force, the
lines of magnetic force being at right angles to the axis
of the tube. Let H be the intensity of the magnetic force.
Then, if m is the mass of the atom, v its velocity, and p the
radius of curvature of its path, we have

where e is the charge on the atom ; since e/tn for hydrogen is
10*, we have               «=/»HxlO«.
    I cannot find any quantitative experiments on the deflexion
 of these rays by a magnet ; but ordinary observation shows
 that it would require a strong magnetic field to make p as
small as 10 centim., which would mean clearing the tube of
 phosphorescence except within about 10 centim. of the
cathode. If v were 2 x 107, this would give H = 200, which
 is not extravagant.
   XLI. On the Amplitude of Aerial Waves which are but just
            Audible. By Lord Rayleiqh, Sec. R.S.*
THE problem of determining the absolute value of the
        amplitude, or particle velocity, of a sound which is but
just audible to the ear, is one of considerable difficulty. In a
short paper published seventeen years agof I explained a
method by which it was easy to demonstrate a superior limit.
A whistle, blown under given conditions, consumes a known
amount of energy per second. Upon the assumption that
the whole of this energy is converted into sound, that the
sound is conveyed without loss, and that it is uniformly dis
tributed over the surface of a hemisphere, it is easy to calcu
late the amplitude at any distance ; and the result is necos-
sarily a superior limit to the actual amplitude. In the case

366               Lord Rayleigh on the Amplitude
of the whistle experimented on, of frequency 2730, the
superior limit so arrived at for a sound just easily audible
was 8'1 x 10~8 cm. The maximum particle velocity v and
the maximum condensation * are the quantities more im
mediately detei mined by the observations, and they are
related by the well-known equation v=as, in which a denotes
the velocity of propagation. In the experiment above re
ferred to the superior limit for v was "0014 cm. per second,
and that for s was 4*1 x 10-8. I estimated that on a still
night an amplitude, or velocity, one tenth of the above would
probably be aud-ble. A very similar number has been arrived
at by Wien*, who used an entirely different methodf.
    In co~neuon with calculations respecting the sensitiveness
of telephones, I was desirous of checking the above estimates,
and wade some attempts to do so by the former method. In
order to a\oid possible compilations of atmospheric refraction
which may occur when larre distances are in question, I
sought to construct pipes which should generate sound of
given piteh upon a much smaller scale, but with the usual
eco. oiry of wind. In this I did not succeed, and it seems as
if tl'ere is some obstacle to the desired reduction of scale.
    The experiments here to be recorded were conducted with
tuning-forks. A fork of known dimensions, vibrating with
a k.iown amplitude, may be regarded as a store of energy of
which the amount may readily be calculated. This energy
is gradually consumed by internal friction and by generation
of sound. When a resonator is employed the latter element
is the more important, and in some cases we may regard the
dying down of the amplitude as sufficiently accounted for by
the emission of sound. Adopting this view for the present,
we may deduce the rate of emission of sonorous energy from
the observed amplitude of the fork at the moment in ques
tion and from the rate at which the amplitude decreases.
Thus if the law of decrease be e~ikl for the amplitude of the
fork, or e~H for the energy, and if E be the total energy at
time t, the rate at which energy is emitted at that time is
 — dE/tit, or X,E. The value of k is deducible from observa
tions of the rate of decay, e. g. of the time during which the
amplitude is halved. With these arrangements there is no

   t The first estimate of the amplitude of but just audible sounds, with
which I have only recently become acquainted, is that of Toepler and
Boltzmann (Pogg. Ann. cxli. p. 321 (1870)). It depends upon an in
genious application of v. Helmholtz's theory of the open organ-pipe to
data relating to the maximum condensation within the pipe as obtained
by the authors experimentally. The value of t was found to be 66 X 10—8

difficulty in converting energy into sound upon a small scale,
and thus in reducing the distance of audibility to such a
figure as 30 metres. Under these circumstances the obser
vations are much more manageable than when the operators
are separated by half a mile, and there is no reason to fear
disturbance from atmospheric refraction.
    The fork is mounted upon a stand to which is also firmly
attached the observing-microscope. . Suitable points of fight
are obtained from starch grains, and the line of light into
which each point is extended by the vibration is determined
with the aid of an eyepiece-micrometer. Each division of
the micrometer-scale represents -001 centim. The resonator,
 when in use, is situated in the posit:on of maximum effect,
 with its mouth under the free ends of the vibrating prongs.
    The course of an experiment was as follows :—In the first
 place the rates of dying down were observed, with and with
 out the resonator, the stand being situated upon the ground
 in the middle of a lawn. The fork was set in vibration with
 a bow, and the time required for the double amplitude to fall
 to half its original value was determined. Thus in the case
 of a fork of frequency 256, the time during winch the vibra
 tion fell from 20 micrometer-divisions to ?0 inicromete.-
 divisions was 169 without the resonator, and 93 when the
 resonator was in position. These times of halving were, as
 far as could be observed, independent of the initial ampHtude.
 To determine the minimum audible, one observer (myself)
 took up a position 30 yards (27*4 metres) from the fork, and
 a second (Mr. Gordon) communicated a large vibration to the
 fork. At the moment when the double amplitude measured
 20 micrometer-divis:ons the second observer gave a signal,
 and immediately afterwards withdrew to a d'stance. The
 business of the first observer was to estimate for how many
 seconds after the signal the sound still remained audible. In
 the case referred to the time was 12s. When the distance
 was reduced to 15 yards (13*7 metres), an initial double
 amplitude of 10 micrometer-divisions was audible for almost
 exactly the same time.
    These estimates of audibility are not made without some
 difficulty. There are usually 2 or 3 seconds during which
 the observer is in doubt whether he hears or only imagines,
 and different individuals decide the question in opposite ways.
 There is also of course room for a real difference of hearing,
 but this has not obtruded itself much. A given observer on
 a given day will often agree with himself surprisingly well,
 but the accuracy thus suggested is, 1 think, illusory. Much
 depends upon freedom from disturbing noises. The wind

368            Lord Rayleigh on the Amplitude
in the trees or the twittering of birds embarrasses the ob
server, and interferes more or less with the accuracy of
results.
   The equality of emission of sound in various horizontal
directions was tested, but no difference could be found. The
sound issues almost entirely from tbe resonator, and this may
be expected to act as a simple source.
   When the time of audibility is regarded as known, it is
easy to deduce the amplitude of the vibration of the fork at
the moment when the sound ceases to impress the observer.
From this the rate of emission of sonorous energy and the
amplitude of the aerial vibration as it reaches the observer are
to be calculated.
   The first step in the calculation is the expression of the
total energy of the fork as a function of the amplitude of
vibration measured at the extremity of one of the prongs.
This problem is considered in § 164 of my ' Theory of
Sound.' If I be the length, p the density, and co the sectional
area of a rod damped at one end and free at the other, the
kinetic energy T is connected with the displacement 17 at the
free end by the equation (10)

so that if we now denote the double amplitude by li), the

where pal is the mass of each prong.
   The application of (A) to the 256-fork, vibrating with a
double amplitude of 20 micrometer-divisions, is as follows.
We have

and thus
                       E=4-06x 10s ergs.
This is the whole energy of the fork when the actual double
amplitude at the ends of the prongs is '050 centim.

   As has already been shown, the energy lost per second is
kE, if the amplitude vary as e~•**. For the present purpose
k must be regarded as made up of two parte, one kx repre
senting the dissipation which occurs in the absence of
the resonator, the other k3 due to the resonator. It is the
latter part only which is effective towards the production of
sound. For when the resonator is out of use the fork is
practically silent ; and, indeed, even if it were worth while
to make a correction on account of the residual sound, its
phase would only accidentally agree with that of the sound
issuing from the resonator.
   The values of kt and k are conveniently derived from the
times, <! and t, during which the amplitude falls to one half.
Thus
                   A=21og,2./f, A1 = 21og,2./<1;
so that
             Ag=2 log, 2 . (1/t-l/fa) =1-386 (1/t-l/h) .
And the energy converted into sound per second is &2E.
   We may now apply these formulae to the case, already
quoted, of the 256-fork, for which « = 9, ^=16. Thus t3, the
time which would be occupied in halving the amplitude were
the dissipation due entirely to the resonator, is 20" 6 ; and
&3 = -0674. Accordingly,
                       &SE = 267 ergs per second,
corresponding to a double amplitude represented by 20
micrometer-divisions. In the experiment quoted the duration
of audibility was 12 seconds, during which the amplitude would
fall in the ratio 212/9 : 1, and the energy in the ratio l13'9: 1.
Hence at the moment when the sound was just becoming
inaudible the energy emitted as sound was 42*1 ergs per
second*.
   The question now remains, What is the corresponding
amplitude or condensation in the progressive aerial waves at
27-4 metres from the source ? If we suppose, as in my former
   * It is of interest to compare with the energy-emission of a source of
light. An incandescent electric-lamp of 200 candles absorbs about a
horse-power, or say 1010 ergs per second. Of the total radiation only
about -jJu part acts effectively upon the eye ; so that radiation of suitable
quality consuming 5 x10s ergs per second corresponds to a candle-power.
This is about 10' times that emitted as sound by the fork in the experi
ment described above. At a distance of 102 X 80, or 3000 metres the
stream of energy from the ideal candle would be about equal to the
stream of energy just audible to the ear. It appears that the streams of
energy required to influence the eye and the ear are of the same order
of magnitude, a conclusion already drawn by Toepler and Boltzmann.

best supposition to make, although the reflexion is doubtless
imperfect. The area S covered at the distance of the observer

                            s=6-0xl0-9.
The condensation s is here reckoned in atmospheres; and the
result shows that the ear is able to recognize the addition and
subtraction of densities far less than those to be found in our
highest vacua.
   The amplitude of aerial vibration is given by asr/iv, where
1/t=256, and is thus equal to l-27 x 10-7 cm.
   It is to be observed that the numbers thus obtained are still
somewhat of the nature of superior limits, for they depend
upon the assumption that all the dissipation due to the resona
tor represents production of sound. This may not be strictly
the case even with the moderate amplitudes here in question,
but the uncertainty under this head is far less than in the case
of resonators or organ-pipes caused to speak by wind. From
the nature of the calculation by which the amplitude or
condensation in the aerial waves is deduced, a considerable
loss of energy does not largely influence the final numbers.
   Similar experiments have been tried at various times with
forks of pitch 384 and 512. The results were not quite so
accordant as was at first hoped might be the case, but they
suffice to fix with some approximation the condensation
necessary for audibility. The mean results are as follows :—

no reliable distinction appearing between the two last numbers.
Even the distinction between 6-0 and 4'6 should be accepted
with reserve; so that the comparison must not be taken to
prove much more than that the coadensation necessary for
audibility varies but slowly in the singly dashed octave.

XLII. Note on the Relation between the Coefficients of Pressure
             in Thermometry. By C. Chree, M.A.*
THE study of thermometers inteuded for very exact
        physical work has been the object of much patient
research at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures,
and an important bookf) embodying the principal results
obtained and giving a full account of the several corrections
required, has been written by Dr. Guillaume, attache to the
Bureau. The present paper was called into existence by
Dr. Guillaume's discussion on his pages 9SJ—1 11 of what he
terms " Coefficients de Press'on."
    There are two such coefficients of pressure, an " external "
and an " internal." Both have to do with the change in the
internal volume of the thermometer, i. e. the volume con
tained within the inner glass surface ; but the external
 coefficient is connected with the reduction of this volume
 under increased pressure on the outside of the thermometer,
 while the internal coefficient is connected with the increase of
volume accompanying increased pressure on the inner surface
itself.
    The increase of external pressure may be due to a rise in
 the barometer or to immersion iu a liqu'd ; while an increased
 internal pressure follows a rise in temperature if the stem be
 vertical, or the alteration of the thermometer from a hori
 zontal to a vertical position.
     As a matter of convenience, Dr. Guillaume combines the
 correction required by the change of volume of the glass with
 that required by the compressibility of the mercury itself.
 Here, however, we shall have to do solely with the corrections
 due to the compressibility of the glass. The coefficients of
 pressure dealt with here are those which Dr. Guillaume (/. c.
 p. 99) denotes by the letters at and a.e. They may be defined
  as follows :—
     Let V( denote the internal volume of the thermometer
  when free from all pressure. Let this become increased by
  8V/ when there is a uniform internal pressure p' and no
  external pressure, and let it become diminished by SV," when
  there is a uniform external pressure j/' and no internal

isotropic elastic material.
    On reading Dr. Guillaume's book I was struck by the
 simplicity of the result (3), but was unable to feel confidence
in the proof, of which the following is a brief outline:—
    Let       and Re denote the radii of the inner and outer
surfaces of an isotropic spherical shell, and let it become
exposed to uniform internal and external pressures Pj and Pf.
 Then the elastic displacement u is along the radius, and is
 given at a distance r from the centre by

 where \ and fi are Lame's elastic constants.            Noticing
 it is easy to prove that the relation (3) holds exactly.
     Take next a hollow circular cylinder extending from the
 plane z = 0 in the direction of z positive. Let R and Re be
  the radii of its inner and outer cylindrical boundaries, and let
 uniform internal and external pressures P< and PE be applied.
 Then, according to Dr. Guillaume, there is at any point not
  too near the ends of the cj-linder, and at distance r from the
  axis, a displacement w parallel to the axis and a displacement

 If we now suppose (5) to apply throughout the whole length
 Z of the cylinder, whose internal volume is 7rR< Z. we again
 find the relation (3) to hold.
    Having proceeded thus far Dr. Guillaume argues as fol
 lows *:—" En supposant, ce qui n'est sans doute qu approxima-
 tivement vrai, que, dans un reservoir compose d'un cylindre
 termine par des hemispheres, la partie cylindrique et les
 calottes se deforment d'une maniere independante, on pourra
 combiner les formules pr^cedentes de facon a obtenir les
 valeurs qui conviennent sensiblement au cas d'un reservoir
 thermometrique. La relation (3), commune aux deux cas,
 doit encore subsister."
    In order to judge of the force of the concluding argument
 we must consider what has been actually proved. The solu
 tion (4) is quite satisfactory for a uniform isotropic material
 bounded by two complete, exactly concentric, spherical sur
faces. The solution (5) gives a uniform pressure P( over the
inner surface r=R„ and a uniform pressure P« over the outer
surface r=Re of a cylindrical tube of isotropic material; it
likewise gives a resultant tension 7r(P(R? — PeR,) uniformly
distributed over the area 7r(R*— R?) of any section perpendi
cular to the axis of the tube.
   Now if we supposed a hollow vessel constructed of the
cylindrical tube in question closed at each end by any form
of surface, or cap, to be exposed to uniform internal and
external pressures P< and P„ the resultant of the pressures
on one of the caps is necessarily a force 7r(Pi R~PeR*)
parallel to the axis, and by ordinary statics this must equal
the resultant of the tensions over any orthogonal cross section
of the tube. With a cap symmetrical about the axis of the
cylinder, the tension borne by the wall of the tube will
obviously be the same at all points in the same transverse
section which are equidistant from the axis. The solution (5)
would thus satisfy all the conditions for the cylindrical por
tion of the hollow vessel if the caps were of such a form that

tion (5) thus breaks down in this respect. In accordance,
however, with what has been termed the " equivalence of
statically equipollent systems of terminal loading' *, it is pretty
generally conceded that if one dimension of a body be rela
tively small, such as the diameter of a long beam, then the
precise law of distribution of forces applied over the small
dimension is not of great importance so far as concerns the
elastic strains and stresses, except at points near the surface
where the force is applied. It would thus, I think, be gene
 rally admitted that, in the case of a closed tube of length not
 less than twenty times its externpl diameter, (5) would apply
 in the case of uniform pressures with a close approach to
 accuracy throughout much the greater portion of the volume.
 At the same time it is uncertain how large are the terminal
 volumes throughout which (5) is appreciably erroneous, and
 how great is the effect of the consequent error on the result (3) .
 This error is really negkcted by Dr. Guillaume, for though
 he starts by admitting the failure of (5) near the ends of the
 tube he applies it finally to the entire length.
     A more serious objection arises when we pass to the assump
 tion that (4) holds for two hemispherical caps connected by a
 cylindrical tube. Let us lay aside for the moment any pre
 conceived ideas as to the shape of a thermometer, and suppose
 we are really dealing with a cylindrical tube with hemi
 spherical ends, whose radii B,, Re are the same as the cylin
 der's. In this case the theory of equipollent systems of
 loading cannot lie invoked with the least show of reason, so
  far as the hemispheres are concerned, unless the thickness
  B,— R( of material be very small compared to B, ; and even
  in that extreme shape the error introduced by applying the
  theory would be most uncertain. There is thus, I think, very
  little mathematical basis for the assumption that (4) may be
  applied to two hemispheres connected by a cylindrical tube,
  unless it should turn out that the solutions (4) and (5) are in
  very close agreement over the transverse sections where the
  hemispherical caps pass into the cylindrical tube. This, how
  ever, is in general far from the case. We see in fact that the
  radial displacements u in (4) and in (5) are totally different
  functions of r, except in the special case when Pj=P,.. A
  like incompatibility will be found between the stress parallel
  to the axis in the cylinder and the stress it would require to
  equal in the hemisphere.

   There is a final objection to the extension of the result (3)
to a thermometer, -which has doubtless occurred already to
every one familiar with the ordinary shape of that instrument.
A mercury-thermometer of ordinary dimensions which makes
the slightest pretence to an open scale must have the internal
diameter of its bulb a very large multiple of that of its tube.
Its resemblance to a cylindrical tube with hemispherical ends,
whose diameters must of course equal that of the tube, is
thus so remote that even if (3) had been satisfactorily estab
lished for the one body its extension to the other would have
been a very long i,tep into the unknown.
   The object of the preceding remarks is solely to show the
necessity for further investigation. It is far from my desire
to reflect in any way on the author of the proof, whether
Dr. Guillaume or another. The discriminating physicist
whom the exigencies of the case compel to use imperfect
mathematical methods, but who nevertheless reaches results
of practical utility, ought rot to be classed with the mathe
matical proficient who overlooks errors in his anatysis which
wholly vitiate his physical conclusions, or who fails to recog
nize fundamental differences between the problem he has
actually solved and that which is presented by nature.
While the mathematician devoid of physical insight may go
badly wrong through some slip which mathematically con
sidered is insignificant, the man possessed of keen physical
instincts would almost appear protected by a special pro
vidence which causes even his mistakes to work to his
advantage.
   The conclusion to which my own investigations lead is that,
on the hypothesis of uniform pressure, (3) is true absolutely,
and not merely approximately, for any homogeneous elastic
material, isotropic or aeolotropic, limited by an internal and an
external surface of any shape or shapes whatsoever; and tills I
now proceed to prove.
   In any homogeneous elastic material, with any number of
elastic constants from 2 to 21, acted on only by surface-
forces, the elastic stresses must satisfy the three internal
equations

    Since the result (3) may come under the notice of some
persons whose interest in thermometry is not accompanied by
a knowledge of elastic solids, it may be well to state explicitly
under what conditions it has been proved to hold, and wherein
these conditions may differ from what occurs in practice with
actual thermometers.
    The conditions assumed in the mathematical theory are :—
    (A) that the material is completely homogeneous, though
         not necessarily isotropic ;
    (B) that the pressure is perfectly uniform over the surface
         where it is applied ;
    (C) that the volume whose change is considered is the
         entire volume within the inner surface.
    The fact that (3) holds when all these conditions are satisfied
does not of course necessarily imply that it ceases to hold if
one of the conditions is not satisfied. As a matter of fact it
certainly holds in one case when (A) is only partially satisfied,
viz. in the case of a spherical shell composed of concentric
layers of different isotropic materials, which though differing
in rigidity have all the same compressibility. But it is
obvious that in any case where the compressibility, and so
the bulk-modulus, is not uniform it would be meaningless.
    There is room for doubt as to how far condition (A) is
 satisfied by thermometers. Differences of elastic quality
 between the bulb and stem, or even between the material at
the outside and inside of the stem, seem not unlikely to occur.
    The condition (B) is probably never satisfied exactly ; and it
may be \ery far from holding when the stem is vertical, in
 the case either of internal pressure or external fluid pressure.
 It may, however, be regarded as practically satisfied in the
 case of external atmospheric pressure.
    The preceding mathematical theory gives no direct and
 certain information as to how the change of volume is divided
 between the bulb and stem even when the pressure is uniform.
 If, however, we for a moment supposed the bulb and a short

        New Method for Mapping the Spectra of Metals.        379
adjacent portion of the stem to be converted into a closed
vessel by means of a flat disk of glass closing the bore, the
effect on the change of the volume so enclosed could hardly
differ appreciably from that occurring previous to the closure,
supposing the bore to be fine. Also if the bulb be nearly
spherical the pressure over its surface would seem, so far as
change of volume is concerned, to be replaceable without
serious error by a uniform pressure equal to that actually
found at the level of the bulb's centre.
    We should thus conclude that the change in the volume of
a nearly spherical bulb follows approximately the same law
as if the bulb were closed and subjected to uniform pressure
 equal in intensity to that occurring at the level of its centre
 of gravity. A relation equivalent to (3) thus seems likely to
 hold approximately for the bulb alone, at least when it is
 nearly spherical and the bore is fine. This is, I think, prac
 tically in harmony with the conclusion reached by Dr.
 Guillaume on his p. 111.
 XLIII. On a New Method for Mapping the Spectra of Metals.
      By Prof. Henry Crew and Mr. Robert Tatnall*.
 THE difference in physical character between the various
        lines in the spectrum of an element has recently assumed
 such importance that a table of wave-lengths is now, to some
  extent, incomplete unless accompanied by a photographic
  map. This is especially true for one who is seeking new
  relations among the wave-lengths. Thus, in the case of
  cadmium, the triplets overlap, but, " owing to the physical
  similarity of the lines forming any one triplet, it is a matter
  of perfect ease to select them "f.
     Indeed, in many cases where series have been discovered,
  one might decide to what series a given line belongs quite
  as well by its appearance as by its wave-length. Kydberg
  has happily suggested, for these series, names which describe
  the appearance of their respective lines.
     So far as we are aware, all photographs of metallic spectra
  which have hitherto been made are, with two exceptions,
  either of spark spectra or spectra of substances vaporized in
  the carbon arc. The two exceptions to which we refer are,
 first, the well-known spectrum of iron by Kayser and ltunge,
  in which the arc employed is that between iron rods about
  one centim. in diameter ; and, secondly, a copper arc with
                  * Communicated by the Authors,
                  t Ames, Phil. Mag. July 1890, p. 45.

380           Prof. H. Crew and Mr. R. Tatnall on a
which these same gentlemen have attempted to vaporize
strontium, and thus obtain the strontium triplet* at X3800,
 free from the cyanogen band. They say, however, that the
arc worked so badly as to give only one line out of the
three.
    The well-known difficulty with the spark spectrum is that
it is almost as characteristic of the slight differences in
physical condition under which it is obtained as of the
chemical element from which it is obtained. Not only so,
but owing to its streaks, as it were, of high temperature
 (" luminescence " ?) there is obtained, at the same time with
the spectrum of the metal, also the spectra of the gases in
which the discharge takes place.
    In the case of the carbon arc, nature has fortunately
grouped its many thousand lines into bands, leaving here and
there comparatively clear spaces in which the lines due to
substances deliberately introduced into the arc can be studied
and measured with a high, degree of accuracy, as exemplified
in the work of Rowland and of Kayser and Runge.
    Fortunately also, in the case of some metals, especially the
easily volatile ones, the metallic vapour acts as if it shunted
off the current from the carbon vapour ; and the metal comes
out strong in comparison with the carbon.
   At the same time, the carbon and cyanogen bands stretch
practically through the whole spectrum from X 3500 into the
infra-red. Not only so, but many of these carbon lines have,
as a rule, intensities quite comparable to those of the metallic
lines. One ingenious effort has been made by Kayser and
Runge (I. c.) to rid themselves of the cyanogen bands by
working the carbon arc in a current of carbon dioxide. This
is partially successful ; but, at best, it only diminished the
intensity of the band. Messrs. Lewis and lerry f, speaking
of the infra-red spectra of the metals, say :—" It seems as
though little more could be done in the discovery of new
metallic lines unless the carbon lines are first carefully
mapped, or some means is devised for raising the substances
investigated to sufficiently high temperature without placing
them directly in the [carbon] arc."
   We have, therefore, devised and used during the past year
the following method for obtaining the arc spectrum of the
metallic elements free from carbon, free from air-lines, and
free also from any continuous spectrum.
   The idea is simply that of an arc in which one pole rapidly

        New Method for Mapping the Spectra of Metals.         381
rotates or vibrates, thus preventing welding and destroying
the coating of oxide which in some cases interrupts the
current between ordinary metallic poles.
  fa
   To accomplish this, a brass disk is fitted, by means of a
collar and set-screw, to the shaft (or counter-shaft) of a small
high-speed electric motor. Parallel to this brass disk, and
upon it as a base, is screwed a similar disk. These disks are
used as jaws in which to clamp small pieces of metal to be
vaporized. One pole of the electric circuit which includes
the arc is connected, by brushes, to the counter-shaft, shown
in section at A (fig. 1). The other pole of the arc circuit is
connected to another clamp F, which, by means of the screw
E, can be made to approach or recode from the rotating disk.
 The clamp F is also fitted with parallel jaws, to receive a
 small piece of the metal (B) to be vaporized. This metal B
 is moved alwaj's parallel to itself, and the arc between B and
 C is maintained always at the same point. Both the rotating
 and the sliding jaws are mounted on the same base with the
 motor ; and the whole is so light as to be easily carried about
 in one hand.
    The disk is set in rapid rotation and the metal at B is slowly
 fed in, by the screw E, until the arc strikes. The incan
 descent vapour is then carried out by the disk into the form
 of an open fan, and is projected upon the slit of the spectro
scope by the " image ' lens.
    In the case of those elements which are easily obtainable
 in the form of a regulus, an entire disk may be made of the
 metal. With the rarer elements one needs to use only a
 small piece in the clamp, but the time of exposure is cor
 respondingly lengthened. The disk once started, no attention
 is required except the feeding-in of the metal, B. Nearly all
 the wear is on this piece and very little on the disk, so that
 the latter will last for a comparatively long time, while the
 former has to be renewed with a frequency depending upon
 the amount of current employed. We have generally used

382           Prof. H. Crew and Mr. R. Tatnall on a
a hundred-volt circuit and an alternating current of from two
to ten amperes. Higher voltages sustain a longer arc, and
thus protect the metal from mechanical wear.
    For the purpose of a comparison spectrum is used a second
counter-shaft placed parallel to, and in the same horizontal
plane with, the first. This shaft carries an iron disk, about
an inch in diameter, against which is fed a piece of iron
tubing. The spectrum of any one metal having been photo
graphed, the whole instrument is translated laterally and the
current switched on to the iron disk. While not so con
venient as the sun in many ways, the iron spectrum has an
abundance of sharp lines evenly distributed : it permits one
to work in all kinds of weather and at night.
    The plates whose measures follow will illustrate the method.
They were taken with a Rowland concave grating of ten feet
radius and ruled with fifty thousand lines. The portion of
the plate measured, in each case, covers a part of the spec
trum where the carbon bands are strong. Knowing of no
adequate method of reproduction, except silver printing,
which is too expensive, we have selected three typical plates
and simply measured on a dividing-engine all the lines visible,
including " ghosts " and recognized impurities. The tables
explain themselves. They include all the lines certainly
visible through the reading-microscope of the dividing-engine ;
but a still lower-power microscope shows a number of weaker
lines between those measured. The wave-lengths were de
termined not with the highest accuracy possible, but well
within a tenth of an Angstrom unit, which is usually ample
for purposes of identification. The method was interpolated
between two of Rowland's standard iron lines, except in the
case of copper, where, for convenience, the interpolation is
between two of Kayser and Runge's copper lines.

    Out of 98 lines measured on the copper plate, it will be
 noticed that we are unable to identify 41. They are not to
be found among Kayser and Runge's values for Ag, Au, Sn,
 Pb, As, Sb, Mg, Ca, Zn, Sr, Cd, Ba, Hg, Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs,
or Fe.
    It is probable that these 41 lines belong to impurities whose
wave-lengths have not yet been determined (or, at least, not
published) with an accuracy sufficient for identification. It
is not impossible, however, that some of these are new copper
lines. We have found very little difference between " <com

XLIV. On the Vibrations of a Loaded Spiral Spring. By
    L. R. Wilberforce, M.A., Demonstrator in Physics at the
    Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge*.
IT has been pointed out by Profs. Ayrton and Perry f that,
      by comparing the axial elongation and the twisting pro
duced in a spiral spring of finite angle by the action of an
axial force, we can deduce the ratio of the torsional and
flexural rigidities of the wire or strip of which the spring is
made, and hence obtain the ratio of the rigidity to the
Young's modulus of its material.
    This method is very interesting and instructive ; but as it is
not easy to produce springs of convenient and yet sufficiently
uniform angles, nor to determine accurately a small axial
elongation, it seemed to me that it might be worth while to
modify it by attaching a mass to the spring and observing
the periods of the vibrations which it executes when dis
placed. In this case it will be found convenient to use a
spring of an angle so small that its square may be neglected.
    Apart from their use in comparing moduli of elasticity, the.
 vibrations of such a system present some rather interesting
 features, of which a detailed consideration may not be out of
 place.
    If we have a spiral spring made of a length I of wire,
 and wound on a cylinder of radius r, so that the distance
between the ends of the spring is x, and if <£ is the angle
between the planes through the axis of the spiral and the two
ends of the wire, the force and couple required to produce a
deformation from the equilibrium state (x0, <j>0) to the state

         If the spring is hung up in a vertical position with its
     upper end rigidly fixed, and a mass M attached to its lower
     end so as to be symmetrical about its axis, then, neglecting
     the mass of the spring, we have

     The most general form of solution is

   where p2 and are the roots of the quadratic (x— a) (x —c) = b2.
   We will suppose p2 to be the greater. The solution may be

         It is easily seen that p2 — a is positive and q2 — a negative ;
     therefore we conclude that, if b is a positive quantity, the
     shorter period of vibration corresponds to a screwing motion
     similar to the screw of the spring, and the longer to a screw
     ing motion opposite to the screw of the spring, while if b is

throughout the motion, the periods corresponding to these
modes being nearly equal. In this case, if the system
receives a displacement not represented by either of these
equations, the subsequent motion will be compounded of two
vibrations, one of which slowly gains upon the other, and will
thus exhibit phenomena of intermittence.
   For example, if the displacement (S.v = X, 8<f>=0) be given,
this may be resolved into
and
         *>*=X ^t^X> Mf—X;
                    2vV + l '                  2VV+T
and therefore, when the vibrations of one normal mode have
gained half a period on those of the other, the half-amplitude
of the x-vibration will have decreased from X to X —.
                                                         •xa+i
and a i^-vibration of half-amplitude X          .—^—= will have
appeared, while when another half-period is gained the initial
conditions will be restored. Thus, while at first the system
moves simply with an ;r-vibration, this gradually diminishes
to a minimum value, and at the same time a ^-vibration is
gradually set up and grows to a maximum ; the latter vibra
tion then decreases and finally vanishes, while the former
increases until it reaches its initial value, and then the phe
nomena recur.
    It is easy to see that a similar intermittence will be
exhibited if the system is started with a </>-vibration only.
   The above results may readily be verified experimentally
by employing as the mass M a body of adjustable moment of
inertia. The most interesting case is that in which k is
adjusted so that \ is rendered very small, when the energy

390         Mr. L. R. Wilberforce on the Vibrations
is seen to be transferred with almost perfect completeness
from ^-vibrations to <b-vibrations and back again.

or, since to our order of approximation l=r<f>,

It is also of interest to produce, by means of a series of suit
ably timed small impulses, the normal modes of vibration of
such a system and to demonstrate the permanence of each.
   If, however, the object in view is the determination of
elastic constants, it is convenient to arrange that {c—a) shall
be large compared with b. In this case, as we have seen,
pure iK-vibrations and pure </>-vibrations are practically the
two normal modes, and the periodic times of the former and
the latter are given by
                          ^a        V     A
If the mass m of the spring itself cannot be neglected, we
 can allow for it, if small compared with M, by taking M + Jwi
 as the vibrating mass, and MA' + ^ror* as its moment of
inertia*.
   Let us consider the case of a spring made of circular wire
of radius p. If we may assume the material to be homo
geneous and isotropic, an assumption which is undoubtedly a
weak point of all methods of determining the elastic constants
of a material by experiments on wires, we have
where E and n are respectively the Young's modulus and the
rigidity of the material. From the above we obtain

can be separately calculated.
   Some observations were taken upon different lengths of
one of Salter's steel springs (r= 1-494 cm.), using as the

attaching an additional mass to the vibrating body, so that x
was increased to 125, and of course K was changed.

 XLV. On the Velocities of the Ions and the Relative Ioni-
    zation-Power of Solvents. By W. C. Dampier Whetham,
    M.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge* .
  Ij^ROM a knowledge of the electrical conductivity and
-I-     migration-constant of a solution, Prof. F. Kohlrausch
 has shown us how to calculate the velocity with which its
 ions must travel in order that, in accordance with Faraday's
 law, a given current should be carried (Wied. Ann. xxvi.).
    Prof. 0. Lodge experimentally determined the velocit}'
 of the hydrogen ion as it travelled through a jelly solution of
 sodium chloride and so formed hydrochloric acid, the presence
 of which was indicated by the decolorization of phenol-
 phthalein. When the ion was driven by a potential gradient
 of one volt per centimetre the speed came out 0'0029 centi
metre per second, a number agreeing in a most remarkable
manner with Kohlrausch's theoretical value 0'0030 for a
decinormal solution (B.A. Report, 1886).
   The author of this paper has observed the specific ionic
velocity of other ions, such as copper and the bichromic-acid
group (Cr207J, by tracing the motion of the junction of two
salt-solutions (one of which is of different colour from the other)
 under the influence of an electric current (Trans. Roy. Soc.
 18i*3 A.) . The results agree with Kohlrausch's numbers even
 in the case of alcoholic solutions, the conductivities of which
 are much less than those of the corresponding aqueous
 solutions.
    Certain substances, e. g. ammonia and acetic acid, have
been regarded as exceptions to the application of the theory.
From a knowledge of the conductivity and migration-
constants of acids such as nitric and hydrochloric, we can
                 * Communicated by the Author,

      Ions and the Relative lonization-Power of Solvents.    393
calculate the velocity of tbe hydrogen ion ; and from the same
constants for a solution of (say) sodium or potassium acetate,
we can get the velocity of the acetic-acid group C2H302. If
 we calculate what conductivity these velocities would give to
 a solution of acetic acid (whose ions are H and C2H30j)
of strength O'l gram equivalent per litre, we obtain a number
 greater than the observed result in the ratio of 31G8 to 46.
    In order to observe whether the velocity of tbe ioDS was
 reduced in the same proportion as the conductivity, the
 velocity of the hydrogen ion through a solution of sodium
acetate was determined by Lodge's method.
   The apparatus used is represented in
the figure, and was the same as that
employed in the earlier investigation
above mentioned. Ordinary aqueous
solutions were at first set up ; but the
junction did not travel uniformly, and
agar jelly solutions were found to be
much better for this purpose. A pre
liminary investigation was made to
examine the influence of the jelly.
    The velocity of the bichromic-acid
group when driven by a potential gra
dient of one volt per centimetre was                      ^?
determined by filling the longer limb of
the tube with a solution of potassium
 bichromate in agar jelly just strong
enough to set, and the shorter with a
similar solution of potassium chloride.
A current was then passed across the
junction by conflicting the electrodes
 with a battery of storage-cells giving
an electromotive force of about 50 volts.
The bichromic-acid group travels in a
 direction opposite to that of the current
 and displaces the chlorine, so that the
 colour-boundary moves. If v represents the observed velo
 city, A the area of cross section of the tube at the point of
junction of the solutions, r the specific resistance of the solu
 tion, and 7 the strength of current as shown by a galvano
meter empirically graduated by means of a Daniell's cell and
box of resistance-coils, it is easy to prove that the specific
ionic velocity of the ion causing the change of colour is

394       Mr. W. C. D. Whetham on the Velocities of the
when the potential gradient along the tube is unity. In the
case of the Cr207 group travelling through an agar-jelly
solution of decinormal strength v1 = "00044 centim.per second.
In the earlier investigation the same group travelled through
an aqueous solution of corresponding strength with a velocity
of "00047 centim. per second. The effect of the jelly is thus
to slightly retard the motion, but the alteration appears to be
not more than about 10 per cent.
   The use of jelly having been thus justified, a solution of
sodium acetate (whose strength was afterwards found to be
about 0"07 grm. equiv. per litre) in agar jelly was prepared
and coloured red with phenolphthalein, just enough caustic
soda being added to bring out the full colour. Half of this
was decolorized by means of a few drops of dilute acetic acid,
and placed in the longer limb of the tube. When it had
cooled and become solid, the alkaline red portion was poured
into the other limb and also allowed to solidify. A glass
scale was fixed behind the junction-tube, and the whole placed
in front of a window. The position of the boundary was then
read off on the scale by means of a telescope. An electro
motive force of about 40 volts was applied, and the
velocity with which the boundary between the coloured and
colourless solutions travelled observed, readings being taken
at intervals of half an hour. The details of the first set of
observations are :—

     Ions and the Relative Ionization-Power of Solvents.     395
allowing weight to each in proportion to the time-interval
used in obtaining it, comes out 0-48 centim. per hour, and
the mean galvanometer reading 41o-0.
   The specific resistance of the solution was measured by
using a Wheatstone's bridge with alternating currents, and
gave 246'2 legal ohms per cubic centimetre when reduced
to 18° C.
   The area of cross section was determined by weighing the
water required to fill an observed length of the glass tube, and
found to be O430 square centim.
   The strength of the current was shown by the galvano
meter-reading to be ^3 ampere. Substituting these values
in our equation, we get for the hydrogen ion travelling
through a solution of sodium acetate in agar jelly whose
concentration is 0*07 gram equivalent per litre, when urged
by a potential gradient of 1 volt per centimetre, a velocity of
                0000065 centimetre per second.
   The value given by Kohlrausch for the same ion is 0'0030
centim. per second, so that in acetates its speed is reduced in
the ratio of 1 to 46.
   The ratio of the conductivity of a solution of acetic acid of
the strength used above to that of a decinormal solution of
hydrochloric acid is 1 to 59.
   Thus the velocities of the ions are reduced in about the
same proportion as the conductivity, and even in such cases
as these the conductivity can be calculated from a knowledge
of the opposite ionic velocities. It appears that all the factors
determining the conductivity of a solution primarily act by
exerting an influence on the ionic velocities. These factors
may be (first) the " ionization," i. e. the average fractional
time during which an ion is on the whole active (in whatever
its activity may really consist) ; and (secondly) the resistance
offered by the solution to its motion by reason of viscosity.
   It seems probable that the " ionization " power of different
solvents is largely dependent on their specific inductive ca
pacities. Prof. J. J. Thomson has pointed out that the effect
of immersing a molecule held together by electric forces in
a medium of high specific inductive capacity is to greatly
reduce the forces between the atoms. In this manner they
may acquire the freedom necessary for electrolytic activity,
which would, for any one salt, be proportional to the specific
inductive capacity of the solvent in which it was dissolved.
   If we assume that the resistance of a liquid to the passage
of an ion through it depends on its ordinary viscosity, we
ought to be able to calculate the relative conductivities of a

396             Mr. Rollo Appleyard on Dielectrics.
salt in different solvents. Some numbers have already been
given in the July number of ' Science Progress,' but for the
sake of convenience they are reproduced here. The values of
the specific inductive capacities of water and ethyl alcohol
have been determined by several observers; but apparently the
onl>- number for methyl alcohol is one given by Teneschin,
so "his values for all three liquids are taken, viz. water 83"7,
methyl alcohol 32-65, ethyl alcohol 25'8. Correcting these
numbers for the viscosities (100; 63; 120) we get the fol
lowing values, which should, if our assumptions are correct,
be proportional to the molecular conductivities of a salt in the
three solvents :—
   Water = 100; Methyl Alcohol 63; Ethyl Alcohol 26.
   Since these are measured for the pure solvent, they should
give the relative molecular conductivity of an infinitely dilute
solution. An investigation on the conductivities of very
dilute solutions of calcium chloride in ethyl and methyl
alcohols is now being made by Mr. Fitzpatrick and the
present writer. There are not for these cases such definite
limiting values as for water solutions, but the following rela
tive numbers (that of the infinitely dilute aqueous solution
being taken as 100) correspond to the greatest dilutions
reached :—
    Water 100; Methyl Alcohol 70; Ethyl Alcohol 23.
   The approximation of these numbers to those given above
suggest that the specific inductive capacity and the viscosity
are at all events the chief factors in determining the '' relative
ionization power " of a solvent.

       XLVI. On Dielectrics. By Rollo Appleyard *.
MOST dielectrics, when submitted to the ordinary "insu
        lation " test, show an apparent increase of resistance
under the action of the testing-current. That is to say :
from the moment the current has been applied, the galvano
meter-spot, having reached its maximum position, falls
gradually towards zero with time. The rate of this dimi
nution, at any instant, is a measure of the so-called " electri
fication " of the dielectric at that instant. For commercial
purposes the "electrification " is usually computed between
the first and second minutes from the moment of charge ;
the value thus determined is an excellent confirmatory guide

to quality, if the general history of the material and the
peculiarities of manufacture are understood. But, apart from
its merely commercial bearing, " electrification " presents a
wide field for scientific research. The use of the term " elec
trification " for this rate of change of the apparent resistance
of a dielectric with the time of application of the charging
current, may be called into question by those who prefer the
words " polarization," or " absorption ; " but, in the present
stage of our knowledge of the action which determines this
change, it has been thought better to adopt a term which is
never mistaken in practice than to use an .ambiguous ex
pression, founded upon an equally uncertain hypothesis.
" Electrification " seems to be the net result of many simul
taneous actions, some of which are very obscure ; the physical
mechanism implied in the process is subtle and mysterious,
the experimental observations are difficult to reconcile among
themselves, and there is no theory to adequately account for
the phenomena. It is not proposed, here, to make any attempt
at solving the difficulties, but rather to present them in the
form of experimental results.
                              Celluloid.
    The first substance to be dealt with, in this regard, is
 " celluloid." As far as can be judged by inspection it
 appears to be a compound of guncotton and camphor, with a
 trace of lime—possibly in the form of sulphate. When seen
 through the microscope, small white spots become visible in
 a translucent yellowish substance. In texture " celluloid "
 resembles " cordite," but it is of lighter colour, inflammable
 but not explosive. The insulation of this substance was, at
 first, measured in the following way :—A thin circular sheet
 of celluloid was placed between two plane surfaces of brass
 11 inches in diameter. A margin of celluloid was allowed, to
 prevent leakage over the edges ; and a heavy weight was put
 upon the top plate. When this sheet was submitted to the
 action of a current, there was no such apparent increase of
 resistance as is usually to be observed with dielectrics. The
 falvauometer, in fact, indicated the reverse effect—the de-
   exion gradually increasing with time. No actual fault could
 be detected in any of the samples, and yet the " electrification "
 was negative. This curious effect was the more to be noticed
 as the voltage of the testing-battery was increased. The
 actual insulation resistance, calculated for the same sample,
 with this apparatus, under various currents, showed that the
 resistance changed enormously with the testing voltage.
     In this case, and in all experiments here mentioned, the

398              Mr. Hollo Appleyard on Dielectrics.
insulation has been computed from the deflexions obtained
after the corresponding voltage had been applied for one
minute. The upper readings correspond with increasing
voltages ; the lower curve completes the cycle with diminish
ing voltages, and shows the falling-off of insulation with
current, in a manner curiously like the hysteresis curve of
iron. The observed values are given in Table I.

   This table includes the actual galvanometer-deflexions from
which the insulation-resistance at each voltage was calculated.
First and second minute readings are recorded, and exhibit
very strikingly the apparently negative " electrification/'—the
first-minute readings being less than the second-minute
readings.
   A series of tests was made upon celluloid sheets pressed,
in the above manner, between two plane surfaces of metal, and
the same general features were observed in each case. As no
definite fault could be discovered in any sample, I was led to
suppose that the abnormal change in resistance, and the
corresponding negative " electrification," were to be accounted
for by some complex molecular rearrangement within the
substance of the celluloid itself. Leakage over the edges
might obviously be urged in explanation, but the conditions
did not seem to allow of any serious loss in this manner.
While employing unyielding metallic surfaces against the
comparatively hard surface of the celluloid, the chances of
uneven pressure upon the sheet were very great : which would
imply uneven electrical contact between the dielectric and the
plates.
   The next experiments were made with a view to test the
celluloid in perfect contact with the opposed plates ; to remove
all chances of leakage-error ; and to provide, at the same time,
a more evenly distributed pressure over the surface. The hard
metallic plates were therefore replaced by mercury surfaces

               Mr. Rollo Appleyard on Dielectrics.           399
which conformed precisely, and -without undue pressure, to
the sheet of dielectric ; and, at the same time, made perfect
contact with it, leaving no air-spaces or spark-gaps where
ozone or other gases might collect.
   Circular sheets of celluloid, 11| inches in diameter, were
employed for these tests. To prevent leakage, a 3-inch
margin was allowed all round, so that the working-surface in
contact with mercury was 5£ inches in diameter. The method
of fixing the dielectric sheet wp.s as follows :—Two flat ebonite
rings, 5£ inches internal diameter, and 6£ inches outside, were
faced on each side with india-rubber, forming insulating
washers. These rings were placed exactly opposite each
other, flatwise, one on each side of the sheet to be tested.
Circular plates of iron were now laid against the outer faces
of the rings, and combined to make two mercury-tight hollow
boxes, one on each side of the dielectric. The whole was then
gripped vertically in an ebonite vice ; after which mercury
was poured in to fill the boxes. This apparatus, with the
exception of the insulating rings, is the same as that designed,
I believe, by Mr. Evers. The great advantage of the method
is that the mercury conforms to the surface of the dielectric,
leaving no air-spaces and necessitating no artificial pressure.
The surface-leakage can be made as small as desired, by the
simple device of leaving enough margin. Experiments made
 upon dielectrics fixed in this apparatus give results entirely
 different from those obtained with rigid metallic plates.
   A sheet of celluloid "071 inch in thickness was the first that
came under trial. Its behaviour during a cj'cle of voltage
from 150 to 1200 volts is represented in Table II.

   The curves practically overlap. The insulation falls some
what with the increase of voltage, but recovers its original
value as the cycle is completed. There was no observable
"electrification"; the first and second minute readings were
in each case identical.
   The next sheet of celluloid tested was 6 mils in thickness.
Here again there was no sign of " electrification," though
there was a distinct diminution of insulation with voltage.
This sheet broke down at 1200 volts ; there is nothing in the
curve to indicate that such a rupture was about to take place.
These results are given in Table III.

                           "Dielectric Hysteresis."
         " Dielectric hysteresis " is here alluded to in a sense which
     needs a little explanation.           The similarity in shape and
     character between some of these curves and the well-known
     forms of the hysteresis curves of magnetism is all that I wish
     to imply,—it is not the phenomenon of " dielectric hysteresis "
     proper. In an article in the Electrotechnische Zeitschrift,
     29th April, 1892, p. 227, Steinmetz traces the analogy be
     tween a dielectric medium in an electrostatic field and
     magnetic bodies in a magnetic field, with a view to deter
     mining whether the loss of energy in dielectrics, under the
     influence of an alternating electrostatic field, would follow a
     law similar to that which defines the magnetic losses due to
     magnetic hysteresis. The experiments of Steinmetz, and
     of Arno, have gone to show that the energy expended in a
     dielectric medium, in an electrostatic field of alternating
     potential, is sensibly proportional to the square-root of the
     intensity of the electrostatic field. These losses are due to
     " dielectric hysteresis " proper, and are quite distinct from
     the mere change of resistance with voltage here described.
     The experimental results of Steinmetz should, however, be
     corrected for this other phenomenon of change, which, for
     the time being, we may call " dielectric mutability," or any
     other term which denotes the variation of resistance with
     voltage; for it is clear that the energy expended during a
     cycle of potential cannot rightly be calculated upon the basis
     of constant resistance assumed by Steinmetz. With this cor
     rection, if it could be determined and applied to his results,
     the observed values, notwithstanding their present close
    agreement with those calculated, may possibly be brought
    even nearer to conformity.

 402           Mr. Hollo Appleyard on Dielectrics.
                       " Residual Charge."
    The residual charge becomes a very small quantity a few
 minutes after breaking circuit ; consecutive voltages can
 therefore be applied without having to wait very long for the
 practical disappearance of the last charge. In the above tests
 it was made a rule never to send a current into a sheet until the
 previous charge had vanished to within £ per cent. Although,
 under these conditions, the charge is quickly got rid of, yet
 during the first few seconds the amount left in may be very
 considerable. Conversely, the celluloid takes up its change
 comparatively tardily. If, for instance, an attempt is mude
 to determine the capacity of the sheet, when in the mercury
 apparatus, by the simple discharge method, an eye which is
 accustomed to watching the " throw " of the galvanometer will
at once observe thai the needle is under the action of an ex
tended discharge and not of a sudden impulse. When first
this phenomenon was observed I carried out the following ex
periment :—The celluloid was charged from 20 cells for 15
seconds. It was then discbaiged, noi; through the galvano
meter, but through the short-circuit key. After two seconds
 the short-circuit key was opened, and there was a discharge
of a few degrees to the right—that is, in the "discharge"
direction ; this fell in a few seconds across the zero to 5
divs. on the left, when? it remained perfectly steady. This
curious reversal of sign was at first rather puzzling ; if the
spot had merely fallen to zero, it would have been easy to
refer it to complete loss of charge ; if it had fallen a little to
the right of zero, it could have been attributed to incomplete
loss of charge ; but falling, as it did, on the negative side of
zero, a novel case was presented.
    After several repetitions, charging with various potentials
up to as high as 900 volts, this reversal still manifested itself,
although the time required to attain it was of course greater
as the testing-voltage increased. Days and nights of short-
circuiting would not wipe it out ; whatever was tried, it
remained always the same negative deflexion. It is, in fact,
an initial permanent E.M.F. of about '0006 of a volt with
which nothing seems to interfere. It is apparently due to
the contact of the mercury with the celluloid ; it did not
appear when metallic plates were used. This point having
been so far settled, the experiments on slow discharge were
repeated with 100, 200, 400, and 600 cells ; the corresponding
discharge-readings—after short-circuiting the sheet for two
seconds in each case before discharge—were respectively 18,
'66, 57, and 80 divs., falling to zero, or very nearly to zero in
a few minutes, and ultimately crossing the zero to —5. The
discharge from a standard microfarad charged to 30 volts is

              Mr. Rollo Appleyard on Dielectrics.            403
 11,103 scale-divs. The instantaneous discharge from the
celluloid sheot (5^ in. diam., '00615 inch thick) with the same
voltage, was 115 divs., which is the mean of the two readings
obtained by reversing the battery. The test can scarcely be
regarded as a capacity test under the above conditions. It is
recorded here simply to show the phenomenon of slow dis
charge, and the existence of the permanent initial E.M.F.
                          Gutta-Percha.
   Appended are the results of some tests upon a sheet of
pure gutta-percha, in the mercury apparatus, at high voltages.
The thickness of this sheet was about 2 mils ; the diameter of
the circular mercury surface in contact with it, bounded by
the insulating rings, was, as before, 5| inches. Curves drawn
 from the tabulated results exhibit the phenomenon of dielectric
hysteresis, and show that the effect of the current, up to a
certain point, is to increase the resistance ; there is a subse
quent tendency in the opposite direction, which would probably
end in the breaking-down of the sample. There was no initial
electromotive force to be observed with the gutta-percha.
   Four separate tests wore made upon the sheet, two with a
cycle commencing at maximum volts, and two commencing
at the minimum. In each case, whether beginning at the
maximum or minimum volts, there was a decided increase of
resistance as the result of a cycle. With such a thin sheet as
2 mils the test was a very severe one for the gutta-percha ;
hence it is not surprising that the curves are somewhat broken.
Two-thousandths of an inch of material is here effectively
contending against 1200 volts, and setting up a barrier of
3000 million ohms over an area of 5i inches.
   A very interesting point about these four tests is that when
the cycle commences at maximum voltage the subsequent read
ings are far steadier, and the curve of resistance and voltage
smoother, than when minimum volts are started with; this is
clearly indicated by a comparison of the four curves which
may be drawn from these tables.
   There is no absolute need to short-circuit the apparatus in
order to remove the residual charge of the sheet ; but short-
circuiting probably quickens the process. This is a matter
for further experiment. It was found that the sample of
gutta-percha completely lost its charge after twenty-four
hours, whether short-circuited or not, and during that time it
regained its normal condition as regards insulation resistance.
Twenty-four hours was therefore allowed between each of the
four tests upon the gutta-percha sheet. As a rule, about
ten minutes' rest was given between the consecutive voltages
of individual tests ; this was found to be time enough to
practically discharge the sheet when short-circuited.

406           Mr. Rollo Appleyard on Dielectrics.
   The small opaque white spots, observed within the celluloid
under the microscope, led to some further experiments to
investigate the effect of isolated foreign particles within the
substance and upon the surface of dielectrics. Coarse brass
filings were scattered as thickly as possible over one face of a
warmed strip of gutta-percha, 16 inches long, 2 inches wide,
and J inch thick. The insulation of such a strip is not exactly
what might be expected ; when tested even with 750 volts its
resistance was practically infinite, and was certainly greater
than 600,000 megohms. A charged gold-leaf electroscope
could not be discharged with such a strip in this condition.
If, however, a wet cloth was passed once over the ron-
metallic face of the strip, or if it was simply breathed upon,
the insulation fell to 5000 megohms, and the strip now easily
discharged the electroscope. A round rod of gutta-percha
can be warmed and rolled in a heap of brass filings so as to
appear almost like a brass rod, and such a rod does not
discharge the electroscope. This would be an instructive
experiment for schools and instrument-makers.
                     "Sensitive " Dielectrics.
   The next experiments were made with rods formed of a
mixture of gutta-percha and brass filings melted together in
various proportions. The length of these rods was about 20
inches, and their diameter £ of an inch. Contact was made
with the ends for about 1£ inches by tin-foil which was bound
round with wire. It is found that, for small proportions of
brass filings, the resistance between the ends of these rods is
exceedingly high, and this high resistance is maintained until
about 2 parts, by weight, of brass are mixed with one part,
by weight, of gutta-percha. Here a " critical " point of propor
tionality between the two substances occurs, undei' which the
rods have a very low resistance, of something liLe one ohm ;
and above which the resistance is exceedingly high, and can
only bo measured in megohms. Several rods were made at
or near this "critical " poirl., and in no case could a medium
resistance of, say, a few hundred ohms be attained. All the
rods were either of very high or very low resistance.
   The method of making them is to warm a sheet of gutta
percha upon a hot plate, using French chalk to prevent
sticking. The filings are sprinkled in as soon as the sheet
becomes soft. The whole is then made up into a pudding,
which is again flattened out into a sheet ; this is repeated
until a good mixture is arrived at. The compound is then
rolled into rods.

   Table IX. gives the proportion by weight of these rods and
the corresponding resistance. When rods made up in this
way are submitted to the action of oscillating discharges, they
behave in a similar manner to the " impulsion " cells of Prof.
Minchin and the tubes of M. Branly. If, for instance, one
of the low-resistance rods of, say, four parts by weight of
gutta-percha to nine of brass filings is connected to one arm
of a Wheatstone's bridge and bplanced, an oscillatory dis
charge made anywhere near it will, in "early all caf.es, pro
duce a considerable diminution of resistance—in some cases
amounting to more than 10 per cent., and, in one experiment,
to as much as 45 per cent. This charge remains until restored
to the former condition of things by a slight mechanical tap.
I have repeated this experiment upon seven different rods,
and have, in each case, obtained a diminution when the dis
charge-spark passed at the oscillator. The small- resistance

 of which the energy is less than that of any other motion
possible to the fluid with the g'ven motion of the disk. We
suppose the disk to be very thin, and therefore the profile-
curvature at every point of its edge to be very great: there
is no limit to the thinness au which the proposition could

infinitely thin disk, when the fluid and its boundary fulfil

    § 3. But in nature every fluid has some degree of viscous
resistance to change of shape ; and any viscosity however
small (even with ideally perfect incompressibility of the fluid
and unyieldingness of the boundary) would prevent the in
finitely great velocities at the edge of the disk which the
unique minimum-energy solution gives when the disk is
infinitely thin ; and would originate so great a disturbance
in the motion of the fluid that the resistance to the motion of
the disk would probably be very nearly the same whatever the
actual value of the viscosity, if not too great in comparison
with the velocity of the disk multiplied by the least radius of
curvature of the boundary of its area. No approach, ho .vever,
has hitherto been made towards a complete mathematical
solution of any case of this problem, or indeed of the motion
of a body of any shape through a viscous fluid, except when,
as in Stokes's original solutions for the globe and circular
cylinder, the motion is so slow that its configuration is the
same as it would be if it were infinitely slow, and when
therefore* the velocity of the fluid at every point is equal to,

of equilibrium, in the manner translationally and rotationally
corresponding to the translational and rotational velocity
given to the rigid body in the fluid.

   The sirip began to break down under the action of the
alternating current at 900 volts ; at 3000 volts it was emitting
small local arcs, some crimson, others violet. After the
application for some time of this high voltage the number
and brilliancy of the arcs diminished,—the insulation had
apparently improved. At 5500 volts there were bright dis
charges similar to the first. These were not of the nature of
long sparks, but of small local arcs.
   Rod No. 6 gave way at 6500 volts and exhibited the same
apparent improvement in insulation. The arcs shot out in
miniature flames, like very small blowpipe blasts ; locally, as
in the case of the strip.
   With rod No. 9 sparking commenced at 1500 volts, having
the appearance of small beads of crimson and violet light
burning themselves out at fixed points. When these speci
mens had become cool their insulation was again tested.

   The strip thus appears to have recovered entirely. No. 6

improved, under this trying ordeal.

be made simply of metallic powders intermixed with the
dielectric.

found by the following method, with result expressed in § 9,
which 1 venture to give as a guess, and rot as a satisfactory-
mathematical investigation.
    § 5. Considering a disk of finite thickness, however small,
moving in an inviscid incompressible liquid within an un
yielding boundary, and, for a moment, thinking only of the
u-component of the motion, according to the notation of § 1,
let E and E' denote the front and the rear parts of the edge,
respectively. Imagine now instead of the real motion of the
unvarying solid disk through the fluid, that the disk grows
all over E, by rigidification and accretion of the fluid in front
of it, and melts away from E' by liquefaction of the solid.
In an infinitesimal time St, the extent of the accretion in front
of E will be uSt. Now if the v component of the motion of
the disk is maintained without diminution during this accre
tion, a force, F, equal to (I' — I)/o7, must be applied from
without, perpendicular to the disk ; I denoting the impulsive
force which would be required to give the u-component
velocity to the unangmented disk, and 1' that required to give
the same velocity to the augmented disk. The point of
application of the force (l' — I)/St must be that of the
resultant of impulses I' and —I, applied at the hydraulic
centres of inertia* of the augmented disk and the unang
mented disk respectively.
   § 6. Sudden cessation of the rigidity by liquefaction of any
portion, (finite or infinitely small) of matter of the disk at E'
requires no instantaneous application of force, to prevent
change of the v-motion of the residual solid. The continued
gradual liquefaction which we are supposing performed, leaves
a Helmholtz " vortex sheet " of finite slip growing out in the
liquid, behind E', the evolutions and contortions of which are
not easily followed in imagination. This sheet is in the form
of a pocket of which the lip remains always attached to the
solid disk. The space enclosod between it and the disk is
filled by the liquid which was solid. It grows always longer
and longer by gain of liquid from the melting solid at E' in
front of it, and probably also by its rear extending farther
and farther, far away in the wake of the disk.
    § 7. Suppose now that, after having been performed during
a certain time T, the ideal processes of §§ 5, 6 are discon
tinued, and the resulting solid disk, equal and similar to the
original disk, but carried in the M-direction through a space

equal to wT, is left with simply its «-motion through the fluid
maintained. The pocket of liquefied solid will be left farther
and farther behind the disk. Its mouth, still always stopped
by the solid, will shrink from its original area which was the
whole of E' ; and will become always smaller and smaller, but
not infinitely small in any finite time. The neck of the pocket
in the wake of the disk will become narrower and narrower,
and the whole pocket will be drawn out longer and longer
behind ; but, through all time, the fluid which was solid will
remain separated by a surface of finite slip, or Helmholtz
" vortex sheet," from the surrounding fluid, except over the
ever diminishing area of the disk, which stops the mouth of
the pocket. The motion of the fluid is irrotational outside the
pocket, and rotational within it. To keep the solid disk
moving with its v-motion constant, and with no other motion
whether rotational or translational, it is necessary to apply
force to it. But this force becomes less and less, and approxi
mates to zero, as the vortex-trail becomes finer and finer ;
and the motion of the fluid in the neighbourhood of the disk
approximates more and more nearly to perfect agreement with
the unique irrouitional motion due to v-motion of the solid
through the fluid.
   § 8. So far we have, in §§ 5, 6, 7, been on sure ground,
and every statement is rigourously true, not only for a
" disk " of any shape of boundary and of any thickness how-
over small, but also for a solid of any shape, dealt with
according to § 5, provided only that the fluid is inviscid and
incompressible, and its boundary unyielding. My hypothesis,
or "guess" (§ 4), which forms the subject of the present,
paper, is that default from infinitely perfect fulfilment of all
these three conditions would, for an Infinitely thin disk kept
moving with uniform translational motion («, t>, § 1), require
the continued application to it of force determined in magni
tude and position by § 5; provided v be very small in com
parison with u.
   § 9. The result is worked out with great ease for the case
of a rectangular disk of which the length, /, is very great in
comparison with the breadth, a. For this case, by the well-
known hydrokinetics of an ellipsoid or elliptic cylinder
moving translationally in an inviscid incompressible fluid of
unit density, we have        j= iTOs/s .
and, still using the notation of § 5,

           XLVIII. " Densities in the Earth's Crust."
              By Rev. J. J. Blake, M.A., F.G.S.*
MR. OSMUND FISHER having been unfortunately called
         upon to categorically assent to or answer my criticisms
of a portion of his work on the ' Physics of the Earth's
Crust/ has attempted the latter alternative in the April
number of this magazine. I had hoped that he would have
adopted the former on more careful consideration of the
subject ; but, as it is not so, I hope I may bo excused if I
point out still more clearly the gist of my objections to his
method.
    In several places Mr. Fisher does not seem to recognize
that it is not his conclusions but his mathematics that are
discussed, for if the mathematics are wrong there arc no con
clusions to discuss. Thus he begins by stating that if I had
more fully mastered his " results," I should not have stated
that " the argument . . . seems to depend on the greater density
of the superficial layer in continental than in oceanic areas, '
which he observes is the exact opposite of his " conclusion ; "
 but, as ocean water is certainly of less density than rock,
this is not a conclusion at all, but a datum—the mathematical
problem being this:—Given that the attraction of a sphere on
a particle at any point on its surface is constant for all such
points— but that, the superficial layer in one part is less dense
 than in another—find the relations between the densities and
 thicknesses of the underhung layers.
    Again, he says it would be absurd to assume any other law
of attraction than the Newtonian for the case of nature,—very
likely ; but the objection is that, if the method were correct,
the same results might be deduced even from an absurd law.
It is for this reason that I call the functions he speaks of (f(0)
&c.) " unknown."
    Again, he answers my objection that in his solution " it is

necessary to assume the equality of the two sides to the same
degree of approximation as there are layers in the crust," by
 saying that there is no necessity for such an equality in
nature. Just so—that is my objection—that the equality has
to be assumed for the sake of the mathematics.
   These minor objections, however, and their replies are of
comparatively little consequence; and I merely mentioned
them as slight indications that should have shown that some
thing was amiss. The main statement, which Mr. Fisher
simply repeats, is to the following effect : —If

   That is his fundamental proposition, and what I say is this : —
that equations (B) do not follow from (A), and that if they
were true, they would be of no value.
   Even the converse proposition, that if equations (B) are
satisfied the series (A) is zero, is only true if the series is con
vergent; but to deduce (B) from the series (A) being zero it is
necessary to show, first, that it is convergent ; secondly, that
none of the functions f{9), #(#), &c, are zero for all values of
0, and particularly that it is possible to make <j>(0), ^{0), &c.
zero without making/(0) zero at the same time. This is what I
mean by " independent." Mr. Fisher replies to this, that they
are not independent, which is exactly my objection, because he
has to assume them, in his work, to be so. As a matter of fact,
if we take Mr. Fisher's values of/(0), $(6), ^(0), as correct,
each is a linear function of the other two and all vanish
together for the same value of 0, so that the coefficient of any
one may be distributed amongst the others. Moreover, the onlv

value of 0 which makes them zero is given by sin^ = — 1,

small values of 0, and, indeed, cannot be a true expression for
the attraction when 0=0. The true expression is in fact a
function of two independent variables t and sin - ; and if we

  found to be indeterminate.
     But supposing equations (B) were true, what do they
  mean ?

 Hence one of these factors must be zero, anil therefore by
 symmetry all in the same group ; that is, either all the thick
 nesses of the layers are zero, or all are equal; and in the
 latter case we get
                        Ti + t2 + t3 + t4 . . . = 0,
 or the sum of the densities in one cap is equal to that in
 other.
     Mr. Fisher nearly came to this point when he supposed his
 11 quantities /i/2, &c. to be connected by n — 1 equations. If
he had only tried n equations instead ho would have come to
this same result. It may be noted that the first n equations
 (B) give us ti = t2 = t3, &c, and hence any number of such
equations will be satisfied, for they all reduce to
                       T! + T2 + T3 + T4. .. =0.
    Now since the supposed layers of each cap overlap—for I
admit that my second objection is answered and that this is
assumed in the working—and they are all equal, the division
of the cap into coincident layers of different density is quite
arbitrary, provided the sum of the densities of the parts is
the same in the two caps. Equations (B) mean, therefore,
that the two caps are identical in all respects. In other
words, we get to the following curious result, tliat Mr. Fisher's
mathematical argument, if assumed to be correct, would show
that identical attractions can only bo produced by identical

416                    Rev. J. J. Blake on
caps ; i.e., would prove that his hypothesis is wrong, when he
assumes that gravitation is constant in spite of the different
densities of the oceans and continents.
   A second paper by the same author *, in reply to another
criticism of his conclusions as to the existence of a level of
no strain at a small depth below the earth's surface, calls for
a few observations.
   It is certainly a gain to have elicited that, by Mr. Fisher
at least, " no claim is made that such a change in condition
exists at that depth in the actual earth." I thought that a
level of no strain had been " discovered," and that its actual
position in the earth was " proved " to be at so slight a depth
as to show that the surface-features had been produced by
some other cause than contraction, notwithstanding its
presence.
   Somehow or other, however, my two objections have got
mixed. The a priori objection is that in any cooling globe
such a level in such a position is extremely unlikely ; and the
a posteriori objection is that " in that case the surface-features
would not have resembled .... those that we see," which is
thus admitted by Mr. Fisher. That this objection does not
simply involve a pelitio principii may be seen from the fact
that the compression at the poles is neglected in the investi
gation, and this would make a difference two or three times
as great as the supposed depth of the level of no strain.
   But, as Mr. Fisher says, the primary objection is to the
method, and I am much obliged to him, and I think others will
be also, for calling attention to the investigation of the ques
tion by Prof. R. S. Woodward, which is an admirable piece
of work, though I do not see that it helps Mr. Fisher much.
Prof. Woodward distinguishes between " free cooling," which
is considered by Lord Kelvin and Mr. Fisher, and "con
ditioned cooling," which was dealt with by Poisson, Fourier,
and Riemann, and which is the actual state of affairs with
regard to the earth ; and he gives this curious reason for
assuming that the former may be adopted instead of the
latter, that " defects in the best data at present attainable,
and probable inaccuracies in our fundamental assumption,
render the results uncertain even in the first place of decimals."
In other words, when applied to the actual earth, both suppo
sitions must give such loose approximations that it matters
little which is taken. How, then, can wo hope to get results
of any value when we deal with such small quantities as a
mile or two in a spheroidal earth ?
   But, more than this, it seems to me that as soon as
                      « Phil. Mag. July 1894.

                 " Densities in the Earth's Crust."          417
Mr. Fisher leaves his guide his equations become wrong.
The formula given by Prof. Woodward for the temperature
u becomes indeterminate when we make x=r, i.e. when
we seek to know the temperature at the centre, as the expres
sion in brackets becomes zero ; and to this there is no objec
tion. But when Mr. Fisher takes only the first two terms
and differentiates, he gets
                     dt       s/^r—xttsJiKt
    If in this we put x—r, and r is not infinite, then -j-
becomes infinite—that is, the rate of cooling at the centre is
infinite—while in reality it must be quite small. In like
 manner -=- also becomes infinite, i. e. the temperature at the
centre is infinitely greater than elsewhere. As Mr. Fisher's
 results depend on the values of these differential coefficients,
it does not seem possible that they can be correct.
    If the mathematics is to teach us anything we must keep
the meaning of our equations well in mind throughout. As
 I have shown, each term of the series which satisfies the
fundamental equation
                           d(zu) _ eP(2w)
                           ~~dT~K~dlr
gives the cooling greatest at the centre, and the sum of a
number of maxima must itself be a maximum. Hence, if
 we do not discriminate in some way, it would follow that
 throughout the whole cooling from i = 0 to t = <x> the cooling
 is greatest at the centre ; whereas we know very well that
at the beginning the cooling will be greatest at the surface.
 This must be accounted for in some way, whether my ex
 planation of it be correct or not ; in fact, in the cooling of
 every body there must be two stages—the first, a temporary
 one, when the exterior cooling is most rapid, and the second,
 one which lasts till all the heat is lost, during which time
 the surface has so little heat to lose that the centre cools
 quickest ; and the question is whether the earth has now, and,
 if so, when it, entered on this second stage.
    Only when the temperature condition of the earth is settled
can we enter into the question of its results as regards con
traction and a level of no strain. There appears to me to be
an error also in Mr. Fisher's investigation of this point, as
he deals with the circumference of the earth at the level he
discusses rather than with the splierical area ; but as we do

not really reach this point, I have not entered into that
question, nor do I desire to do so.
    It does not appear, therefore, that the mathematical in
vestigation prevents us in any way from taking a general
view of the matter under the light of the positive teachings
of geology. We know that a cooling body must contract,
and that it will not contract equally throughout ; we know
 that the surface-features demonstrate a great amount of con
 traction, and whether other causes of contraction have operated
 or not, we are at liberty to look on the cooling as one of
 the most potent ; and geological observations must teach us
 Iiow far and in what manner such contractions have been
 effected.
        XLIX. Of the "Electron," or Atom of Electricity.
            To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
       Gkntlemkn,
 PKOFESSOR EBERT, in his paper on the Heat of
          Dissociation in Last month's (September) Phil. Mag.,
 says on p. 332 :—" Von Helmholtz, on the basis of Faraday's
 Law of Electrolysis, was the first to show in the case of
 electrolytes that each valency must be considered charged
 with a minimum quantity of electricity, the 'valency-charge,'
 which like an electrical atom is no longer divisible."
     Now I had already twice pointed out this remarkable fact :
 first, at the Belfast meeting of the British Association in
 August 1874, in a paper " On the Physical Units of Nature,"
 in which I called attention to this minimum quantity of
  electricity as one of three * physical units, the absolute
 amounts of which are furnished to us by Nature, and which
  may be made the basis of a complete body of systematic
  units in which there shall be nothing arbitrary. This same
  paper was again read before the Royal Dublin Society on
  the lGth of February, 1881, and is printed both in the Pro
  ceedings of that meeting and in the Phil. Mag. of the
 following May.
     • The two other units being (1) the "Maxwell" of velocity, that
  velocity which connects electrostatic with electromagnetic units in a
  medium of which tho inductive capacity is unity, and which, under the
  electromagnetic theory of light, is also the maximum velocity of light ;
  and (2) the " Newton " of gravitation, that coefficient of universal gravi
  tation of the amount of which Professor Boys has lately made so accurate
  a determination.

    Professor Helmholtz's announcement was made in his
 Faraday Lecture delivered on the 5th of April, 1881, subse
quent to both the announcements I had made.                      See the

    (Readers of my paper are requested to bear in mind that it
was written so long ago that the Ampere was still understood
to mean the electromagnetic unit quantity of electricity of
the Ohm series. The term is now always applied to the unit
current. Moreover the paper, having been written before
( !.G.S. units came into use, employs those which had been at
an earlier date adopted by the Committee of the British
Association on Electrical Standards, viz. the G.M.S., or gram-
metre-second system.)
   In this paper an estimate was made of the actual amount
of this most remarkable fundamental unit of electricity, for
which I have since ventured to suggest the name electron.
According to this determination the electron =a twentiethet
(that is 10-20) of the quantity of electricity which was at
that time called the ampere, viz. : the quantity of electricity
which passes each second in a current of one ampere, using
this term here in its modern acceptation. This quantity of
electricity is the same as three eleventhets (3x 10" ") of the
C.G.S. electrostatic unit of quantity.

420        Of the " Electron," or Atom of Electricity.
   That determination was made twenty years ago, and is
founded on the estimate I had previously announced in 1867
of the number of molecules present in a gas, viz.: 1018 in
each cubic millimetre of a gas at standard temperature and
pressure (see Phil. Mag. for August 1868, vol. xxxvi.
   An estimate of this same remarkable unit of electricity
was made in 1891 by Professor Bicharz, as quoted by Pro
fessor Ebert (see p. 335 of the September number of the
Phil. Mag.). His determination makes the electron = 12'9
eleventhets (12-9 x 10-11) of the C.G.S. electrostatic unit.
This appears to be in sufficiently satisfactory agreement with
my previous determination, having regard to the amounts of
the probable errors of some of the data.
   Finally, in 1891 (see Transactions of the Royal Dublin
Society, vol. iv. p. 583), I called attention to the fact, which
Professor Ebert appears also to have noticed in 1893 (see
footnote on p. 335 of the September number of the Phil.
Mag.), that the motions going on within each molecule or
chemical atom cause these electrons to be waved about in the
luminiferous aether, and that in this constrained motion of
the electrons the distinctive spectrum of each kind of gas
seems to originate : since lines in the spectrum will be fur
nished by each term of the Fourier's series which represents
the special motion of each electron (see Transactions of the
Royal Dublin Society, vol. iv. 1891, p. 585). In fact the
only other conceivable source of these spectra is excluded,
viz., Hertzian undulations consequent upon electric discharges
within or between the molecules. This is because these
undulations, if they exist, must consist of waves of far too
high frequency to produce lines that can be visible, or even
that could bo situated within any part of the spectrum that
has been reached by photography—a circumstance to which
my attention was called by Professor FitzGerald. They
cannot, therefore, be the cause of any part of the known
spectra of gases.

      1. ' Mesozoic Rocks and Crystalline Schists in the Lepontine
Alps.' By T. G. Bonncy, D.Sc, LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S., Professor of
Geology in University College, Lordon, and Fellow of St. John's
College, Cambridge.
    The author described the results of an examination of the infold
of Jurassic rock in the Urscrenthal, undertaken in the hope of
finding some definite evidence as to the relations of the marble,
exposed near the old church at -Altkirche, and the adjacent Ji'rassic
rocks. Good sections are few and far between ; for the comparatively
perishable nature of the rock causes it usually to be masked by
debris and turf.
   The easternmost of the sections described occurs high up on the
slopes north of the Obcralp road. Read off from the northern side
it exhibits (1) gneiss, (2) phyllites with bands of subcrystalline
limestone, etc. — Jurassic, (3) a little rauchwacke, (4) ' sericitic ' gneiss.
The next section (about 250 feet above the St. Gothard road at
Altkirchc) gives (1) gneiss, (2) covered ground, (3) slabby marble,
(4) phyllite, (5) thicker mass of slabby marble, (G) phyllite, etc.,
(7) ' sericitic' gneiss. The third section (just abovo the church)
runs thus, using numbers to correspond with the last:— (1) gneiss,
(4) phyllite, (5) slabby marble, (C) phyllite, etc., (7) 'sericitic'
gneiss. It must be remembered that on the slopes of the Oberalp
farther south, between the • sericitic ' gneiss and the ' Hospenthal
Schists,' another dark phyllite is found, generally considered by the
Swiss geologists to bo Carboniforous. The marble in the third section
is in places distinctly banded with white mica, and passes on the
northern side into fairly normal mica-schist and quartzose schist.
The fourth section, about a mile away, on the left bank of the
Rouss valley, gives a practically continuous section in phyllite and
dark limestone, without any marble. In the fifth section, rather
more than a mile farther, if any marble is present, it is very thiu and
shattered. At Realp, about 5J miles farther, the next good soction
is obtained. Here the rocks go in the following order (from the
northern side):—(1) gneiss; (2) phyllite and limestone ; (3) sub-
crystalline limestone, looking very crushed; (4) the marble; (5)
phyllite, etc. ; (6) Hospenthal Schists. The last group of sections
occurs near the Furka Pass. In the first, crossed by the high road,
there is no marble, but a little rauchwacke on the southern side.
The next one, on the slopes below the pasB, seems to show two masses
of the marble parted by a subcrystalline limestone like that at
Realp, with phyllite above and below. Of the two masses of marble

 the southern one can he traced right across the pass, hut the extent
 of the other is not so clear.
    Examination of the marble mentioned above shows in all cases
 that it has been considerab'y modified by pressure since it became a
 crystalline rock. The author discusses the evidence of these sections,
 and maintains that the hypothesis that the marble is an older rock
 intercalated by thrust-faulting among Jurassic strata leads to fewer
 difficulties than to consider it as belonging to the same system.
    In the latter part of the paper the results of a re-examination of
 the ravine-section in the Val Canaria, and of somo studies of the
 south side of the Val Bedretto are described, which, as the author
 maintains, confirm the view already expressed by him, viz., that
the schists with black garnets, mica, kyanite, dolomite, and calcite
(the last sometimes becoming marbles) are not altered Jurassic rocks
 but are much older.
    2. ' Notes on some Trachytes, Metamorphosed Tuffs, and other
 Rocks of Igneous Origin, on the Western Flank of Dartmoor.' By
 Lieutenant-General C. A. McMahon, F.G.S.
    In this paper tho author notices the occurrence of felsite and
 trachyte at ^ourton Tor ; of rhyolite and of aluminous serpentine
at Was Tor ; and of a do'lerite at Brent Tor in the exact situation
indicated by Mr. Rutley as the probable position of the throat of
the Brent Tor volcano.
    The author describes cxtensivo beds of tuffs at Sourton Tor and
Meldon, the matrix of which has been converted, by contact-meta-
morphism, into what closely resembles the base of a rhyolite, and
which, in extreme cases, exhibits fluxion-structure, or a structure
closely resembling it. The fragments included in this base are so
numerous that six or seven different species of lavas may be seen
in a single slide ; this fact, and a consideration of the extensive
area over which theso beds extend, lead the author to believe
that these beds are metamorphosed tuffs and not tufaceous lavas.
    He then describes somo beds on the flank of Cock's Tor, which
give evidence on their weathered surface of an original lami
nated structure by exhibiting a corded appearance like corduroy
cloth. These beds are composed of colourless augite, set in a base
which in ordinary light looks like a structureless glass, but which
between crossed uicols is seen to be an obscurely crystalline felspar.
   The author compares these rocks with that portion of the Lizard
hornblende-schists for which a tufaceous origin was proposed by-
Do la Bechc and other writers, including Prof. Bonney and himself.
He shows that the Lizard schists and the Cock's Tor rocks agree in
specific gravity and in somo other characteristics ; and he concludes
that at Cock's Tor the first stage in the conversion by contact-
action of beds of fine volcanic ash into hornblende-schist had been
completed, and the final stage, due to aqueous agencies, had just
begun.
   The paper concludes with some remarks on the relationship of
the epidiorites to the rocks of volcanic origin.

   1. 'Further Notes on some Sections on the New Railway from
Romford to Upminater, and on tho Relations of the Thames Valley
Beds to the Boulder Clay.' By T. V. Holmes, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author alludes to his discovery of Boulder Clay on this new
railway at Homcliurch (dealt with in a previous paper, Q. J. G. 8.
Aug. 1892), and describes the finding of more Boulder Clay close to
Romford during the deepening and widening of a cutting there.
The Boulder Clay was on precisely the same level as that at Horn-
church, a mile and a half to the south-east, and, like it, was covered
by gravel belonging to the highest, and presumably oldest, terrace
of the Thames Valley system. A portion of the silted-up channel
of an ancient stroam-course was also found in this Romford cutting.
Its relations to the Boulder Clay could not be seen, as .they were
not in contact, but they were alike covered by the oldest gravol
belonging to the Thames Valley system. The author discusses the
 probable direction of the flow of this stream-course, and the way in
 which it was superseded by the ancient Thames. After noticing
 certain points brought forward during the discussion on his former
 paper, he concludes with a criticism on the views to which Dr.
 Hicks inclines in his paper on the Sections in and near Endsleigh
 Street (Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xlviii. 1892) as regards tie age
 of those beds, asserting that they are, in all probability, simply River
 Drift of the Thames Valley system, and consequently post-Glacial,
 in tho sense of being later in date than the Boulder Clay of Essex
 and Middlesex.

    The section described in this paper was exposed during the con
  struction of an effluent from the Twickenham sewage-works to the
  Thames. Its length was about one mile.
     The beds exposed were: —(1) Coa.se reddish-yellow gravels,
  coloured blue below, lying on an eroded surface of (2) Dark blue
  loam, varying in thickness, the greatest thickness seen being 3 feet,
  at a place where the bottom was not reached ; (3) Dark sand ;
  (4) Coarse ballast-gravel ; (5) London Clay.
     Tho loam (which is quite a local deposit) yielded 8 species
  of mollusca and 14 species of plants, all still living in the neigh
  bourhood. A number of mammalian bones referable to 7 species
  were lying just on the surface of the loam. Amongst the forms
  were bison and reindeer.
     The authors consider that the loam was deposited in a small lake,
  and they allude to similarities between it and a deposit described
  by Dr. Hicks as occurring in the Endsleigh Street excavations.

two ends of the magnet an induction current which cannot pos
sibly be due to a cutting of the rotating lines of force in the short
fixed spring contacts. The current is easily explained if we adopt
the view of Faraday, which, however, he afterwards abandoned,
that the rotating magnet cuts its own fixed lines of force, and
thus has an electromotive action.— Wiener Berichte, July 12,

        ON THE CIRCULAR MAGNETIZATION OF IRON WIRES.
                   BY PROF. DR. ION. KXEMENCIC.
    The author investigated, in wires of soft and hard iron and of
Bessemer steel, the extra currents which are formed on passing a
current owing to circular magnetization. From the extra currents
the susceptibility in a circular direction may be calculated by a
formula of Kirchhoff. The susceptibility in an axial direction for
different field-strengths was determined. The experiments showed
that qualitatively the course of the susceptibility in both directions
is pretty much the same. Quantitatively, however, the following
difference is to be observed. With soft-annealed iron the sus
ceptibility about the axis is less than in the direction of the ax's.
If the iron wire is hardened by a stress, the susceptibility in a
longitudinal direction diminishes more rapidly than in the circular,
and the behaviour observed for soft iron may even be reversed.
    Simultaneous experiments on remanent magnetism gave greater
values for this with circular than with axial magnetization, especially
in hard iron and steel. Repeated demagnetization with greater
field-strengths increases the susceptibility for weaker fields, even
with circular magnetization.— Wiener Berichte, July 5, 1894.

         LII. Wave-Lengths of Electricity on Iron Wires.
                  By Charles E. St. John, A.M.*
                                [Plate XII.]
 THE question whether the magnetic properties of iron are
        called into play under extremely rapid alternations of
 the magnetizing forces is an interesting one, and has received
 various answers.
    Hertz found negative results when he replaced one side of
 a rectangular copper resonator f by an equal iron wire ; and
 in a later paper, on the " Finite Velocity of Electromagnetic
 Action"|, when he compares the rate of propagation along
copper and iron wires, he concludes " that the rate of propa
gation in all wires is the same, and wo are justified in speaking
of it as a definite velocity; Even iron wires are no' exception
to this general rule ; hence the magnetic properties of the iron
are not called into play by such rapid disturbances'^.
    Dr. Oliver J. Lodge attacked the question by means of his
experiment on the alternate path. In his ' Lightning Con
ductors and Lightning Guards ' (1892), he remarks :—" But
everyone will say—and I should have said before trying—
surely iron has more self-induction than copper. A current

426              Mr. C. E. St. John on Wave-lengths
going through iron has to magnetize it in concentric cylinders,
and this takes time. But experiment declares against this
view for the case of leyden-jar discharges."
    Prof. John Trowbridge has shown* that the magnetic
character of iron wires exercises an important influence upon
the decay of electrical oscillations of high frequency, and that
currents of such frequency as occur in leyden-jar discharges
magnetize the iron. The spark in geometrically similar
oscillating circuits of copper and iron was photographed by
means of a revolving mirror, and the number of oscillations
on the negatives compared.
    Prof. J. J. Thomson has shown t that the presence of iron
can affect the rapidly oscillating electric discharges through
a rarefied gas by absorbing the energy of the discharges.
    In a paper upon the " Absorption Power of Metals for the
Energy of Electric Waves,"}: V. Bjerknes has also given
results that prove the great damping power of magnetic
metals upon electric oscillations of very high frequency
(100,000,000 double oscillations per second).
    If the damping power of iron is due to the fact that its
magnetic properties are brought into play under such rapidly
alternating forces, it still remains an interesting question
whether the self-induction of an iron circuit is measurably
greater than that of a similar copper circuit, and whether the
wave-length remains constant for oscillations of the same
period.
    In the determinations of the wave-length due to tho
Hertzian vibrator, the arrangement originated by Hertz §,
and modified by Lecher |l and by Sarasin and De La RiveU,
has been very generally employed. In this arrangement
secondary disks were placed face to face with the plates of
the vibrator and near to them, to each secondary disk a long
wire was attached, and these wires carried through the air
parallel to each other, with, sometimes, an additional disk on
the free ends.
    With such an arrangement no exact adjustment of the
length of the secondary circuit was required in order to excite
powerful oscillations in it, for the direct electrostatic induction

between the plates of the secondary and the disks on the
ends of the primary wires was so great that vigorous oscil
lations were produced along the secondary wires whatever
their length might be, and several systems of waves could
bo detected which seemed to give experimental grounds for
believing that the wave- system sent out from the Hertzian
 vibrator was very complex.
   The capacity of the vibrator is increased by the presence of
these secondary disks so neat to the vibrator-plates, so that
the wave-length found under these conditions is not that
due to the simple Hertzian vibrator but that duo to a very
complex oscillating system with somewhat obscure internal
reactions. Especially is this true when the wires are bridged
as in the Lecher arrangement. The latter calls attention to the
change in the sound of the primary spark when the secondary
wires are bridged by a conductor. There is a very marked
difference in the spark when the secondary circuit is removed
entirely : the spark then loses much in body and explosive
character. The secondary circuit under these conditions
exerts apparently a strong reaction upon the primary.
   It seemed desirable to devise some form of secondary
depending more directly upon the principle of electrical
resonance, the use of which would not increase the capacity
of the vibrator, and whose reaction upon it would be a
minimum. This was done by omitting the secondary disks
 and using simply a long wire as shown in fig. 1.

which is carefully adjusted to resonance before any other
measurements are made.
    For determining the occurrence of resonance and for ex
ploring the wires to obtain the wave form, the bolometer as
described by Paalzow and Rubens * was used in connexion
with Eubens's f adaptation of it. The exploring terminals of
the bolometer are shown at P, fig. 2. They consist of two
                                 Fig. 2.
capillary glass tubes set in a frame of wood ; the tubes slide
over the wires to be explored, and around each tube is
wrapped, by a single turn, one of the lead wires to the
bolometer. Electric oscillations in the secondary circuit
cause inductively alternating currents along the lead wires
through one arm of a balanced Wheatstone bridge, which
forms the bolometer. This arm of the bridge is made of fine
iron wire, and so arranged that the bridge current and these
oscillating currents traverse it without affecting each other.
The bridge is thrown out of balance by the increase of resist
ance caused by the beat generated from the alternating
currents, and a corresponding throw of the galvanometer is
produced.
    To adjust the circuit to resonance the exploring terminals
were placed at P S (fig. 1). The induction-coil was put in
action, and the reading of the bolometer taken for this length
of wire. A few centimetres of wire were cut off and the reading
again taken- This operation was repeated until a maximum

point was passed. The wires were renewed, and the operation
repeated again and again. A sharp and unmistakable maxi
mum was found when P Q was 859 centim. long. (fig. 3). The
effect fell off rapidly either when the wires were lengthened or
shortened from this point. The result is shown graphically in
fig. 2 (PI. XII.), where distances from Q are used as abscissas
and deflexions of the galvanometer as ordinates. When the

circuit is thus arranged, there is little effect produced upon it
by the vibrator unless it is near the point of resonance. The
period of the vibrator is the controlling factor, and the in
fluence of the secondary circuit is greatly reduced.
   To determine the character of the vibration along the wire,
the lengths Q P and R S (fig. 1) were fixed at 859 centim.,
the exploring terminals were moved along the rectangle, and
the bolometer-readings taken for each position of the explor
ing terminals. The graphic representation of the results is
given in fig. 1 of PI. XII., where, as in all the curves, the
abscissas are the length of the sides of the rectangle and the
ordinates the bolometer-readings. The character of the curvo
indicates a simple form of vibration. The total length of the
wire is equivalent to 7 half wave-lengths. The minimum
points occur at nearly equal intervals, and the distance from
the minimum at 748 centim. to the centre 0 (fig. 1) of
the side Q R may be taken as 3 half wave-lengths. This
furnishes a ready means of calculating the half wave-length.

 430          Mr..C. E. St. John on Wave-lengths
    QR=30centim. 748+15 = 763 centim. 763+3=254-3
 centim. =a half wave-length. The distance from this minimum
 to the end of the wire P should be a fourth wave-length of
 127"15 centim. The actual distance is 859 — 748=111 centim.,
 bo that the correction for the free end of the wire is abont
 16 centim.
    To adjust the length of the wire under this arrangement was
 a work of considerable difficulty, but the possibility of using
 a single-wire circuit free from disturbing capacities over
 balanced much inconvenience. To remove some of this,
 the ends P and S were wound upon wooden bobbins, so that
 shortening and lengthening could be produced without
 cutting the wire. This was a marked gain in convenience ;
 but the changing size and form of the coils, as the wire
 was shortened or lengthened, altered the capacity at the end
 slightly and somewhat irregularly. This led to the adoption
 of the arrangement shown in fig. 2.
    The secondary circuit consists of the rectangle K L M N
 with the side L N open; the lengths of the sides K L and M N
can be varied between 15 centim. and 1000 centim. The
 ends are really formed by the small copper boxes L and N.
 These were 10 centim. square and 4 centim. thick, and
 mounted upon the wooden bar E by insulating supports.
 Within the boxes were wooden bobbins fixed on a hard rubber
axle, and each capable of holding 10 metres of the largest
wire experimented upon. In the front of each box was a
 small opening for the passage of the wire, but, to insure a
firm contact between the wire and the boxes, a brass block
was soldered on the inner side of the front and a binding
screw passed in from the side of the box. The bar E was
fastened to a wooden support resting upon a car which ran
on a wooden track extending the entire length of the room.
The car carried a brake so that the wires could be drawn taut,
and the wooden screw held the axle from turning. With this
arrangement the length of the wire could be varied at pleasure
while the end capacities remained constant.
   The end capacities are not a desirable feature, for their own
sake, since they destroy the perfect simplicity of the plain
rectangular circuit, and seem to detract somewhat from the
sharpness of the maxima ; but the gain in convenience and
the possibility of obtaining a large number of observations
whose average values can be used may overbalance these
considerations.
   For making and breaking the current through the induction-
coil, an interrupter which would work with certainty and

                 of Electricity on Iron Wires.              431
regularity was much needed. With the assistance of the
mechanician of the laboratory I devised an interruptor which
gave very satisfactory results.
   A small electric motor M (fig. 4) was used to produce the
necessary motion. This was actuated by the current from two
storage-cells, and ran at a fairly constant speed. The armature
of the motor was in three sections, and was free from dead
points, giving it the great advantage for the present purpose
that it could be set in action simply by closing the circuit,
making it possible to control it from the observer's station.
                         Fig. 4. i Scale.
The motor was geared to the two-crank shaft K by means of
a wheel and pinion. The speed of the shaft K was about 750
revolutions per minute, so that about 25 breaks were made
per second. The plunging-rods were thinned at 0 so that

432          Mr. C. E. St. John on Wave-lenglhs
they were flexible and gave the required freedom of motion.
They ran through the bed-plate and the brass bar below, which
served as guides. The plunging-rods carried bind-screws by
which the flexible coils leading the current from the brass
post Q were attached. The lower ends of the plungers were of
No. 18 platinum wire. The brass bottoms of the glass mercury-
cups screwed into the brass arm N, which was adjustable by
means of the collar and binding-screw L along the pillar P.
At P was attached one pole of the battery actual ing the
coil and also one pole of the condenser in the base of the
coil, and at Q was attached one pole of the coil and the other
pole of the condenser. The cups were filled with mercury to
a height of 8 millim. and then filled with alcohol to within a
 few millimetres of the top. They usually required cleaning
only after several hours' use, when the surface of the mercury
consisted of very fine globules, and sharp breaks were not
made at each stroke of the plunger as was indicated by the
occasional failure of the spark. The character of the spark
depended much upon the exact height of the mercury -cups.
The adjustment was best made while the coil was in action by
raising or lowering the cups until the spark had a white body
and a peculiar snap.
   The plates of the Hertz vibrator were 40 centim. square
and fixed at 61 centim. apart. The spark-gap was supplied
with platinum-faced balls (3 centim. in diameter), which
worked with less trouble than the usual brass ones. The side
K M (fig. 2) of the secondar}- circuit was parallel to the con
ductor forming the vibrator plates, and fixed at 6 centim.
distance with its centre 0 opposite the spark-gap. The long
sides of the rectangular secondary lay in a horizontal plane,
and ran through the centre of the room at a height of 1*6
metre above the floor. They were held by their end supports
at 30 centim. apart. The induction-coil was 53 centim. long,
19 centim. in diameter, and was excited by the current from
five storage-cells. A sparking distance of about 6 millim.
was most effective in producing oscillations in the secondary
circuit.
   The following method was pursued in taking the observa
tions. The interruptor was set in action, the circuit closed
through the induction-coil, and an observation taken of the
first swing of the needle. The circuits were broken as soon
as the needle reached the end of its first swing, and the extent
of this excursion was the reading recorded. In accordance
with the experience of Paalzow and Rubens, it was found
that a steady deflexion could not be obtained, but this first

                 of Electricity on Iron Wires.               433
swing was, under like conditions, satisfactorily constant; and
a preliminary calibration of the instrument by passing currents
of known strength through it, showed that the square root of
the deflexion taken in this manner was in a constant ratio to
the current.
    The same copper wire (diameter 0-1201 centim.) that had
been used in the secondary without end capacities was used
for the rectangle KLMN in fig. 2. and, with the exploring
terminals close to L and N, the maximum point was found by
lengthening and shortening the wire. Bolometer-readings
were taken for each length used. To insure the constant
activity of the spark, a convenient length was taken as a point
of reference, and observations taken at this point before and
after a series of readings. If the spark had remained con
 stant, the readings were retained. A maximum point was
 found when KL was 818 centim. The sides were fixed at
 this length, and the form of the wave was obtained by sliding
 the exploring terminals along the wire, and taking bolometer
 observations for each position. The result is shown in fig. 3
 of PI. XII. The critical points were determined several
 times, and the steadiness of the spark insured by choosing, as
 before, a point of reference. The curve shows three minima
 at 240, 496, and 752 centim., starting from 0. These give
 half wave-lengths of 255, 256, and 256centim., with an average
 of 255*6 centim. The third minimum at 752 centim.. was
 determined with care, as it was to be used as a basis for calcu
 lating the half wave-length. An error in determining the
 position of this minimum would be divided by three, since
 the distance from 0 to this minimum was three half wave
 lengths. The total length of the circuit was seven half wave
 lengths, and it was the equivalent of one fourth of a wave
 length from the third minimum to the end. The actual
 distance to the end was 818 — 752 = 66 centim. 127*8—66 =
 61*8 centim. = the 'equivalent of the capacities in centimetres
 of wire.
    A comparison of the curve (fig. 1, PI. XII.) obtained from
 the plain wire circuit with the curve (fig. 3) obtained when
 capacities were fixed on the free ends, shows a quite satis
 factory agreement, which tends to create confidence in both
 methods. The half wave-length by the first is 254*3 centim.
 and by the second it is 255*6, values which differ by about
 one-half of 1 per cent. There is a marked difference, as
  was to be expected, in the form of the curve next the free
  ends. When end capacities were used, the .accumulation of
  charges seemed largely confined to them, out of reach of ih&

 434              Mr. C. E. St. John on Wave-lengths
 exploring terminals, while with the plain wire it seemed dis
tributed over a greater distance. In each case the effect of
the ends was to make the curve depart from the normal form
along the free wire.
    The theory of my investigations rests upon the principle of
electrical resonance. The sides of the rectangle KLMN
(fig. 2, p. 428) were shortened to a few centimetres in length,
so that it could bo safely assumed that the period of the
 secondary was considerably shorter than that of the vibrator.
The exploring terminals were kept at LN, and bolometer
observations taken for each small addition to the length of the
sides KLandMN. When best resonance was found with
the shortest length of the secondary circuit that gave a maxi
mum, it was assumed that the secondary had the same period
as the vibrator and that its equivalent length was a half wave
length, its actual length depending upon the effect due to the
free ends. The occurrenco of resonance is a very marked
phenomenon even with a vibrator that damps as rapidly as
the Hertzian. The accompanying table shows two series of
readings for the first maximum when an iron wire was
used : —

    There can bo no free motion of electricity at the ends of the
secondary circuit, but an accumulation alternately positive
and negative, and a resulting alternation of potential, the
phase at L being always opposite to the phase at N in case of
 resonance. Elsewhere along the circuit the electricity moves
with more freedom and less accumulation. The point 0 may
be called the electrical middle of the circuit, where the accu
 mulation is least and the movement most unrestrained. The
electromotive impulses from the vibrator act directly upon the
side K M, so that 0 remains a point of free motion or the
ventral segment of the wave, whilo L and N are always places
 of no electric movement, or the nodal points. The shortest
 circuit being a half wave-length, a second resonating circuit
ought to be found by increasing each side of the rectangle
by a half wave-length, making the circuit three half wave
 lengths long, and a third when the circuit is five half wave
 lengths, and so on*. It is known that the change of period

 produced by replacing copper by iron does not exceed 2
 per cent. The difference in length between a copper and an
 iron circuit of the same period would be very small with
 circuits a half wave-length long ; but this difference would
 be three times as great with circuits three half wave-lengths
 long, and there might be a cumulative difference that would
 become measurable by the use of circuits of still greater
 length. To examine this question, a copper wire (diameter
 0*1201 centim.) was used as the secondary circuit in fig. 2.
 The sides were taken 15 centim. long, and gradually lengthened
 to 875 centim., and bolometer-readings taken for each addition,
 the exploring terminals being always at the ends L and N.
 The result is shown graphically by the upper curve in fig. 4,
 PI. XII. The critical points ill the curve are the results
 of many separate determinations. The unsteadiness of the
 spark on the vibrator made the determinations somewhat
 laborious, though a single series of observations would locate
 a maximum very closely. After this had been done, the space
 of about a metre, including the maximum point, was worked
 over forward and back • the constancy of the spark was
 insured by choosing a convenient point of reference, as
 already described.
    An examination of the curve shows four maxima occurring
 when the sides of the rectangle were 45, 306, 562*5, and
 818 centim. long. The additions of wire for the successive
 maxima after the first were 261, 256*5, and 255*5. These
should be half wave-lengths. The last two agree well, but
 the first differs from the average of the last two (256 centim.)
 by 5 centim. The sides were fixed at 818 centim. and the
 wave-form, fig. 3 (PI. XII.), was obtained. From this the half
wave-length was found to be 255*6 centim., and the total
length of the circuit seven half wave-lengths. By fixing the
sides of the rectangle at 562*5 centim. and 306 centim., a
 similar investigation showed the circuits to be respectively
 5 and 3 half wave-lengths long.
   An explanation of the fact that the distance between the first
and second maxima was anomalously large may possibly bo
this: for the first maximum the sides of the rectangle wore but
45 centim. long, so that the effect of the closed end was rela
tively great and the maximum appeared earlier than it other
wise would, but when the rectangle was 300 centim. long,
the influence of the closed end became relatively small, and
the second and future maxima came in the normal position?.
Besides, in the first case the capacity was largely local, while
in the others it was mainly distributive. This same effect
appeared in every case, and seemed a constant phenomenon.

436            Mr. C. E. St. John on Wave-lengths
   The maximum I omitted from the above discussion was not
constantly present, but appeared when the primary spark was
especially active, and seems to belong to a circuit whose
period is to the period of the vibrator in the ratio of 5:3.
The sides of the rectangle were 127*5 centim. long and the
end capacities equivalent to 62 centim. of wire. The half
wave-length was 30 + 127-5 X 2 + 62 x 2 = 409 centim.
409 -7- 2556 = 1-6 nearly.
   This was the only indication of complexity in the vibration
of the Hertz vibrator; and it may be explained by supposing
that such a vibration is superposed upon the fundamental rate
of the oscillator, or that the oscillator when particularly active
can excite a circuit having such a ratio to itself. This last
seems the simpler, but it is difficult to see why a circuit of
the ratio 3 : 2 should not be excited as well. The maximum
I would indicate the presence of an undertone rather than an
overtone. This point requires more investigation than it
has been possible to give it, and will be left undecided for
the present.
   An annealed iron wire (diameter 0*1186 centim.) was put
in place of the copper, and the same series of observations
repeated. The results are shown in the lower curve of the
upper pair in fig. 4, PI. XII. The maxima EFGH
appear at 42*5, 301, 553, and 805 centim., in each case
before the corresponding maximum with the copper; and the
difference is seen to increase with the length of the circuits.
The successive additions were 258*5, 252, and 252 centim.,
the last two agreeing, but the first, as with the copper, is much
larger. With the sides of the rectangle fixed at 805 centim.,
the form of the wave was found as shown in fig. 2 of the
plate. The third minimum occurs at 740 centim. Calculated
as before, the half wave-length is 740 + 15 = 755. 755-H3
= 251*6 centim. This agrees well with the value 252 given
above by the last two additions, but differs by 4 centim. from
the value found when the copper was used.
   The same series of observations was repeated with a second
pair of finer wires (diameter of copper wire 0*07836 centim.,
diameter of iron wire 0*0785 centim.). The results are shown
in the lower pair of curves in fig. 4 of the plate. A com
parison of the curves shows the same general result, which
appears more distinctly from the following table :—

   The successive differences should be in the ratio of 1, 3, 5,
7, if the theory of the present investigation is correct. The
differences for the first two maxima are very small, so that
the experimental error in their determination would be
relatively large, and in the case of the fourth maximum the
damping was so great that it was difficult to fix the point
with certainty. The difference for the third maximum was
relatively large and the determination of the point was sharp.
Taking this difference as a point of reference, the calculated
and observed values are shown in the accompanying table :—

   The observed half wave-lengths for the four wires are :—
       f Copper (diameter 0-1201 centim.) 255*6 centim.

      \ Iron          (     „     0-07850 centim.) 246*8 centim.
   The wires in each pair were as near the same diameter as
could be found, the iron of the larger pair having slightly
the smaller diameter, but the copper being the smaller one in
the second case. In other respects the circuits compared were
as nearly identical as possible. The capacity per unit length
being the same for wires of the same diameter, the shortening

438            Mr. C. E. St. John on Wave-lengths
of the wave-length when iron displaced copper must be caused
by an increased self-induction due to the magnetic properties
of the iron. This implies that the magnetization of iron can
be reversed 115 million times per second. This reduced the
"time lag" of magnetization to very narrow limits, if forces
of such duration can magnetize the iron.
   In the case of extremely rapid oscillations Prof. J. J.
Thomson has shown (' Recent Researches in Electricity and
Magnetism,' sec. 295) that approximately yi=yjn,       2      where
-j^-jis the square of the frequency, and L' is the self-induction
for very rapid oscillations and C the capacity of the system.
It is easy from this to calculate an approximate value lor the
ratio between the self-induction per unit length of the iron
and copper circuits.
   Let L = the self-induction of the copper per unit length.

    Using as a basis of calculation the data from the third
maximum of the curves in fig. 4, PI. XII., the total length
of the copper circuit (diameter 0'1201 centim.) is : —
   The sides, 5625x2                            =1125 centim.

For the wire (diameter 0'1186 centim.) the     length is :—
   The sides, 553 x 2                           =1106 centim.

    Since the two circuits have the same frequency, the pro
ducts of the self-induction and capacity are equal.

   By the use of Lord Rayleigh's formula for inductance
under very rapid oscillations, it is easy now to calculate a
value for the permeability of the iron.
   Lord Rayleigh's formula is :—
where I is the total length of circuit, A a constant depending
only on the form of the circuit, or ZA is the inductance of a
similar copper circuit ; fi the permeability ; R the ohmic
resistance; p = 2irn, where n is the number of complete
oscillations per second.
   The value of p = 2-7rn=B6 x 10T.
R for iron wire (diam. Oil 86 centim.) = -1328 ohm per metre.

                 L + -0M L-L+t^/g,
                       •034 L=S/g.
   Calculating the value of L for a similar copper circuit I
units long, substituting the value in the above equation, and
solving for the three cases, we get :—
     For the iron wire, diameter 0"1 186 centim., /a=430,
                                    0-08847 „       /i-389,
         „         „         „      0-0785     „    /i=336.
   These values for the permeability all fall within a reasonable
limit, and have for an average /*=385. Those are the values
found for different specimens of wire made by the same
company, but the specimens were wound and unwound and
stretched many times during the series of observations.
Besides the shortening of the wave-length there is shown a
a decided increase in the damping, as has already been
observed by Trowbridge and Bjerknes. In fig. 4 (PL XII.)
the curves for iron fall below the corresponding ones for
copper, but owing to the change in the activity of the spark
no exact measurement was made. It was only observed that
the bolometer throws with the copper circuit were always

 greater than with the iron circuit of the same dimensions,
 when the spark was constant as far the eye and ear could
 judge.
    A value can readily he calculated for the damping factor

 formula for the resistance under very rapid oscillations is :—

    For the iron wire circuit (diameter 0-1186 centim.), '= 12,18;
 ^,=430 ; R= 1-67 x 109 ; P=36 x 107, whence R' = 403 x 108,
 L = 34xl08.
    The damping factor becomes e-«xl°6' approximately.
    The time required for the amplitude to full to one half its
 maximum value is t = 0 000000115 sec. On the basis of
 115 xlO6 alternations per second, the number of complete
 oscillations during this time is 6'5. A like calculation for the
 corresponding copper circuit gives about 60 times as many.
    The following table shows the results when copper circuits
 are compared in which wires of different diameters are used:—

   The range of wires suitable for the study of the phenomena
is rather limited. If the wires have a greater diameter than
1 milliiu. the difference between iron and copper is slight ;
while with wires less than 0-5 millim. in diameter the damp
ing is so great that long wires cannot be used, and advantage
cannot be taken of the cumulative effect.

       Periodicity of Electrical Waves on Iron Wires.        441
   I wish to express my great obligation to Prof. John Trow
bridge for the encouragement and suggestions that I have
received from him.
                              Conclusions.
   1. The self-induction of iron circuits is greater than that
of similar copper circuits under very rapid electric oscillations
(115 x 10e reversals per second). The change in self-induction
varies from 3*4 to 4*3 per cent, in the present investigation
and increases with decreasing diameters.
   2. The increase in self-induction produces greater damping,
and a shortening of the wave-length of 1*5 to 2 per cent.
   3. The permeability ft of annealed iron wire under this rate
of alternation is about 385.
   4. For oscillations of the same period, the wave-length
along parallel copper wires varies directly with the diameter
of the wires. (Range of wires used 0-03915 centim. to 0-1201
centim.) The maximum decrease observed is 5 per cent.

 LIIL Change of Period of Electrical Waves on Iron Wires.
                       By John Trowbridge*.
IN an investigation upon the damping of electrical waves
      on iron wires t, I endeavoured to detect a change of
periodicity as well as a damping of these waves. On account,
however, of the strong damping effect exerted by the magnetic
nature of the conductors, not a sufficient number of oscilla
tions could be set up in them to enable one to make conclusive
measurements. With more powerful means of experimenting
I returned to the subject, and I have detected a marked change
in the period of electrical waves which is produced by the
magnetic nature of the wire. At the same time Mr. Charles
E. St. John, working in the Jefferson Physical Laboratory,
by an entirely different method, has shown a change in wave
length on iron wire even for the very rapid period of the
Hertz vibrator. It will be remembered that Hertz believed
that iron wires behaved like copper wires when transmitting
very rapid electrical oscillations. Stefan % in a recent paper
gives an analysis of electrical oscillations, in which he proves
that rapid electrical waves on iron-wire circuits have the same
wave-length as those on copper circuits of the same geome-

trical form—the electrostatic capacity of the two circuits being
the same.
    With reference, therefore, both to the theory of electrical
waves and to the theories of magnetism, it seems important
to determine whether there is a lengthening of electrical waves
on iron wires.
    The method of investigation I employed was the same as
that which I have described in my paper on the damping of
electrical waves on iron wires. A leyden jar was discharged
through the given wires and the resulting spark, spread out
 by a revolving mirror, was photographed. The apparatus was
 also modified as I have described in my paper on " Electrical
 Resonance and Electrical Interference " *.
    It was important in this investigation to be able to compare
 the times of oscillation on the iron circuits and the copper
 circuits, and it seemed best to employ some method of imprint
 ing, so to speak, the time of a standard circuit on each photo
 graph, beside the photograph of the spark produced on either
 the iron circuit or the copper circuit ; for if the speed of the
 mirror changed, this change could be readily detected by the
 measurements of the oscillations of the standard time-spark.
 At the first thought it seemed a comparatively simple matter
 to arrange a suitable time circuit. In Hertz, ' Electric
  Waves ' f, appendix p. 271, it is stated : —
     " Let the primary coils of two induction-coils be placed in
 the same circuit, and let their spark-gaps be so adjusted as to
  be just on the point of sparking. Any cause which starts
 sparking in one of them will now make the other begin to
  spark as well ; and this quite independently of the mutual
  action of the light emitted by the two sparks, which, indeed,
  can easily be excluded."
     I therefore slipped two induction-coils of exactly the same
  self-induction on a long electromagnet, placing them sym
  metrically upon it. In the circuits of these induction-coils I
  placed the same amount of capacity. The spark-gap on the
  time circuit was made of the same length as that on a circuit
  of iron or copper wire which was under examination. I
  expected thus to obtain a photograph of the spark on my
  standard circuit at the same instant as that of the spark on the
  trial circuit of iron or copper. To my surprise, I found
  that the two induction-coils did not respond at the same in
  stant to the impulse in the electromagnet, when the spark-gaps
  were of the same length. It was necessary to make careful
  adjustment of these lengths and to modify the amount of

capacity of the circuits. This want of isochronism may have
been due to irregularities in the hard rubber condensers which
I employed. This, however, does not seem probable. The
condensers wore made of sheets of hard rubber one eighth of
an inch in thickness, covered with tinfoil, and the set of
condensers in the time circuit did not differ geometrically
appreciably from the set in the trial circuit. The electrical
disturbance on such a connected system is evidently a com
plicated one when its various reactions are considered, and the
statement given by Hertz, which I have quoted, must be
modified if there is any capacity in the circuits of the two
ltuhmkorf coils which have a common primary.
    The capacity in the time circuit was the same geometrically
as that in the circuit which included the wires under examin
ation. A suitable amount of self-induction was placed in the
time circuit. To ascertain whether the time circuit could be
relied upon, I made many measurements of the ratio of the
oscillations in the time circuit to those in the trial circuit,
which contained copper wires and the same geometrical
capacity. I had no reason to suspect a change in the self-
induction in my time circuit ; a change might occur, however,
in the capacit}- of the indiarubber condensers, due possibly to
hysteresis from electric strains and deformations. I could not
detect, however, such effects. I was dealing with single dis
charges, not repeated ones, such as are employed in obtaining
 wave-lengths along wires, and the photographs of such single
discharges showed no evidence of inconstancy in the capacity
of my condensers. If there was any effect of electrical hys
 teresis, it affected my time circuit and my trial circuit alike.
    As an example of the degree of accuracy which can be
 obtained in the measurement of the distances between the
 oscillations on the negative, the following table is given.
 The distances between different numbers of oscillations is
 given in the first column and the average length of the oscil

   Repeated measures between the same number of oscillations
give closer results ; but one is apt to set the measuring
instrument each time on the same points on the negative. It
is evident that measuring each time the space between a
different number of oscillations gives the faire.<t result. It is
surprising how close one can set the measuring instrument
upon the serrations of the negative.
   It will be noticed that the ratio between any two determina
tions of the time on the time circuit is the same as that
between the corresponding times on the trial circuits. When
iron wire of suitable diameter, however, was substituted for
copper wire of the same diameter and same geometrical form
in the trial circuits, the ratio of the determinations of time in
the time circuit and the ratio of the oscillations in the iron
circuit were no longer constant. This inconstancy 1 desire
to dwell upon as my strongest proof that the period of elec
trical oscillations on iron wires is not the same as that of
oscillations on copper wires of the same geometrical form.
   The arrangement of a suitable iron circuit gave me con
siderable trouble. The problem was to obtain a sufficient
length of iron wire to show any effect of change in periodicity,
and also to obtain a sufficient amount of self-induction, in
order that the distances between the oscillations on the photo
graph should be measurable. The strong damping effect of
iron did not permit of my using more than four or five metres
of wire. It was not a simple matter to arrange two circuits,
one of iron and one of copper, which would have exactly the
same geometrical form. After many trials I arranged my
trial circuit as follows :—
   A cylinder of very porous wood, 11'5 centim. in diameter,
 15 centim. long, was boiled in paraffin, and a spiral was cut
upon its surface. The turns of the spiral were 1 centim. apart.
 On this cylinder and in these spirals the wires under examina
tion were wound. After a determination had been made with
 a copper wire it was unwound from the cylinder and an iron
or steel wire was wound in the grooves occupied by the copper
 wire. Exact geometrical similarity was thus obtained with
 good insulation. Several hundred determinations were made
 with wires of different sizes. With iron wires larger than
 •0312 inch in diameter, no marked change in period could be
perceived. If a great number, however, of photographs were
 measured, an inconstancy of ratios was noticed which never
appeared when the copper circuits were compared. It seemed
as if at certain times the iron exerted a magnetic effect and
at other times failed to do this. The most marked changes
in period I obtained with iron wires of '0312 inch in diameter.

   When the ratios of A to B and of C to D are compared, it
will be seen that the time of electrical oscillations on an iron
circuit of the same geometrical form as a copper circuit is
longer than of those on the copper circuit.
   The rate of oscillation was not far from that which I
employed in my investigation on the damping effect of iron
wires. Since the inductance appears under the square root
in the formula f=7T \/LC, the changes in induction due to
the iron indicated by the above table may amount to from
five to ten per cent.
   Thus my results confirm those of Mr. Charles E. St. John,
who has shown by an entirely different method that the wave
lengths sent out by a Hertzian vibrator on iron wires differ
in length from those transmitted on copper wires of the same
geometrical form as the iron wires. His results are of even
more importance in the theory of magnetism, for they deal
with more rapid electrical oscillations than those which I
employed.

 LIV. On the Scattering of Light by Metallic Particles. By
    Richard Threlfall, Professor of Physics in the University
    of Sydney, N.S.WS
 THE problem of the scattering of light by small conducting
        particles is treated by Prof. J. J. Thomson in his very
 welcome ' Recent Researches in Electricity and Magnetism.
    It would of course be absurd for me to offer any remarks
 on the formidable analysis by means of which Prof. Thomson
 reaches his conclusions ; and therefore I shall limit myself to
 the consideration of §§ 367 and 378, in which similar con
 clusions are reached by different methods.
    One of the most striking results is as follows (' Recent
 Researches/ p. 44 Jt) : — " When non-polarized light falls upon
 a small non-conducting sphere, the scattered light will be
 completely polarized at any point in a plane through the
 centre of the sphere at right angles to the direction of the
 incident light. When the light is scattered by a conducting
 sphere, the points at which the light is completely polarized
 are on the surface of a cone whose axis is the direction of
 propagation of the incident light and whose semi-vertical
  angle is 120 degrees."
     Jt may well be considered questionable whether small
 metallic particles can be regarded as the conducting particles
  to which the investigation refers, especially if we bear in mind
  the apparently excessive transparency of thin metallic films.
  However, there is no difficulty in observing the scattering
 from fine metallic particles ; and what follows deals with
  some experiments I have made on the subject. To save time
  for any one who does not care to follow the detail of experi
  mental work, 1 will state at once that I have observed no
  great difference in the effects produced by particles of gold,
  copper, iron, silver, and gum mastic. The position of the
  azimuth of maximum polarization with gold particles (which
  are most easily observed) does not differ from the cor
  responding position when mastic is employed by more than a
  degree or two, if at all. The observations with metals other
  than gold were nothing like so satisfactory ; but so far as they
  go they confirm the results obtained with gold.
     As long ago as 1888 I examined the properties of a gold
  " sky." In order that the gold particles might be suspended
  in a non-conducting medium, 1 shook up some terebene with
  a bit of solid phosphorus and added a very small quantity of
  a solution of gold chloride in ether; in the course of a few
                     * Communicated bv the Author.

                  of Light by Metallic Particles.            447
hours, or days, the gold was thrown down as usual in particles
of extreme fineness. For the present purpose, however, there
is no advantage in using terebene, since any solution which is
transparent must be regarded as non-conducting for voltages
reversed with the frequency of light-waves. Accordingly
the gold deposits which I have examined have been formed
in water. When a very dilute solution of the double chloride
of gold and sodium—say, one centigram of the crystallized
salt per litre — is reduced by the addition of a solution of
phosphorus in some organic solvent, the solution is observed,
after a time varying from a few hours to several days or even
weeks, to become strongly coloured. The colour varies from
a clear pink with dilute solutions to an opaque purple when
the solutions are strong. A number of observations on these
precipitates and on their removal from suspension (for they
are too fine to subside of themselves) by moulds growing in
the liquids have been published by Prof. Liversidge (Australian
Association for the Advancement of Science, Report, 1890).
 I have to thank Prof. Liversidge for allowing me to examine
these solutions.
   There are certain preliminary questions which must be
dealt with. In the first place the precipitate formed is really
 gold,
    (1) Because in rather strong solutions of the chloride the
          precipitate forms a film on the surface which possesses
          the lustre of gold ;
    (2) Because when the solutions are strong enough to give
          a precipitate coarse enough to sink, or when the fine
          precipitates are carried down by the growth of mould,
          the presence of metallic gold can be rendered evident
          by burnishing.
    I have no formal proof that the precipitates consist of gold
 only ; but taking into consideration the number of expe
 riments made by Prof. Liversidge and the great variety
 of reducing solutions used by him, together with the constancy
 of the phenomena observed, there can be no doubt that the
 precipitate is practically pure gold. Of course, when the
 precipitates are large enough to examine there is no doubt
 about their nature, and we have no chemical reason for sup
 posing that the reaction will change in character by the mere
 influence of further dilution of the solutions.
    The colour of the solutions is certainly to be attributed to
 the presence of the precipitate ; for when the precipitate
 is removed by moulds the colour disappears. The colour,
 therefore, must be due to the fine particles ; but without
 careful examination it is difficult to believe that the whole

U8              Prof. Threlfall on the Scattering
effect is duo to scattering. This, however, appears to be most
probably the case, as the following experiments will show :—
    Three typical samples prepared by Prof. Liversidge were
examined. The first sample had been made up about two
months before I examined it. The quantity of gold was so
large that the precipitate had partly subsided ; and the
solution was so dark that it was practically opaque in thick
nesses of more than a few centimetres. The absorption
spectrum was observed with the help of a wedge-shaped
bottle. The absorption was chiefly in the green and greenish
blue. At about the limit of transparency practically all the
spectrum disappeared except the orange-red. The opacity
was such that no satisfactory observations could be made on
the scattered light.
    The second sample had a magnificent pink colour, very like
•a dilute solution of fluorescein, but of course without the
fluorescence of that substance. The colour was exceedingly
brilliant, and having only had experience of the colour pro
duced by precipitates of gums in water, for a long time
I imagined that some coloured substance had been formed.
This specimen was described by Prof. Liversidge (foe. cit.
p. 406). It was prepared in November 1889, and from the
description of its colour cannot have changed appreciably
since that date. The reducing substance was phosphorus in
chloroform, and a smell of chloroform was still marked. The
solution of gold chloride was of about the strength mentioned.
 The absorption spectrum was observed in a tube 69"3 centim.
long. The absorption was not nearly so sharp as in the case
 of, say, chlorophyll, but was wonderfully sharp for a " sky "
 colour. The absorption extended from the yellow-green to
the blue-green ; there also appeared to be a slight absorption
in the blue ; but it was very slight. The scattered light was
easily observed in this case, especially when a Nicol prism
was used in conjunction with the spectroscope. It was thus
discovered that the scattered light was practically green, and
of about the proper apparent intensity. A line was drawn on
a board so as to indicate a direction at right angles to the
direction of the incident light ; and another line was drawn
at 120 degrees to the same direction. By means of these
 lines the position for maximum polarization could be suffi
 ciently closely observed. There can be no question as to the
angle being much closer to 90°—even if it were not exactly
 90 , as the observation seemed to show—than to 120°. I
cannot say within what limits of angle the position was
perpendicular to the direction of the incident light.
    The third sample 1 examined had a full purple colour, and

                  of Light by Metallic Particles.            449
was made at the same time as the one last described. The
solution must have been of about the same strength, and the
reducing agent was phosphorus dissolved in carbon bisulphide.
The smell of that reagent had disappeared and been replaced
by that of sulphuretted hydrogen. Observations similar to
the last were made with the same general result, except that
the absorption was stronger and that it extended rather
further towards the red end of the spectrum. The scattered
light was again seen to correspond with the part of the
spectrum which was cut out in the last observation. The
angle of maximum polarization occupied its former position.
   A large number of similar experiments were made from
time to time, but they all gave the same general results.
   In order to avoid any risk of contaminating the gold with
organic matter derived from the solvent used for the phos
phorus, I shook up a bit of phosphorus with some distilled
water, and found that I could obtain a sufficient reduction of
the gold to enable me to be sure that the angle of maximum
polarization occupied its former normal position.
    1 also set up solutions of different strengths, and observed
 them from day to day as the process of reduction went on ;
but I never observed any change in the position of the
 maximum angle.
    Most of the observations on the direction of the position of
 maximum polarization were made on about a litre of the
 solution contained in a vessel of glass with plane sides ; occa
 sionally I used beakers, which did just as well.
    The source of light was an arc lamp, and when the particles
 were only few and far between lenses were employed to
 condense the beam. Some experiments were also made with
 initially polarized light, but without any difference being in
 any case detected, whether a gold or a mastic sky was used.
                      Metals other than Gold.
    1. Copper.—A solution of sulphate of copper was taken and
 diluted sufficiently with water that had been shaken up with
 phosphorus. Of course check experiments were made in this
 case, as in all others, to insure the absence of particles other
 than those desired. In many cases it was necessary to use
 platinum-distilled water, as ordinary once-distilled water con
 tains too many motes. A very faint sky was obtained with
 the copper, and this behaved just as did the gold sky. I
 believe that the sky did actually consist of copper, for the
 solutions were both free from motes before mixing, or rather
 they gave a much stronger sky when mixed than when separate.
    2. Silver.—The phosphorus- water was shaken with dilute
                                                                  S'

450              Prof. Threlfall on the Scattering
silver nitrate. In this case I did not succeed in satisfying
myself that chlorides were sufficiently eliminated. The sky,
whatever it was composed of, behaved just as before.
   3. Iron.—A properly reduced solution of ferrous ammonium
sulphate was obtained and mixed with phosphorus-water as
before. The solution was more or less preserved from oxida
tion by covering it with a layer of " alboleue " oil. I am not
sure that an appreciable increase of the sky took place on this
occasion by the action of the phosphorus : what sky there was
behaved as before.
    The above experiments were repeated, a piece of phosphorus
being left in the liquid ; but though the skies became rather
stronger, no differences could be detected. These experiments
suffer from the uncertainty that the skies might have been
formed by particles separated direct from the phosphorus.
    Assuming that Prof. Thomson's views are correct, these
experiments must, 1 think, be taken as showing that at all
events gold in particles fine enough to scatter light behaves
as an insulator. At all events, the phenomena are consistent
with the great transparency of gold-leaf.
    No difference was observed between the scattering of plane
waves, and the scattering from a pencil of rays converging
 from the condenser of the lantern.
    Returning to the gold solutions, I lave no hesitation in
 saying that they afford the simplest and most beautiful
 illustration of the colours produced by fine particles. It
 is worthy of note that the colours are so brilliant, even if we
allow for the manner in which the colour of the scattered
 light depends on the size of the particles.
    The apparent perfect transparency of the more dilute
solutions, when considered in connexion with the comparative
sharpness of the absorption spectrum, must indicate a uni
formity in the dimensions of the particles which is, so far as I
know, unique.
    Judging from the appearance of the spectrum only, espe
 cially in the case of the stronger solutions—i. e., those that
just do not settle by themselves—I think that perhaps an
 excellent light for photographic purposes might be obtained
 by using these skies as light-filters.
                       Supplementary Note.
    After concluding the above experiments it appeared to me
 that the only metal for which the evidence I had to offer was
satisfactory was gold. I therefore made the following expe
riments with the object of observing the action of a " sky "

                  of Light by Metallic Particles.              451
of platinum particles. Platinum is certainly one of the most
opaque, if not the most opaque metal ordinarily dealt with ;
and it seemed possible that very fine particles of platinum
might act as conductors even to electric disturbances reversed
with the frequency of blue light.
    A sky of platinum particles was easily produced as follows:—
A litre bottle with a wide neck was three quarters filled with
boiling distilled water, the water having hoiled for an hour
before being poured into tbe bottle. The rubber bung used
to close the bottle was pierced by three holes—one allowing
 the introduction of a thick glass tube carrying a sealed-in
 electrode and passing into the water ; another carried a
 second electrode of platinum reaching down to within about
 half an inch of the water surface ; the third carried a tube
 permitting communication to be made between the inside of
 the bottle and the water-pump. On placing the bung in
 position and working the pump, most of the air was rapidly
 sucked from the bottle, the water began to boil, and after a
 time the connexion was sealed-off. The bung and tubes were
 well waxed, and the bottle was left to cool down. Next day
 it was found that the water " hammered " in a satisfactory
  manner when the bottle was shaken. The electrode, owing
 to several causes, was now about 1£ centim. from the surface
 of the water. An induction-coil worked by a transformer was
  then caused to pass a current between the water surface and
  the free electrode, the current being regulated so that at a
  frequency of about 60 ~ it just failed to produce sufficient
  electrolysis to free gas. The electrode was white hot. The
  bottle was placed before an arc-lamp and studied by a Nicol
  prism, as previously described, while the coil was actually at
  work. It was noted that before the discharge began the water
  was nearly optically clean, and looked exactly like a check-
  sample of the boiled distilled water which had been preserved
  for the purpose of comparison. After about half an hour's
  discharge no appreciable increase in the scattered light could
  be detected ; but on shaking the bottle, small brightly-
  reflecting metallic scales became apparent. The discharge
  {iroduces considerable motion of the water-surface, and it
    lad been erroneously assumed that this would prevent the
   formation of a platinum film on the water surface. The hint
  was taken, however, and the bottle was shaken by hand for
  about two hours while the discharge was taking place, during
   the whole of which time the scattering of light by the water
   particles continually increased, and was finally fairly brilliant.
   At no time did the direction of maximum polarization appear
   to vary from the perpendicular tu the direction of propagation

452              Prof. Threlfall on the Scattering
of the light. The platinum ' sky behaved, in fact, in a quite
normal manner. The more carefully the directions of the
incident and observed light were adjusted to perpendicularity,
the more complete the extinction produced by rotating the
Nicol appeared to be. The fine particles remaining well sus
pended for a considerable time (at least a week), several
friends were good enough to examine the polarization phe
nomena for me, and all the observations agreed perfectly.
    Platinum particles therefore scatter light like ordinary non
conducting particles within the limits of accuracy of the
observations.
   I was anxious to try the effect of a sky of iron particles,
and made the following experiments and observations on this
matter.
   The apparatus used was similar to that described in the
case of platinum, except that " pure " iron electrodes were
formed by binding the iron wire sold as " pure for chemical
analysis round the sealed-in ends of the platinum wires.
Five or six layers of fine iron wire were bound round the
platinum wire, and connected then to the actual electrodes—
two short lengths of Swedish charcoal-iron carefully cleaned.
 Sparks were taken between the two electrodes, and were
 practically confined in their effects to the charcoal-iron. As
a medium for catching and supporting the fine iron-dust, I
first tried a nearly dry sample of glycerine, prepared by
heating the strongest commercial glycerine in the presence of
strong sulphuric acid under reduced pressure. After sparking
for some hours a sky was formed, but the heat of the discharge
 had been sufficient to obviously decompose some glycerine
 vapour, and consequently the sky might have been due
 to iron, oxide of iron, or carbon, or any mixture thereof. I
 therefore tried to find some more suitable substance than
glycerine. I wished to exclude oxygen, if possible, from the
medium employed, and yet have a substance which should
have only a small vapour-tension. After a good many trials
I settled on a vaseline'oil (?) known as "albocarbene oil."
The vapour-tension of this substance was at least 2 centim.
at 24° 0. even after heating and exposing in a vacuum several
times. Under the circumstances it hardly appeared worth
while to attempt to take up the oxygen it might hold by the
action of sodium, especially as I was not sure of the complete
action of the sodium ; while the certainty of its making the
oil dirty opened up the probability of other disadvantages.
The atmosphere employed was hydrogen disengaged from
zinc and hydrochloric acid in presence of chromous chloride ;
it was washed by solution of sodium hydrate, and finally dried

                 of Light by Metallic Particles.            453
over phosphorus pentoxide. The pressure was ahout two
inches of mercury. The sparking &c. was carried out as
before, and after about four hours' of sparking a fairly good
sk}r was visible in spite of the strong fluorescence of the oil.
On opening the bottle a decided smell of hydrocyanic acid was
noted (nitrogen was known to be present in small quantities),
and there were traces of decomposition on the sides of the
bottle. An attempt was made to concentrate the particles by
standing the bottles on the poles of a Jamin magnet, but no
concentration could be observed after twenty-four hours.
Considering the viscosity of the oil, this was not regarded as
of much weight. The oil was then poured through a filter
 made from Schleicher and Schull's special quality paper for
stopping fine particles. The paper was washed with kerosene,
fasolene, alcohol, and water, and was finally digested in dilute
   ydrochloric acid. The resultant liquid, on evaporation,
showed the presence of traces of iron in an unmistakable
manner. The filtered oil was not examined as to its scattering
 properties, owing to an accident.
    The light scattered from the supposed iron sky behaved in
 a perfectly normal manner, i. e. like all substances hitherto
examined. In this case it was found more convenient to use
 a beam of sunlight than the light from the arc-lamp ; obser
 vations are rendered difficult by the blue fluorescence of the
 oil. The question turns entirely on the point as to whether
 the scattering was produced by metallic iron or by its oxide.
 That the scattering was produced by one or the other I have
 no doubt ; for after filtering the oil I could discern a faint
 darkening of the filter-paper which disappeared by treatment
 with hydrochloric acid, and so disposes of the supposition that
 the particles w-ere carbon. The iron afterwards found was
 from the deposit and not originally in the acid or reagents, or
 in the filter-paper (for check-experiments were made). Some
 dust on the electrode appeared to be magnetic when tested
 by a magnetized sewing- needle, but the quantity that I
 could collect was too small to make tha-observation conclusive.
 Of course if I had been in a position to secure a sample of a
 definite hydrocarbon of small vapour-tension, the matter could
 easily have been determined ; but such a thing does not exist,
 to my knowledge, in Australia.
     As I desired further evidence I repeated the whole investi
 gation up to the sparking, but this time introduced a small
 plate of glass between the oil and the electrodes. After
  sparking as before for three hours (using the coil-contact and
  three gallon leyden jars with an air-gap) I could see no
  mirror, though obviously a good deal of oil-vapour had been

454               Prof. Threlfall on the Scattering
decomposed. (Professor Wright, of Yale, warned me in
1889 that iron mirrors are not easily made.) The experi
ment was perforce interrupted for three days, and on turning
on the coil on the fourth day a smart explosion resulted,
bringing the observations to a conclusion by scattering every
part of the apparatus, the writer having a rather lucky escape.
The electrodes were picked up and found to be perfectly clean
and bright. After consideration I decided not to pursue the
matter further, first because I am not quite sure of the
importance of an investigation of iron in the present state of
electromagnetic theory, and secondly because the investigation
can be easily made by anyone who has a suitable hydrocarbon,
whereas I can only hope to obtain inconclusive results with
the oils at my disposal.
    I will add a note on producing oxygen-free atmospheres.
 If hydrogen is employed the difficulty is to get rid of oxygen
 from the water and acid used to act upon the zinc. Several
 ways of absorbing small quantities of oxygen are known and
 dealt with in a paper by me, " On the Preparation of Pure
 Nitrogen and Attempts to Condense it," Phil. Mag. January
 1893.
    The most convenient way of obtaining large quantities of
 hydrogen free from oxygen is to half fill a very large flask
 with granulated zinc and keep this covered with a solution of
 chromous chloride—the " liquide brute " of Recount. Hydro
 chloric acid can be added fearlessly bjr means of an ordinary
 safety funnel; for any air carried down is instantly deprived
 of its oxygen by the blue liquid. If the flask be permanently
 sealed to a potash wash-bottle and drying-tubes, a means of
 procuring dry hydrogen wiih traces of nitrogen is instantly
 and continually available. The blue liquid does not last for
 ever, however, though if a little acid be added from time to
 time its life is sufficiently prolonged. Following Recount in
 the paper quoted, I recommended that the potassium dichro-
 mate should be finely ground in the chromous chloride
 preparation. 1 now find that if it is dissolved in the hydro
 chloric acid before the latter is added to the zinc, it does just
 as well and saves a good deal of trouble.
    To sum up :—
     1. The scattered light from gold and platinum particles
 behaves like light scattered from particles of gum mastic or
 milk so far as the polarization phenomena are concerned.
     2. The same remark applies to iron, or iron oxide, or

      Note on the preceding Paper by Prof. J. J. Thomson.
   I made, about two years ago, some rough experiments on
the polarization of light scattered by small particles of gold,
the results of which were in agreement with those of Professor
Threlfall. I regarded these experiments as confirming the
results of Maxwell and Wien, that the resistance of metals to
the very rapidly alternating currents which constitute light
is much greater than to steady currents.
    It is, moreover, difficult to make these experiments so as to
be a fair test of the theory, as it is only when the size of the
particles is within narrow limits that the theory would be
applicable, even supposing the resistance to be as low as for
steady currents. To scatter the light the diameters of the
{(articles must be small compared with the wave-length of
  ight, while the theory given in my ' Researches on Electricity
 and Magnetism ' requires that the depth to which the currents
 produced by the light penetrate the particle should be a small
 fraction of the radius of the particle. Now at a depth d below
 the surface of the sphere the intensity of the induced current
 varies as e~w, where k= {2irfip/<r}l, where /jl is the magnetic
 permeability, a the specific resistance of the metal, and 2ir/p
 the time of oscillation of the incident electrical vibration.
 Thus the currents at a depth l/k below the surface will only
 be 1/e of their value at the surface ; we may therefore take l/k
 as the measure of the thickness of the film filled by the currents.
 For gold (7 = 2100 for steady currents. fi= 1, and for the D line
 p = 2ir x 5-097 X 10u; thus l/k=3-2x 10~7. The wave-length
 of the D line is 5 89 x 10~5, about 170 times l/k. Thus, for
 the theory to be applicable, the diameter of the particles must
 be small compared with \ and large compared with l/k. As
 X is only 170 times l/k this makes the range for the dia
 meter very small. A more satisfactory test of the theory
 could be made with longer wave-lengths and larger particles ;
 for the thickness to which the currents descend varies as the
  square root of the wave-length, so that the ratio of the wave
  length to the thickness of the current-film increases as the
  wave-length increases.

 LV. On t/ie Self-induction and on the Gravity-Potential of a
                     Ring. By W. M. Hicks*.
THE self-induction of a finite ring has been considered by
         Professor Minchin in the March number of the Philo
sophical Magazine on the assumption that it is the flux
through a diaphragm composed of the aperture and half the
surface of the ring. In reading this paper it occurred to me
that the problem could more naturally be attacked by means
of Toroidal Functions. In considering it from this point of
view I was led to a conclusion which does not seem to have
been heretofore noticed.
    The expression for the self-induction of a thin circular ring
as given by Maxwell is 7rR(41og8R/r— 8), and for a ring of
finite size as given by Minchin is 7rR(41og 8R/r— 8) + terms
involving the radius (r) of the transverse section. In the
finite ring the current-density varies inversely as the distance
from the straight! axis. In Maxwell's wire the distribution
of current across the transverse section is considered uni
form, and it would therefore appear that his formula gives
the self-induction so far as it is independent of the thick
ness, and that this part is independent of the distribution of
current-density within the wire itself. Asa matter of fact,
however, the distribution of current-density has a deciding
effect on the value of the second term, and this however small
the section of the ring may be. The correct value of the self-
induction, neglecting powers of r/R, is 7rR(41og8R/r— 7).
The expression 7rR(4 log 8R/r — 8) gives the value of the flux
through the aperture only, which to this degree of approxi
mation is independent of the law of current-density. The
difference is due to the fact that although- the section across
the ring may be exceedingly small, yet the forces are cor
respondingly large, and the interaction of the different parts
of the current cannot be neglected even when the ring
is extremely thin and of large aperture. E. g. in a ring of
1 metre radius and I millim. thick the usually accepted
formula gives a value 3£ per cent, too small.
    In the present paper the question is treated by the method
usually employed in dealing with problems of electric potential
and fluid motion, but which, so far as I know, is new in its
application to electromagnetic and gravity potentials. The

        Self-induction and Gravity-Potential of a Ring.                457
functions which naturally come in are Toroidal Functions,
the properties of which are developed in two papers in the
Transactions of the Royal Society*. These papers are
referred to in the present pages as [T. F. i.] and [T. F. ii.].
   The special problems considered are :—-
   (1) The force-flux function and self-induction for a ring in
         which the current-density varies inversely as the dis
         tance from the straight axis. This is the case of
         current through a ring consisting of a single turn of
         round wire.
   (2) The same quantities when the current-density is con
         stant. This leads to the case of a uniformly wound
         coil of circular cross section.
   (3) The method is then exemplified by finding the gravity-
         potential of a finite ring—a problem which has been
         recently very fully considered by Mr. Dyson t-
   1. The force is symmetrical round the straight axis of the
ring. Take this axis for the axis of z and the origin at the
centre of the ring, and let p, z denote the cylindrical coordi
nates of any point. Further, let, R denote the radius of the
circular axis, r that of a cross section, and a that of the
critical circle in the curvilinear coordinates used in toroidal
functions —i. e. in the system of coaxal circles having Oz
for common radical axis and having one circle of the
system coinciding with the cross section. The length of a is
equal to the length of a tangent line from the centre to the
circle. It will be found convenient to express values later
in terms of R and the angle subtended at the centre by a
cross section : this angle will be denoted by a.
   The flux function yfr at a point P will be taken as denoting
the total flux up through a circle, radius P N (see figure).
It is the same as that through a diaphragm stretching from 0

At points where there is no current the right-hand side is of

   3. To find the force-flux we shall require two functions,
one (i/r') for space outside the ring, and the other (yjr) for
space inside. The conditions which they have to fulfil are as
follows :—•
   -vjr' must be finite at all points outside the ring, be zero at
 the point 0, and satisfy the equation
                     (Jiyjr' [ d^y      1 <ty_Q
                      dz2       dp*     p dp
 Using toroidal functions, these conditions are satisfied by

             and on the Gravity-Potential of a Ring.              459
yfr must be finite at all points inside the ring, and must satisfy
These conditions are satisfied by

 where w„ is the value of u corresponding to the boundary.
 These conditions will serve to find completely tjr and ¦* in
 all cases.
     In order to apply these last conditions it will be necessary
 to expand /in a series of cosines and sines of multiple angles.

This is the general solution for any case in terms of F.
   4. We proceed to apply the foregoing to special cases.
Consider, first, the case of a current flowing in a uniform
circular ring of any size. The parts of the current all flow in
circles, and the equipotential surfaces will be planes through
the straight axis. The lengths of conductor which a current
uses between two such surfaces will be proportional to the
arc between—i. e, to p. Hence, in order that each element
of current may produce equal fall of potential between the
two planes, the current-density must vary inversely as p, i. e.
a=b/p, where b is some constant. Let I denote the total
current ; then, integrating over a cross section, it will be
found that         l = ^b{R- */(R2-r4)}.
   Now             r=Rsina, a = Rcos«;                               (4)
whence                    I = 27r&R(l — cos a),

   Equation (1) now becomes

                      = _4^a* JELJL                  [T.F.i.3].

are now considering, it is necessary to particularize. Its
 value will differ for alternating currents ol different periods.
 The time-constant for a constant E.M.F. applied to the ring
 will not be the same as on the assumption here made as to
 distribution of current-density. In order to be definite we
 will find the coefficient for the energy on the assumption of
 steady current—in other words, the value of L in the expres
 sion \ LP. This will veiy approximately give the self-
 induction except for rapid alternations. The energy is

flux functions (and therefore forces) and self-induction of
large tores of any size may be calculated to any desired
degree of approximation directly from the formulae obtained.
When, however, the rings are of smaller cross section, and k
small, it is more convenient to have the formulae expressed
directly in terms of k.

   If / be a particular solution of this, and <f> denote the

attracting body the potential = f+fa, and at all points out
side = fa. Also fa and fa must be finite and continuous in
their respective regions, and at the surface of the body the
fa and fa and their first differential coefficients are continuous.
These conditions suffice to determine fa and fa.

a is constant, and

LVI. On the Energy of the Amperian Molecule. % A, P.
   Chattock, Professor of Physics, University College, Bristol,
   and F. B. Fawcett, Associate of University College, Bristol".
THE following experiments were undertaken for the pur
       pose of determining, if possible, whether the molecular
currents of Ampere are accompanied by motions of the mole
cules themselves. They were suggested during an attempt
by one of usf to express certain physical properties of solids
in terms of the ionic charges of their molecules.
   The theory put forward by Weber, that Amperian molecules
may be rotating charged carriers of electricity, lends itself at
first sight to the view that the molecules of all matter, whether
in the electrolytic form or not, carry upon them the charges
they possess when in the condition of ions. It is only neces
sary to suppose that the molecules of a magnetic substance
rotate with these charges in virtue of their neat motions, to
account for the permanence of their magnetic moments at
any given temperature.
   Upon this supposition, if a bar of iron is saturated in a
magnetic field, and this field is suddenly strengthened, the
effect upon the iron will be two-fold. There will be a sudden
decrease in the magnetic moments of the molecules corre
sponding to a decrease in their rates of rotation, and therefore
to a cooling of the iron as a whole ; and this will be followed
by a slow return to their original condition as the iron receives
heat from surrounding objects.
   The result of Ewing's work on iron subjected to intense
fields has been to show that no certain alteration in the value
of I (the magnetic moment per cub. centim. of the iron)
can be detected after saturation within the wide limits of field-
strength which he employed. Upon the present hypothesis
there should be no permanent alteration ; and even the tem
porary fall of I on the first application of the field would be
tar too small to detect ; its value being about 5 X 10-llI when
the magnetizing force is raised to 40,000 after saturation (see
below).
    But though the alteration of I is inappreciable, the accom
panying fall of temperature is not ; and we therefore decided
to look for it. Wo were, moreover, encouraged to make the
experiment by the publication of an interesting paper on the
subject of ionic charges and their consequences by Ur. F.

 as the cause of molecular magnetism, ana then gives quanti
 tative support to his view hy showing that the saturation
 values of I for magnetic metals are of the same order of
 magnitude as those calculated from reasonable assumptions
 as to the period of rotation of the molecules.
                    Magnitude of the Effect sought.
    For simplicity of calculation, consider the molecules to have
 the form of thin rings of diameter S ( = ^10~8), rotating about
 their principal axes, carrying charges y(=3x 10-2aE.M.)
 and numbering n( = 10as) to a cubic centimetre of iron.
    Let the magnetic axes of these rings be parallel and similarly
 directed ; i. e. let the iron be saturated and of magnetic moment
 I per cub. centim. It is easy to see that if V stands for the
 linear velocity of any point on a ring along its circumference,

    Suppose now that the field by which the molecules are
held in position is suddenly increased by an amount H. The
 number of lines of force which will enter each ring per centim.
of its circumference is —,* • —j- = -7-, and the momentum

imparted thereby to the matter of the ring is consequently
-r-q-    From this it follows that if v is the change produced
by this process in the original velocity (V) of a ring of mass m,

   Now the ratio ^ is the fraction by which the magnetism
in the iron decreases when H is increased. If we put
H = 40,000 (Ewing's maximum value about) and 1=1500,
^ comes out to be 5 x 10-u, as stated above.
   From (i.) and (ii.) it is also easy to calculate the loss of
heat in the iron due to any increase of H.

one hundredth of a degree C.
   This is a well-known expression for magnetic-field energy ;
and though obtained in this somewhat roundabout manner,
it is of course quite independent of any hypothesis as to the
source of the energy being in the motion of the molecules or
elsewhere. The above equations simply suggest a mechanical
explanation, in the caso of magnetic molecules, for the fact
that, when energy is put into surrounding space by starting
any current A (say the source of H in the above) , it is less
when A is alone than it is if a second current B (the mo
lecular current) is already flowing in its neighbourhood ; the
difference being wholly derived from the source of B (which,
according to the present hypothesis, is the kinetic energy of
the molecule) provided B does not change in strength during
the process. If it does—in other words, if the second term
in the above expression does not vanish—part of the extra
field-energy is derived from the source of A, and calculation
 becomes practically impossible.

4?6       Prof. Chattock and Mr. F. B. Fawcett on the
in the magnetizing force experienced by the iron under test ;
the latter being contained in a zinc box 0, which was filled
and surrounded with cotton-wool and placed between the
poles DD.
    The test-piece consisted of a bundle of fine iron wires
lying parallel to the lines of force, into the centre of which
was introduced one end of a " line " thermopile. The other
end of the pile was surrounded by a coil of silk-covered
copper wire all in one length, which was similar in size and
shape to the iron test-piece.
    The actual size and shape of the mould in which the separate
 plates of the alloys forming the pile were cast is shown in
fig. 2. The plates were about £ millim. thick, and were com
 posed alternately of the alloys * 32 parts bismuth + 1 part
 antimony, and 12 parts bismuth + 1 part tin. They were
 placed side by side with mica to separate them, and were
 soldered at their pointed extremities, which were then covered
 with goldbeater's-skin. Fourteen pairs were used to form
 the pile.
    By this means the junctions formed a blunt knife-edge and
 were brought well into the centre of the iron wire ; the mass
 of the pile being at the same time kept small at that point,
 while it was large enough outside to prevent undue resistance
 to the thermal current.
    The galvanometer, connected through a mercury commu
 tator with the pile, was at a distance of nearly 20 yards from
the electromagnet, and its circuit was provided with a small
variable E.M.F. to counterbalance accidental thermal currents.
The scale was read by a telescope, and a motion of a tenth of
a division could be easily detected.
                    Results of the Experiments.
   The constant saturating field between DD (tig. 1), pro
duced by exciting the main coils A, was first measured by
the earth-inductor method and found to be about 2800 C.G.S. ;
and a separate current was then sent through the coils B of
such a strength that on reversing it the main field was altered
by 166 C.G.S. units (H in equation iii.). The currents re
quired to produce these fields were also measured, so that
they might be reproduced for the experiment.
   After passing current through the exciting coils for a
couple of hours to obtain a steady temperature, the method of
experiment was as follows :—
   Galvanometer-readings were taken every 20 seconds, the
current in B being at the same time reversed every 5 minutes,

                  Energy of the Amperian Molecule.            477
so as to alternately heat and cool the iron if the effect looked
for existed. In this way fifteen readings were obtained
between every pair of reversals. It was found, however, that
a small inductive effect on the galvanometer- circuit occurred
at each reversal, and could not be quite got rid of. The
needle always kicked from 0'5 to 1 and oscillated. On the
other hand, it so happened that the period of oscillation of the
needle was almost exactly 60 seconds. We therefore divided
the fifteen readings into five groups of three ; and taking the
mean of each three we assumed it to represent the average
position of the needle during one minute. Five reliable
readings were thus obtained at intervals of 0'5, l-5, 2*5, 3'5,
4-5 minutes after each reversal of the B current. Nine such
reversals formed a " set." At the end of a set the connexions
of the galvanometer were reversed, to eliminate a possible
direct magnetic effect on the needle of the galvanometer, and
the set was repeated. Two such seta thus constituted a com
plete experiment.
    In the following table the mean values of the differences
between the readings in the strong and in the weak field,
taken at 05, 1*5, 2'5, Ac. minutes after alteration of the
field, are given for the four sets of two complete experi
ments. The final mean values of these differences are thus
each dependent on 108 separate readings of the galvanometer.

     The effect of commntating the galvanometer upon the sign
 of the differences has been allowed for in the table by reversing
 the signs of Set 2 in each experimert. The — sign to every
 difference except one means that, except in that case, the
 cross-wires stood more to the left of zero when the pile was
 in the strong field than when it was in the weak one.
     To determine the thermal meaning of this fact, we next
  sent a small momentary current through the copper-wire coil
  mentioned above as being upon the other end of the pile. The
  galvanometer was connected as for Set 1. A motion of the

478        Prof. Chattock and Mr. F. B. Fawcett on the
 cross-wires to the right resulted. Hence, if the differences
 observed were due to the iron, an increase of the magnetic
 field must have warmed it—just the reverse of what theory
required.
    The volume and resistance of the copper in the coil upon
the pile were known. By sending the proper current through
the coil for one second, it was possible to produce in the copper
the number (0*006) of calories per cub. centim. which ought
to have been produced in the iron by weakening the field,
viz. —y-.     The result was a deflexion which reached a maxi
 mum value of 3'8 at the end of about 75 seconds after the
 copper had been warmed, and died away in less than 6 minutes.
 As the two ends of the pole were as nearly alike as possible,
 this value gave a rough idea of the deflexion to be expected.
The observed effect of 0"44 was thus about nine times too
small and in the wrong direction.
    These results were obtained at the end of the Christmas
vacation, and at this point we were obliged to remove our
apparatus for the term's work.
    Two possible causes for the effect we had observed occurred
 to us. One, that the alteration in field-strength had altered
 the resistance of the pile, and therefore of the current passing
through it. The other, that the iron had not been quite
saturated throughout its length, and that hysteresis effects
had been superposed upon the one we were looking for. We
therefore undertook a fresh series of measurements this
summer with better appliances. The galvanometer was ren
dered absolutely dead-beat with a large mica vane, so that
each reading was complete in itself. The distance between the
pole-pieces was decreased from 3"0 to 2'65 centim., by which
means the strength of the main field was increased to 3200
 ( '.G.S., and the length of the iron test-piece was increased
until there was only 0"5 millim. clearance between its ends
and the pole-faces, instead of 7 millim. as before.
    Direct measurement now showed that the iron was
thoroughly saturated, and that the value of I for it was 1640.
    A further improvement consisted in the fact that the iron
wire was itself silk-covered and all in one length, so that the
artificial heating for calibration could be performed upon the
specimen itself, and a far more accurate indication obtained
of what to expect from the variations of the magnetic field.
    Slight movements of the test-piece on altering the field
were now found to give rise to small thermal effects, due
doubtless to an alteration in the flow of heat from the exciting
coils through the pole-pirces into the pile brought about

                 Energy of the Amperian Molecule.                479
 thereby. The pile and test-piece were therefore together
 embedded in a slab of paraffin wax, 2"55 centim. thick,
 through which passed two brass pins 2*65 centim. long and
 0*3 centim. in diameter, which were melted into the wax on
either side of the test-piece, and served to prevent any relative
motion between it and the pole-pieces.
    On trying this soon after the paraffin had set, the following
 readings were obtained in the right* direction ; that is to say,
 they pointed to a cooling of the iron when the field was
 strengthened.

are in accordance with theory, and vice vertd.

480        Prof. Chattock and Mr. F. B. Fawcett on the
the same diagram represents the effect of heating the iron
wire by means of a current flowing through it for one second,
and of the proper strength to produce                ^    calories
 per cub. centim. of the iron. The points which determine
 this curve are the mean values of several consistent ob
servations.
    The following day the readings were in the wrong direc
 tion (curves b and c), nothing having been altered in the
 mean time. Thinking that the alterations in the field-strength
 might still be capable of producing some relative movement
 of the pile and the strands of the test-piece, the effect of
 which had been altered by the hardening of the paraffin
 during the night, we caused the paraffin to penetrate the
 interstices of the iron wire by means of the air-pump, and
 the apparatus was then placed in position and subjected to a
  field of about 3000 units for 5 hours while it cooled. Readings
  taken next day were still negative, and to about the same
  extent as before (curves d and e). The substitution of a
 solid cylinder of iron for the iron wire did not affect matters.
  Relative motion of test-piece and pile seemed therefore to be
 excluded.
     The clearance between pole-faces and test-piece was next
 increased from 0'5 to 3*5 millim. without altering the result ;
  from which we inferred that the values obtained could not
  be due to a slight yielding of the paraffin slab when the
  field was altered, the distance from slab to poles being too
  great to be affected thereby in this case. Neither could
  they be due to a direct effect of the field upon the resistance
  or E.M.F. of the pile, for we found that they were indepen
  dent of the direction of any permanent current which might
  be flowing through the pile during the observations.
     It only remained therefore to suppose that our results were
  attributable to a change in the conductivity for heat of the
  system pile-testpiece ; the flow of heat through it from the
  exciting current being alternately checked and accelerated as
  the field was altered. That a flow was actually occurring
  from the iron into the pile and on through it to its other end,
  was shown by the direction of the E.M.F. required in the
  galvanometer circuit to balance the permanent effect of the
  pile. It was due to the fact that the pile was too long to
  allow of its being wholly between the poles at the same time
  that the test-piece was in a uniform part of the field.
     The correctness of this view was proved by showing that the
  sign of the effect changed with the direction in which the

                 Energy of the Amperian Molecule.                 481
heat flowed through the pile. By passing hot or cold water
through holes in the pole-pieces we were able to alter the
flow at will. The following are the results obtained :—

    These numbers are each the mean of ten determinations,
 and show clearly the alteration of sign from — to + as the
 flow of heat changed from the iron-pile to the pile-iron direc
 tion. They accord with the sign of a set of readings we took,
 in which the end of the pile remote from the iron was warmed
 by a tube carrying a stream of tepid water (curve f) ; and
 they also explain the change of sign which occurred while
 the paraffin slab was cooling (p. 479).
    Having thus traced our first results to the unsymmetrical
 arrangement of the pile, the obvious course was to put it in
 such a position that the flow of heat through it was avoided
 altogether, and to repeat our original readings. This we tried
 to do, but without success. It was easy to reduce the flow to a
 very small amount, but quite impossible to keep it so for more
 than a few minutes at a time. We venture to think, however,
 that the curves obtained are sufficient to prove the absence of
 the molecular effect sought for. A comparison of the curve
 for artificial heating with the others shows that the peak,
 which is so marked a feature in the former, is not found in
 the latter. It is true that if only the normal curves b, c, d, e
 are considered, it might be urged that the peak is perhaps
 absent because it is neutralized by an equal and opposite peak
 in the effect which gives the readings their negative sign.
 But if this were so, it should be doubly present in the curves

 That this is not the case seems to us to render it practically
 certain that it does not exist at all*. In other words, that

 charges, this motion is not inseparably connected with a spinning
of the molecules themselves.
  LVII. A Neic Method of Magnetizing and Astaticizing
       Galranometer-Needles. By F. L. O.WADSWORTHf.
                            [Plate XIII.]
 A GREAT deal of attention has been devoted by many
         eminent physicists to the improvement of the galvano
 meter, and it has in consequence been brought to perhaps
 as high a degree of delicacy and excellence as any of our
standard physical instruments. It is vain to hope for any
great advance in sensitiveness in existing types, but there will
always be a steady improvement in details and methods of
construction.
    One of the first essentials in securing a maximum degree
of sensitiveness in a galvanometer of the Thomson type is to
secure the maximum intensity of magnetization in the mag
 netic system. The maximum attainable will depend on three
 factors : —first, on the form of the individual magnets and
their arrangement with reference to each other ; second, on
 the quality of the steel used in making the magnets, and the
 method of hardening and tempering the same ; and third, on
 the method of magnetization. I have found that the intensity
of magnetization, and hence the sensitiveness of the galvano
 meter, depends on this last factor to a greater degree than has
usually been supposed, and that by using the method which
will presently be described the sensitiveness of a given gal
vanometer may he doubled and in some cases more than
quadrupled. This results not so much from an improvement
in the magnetizing process per se as from the method of
application.
    The usual method of making the astatic system of the
Thomson galvanometer is to build up each member of the
system from a number of individual bar-magnets, each of
which is hardened and magnetized as strongly as possible
between the poles of a powerful electromagnet, either during
   * The only way out of this conclusion is to supposo that the peak has
been neutralized by some effect which we have overlooked, and which
does not change its sign with the direction of the heat-flow. But this is
unlikely.

the process of hardening and tempering or subsequently*.
During the process of building up, the individual magnets
are subjected to various demagnetizing influences, the most
serious of which are the jars and blows received in the pro
cess of mounting, and the proximity of other magnets during
the process of astaticizing. The resultant strength of each
member of the finished system is therefore considerably less
than it would be if the individual magnets were magnetized
to their saturation-point. Prof. Threlfall f avoided this diffi
culty by magnetizing each member of the system in situ,
using for this purpose two separate electromagnets, one for
each member.
    It was this which first suggested to me the present method,
which differs from the preceding in that but one electro
magnet is used for simultaneously magnetizing both members
of the system. The advantage of this is that both members,
when being magnetized, form part of one and the same
magnetic circuit, and hence, barring magnetic leakage (which
limy be reduced to a minimum by proper design of circuit),
are necessarily in fields of precisely the same strength for all
magnetizing forces—one essential condition for securing
astaticism, or in preserving it when once established and
remagnetization is desirable. When separate electromagnets
are used for each member, it is necessary in order to secure
this condition that the field of each be of exactly the same
strength, an end which requires for its accomplishment
the taking of unusual precautions (described in tbo paper
 referred to) in the selection of material, tbe winding of the
coils, &c. The single electromagnet device is therefore con
 siderably simpler to construct and more convenient, to use.

484        Mr. F. L. 0. Wadsworth on a New Method of
which it was first used. It consists simply of two pieces of
round iron $ inch diameter, each bent into the shape of a very
shallow U, with legs about 1 inch long and back or yoke
2J inches long (this being the distance between the centres
of the two members of the astatic system), wound with about
350 turns of No. 18 magnet-wire.                   With a current of
5 amperes in the magnetizing coils, and a separation between
the poles of the two halves of 3 milliin., the density in the
iron cores amounts to about 5000 C.Gr.S.
    The system to be magnetized is laid on its back on the edge
of a narrow strip of wood b mounted on a board B (figs. 1 & 2,
Plate XIII.). This strip is a very little wider than the length
of the needles of the system, and of such a height that the top
edge is just below the centre of the poles of the electromagnet,
the two yokes of which rest on the supporting base. Thin
strips of glass or mica are cemented on each side of the
central strip opposite the poles of the magnet, to prevent the
latter from touching the needles. The coils of the two yokes
are so connected that the whole forms a single magnetic
circuit with the two air-gaps m, n, in each of which lies one
of the members of the magnetic system, so that when the
current is turned on by means of a key, K, they are strongly
and equally magnetized in opposite directions, as required.
In order to secure the maximum permanent magnetization,
the strength of the field should bo suddenly increased to a
maximum and then gradually decreased, several times in
succession, either by varying the strength of the current in
the coils by means of a rheostat, or, better, by varying the
distance between the two poles*, tapping the support with a
light hammer or block of wood when the magnelic induction
is at a maximum, in order to assist in "setting" the mole
cular structure. The magnetization being finished, the system
is lifted carefully from its support, hung by means of its
attached fibre in a glass tube large enough to allow it to
swing freely, and tested for astaticism.
   * In no case should the magnetizing current be broken suddenly when
the poles are close to the needles, or the strength of the latter may be
very considerably wenkened, if not destroyed, by the sudden recoil of
the field. See Auerbach, Wied. Ann. xiv. (1881), and Fromine, Wied.
Ann. v. (1878): — " Auerbach lays down as a general principle that
when the variation of the magnetizing force is slow and continuous the
velocity of the transition does not influence the final magnetization ; but
sudden transition causes the final magnetization to be less or greater than
that obtained by gradual transition, according as the passage is from a
greater to a less or from a less to a greater force." (Encyc. Brit. art.

    Usually, owing to difficulties of construction, one member
will be slightly heavier and bence magnetically stronger, and
the magnetic planes will be slightly inclined to each other ;
the amount and direction of which inclination can be ascer
tained by noting the setting of the system with reference to
the magnetic meridian.
    The planes of the members should first be brought to
parallelism by a slight twisting of one of them on its support.
A good way to do this is to take two bar-magnets, N, S
(fig. 2), and bring first one and then the other up against
the side of the glass tube, as in fig. 2.

 needed to bring the two p'anes to pa- SKm^^^'^BKL
 rallelisnl, the two magnets are held
as shown, in front of the axis of the tube ; if a left-handed
one, behind the axis, as indicated by the dotted lines. Then
the magnet N is quickly removed and the member is drawn
toward S against the inclined wall of the tube, giving it a
 blow which tends to twist it clockwise on the axis of suspen
sion and at the same time to slightly weiiken it. Repeating
this operation a few times will soon suffice to bring about the
required degree of parallelism unless the cement which
attaches the member to the staff be too hard and dry, in
 which case a slight heating of the surrounding tube with a
 hot block of copper or a Bunseu-flame will be necessary to'
 render the cement slightly plastic.
     Parallelism having been secured (which is determined by
 the plane of the system lying in the magnetic meridian), the
 relative magnetic strengths of the two members are tested by
 determining the time of vibration. Generally, if the system
 has been made up with a proper degree of cars, the strengths
 of the two members will be so nearly equal that it will only
 require a very weak directing magnet placed some distance
 above or below the system to secure almost perfect astaticism.
     But if it is desirable to secure this without the use of such
 a magnet, it will be necessary to add to the weaker of the
 two s}'stems a minute fragment of steel (a very short piece
 broken off from one of the finest watch hair-springs answers
 well), and then to remagnetize the whole as before, taking
 care of course to magnetize in the same direction. The whole
 operation requires at the most but a few hours' work by an
 experienced manipulator, and the success of this method may
 be judged by the results which havo been obtained by its use.

 486        Mr. F. L. 0. Wadsworth on a New Method of
    The first galvanometer experimented upon was a fine
 Thomson instrument, whose coils were wound by While, and
 whose needle system was made by Very*. The magnetic
 system was built up of hollow cylindrical magnets, rolled up
 out of the thinnest sheet-steel, heated red-hot in fused ferro-
 cyanide of potassium, and hardened in mercury in a powerful
 magnetic field. The system was then astaticized by the usual
 method of stroking with a weak bar-magnet. Every care
 was taken to secure the maximum intensity of magnetization.
 The constant of the galvanometer in its most sensitive state
 was 0 = 1-5 X 10-" f-
    The bost value of the constant of the Allegheny galvano
 meter already referred to was 0 = l-3 x 10"9. On October 23
 the magnetic system was removed and remagnetized, and
 reastaticized by the method described above. No other
 change was made. The new constant after magnetization
 was 0=8 x 10-10, an increase in delicacy of nearly 100 per
 cent.
    The second galvanometer to whoso magnetic system this
 method of treatment was applied was one constructed by
 Queen and Co. especially for the Observatory. The mag
 netic system had very nearly the same dimensions as the one
 already described, but the individual magnets were solid.
 The method of hardening and magnetizing was not described
 by the makers. The constant for this galvanometer as re
 ceived from them was :—
          C = l"6x 10-9 for coils in series, R=309 ohms,
          C = 5"5 x 10~9 for coils in parallel, R=19"2 ohms.
    The needle was removed and remagnetized by the new
 method and the constant redetermined. The new constant
was :—
                   0 = lx 10~10 for coils in series,
                   C = 3'4x 10-11 for coils in parallel.
    Part of the immense improvement here is due to a more
accurate centering of the coils, to the magnetic system, and
to a reduction of the excessive damping ; yet with a most
   * This instrument was a duplicate of the celebrated Thomson galvano
meter, with Very hollow magnets, used by Langley at Allegheny in his
bolometric work; and which was considered at that time to be the most

liberal allowance for the influence of these changes, the sensi
tiveness was increased fully ten times bv the remagnetization.
   This would seem to indicate either that the first magneti
zation had been very inefficient, or that the needle in transit
from Philadelphia to Washington had been accidentally sub
jected to some very strong demagnetizing influence. It
serves to show, however, the importance and necessity of
some such ready and efficient means of remagnetizing the
systems of galvanometers in which a high degree of sensi
tiveness and not absolute constancy is required. Steel mag
netized to the degree of intensity hero attained will of course
 gradually lose a part of its magnetism, but not more (in my
 experience) than 10 or 20 per cent, in many months, if care
 fully handled. This small loss is not of importance compared
 with the gain in sensitiveness secured, as the original strength
 may at any time be quickly and easily restored or even slightly
 increased* by remagnetization.
    The advantage of the method which specially commends it
to general laboratory use is the simplicity of the apparatus
 required. The whole arrangement may be made in any labora
tory in a single afternoon. The same electromagnets may be
used for systems of varying dimensions by adding adjustable
pole-pieces. But if many systems are to bo treated, a more
convenient although more elaborate arrangement, like that
 shown in Plate XIII. figs. 3 & 4, will bo desirable. In this
 the magnetic system is held lightly between two long jaws
of copper a, a, adjustable in width by means of the screw b.
An adjustable fork or table c, which may be replaced by a
clamp if desired, serves to carry the fibre support.
    The two halves of the electromagnet, which may be wound
as before, or with four coils as here shown, are carried on
arms d, e, pivoted at /, so that they may be easily swung
apart or brought together, the motion being made sym
metrical with respect to the jaw3 a, a by means of the
links and sliding block. The lower set of poles are adjust
able on the yokes for systems of different lengths, and the
whole is mounted on an L-shaped base, which may be placed
so that tho needle is either vertical as shown in the figure, or
 horizontal.
    This method has also been applied with much success to
 the initial magnetization of some new systems for the samo
 galvanometer already described, and for the new very sensi
tive one which is described in a subsequent paper. A further

LVIII. On the Effects of Magnetic Fields on the Electric
    Conductivity ofBismuth. By James B. Henderson, B.Sc*
                            [Plates XV. & XVI.]
fpHAT magnetic fields have an effect on the electric con-
       ductivity of metals was noticed first in the year 1856 by
William Thomson f (Lord Kelvin), who was led to suspect it
from the effects which he had discovered magnetization to have
on the thermoelectric properties of metals. He experimented
on iron and nickel, and found in both an increase of resist
ance along the lines of force, and a diminution perpendicular
to them.
   Bismuth was first experimented on by Tomlinson f, who
found an increase of resistance due to longitudinal magneti
zation of Bi wire, and he found a similar increase in Fe, Ni,
Co, and steel wires. Later investigations in this subject have
been made by llighi§, Hurion ||, Eeduclf, Ettingshausen and
Nernst**, Ettingshausen ft, (jroldhammerjf, Lennard and
Howard §§, and Lennard || || ; but the lust of these is the one
which has the most important bearing on the present in
vestigation.
   In this Lennard used spirals of Bi wire, in all fifteen
spirals being tested, whose wires varied from 0'2 to 0"4
millim. in diameter, and from 50 to 150 centim. in length,
the respective resistances varying from 6 to 25 Siemens
units. The resistance was determined by the Wheatstone-
bridge direct-current method, and also by the method using

alternating current and telephone, and a remarkable difference
was found in the resistances obtained by the different methods.
Two kinds of Bi were used, one chemically pure and the
other containing traces of Fe and Zn, but differences were
not more than those due to observational errors. Deviations
from the mean values amounted to 1 per cent. The tem
perature varied from 10° to 25° C, and once was 0° C.
   The present investigation was instituted to determine de
finitely the relation between the magnetic field and the
resistance of Bi wire going to much higher field-intensities
than had ever been experimented with, and also to determine
the influence of temperature on that relation if any was
found. The investigation was started purely from the scien
tific standpoint, but the importance of it to the practical
application of Bi wire as a field-tester was not lost sight of.
   Owing to the purity with which Bi wire is now prepared
for instruments for magnetic-field testing, and the convenient
form for experimenting which these field-testers offer, it was
determined to use them in this investigation. Two such were
employed, the spiral of one having a diameter of about
18 millim. and a resistance of 24 ohms, and that of the other
a diameter of 6 millim. and a resistance of about 9 ohms. The
form of the instrument is shown in fig. 1.
                                Kg.l.
   The magnetic fields were obtained by means of a Ruhm-
korff electromagnet, and the very highest field-intensities
from the large ring-electromagnet lately designed by H. du
Bois* for the production of very strong fields for experi
mental purposes. With the large spiral the ordinary dome-
shaped pole-pieces belonging u> the Ruhmkorff magnet were
used, the holes in them being first blocked up with pieces of
soft iron to render the field as uniform as possible. For the
small spiral special pole-pieces were prepared, which were
designed to fit the ring-electromagnet, but by using a pair
of flat poles with them they also fitted the Ruhmkorff
magnet. They had an angle of 60°, and their faces, which were
7 millim. in diameter, were held at a distance of 1*5 millim.
apart by means of a brass casting to which both pole-pieces
were rigidly attached. This casting consisted of two thick
rings held rigidly parallel and coaxial by means of two stout

distance-pieces, and to each ring one of the pole-pieces was
soldered, the inner surfaces of the rings being conical to
receive them (see fig. 4). The distance-pieces were not at
opposite ends of a diameter of the rings, but one was dis
placed a few degrees round the circumference of the ring to
allow of the introduction of the spiral and the ballistic coil,
which turned about the same horizontal axis and in the same
vertical plane (see fig. 2).

    The ballistic method was used to measure the field, the
 galvanometer being of the form designed by du Bois and
 Bubens*, used with the four 20-ohm coils in parallel. It was
 standardized by means of the induced current produced in a
 fine coil placed at the centre of a long straight solenoid of
 thick wire, when a current through the latter was made or
 broken f. The constants of both coils being known and
 the current in the solenoid measured, the induced current

        Fields on tlie Electric Conductivity of Bismuth.      491
was easily calculated and the constant of the galvanometer
obtained from it.
   The ballistic coil for the large spiral consisted of one turn
of wire mounted on one of the mica plates between which the
Bi spiral was cemented, and embraced the whole area of the
spiral, which area was determined by accurate measurement.
The ballistic coil for the small spiral consisted of four turns of
very fine copper wire wound side by side on a small wooden
cylinder about 6 millim. in diameter and rather less than
1*5 millim. long, so that with the thin ends to keep the wire
in position the whole coil could pass between the poles. From
the exact dimensions of the wooden cylinder and of the wire
the constant of the coil was calculated.
   These two ballistic coils were compared in a uniform field
between large flat pole-pieces, and the ratio of their constants,
experimentally determined, agreed within one half per cent,
with the calculated value.
   The resistance of the spirals was measured always by the
Wheatstone-bridge with direct currents and galvanometer.
   At first no arrangement was made and no precautions
taken to keep the temperature constant, as other experimenters
had found no influence due to it ; but after some results had
been obtained, it was seen that these varied among them
selves beyond the limits of observational error wherever the
temperature had varied, and so a method of keeping it con
stant became necessary.
   For each spiral a watertight copper case was made, that
for the large spiral having the dimensions 95 X 26 x 5 millim.
and for the small one 95 X 9 x 1 millim., and these were fitted
over their respective spirals but so as not to touch the copper
rods which served as terminals to them. For each spiral a
water-bath was made, that for the large one consisting of a
cylindrical copper box with a horizontal section resembling a
lemniscate in form, the thin part in the centre going between
the poles. Fig. 3 shows a plan of the box between the poles.
Since it was necessary to remove the spiral quickly from
between the poles to measure the field, the ballistic coil being
fastened to it, and still to keep the temperature constant, the
spiral was fixed in the narrow part of the box and the box
mounted on vertical guides, so that by means of a cord passing
over a pulley the whole bath with the contained spiral and
ballistic coil could be suddenl}- raised clear of the magnet. In
each side of the bath a stirrer was placed. With this apparatus
experiments were made with ice, and with water the tem
perature of the room in the bath, but none could be made
with hot water, as the spiral could not be heated above 30° C,

account, therefore, as also on account of the higher fields in
 which it could be placed, the results obtained from the small
 spiral are more interesting and important.

                                Pig. 4.
 the pole-pieces themselves were made to form part of the
vessel. The two brass rings to which the poles were soldered
were connected outside by a cylindrical brass tube of large

           Fields on the Electric Conductivity of Bismuth.               493
 diameter, which was pushed over them and soldered to both,
 thus forming a closed cylindrical vessel with the pole-pieces
 as ends. A slit made at the top for about one quarter of the
 circumference served to admit the small spiral or the ballistic
 coil, and two extra holes in it with brass tubes fitted in them
 served as inlet and outlet for a flow of water. In this way
 it was possible to have a constant flow of water over the poles
 and spiral.
    The temperature of the spiral was measured by means of a
thermoelectric junction placed beside it inside the copper
case ; and the same galvanometer was used to measure the
 temperature and field, it being never required for both
 purposes simultaneously.
    Experiments were first of all made with the large spiral,
using either ice or water of the temperature of the air in the
 bath, and the two series given below in Table I. for 0° and

    In all the experiments with this spiral the constancy of
the temperature was tested by taking the resistance of the
spiral when raised clear of the poles each time the field was
measured ; and the temperature could be got very exactly
from the temperature-coefficient curve. Throughout a series
the temperature never varied more than one degree, and for
the greater part of the series it was constant. PI. XV. fig. 5

494     Mr. J. B. Henderson on tlie Efects of Magnetic
represents the above series in grapbic form, where the ordinates
represent resistances and the abscissa? field-intensity.
    It will be seen that the curves take a form somewhat
resembling an hyperbola with its axis parallel to the resistance
coordinate ; and that the rate of increase of the resistance, or
the inclination of the curve to the horizontal, diminishes as
the temperature increases, so that each curve cuts all the
others but not in the same point, as will be made clearer in
considering the results from the small spiral. The third
columns in the foregoing table give the percentage increase
 of resistance, and these are shown in graphic form in PI. XV.
 fig. 6. Here the curves all pass through the origin and have
 a similar form to those described above, the inclination to the
 horizontal being less as the temperature increases.
    With the large spiral, tests were made for hysteresis of
resistance by taking two series at the same temperature, one
with ascending values of the field-intensity and the other with
descending ; but the results obtained agreed within the limits
of observational error, and so, if hysteresis does exist, it must
 be of a small order of magnitude.
    Tests were also made for time-lag of resistance by finding
the resistance in zero-field, then, after being placed in a mag
netic field, again in zero; but no difference could be noticed
after times comparable with several seconds. That there is
such time-lag after very short intervals of time appears in
Lennard's results with the alternating current and telephone,
¦which show that the resistance found in this way is a function
of the period of alternation ; and it is also shown by some
experiments lately made by Rubens in Berlin to determine
if vibrating spirals of Bi wire in magnetic fields could
be used for microphonic purposes ; but his results proved the
negative.
    In the foregoing results the highest field obtained with the
large spiral has been 13,000 C.G.S., that is, over an area of
about 268 square millim., and was obtained with the pole-
pieces 9 millim. apart, with a current of 30 amperes. In the
investigation the current was obtained either from six accu
mulators, or from the Berlin supply-mains at a potential of
 108 volts. "With the fine pole-pieces fields of 28,000 were
obtained with about 10 amperes from the accumulators, and
33,000 with about 30 amperes from the mains ; and with the
same pole-pieces in H. du Bois's ring-magnet and a current
of 45 amperes, a field of 39,000 was obtained.
    Thus there was a full range up to 39,000 C.G.S. available,
and the following table gives the resistance of the small spiral
at 18° C. in the full range of field-intensities.

                    Series at 18° C. with small spiral.
    To enable a comparison to be made with the series for the
large spiral at 18° 0. the percentage increase in fields up to
 13,000 is also given, and these values are plotted along with
those for the large one in fig. 6, the crosses denoting the
points got from the small spiral. The diagram shows that
the two spirals agree at this temperature.
   PI. XV. fig. 7 represents the series given in Table II. in
graphic form. It will be seen that the resistance is more than
tripled in the highest field at 18° ; and for a lower temperature
it would have a still higher value, and, vice versa, for a higher
temperature, a lower.
   The four highest fields in the above series were obtained by
means of the ring-magnet, and as the apparatus was arranged
specially to suit the Ruhmkorff, the same exactitude does not
apply to these readings as to the others. The magnet had a
very large influence on the galvanometer, which was elimi
nated by repeating each experiment with the current reversed

496      Mr. J. B. Henderson on the Effects of Magnetic
in the magnet and taking the mean ; and on the whole these
four points can have a possible error of about 2 per cent.
    To determine the influence of temperature on the resist
ance in the magnetic field two methods were made use of.
 First, the temperature was kept constant, or as constant
as possible, and the resistance taken in different fields ; and
second, the field was kept constant and the temperature
varied, or the temperature-resistance curves in different fields
determined. The latter method proved much more successful
than the former, as it was much easier to keep the field con
stant than the temperature, and the particulars and results of
 the latter method only will be given.
    For the fields the current from the accumulators alone was
 used, and by taking currents up to about 7 amperes constant
fields up to 23,000 C.G.S. were obtained.
    In the experiments a flow of water at 0° C. was sent over
 the poles and spiral, and the resistance taken at the lowest
 temperature reached, which was when the galvanometer
 became steady, and usually represented about 9° C. The
 flow of water was then stopped and the temperature of the
 bath slowly raised by a small flame to 80° C, the temperature
and resistance of the spiral being read off at intervals. The
constancy of the field throughout the experiment was roticed
by observing no change of current through the magnet, as
 shown' by an ampere-meter.
    In this way temperature-resistance series were obtained
 for the fields as given in Table III., varying from zero to
 23,000, in all nine different series, which are represented
 graphically in PI. XVI. fig. 8.
    From the diagram it will be seen that the inclination of
these curves to the horizontal diminishes as the field increases,
being positive at first, then zero, and then regative ; but at
the same time it is also evident that with increasing field the
curves deviate more and more from the straight line form, to
which the curve in zero-field or the ordinary temperature-
coefficient curve approximates ; so that those curves which
have a horizontal part within the temperature limits of these
experiments are only horizontal for a small distance, which
represents a minimum value of* the resistance. Such mini
mum values occur at higher and higher temperatures as the
field increases. Thus, for example, the curve for a field of
9600 has its minimum value about 35°, that for 11,500 about
50°, and the one for 14,300 is horizontal at 85°. Thus,
reasoning from analogy, it would seem that all the curves
have a minimum value, the higher the field the higher being
the temperature at which the minimum occurs, and vice versd.

 10o,30°,50°, 65°, and 80°, deduced from tbe above temperature-
 resistance curves represented in fig. 8, and forming cross curves
 to them.
    The three variables— resistance, field-intensity, and tempe
 rature—could thus be made the three coordinates, and a
 smooth regular surface obtained giving the value of any one
 of the variables if the other two are known. PI. XVI. fig. 8
 represents sections of this surface perpendicular to the field
 coordinate, fig. 9, sections perpendicular to that of tempera
ture ; and in fig. 10 are represented sections perpendicular to
 the resistance-coordinate, or equi-resistance lines of tbe sur
 face. It is evident that tig. 9 represents a family of curves
 with a variable parameter, namely the temperature, and the
 envelope of this family is interesting. It represents the
 projection on the field-resistance plane of the locus of the
 minimum points considered in fig. 8, or gives the connexion
between the field and resistance for which a miilimum value
of the latter takes place ; or, to put it still another way, at
these values of the resistance and field the former is inde
 pendent of small increases or decreases of temperature. Thus
for each field there is a ceriain temperature at which increases
or decreases of temperature of one or two degrees have no
effect on the resistance. The projection of this locus on the
fielJ-temperature plane would be represented in fig. 10 by a
curve through all the points where the tangents are parallel
to the temperature coordinate—that is, the points where the
field is a maximum.
   A few words have still to be added on the practical appli
cation of Bi wire to the measurement of magnetic fields.
    We have seen that the phenomenon of alteration of resist
ance of Bi wire in magnetic fields is greatly influenced by
temperature, and therefore for anything like exact determi
nations the temperature must be known. A suitable combi
nation of thermometer with the spiral would therefore remove
difficulties, and this can be most conveniently arranged by
winding a spiral of copper or platinum side by side with the
Bi spiral, and from its resistance determining the temperature.
   In closing, I desire to express my great indebtedness to
the late Prof. Kundt and Drs. du Bois and Rubens for
the help which they have given me by putting private
apparatus at my disposal, and for the advice which I have
received from them from time to time.

  The Outlines of Quaterniotis. By Lieut.-Colonel H. W. L. Hime.
                 (Longmans, Green, and Co. 1894.)
 TT is becoming more and more clearly recognized that a vector
 ¦*¦ algebra is the proper mathematical method for treating physical
 problems; and it may confidently be said that in Hamilton's
 Quaternions we find such a vector analysis of a most powerful
 and flexible character. O'Brien, a contemporary of Hamilton,
 constructed a vector analysis similar in many respects to Hamil
 ton's, but lackiug the solidarity and flexibility which apparently
 the quaternion alone can give. Eecent attempts to follow where
 O'Brien led have served but to bring out in stronger light the
 transcendent superiority of the Hamiltonian system. This is said
advisedly ; for the recent vector analyses which have been pre
sented to the world are all unconscious plagiarisms of O'Brien's.
    But there is another class of mathematicians who object to the
quaternion because it does not seem to fit in with the general drift
of modern analysis. It is undeniable that, on the purely mathe
matical side, there has been little systematic advance in quater
nions since Hamilton's own time. But is not this due rather to
the timidity of man than to any inherent weakness in the system ?
lu the later chapters of Tail's treatise, which abound in original
 and striking applications, there are hints and suggestions that
 might easily be developed into memoirs and even treatises by the
purely analytical mind. The truth is that many a seemingly simple
quaternion expression or equation, when translated into ordinary
analytical symbols, assumes a form that mocks at the bravest
analyst; and <ertain quaternion equations, sufficiently interpret-
able, have never yet been expressed in Cartesian coordinates.
    If we except Hamilton's, Tait's, and McAulay's papers and
treatises, most of the literature of the subject has been a restate
ment of known results. Lieut.-Colonel Hime's book confessedly
belongs to this class. It is intended for the student. A know
ledge of geometry and algebra such as may easily be obtained in a
secondary school is sufficient to enable the learner to read intelli
gently nearly the whole of the book. The processes of differen
tiation are discussed in a short chapter; but they are not used to
any marked extent in the geometrical illustrations given further
on. Within the limits assigned, Colonel Hime has given us a
book which cannot fail to be of service in popularising the study
of quaternions. Its value would have been enhanced had it
contained at the end of every chapter a selection of exercises for
the student's private work. As the author himself points out
in the closing paragraph, it is not in simple geometrical appli
cations that the peculiar power of quaternions is displayed. It
is certain, however, that no candid mind can read the sections
devoted to spherical geometry and trigonometry without being

500                Notices respecting New Books.
struck with the extraordinary simplicity of the quaternion mode of
attack. Once the quaternion in its true geometrical significance
is understood, we need never refer—except in wondering awe—to
a treatise on spherical trigonometry.
   With so much that is worthy of praise in Colonel Hime's book,
we gladly refrain from criticism of minor details, which are
often a mere question of taste. But it is otherwise with a few
really serious faults, which seem eminently fitted to perplex the
student. Such a fault is the whole of paragraph 11. Whatever
it is, it is not quaternions ; indeed it is inconsistent with nearly
all the other paragraphs of the book. As a quaternion equation,
equation (8)
is simply nonsense. Having already taught us that i, j, k are
coperpendicular unit vectors or right versors (the identification of
which is one of the bursts of genius in Hamilton's calculus), what
reason has the author for declaring that i=j =&c? " Equation (8),"
we are told, " asserts that all unit-vectors in the first power are
equal, as versors, in respect to angle." In short, versors are to be
equated when their angles are equal. [For consistency's sake,
Colonel Hime should use the equation Uq = Ur as meaning only
 Lq= Lr. Further on we are told that "the symbol a/—1
represents them [i,j,k~\ only in their character of indeterminate
right versors." But i,j, k have already been defined in anything
but an indeterminate manner. This arbitrary robbing a symbol
of its most characteristic feature, so that it no longer is what it
was defined to be. is contrary to the whole genius of— Common
Sense. What would the Cartesian analyst say to the equation
                 x=y=z= V +1 = —x= —y=—z,
which is certainly less irrational than equation (8).
    Again, at the foot of page 76 we meet with the equation
                             s _     /y
 which is asserted to mean that 2 bisects the angle between fi and
 y. Then we read :— " This equation may be written 52=y/3,
 where I is called the Mean Proportional betwee i /3 and y." Mow
 we are told in previous sections that ff, the square of a vector,
 is a scalar; and that yfi, the product of two different vectors,
 is a quaternion. The legitimate conclusion is that a scalar is
 equal to a quaternion ! The equation tf = y/3 really means that /3
 and y are parallel vectors, to whose tensors the tensor of S is the
 geometric mean. If it mean ought else it cannot be a quaternion
 equation.     But, anyhow, it has no business here. The true
 transformation of the equation first given is ^-I=y2-', a toti-Uy
 different thing.
   We hope that the author will in future editions delete the
second form of this equation entirely, recast the whole of para
graph 11, and root out the altogether obnoxious equation (8).

The book will then be a very serviceable introduction to quaternions,
although we should like to see a more logical and thorough laying
down of the foundations of the calculus. Especially does the
whole question of vector and versor require careful presentation,
else will the triple dynasiy of antiquaternionic vector analyses
let loose their invective, their scorn, and their specious pleadings.

 -*- 1. ' Ca rock Fell : a Study in the Variation of Igneous Rock
 masses.—Part I. The Gabbro.' By Alired Harker, Esq., M.A.,
 F.C.S.
    The paper opens with an account of the general relations of the
 intrus've rock-masses of the district, and proceeds to deal more
 particularly with the gabbro, which forms the earliest intrusion.
    A penological description of the Carroek Fell gabbro is followed
 by a study of the variations observed in different parts of the mass.
 Tho rock becomes progressively more basic from the centre to the
 margin, passing from a quartz-gabbro with as iruch as 59 1 per cent,
 of silica to an ultrabasic type with as little as 32|. The latter in
 extreme cases contains nearly 25 per cent, of iron-ores, partly
 titan iferous. This is compared with the igneous iron-ores described
 by Vogt in Scandinavia, &c, and the probable physical cause of tho
 remarkable variation in the gabbro is discussed.
     Other modifications of the gabbro are briefly noticed, duo on the
 one hand to metamorphism of the rock by a somewhat later
 intrusion of granophyre, on the other hand to the gabbro-magma
 having enclosed considerable masses of tho basic lavas of the
 district, which are themselves highly metamorphosed.
     2. ' Tho Geology of Monte Chaberton.' By A. M. Davies, Esq.,
  B.Sc, F.G.S., and J. W. Gregory, D.Sc, F.G.S.
     The importance of the Chaberton district, as affording a key to
  the general goology of the Cottians, is explained, and the opinions of
  previous observers referred to. The mountain was examined from
  three sides—that of the Grand Vallon ; the approach from Mont
  Genevre by the Col de Chaberton; and that of the Clos des Morts
  Valley. The following are the conclusions arrived at : —
     (1) Tho well-known Chaberton serpentine is intrusive into the
  calc-schists, and yields fragments to the canjneules of tho Trias : it
  is therefore a pre-Triassic intrusion.
     (2) There are on the mountain othor fairly basic schistose rock

 502                     Geological Society :—
 (quartz-chlorite-schists) which cut the Trias, and are therefore
post-Triasiic.
    (3) The contorted beds in the Clos des Morts Valley are fossilife-
rous limestones, and it is from them that the fallen blocks previously
recorded were derived. The only recognizable fossil is Calamo-
phyllia femstrata, Reuss, a characteristic coral of the Gosau Beds.
In spite, therefore, of the doubts of Kilian and Diener, the opinion
expressed by Neumayr as to the existence of Cretaceous rocks in
this part of the Alps is confirmed.
   (4) The earth-movements of the mountain are described : they
includo ordinary folds, inversions, faults, and an important thrust-
plane.
   (5) It is suggested that in addition to the two series of intrusive
rocks above-mentioned as pre- and post-Triassic, a third series of late
Cretaceous or Tertiary date may be represented in the MontGencvre
and liocciavre masses.
   3. ' Cone in Cone ; its Structure, Varieties, &c.' By W. S. Gresley,
Esq., F.G.S.
   The author describes cone-in-cone structure occurring in the
Portage Shales of Pennsylvania, and gives details concerning the
nature of the structure as seen in these shah's. He criticises the
explanation of Mr. J. Young as to the origin of the structure, and
concurs in a great measure with the views of those who have
suggested that the formation was due to pressure acting on con
cretions.

   The following communications were read :—
   1. 'On the Stratigraphy and Physiography of the Libyan Desert
of Egypt.' By Captain H. G. Lyons, B.E., E.G.S.
   The Nubian Sandstone, wherever seen, rests unconformably on
the old rocks called by Sir J. \V. Dawson Archaean, and the
author finds no case of alteration of sandstone by these rocks,
though in one case it is altered by an intrusive dolerite.
   The author considers the Nubian Sandstone to be an estuarine
deposit which was formed on an area afterwards gradually invaded
by tho Cretaceous sea. He considers the whole of the sandstone in
the region which he has examined to be of Cretaceous ago.
   He describes a series of anticlinals, one set running W.N.W.-
E.S.E., and the other N. by E. and S. by W. Many springs of the
oaseB seem to occur along these anticlinals, owing to the beds which
contain the water being brought nearer to the surface. Historical
evidence is discussed which points to the Nile having reached a
higher level in Nubia than it does at present, and it is suggested
that variations in the level of the river were caused by earth-
movement opposing obstructions to the river's flow.
   The sandstone of Jebel Ahmar near Cairo is described, and its
occurrence over a wide area west of Cairo is recorded. The author
considers its age to be later Miocene. He believes that, with the

exception of some erosion after the deposition of the Eocene beds,
the greatest erosion, including the cutting-out of the Nile Valley,
took place in Miocene times, while a certain amount, bringing tho
area to its present condition, was done in Quaternary times. This
agrees with the observations of the French geologists in Algeria.
The origin of the silicification of the fossil trees of the sandstone-
deposits is discussed, and the action of water containing sodium
carbonate suggested as a cause.

the 0. F. S., at Harrismith, about 100 feet thick, and containing a
 bone-breccia from which reptilian remains were described by Prof.
 Owen in 1854. Northwards the Red-beds change to a dark grit ;
 and siliceous tree-stumps occur in the upper part. 4. These are
 the well-known coal-bearing beds of the Highveld plateau (1, c)
 and Natal, including the terrace (2) north of the Tugela River, and
 Zululand. The lower 500 feet of these beds in Natal carry coal
 better than that of the Highveld, but have been let down to a lower
level (about 2000 feet). In Natal they thicken northwards. On
 the coast-line in Natal and Zululand portions are at a still lower
level and dip seaward at 20°. Anthracite occurs at St. Lucia Bay.

River, through Pondoland and Natal to Zululand, thins out and
disappears near the Pongolo. Intrusive and flat diorites were
noticed in it. A definite list of the strata of this conglomerate,
where it is 138 feet thick in Zululand, is given ; and the author
does not regard it as of glacial origin. No. 9 is treated of in the
next paper.
   3. 'On the Occurrcnco of Dolomite in South Africa.' By D.
Draper, Esq., F.G.S.
   A peculiar calcareo-siliceous rock, near Lydenburg, described by
Messrs. Penning and Crutwell as ' Chalcedolite,' and a similar
rock mentioned by Mr. Penning, F.G.S., as overlying the ' Black-
reef Series ' of the Megaliesberg formation, are recognized as a dolo
mite. Mr. C. Alford, F.G.S., has described a ' calcareous quartzite,'
as passing into dolomite and ultimately into chert, and known
as the ' Elophant-rock ' in Transvaal, sometimes cavernous with
underground waters. From his own experience Mr. Draper has
recognized the ' Elephant-rock ' in the Potschefstroom, Lichtenburg,
Malmani, and Lydenburg districts as a real dolomite, with inter-
stratified siliceous bands, weathering into a brown earth like man
ganese oxide, and superficial siliceous debris.      It has its place
between the Table-mountain Sandstone and the quartzite of the
Gats Band (=Zuurberg Quartzite of the Cape). It has auriferous
veins in Malmani and Lydenburg. Dr. Schrenck has noticed a
similar dark-blue dolomitic limestone in Great Namaqualand. The
deep water-holes in it in Malmani arc comparable with those found
by F. Galton in West Central Africa. The great caves in Mashona-
land may belong to it. The extensive tufaceous deposits in Griqua-
land-West, the Transvaal, and Orange Free State were probably
derived from this extensive dolomite.
   4. ' Contributions to the Geology of British East Africa.' By
J. W. Gregory, D.Sc, F.G.S.
   The author describes moraines, striaj, glacial lake-basins, perched
blocks, and roches moutonnies below the present limits of the glaciers
of Mount Kenya, which he maintains indicate the existence of a
' calotte ' or ice-cap extending at least 5400 feet farther down the
mountain than the termination of tho present glaciers, and possibly
farther, for in the belt of forest detailed observations could not be
made.
   He agrees that this more extensive glaciation was produced by a
greater elevation of Mount Kenya, and that any theory of universal
glaciation is unnecessary, and indeed opposed by many facts in
African geology.
   He discusses the probable influence of this former glaciation on
the meteorological conditions of the surrounding area and the dis
tribution of its flora and fauna.

LXI. On the Rate of Oxidation of Phosphorus, Sulphur, and
   Aldehyde. By Thomas Ewan, B.Sc, Ph.D., Ude 1851
   Exhibition Scholar in Chemistry at the Owens College*.
                          Introduction.
ACCORDING to our present knowledge the velocity with
        which a chemical change takes place is dependent on
the concentrations of the substances taking part in the change,
and the connexion between the two is of such a nature that
a greater concentration corresponds to a greater velocity.
   Under these circumstances it is of great interest that in a
number of instances oxygen gas appears to act chemically
more vigorously, that is with greater velocity, when it is
dilute than when it is more concentrated.
   The first mention of this behaviour, so far as I know, was
made by Fourcroy f. He says that at the ordinary tempe
rature and pressure pure oxygen is without action on phos
phorus, although ordinary air acts vigorously. In 1798 van
MarumJ found that a piece of phosphorus glowed much
more brightly in rarefied than in ordinary air, and that it
even took fire at very low pressures if surrounded by a little
cotton-wool. These observations were confirmed and extended
by subsequent observers.

50G             Dr. T. Ewan on tlie Rate of Oxidation
   According to Thorpe and Tutton* phosphorous oxide, P406,
shows phenomena in presence of oxygen gas which possess
the strongest resemblance to those exhibited by phosphorus
itself. They suggest that the more rapid reaction at lower
pressures is due to the increased volatility of the phosphorous
oxide.
    Joubertf noticed similar behaviour with sulphur and
arsenic.
   Friedel and LadenburgJ found that a mixture of silicon
hydride, SiH4, and oxygen inflames spontaneously on de
creasing its pressure, and Houton de Labillardiere § had
previously made a similar observation with phosphine (PH3).
   Van de Stadt || mentions that nickel carbonyl, Ni(C0)4,
appears also to behave similarly. Reicher and Jorissenll
found, however, that it is still spontaneously inflammable in
oxygen under a pressure of 13 atmospheres.
   Engelmann ** found that certain Bacteria show a preference
for a certain definite concentration of dissolved oxygen.
 Greater or smaller concentrations seem to be less favourable
to their existence.
   Labillardiere's observation with phosphine was repeated by
van'tHoffft, who found that at ordinary temperatures the
spontaneous inflammation of the mixture took place when
the partial pressure of the oxygen was about ^ atmosphere.
The gases were preserved over a saturated solution of calcium
chloride. When the partial pressure of the oxygen was
higher or lower than ^ atmosphere, only a slow combination
took place.
   H. J. van de Stadt J J in 1893 investigated the subject
more fully in order to find how the velocity of the slow
combustion which precedes the explosion changes with the
concentration. He found that the reaction proceeded slowly
and with a nearly constant velocity, which showed no notice
able acceleration until the explosion-pressure was reached,
when the explosion took place, sometimes at once, sometimes
on standing.
   This reaction was therefore not a very suitable one for the

study of the connexion between the velocity of the change
and the concentration of the oxygen. For this reason, and
at the suggestion of Professor van't Hoflf, I took up the study
of the velocity of the reaction between phosphorus and oxygen.
   Rate of Oxidation of Phosphorus in Moist Oxygen.
                      (a) Belmviour in Air.
   Some measurements have already been recorded by ikeda*.
He found that at 19° the oxidation of phosphorus in moist
air takes place with a velocity which is nearly proportional
to the concentration of the oxygen. At the lower pressures
the roaction went a little faster than is required by exaot
proportionality.
   My first experiments were made in the same way as those
of Ikeda. The apparatus consisted of a bottle of 1£ to 2 litres
capacity with two necks, into one of which a test-tube was
fitted by means of a cork, while the other communicated with
a manometer. The test-tube reached to about the middle of
the bottle, and its lower, closed, end was surrounded by a
cylinder of phosphorus which was kept cool by a current of
water, of the same temperature as the water-bath, which
flowed through the test-tube. The whole apparatus stood in
a large water-bath the temperature of which was kept con
stant. The experiments were made as follows :—The bottle,
containing a little water and air, was placed in the thermostat,
connected with the manometer, and allowed to stand until it
had assumed the temperature of the bath. The phosphorus
cylinder was then quickly placed in position and the pressure
read off. Subsequent readings of the pressure made at con
venient intervals furnished the data from which the velocity
of the reaction was calculated. The concentration of the
oxygen is proportional to its partial pressure so long as the
volume remains constant (which was the case in the method
just described), and the decrease of pressure per minute is
proportional to the quantity of oxygen which undergoes
change per minute—that is, to the velocity of the reaction.
   The pnosphorus was so little acted on during an experiment
that its surface remained practically undiminished.
   The numbers obtained in two experiments made in this
way are given in the following Table (I.). They agree with
those obtained by Ikeda in showing that the velocity of the
reaction (in moist air) diminishes a little more slowly than
the partial pressure of the oxygen. This is seen in the
increase in the values of K' (column 4) . These numbers are

              Influence of the Rate of Evaporation.
   The fact that K' increases as the pressure falls shows that
the reaction takes place somewhat faster at lower pressures
than one would expect if its velocity were directly propor
tional to the pressure. This may be due to the fact that
substances evaporate more rapidly into a gaseous atmosphere
when its pressure is small than when it is larger. There can
be little doubt that the reaction takes place between phos
phorus-vapour and oxygen ; and, furthermore, if it is allow
able to take the phosphorescent light as an indication of the
locality of the reaction, it takes place close to the surface of
the phosphorus so long as the pressure of the oxygen is not
very small*. There are thus grounds for supposing that the
phosphorus-vapour is oxidized as fast as it is evolved from
the surface of the phosphorus, and therefore that the velocity
with which the reaction goes forward will be directly pro
portional to the rate of evaporation of the phosphorus. By
making this assumption, as we shall see, it is at any rate
possible to give a coherent and fairly satisfactory account of
reactions the courses of which would otherwise appear to be
totally exceptional.
   According to Stefan t, when all the other conditions remain
constant, the rate of evaporation of a liquid into a gas is
connected with the pressure of the latter by the following
formula : —
                            t, = Clog——,;
where                                     "
             v = the rate of evaporation,
             P= total pressure of the gas and vapour,
            p' = the vapour-pressure of the liquid,
and          c = some constant.
   Introducing this correction for the changeable velocity of
evaporation into equation (1), we obtain
                      -f=Kp.log^                                   (2)
   In order to integrate this equation we may write p = P — a,
where a is the partial pressure of the nitrogen and aqueous
vapour in the mixture of gases, and therefore constant.
After making this substitution and expanding the logarithm,

the equation may be brought into the form
                 dP rP       1_ 1 i       1 (P<y   &1
This can be easily integrated between the limits P0 and P,
and gives :—
   ^=E7-p+(^fe")[?-^-&-£-H
   For phosphorus at ordinary temperatures, p' is so small
compared with a that the equation may, without appreciable
error, be written
The values of K in the fifth column of Table I. have been
calculated by means of this equation. The numbers are more
nearly constant than those obtained by means of the uncor
rected equation (I).
   It appears, therefore, from these experiments that the
velocity of the reaction is proportional to the pressure of the
oxygen. This cannot be true at all pressures, however, for
when the pressure of the oxygen is greater than a certain
limit the velocity of the reaction becomes zero.

   A further series of measurements was therefore made in
which the whole range of pressures at which the reaction
takes place was studied..
   For this purpose a somewhat different form of apparatus
was used. After various trials that shown in fig. 1 was found
to be most convenient. The glass vessel EPA (50-70 cubic
centim. capacity) was conected by means of a capillary tube
    millim. diameter) with the tap B and with the mano
meter D. The joint at 0 was usually made by means of a
ground-glass joint luted with mercury ; occasionally a thick
indiarubber tube was used. The manometer was arranged
so that the mercury always stood at the same height in
the limb D, the volume of the apparatus therefore remained
constant. A mercury- gauge was mostly used, but some of the
experiments at lower pressures were made with a manometer

            of Phosphorus, Sulphur, and Aldehyde.            511
 in which the mercury was replaced by bromnaphthalene.
This allowed of a more accurate reading of the pressure, and
 the vapour of the bromnaphthalene did not appear to inter
 fere in any way with the course of the reaction. The phos
 phorus was purified by melting it under a uilute solution
of potassium bichromate and sulphuric acid, and carefully
 washing it.
    A piece of this phosphorus was brought into the apparatus
through E, molted at P, distributed in as thin a layer as
possible over the upper surface of the bulb, and allowed to
 solidify in that position. This was generally done in an
atmosphere of carbon dioxide, sometimes in vacuo. By this
means as large a surface of the phosphorus as possible is
exposed to the cooling action of the water in the bath in
which the apparatus is plunged. The product of the oxida
tion also tends to fall and not to collect on the surface of tho
phosphorus. A little water was placed in the apparatus at A ,
and E sealed up before tho blowpipe.
    After placing the apparatus in position in the water-bath,
it was evacuated as completely as possible and oxygen allowed
to enter. This operation was repeated several times. A
precaution which is of importance is to keep the phosphorus
cold ; otherwise, on allowing the oxygen to flow into the
vacuous apparatus, it is very apt to take fire. This is
especially the case when the oxygen is dry and the pressure
is very low ; with oxygen which had been dried by passing
over phosphorous pentoxide I have even seen the spontaneous
inflammation occur at 0° C. The pressure was probably less
than that due to 1 millim. of mercury.

512              Dr. T. Ewan on the Rate of Oxidation
   No attempt was made to measure the absolute velocity of
the reaction, as this would have involved the accurate mea
surement of the area of the surface of the phosphorus. The
constants obtained are therefore different in each experiment,

   Determinations of the limiting pressure, above which no
reaction takes place, were only made at 20°. In one experi
ment at 20°"2 (see Table II.) the reaction just began when
the pressure of the oxygen was 696 millim. In another at
20o,5 it began at 671 millim., but not at. 723 millim. We
may therefore say that at a temperature of 20°-21° phos
phorus will just begin to oxidize in wet oxygen when its
pressure is about 700 millim.
   Joubert* gives two series of experiments on the pressure
at which phosphorus just begins to be luminous in oxygen.
At 20O-2, one series gave 787 millim., the other 666 millim.
The pressure at which oxidation just begins appears, there
fore, to be identical with that at which the phosphorescence
just becomes visible.
   The curves in fig. 2 show the connexion between the pres
sure and the velocity of the reaction between phosphorus and
wet oxygen. The experiments at 20° being the most com
plete have been used in drawing them. The values of the
velocities of reaction have been obtained by dividing the
successive decrements of the pressure by the corresponding
increments of the time.
   These values of -~ are taken as ordinates, and the mean

-v

              of Phosphorus, Sulphur, and Aldehyde.        517
curve I. (fig. 2) will show that the velocity of the reaction
beginning with the value 0 at 700 millim. increases at first
very rapidly as the pressure falls, then varies between narrow
limits over a considerable range of pressure (viz., from 500-
100 millim.), and finally decreases again rapidly. Curve II.
(fig. 2) is obtained by dividing the values of      from which
curve I. is constructed by the corresponding values of
       p
log p      T, the rate of evaporation of the phosphorus. That
is, it represents the rate at which the reaction would go
forward if the rate of evaporation of the phosphorus wore
constant. The numbers so obtained (represented in the figure
by circles) evidently lie on a straight line passing through
the origin. That is, the corrected velocities are proportional
to the partial pressures of the oxygen. This, however, is
only true up to a pressure of about 520 millim. At higher
pressures the curve changes its direction, and the velocity
very quickly decreases to 0.
    A more accurate way of testing the truth of this relation
 ship is to be found in the calculation of the values of the
 constant K in equation 2 b. On looking over the numbers
 given in Table II., it will be seen that the values of K (at
 20°) are approximately constant at pressures smaller than
 550 millim. The numbers sometimes increase, sometimes
 decrease ; the variations may therefore be ascribed to experi
 mental error.
    The same is true for the experiments made at 30°, for
 pressures between 200 and 25 millim. (no measurements
 were made at pressures greater than 200 millim.). Below
 25 millim., however, there is always a marked decrease
 in the values of K, and traces of a similar behaviour are
 to be found in the experiments at 20°, and also in the
 one experiment at 9°. This diminution in the velocity of
 the reaction at low pressures may possibly have been due
 to the steam and nitrogen with which the oxygen was mixed
 hindering the interdiffusion of the oxygen and phosphorus-
 vapour.
    We may conclude, therefore, that wet oxygen at ordinary
 temperatures acts on phosphorus with a velocity which may
  be represented by the equation
                          dp v           .   P

518           Dr. T. Ewan on the Rate of Oxidation
Above a certain limiting pressure (which probably varies
with the temperature) this ceases to be true, the reaction
taking place very much more slowly.
                   Phosphorus and Dry Oxygen.
   Turning now to the action of dried oxygen on phosphorus
quite a different result is obtained.
   The experiments were made by the method and with the
apparatus already described. The water in the glass vessel
at A (fig. 1) was merely replaced by phosphorus pentoxide.
In the first experiment the oxygen was allowed to remain in
contact with the phosphorus pentoxide for a week, in the
second, for two days. The numbers obtained are given in
the following Table.

   The reaction now first began at a much lower pressure than
formerly. Under a pressure of oxygen of 377 millim. it did
not begin ; it just began when the pressure was reduced to
202 millim. Curve I. (fig. 3) shows the connexion between
                 Fig. 3.—Phosphorus and Dry Oxygen.
the pressure of the oxygen and the velocity with which it
acts on the phosphorus. The curve is constructed from the
figures given in Table III. in the same way as before. Setting

520           Dr. T. Ewan on the Rate of Oxidation
 out from the pressure of 200 millim., at which the velocity of
the reaction is 0, it appears to increase continuously as the
pressure falls, and not to reach a maximum value as is the
case when the gas is moist. Curve II. (fig. 3) is obtained by
dividing the values of the rate of reaction from which curve I.
is drawn by the corresponding values of the rate of evapora
tion of the phosphorus, and plotting the numbers so obtained
against the pressures. The numbers are so irregular that it
is not easy to make out the true nature of the curve. The
values of the ordinates of the part of the curve between 0 and
 70 millim., however, appear to be proportional to the square
 roots of the corresponding values of the pressure.
    We have, accordingly,
                      -t = K^P^                 •   " •  •  (3)
which is the same equation as has already been found to hold
good for phosphorus and moist oxygen, except that the velo
city of the reaction is put proportional to the square root of
the partial pressure of the oxygen instead of to the pressure
itself.
   This equation may be integrated by expanding the logarithm
in the same way as before : this gives, neglecting small
terms,
        -Kj= A (P-a)J+              -l^P-a^ + const.
   The value of the constant is obtained from the condition
that P = P0, when t=0 ; P0 being the total pressure at the
beginning of the experiment. Introducing the value of the
constant, we obtain
^^^[(Po-^^CP-a^+^-l^Po-a^-CP-a)*].
It is by means of this expression that the values of Kx given
in Table III. have been calculated. The numbers show that
Kx is approximately constant from a pressure of 60-70 millim.
downwards ; at higher pressures it diminishes. The irregu
larity of the numbers is probably due, in part at any rate, to
the deposition of a coating of oxide on the surface of the
phosphorus. We may therefore say that the rate of eva
poration of the phosphorus being supposed constant, it is
acted on by dry oxygen with a velocity which is proportional
to the square root of its pressure. This is only true (at 20°)
up to a pressure of some 60-70 millim. ; above this pressure
the velocity decreases. It is of interest that the greatest

             of Plwsphorus, Sulphur, and Aldehyde.             521
velocity of the reaction occurs in this case at very nearly the
same pressure as that which van't Hoff found to be most
favourable to the reaction between phosphine and oxygen.
   In Table' III. tho values of K calculated from equation (2 b)
(in which the rate of reaction is put proportional to the pres
sure) are also given. They are much less constant than the
values of Kp
                     Sulphur and Oxygen.
   The course of this reaction is more regular than that of the
last, because the products of oxidation being volatile the surface
of the sulphur remains unchanged.
   Tho first experiments wero made by a method similar to
that which was used with phosphorus, the volume being kept
constant and the pressure allowed to change. The essential
part of the apparatus is shown in fig. 4. It consisted of a
                               Fig. 4.
tube with two bulbs blown upon it, B, S, and of 60-70 cubic
centim. capacity. At S, 1-2 grams of pure sulphur, at B,
5-6 grams of soda-lime were placed, and the end C sealed up
before the blowpipe. The capillary-tube D connected the
apparatus with a manometer, and with the tap E, by means
of which it was filled with oxygen. The whole was heated

 gration" of equation 3. Owing to the magnitude of j),
equation (3 a) is insufficiently accurate, and two further
 terms of the expansion of the logarithm have to be included.

 the exception of the first number, the values of Kj are very

 this reaction.

   It was found that more satisfactory results could be ob
tained by using a different method, in which the pressure was
kept constant and the diminution of volume measured. This
method has the advantage that it allows several measure
ments of the velocity to be made at each pressure ; by this
means accidental variations can be eliminated. It was noticed,
for example, almost invariably that at the beginning of an
experiment (the pressure being constant) the rate at which
the volume diminished was not constant. The reaction com
menced too fast, and only reached a constant velocity after
some time. This doubtless accounts for the abnormally
large value of Kl at the beginning of the experiment in
Table IV.
   The apparatus finally adopted is shown in fig. 5.
                              Fig. 5.
   The tube S containing the sulphur and oxygen remains
unchanged. It was attached to a graduated tube A, con
taining mercury, the height of which could be changed by
means of the reservoir B. C is a three-way tap ; D a
sensitive gauge containing bromnaphthalene, it serves to show
when the pressure in the part of the apparatus to its left is
equal to that in the reservoir F. The tap E serves to put the
parts of the apparatus to the right and to the left of D in
communication with each other when necessary. The reservoir
F, which serves to keep the pressure constant, is in com
munication with the manometer G and with an air-pump.

524            Dr. T. Ewan on the Rate of Oxidation
The part of the apparatus to the left of D having been filled
with oxygen at a somewhat greater pressure than exists in F,
the tap E is opened for a moment to equalize the pressure on
both sides of D, and the position of the mercury in A read
off. By raising B the pressure of the oxygen can always be
kept equal to the constant pressure in F. The diminution of
volume per minute, when reduced to standard pressure, is
then proportional to the velocity of the reaction. When the
velocity has become constant, the pressure in F is reduced,
the tap E opened to equalize the pressure again, and further
readings made at the new pressure.
    The following Table contains the numbers obtained by this
method.
    In it — is the diminution of the volume per minute, the
volume being measured at pressure P.
    ^7 is the rate of change of the volume, calculated for a

of oxygen which is converted into sulphur dioxide per
 minute, that is to the rate of the reaction.

     The constant K2 is calculated from the following equation,
  which is essentially identical with equation 3 :—

            of Phosphorus, Sulphur, and Aldehyde.           525
   k (Table V.) is calculated by the formula
It is evident that the formula in which the velocity of the
reaction is put proportional to the square root of the pressure
is in much better agreement with the truth than that in
which it is put proportional to the pressure itself.

velocity of the reaction and the pressure.    Curve I. is drawn
with the values of -v- as ordinates and pressures as abscissae.
It has a strong general resemblance to the curve representing
the velocity of the reaction between phosphorus and dry
oxygen. The velocity continuously increases as the pressure
falls. Curve II. is drawn with ordinates proportional to the
square roots of the corresponding pressures. The experi
mental values of the velocity of the reaction corrected for the
rate of evaporation of the sulphur, viz. :

526            Dr. T. Ewan on the Rate of Oxidation
 are represented in the figure by circles. The theoretical
 curve evidently represents these points with fair approximation.
    It is interesting to notice that the whole curve here, up to
 800 millini., corresponds to the part of the curve for phos
phorus and dry oxygen between 0 and 70 millim. It would
be of interest to make experiments with sulphur and oxygen
at higher pressures in order to find out whether a maximum
velocity occurs similar to that found with phosphorus.
                     Aldehyde and Oxygen.
   When, as in the experiments which have just been
described, the substance which is undergoing oxidation is a
solid or a liquid, its rate of evaporation becomes such an
important factor in determining the rate of the reaction, that
it is not easy to make out with perfect certainty what rdle is
played by the concentration of the oxygen. It appears,
however, very probable that in dry oxygen the rate of the
reaction is proportional to the square root of its concentration.
In order to further test the truth of this result, experiments
were made on the reaction between aldehyde-vapour and
oxygen. The reaction was found to go on with convenient
speed at 20°. As aldehyde boils at 21 under a pressure of
760 millim., it was assumed that aldehyde-vapour at 20° and
under pressures not exceeding 550 millim. might be regarded
with sufficient approximation as a perfect gas. Numerous
attempts were made to absorb the acetic acid formed, by
means of some solid substance without action on the aldehyde.
PbO, ZnO, BaC03, KC2H3Os (anhydrous), were tried, but
they all appeared to cause a more or less rapid diminution in
the quantity of the aldehyde-vapour. The experiments were
therefore made without any such absorbent.
   The apparatus used (fig. 7) was essentially the same as that
which was employed by van't Hoff for the study of the forma
tion of water from electrolytic gas (Etudes de dyn. chimigue,
p. 53), and for the study of the decomposition by heat of PH3
and AsH3. The reaction takes place in the bulb A (fig. 7) : this
has a capacity of 60 to 70 cubic centim., and is immersed in a
water-bath maintained at a constant temperature. The tubes
connecting A to the rest of the apparatus, which are not
plunged in the water, are made of capillary diameter in order
to diminish as far as possible the volume of gas which is at
the temperature of the air. The pressure of the gas in the
apparatus is determined by means of the manometer BCD.
By raising or lowering the tube 0, the level of the mercury

             of Phosphorus, Sulphur, and Aldehyde.            527
 was always brought to B before a reading was made. The
 pressure of the gas in the apparatus is then obtained by
 reading the difference in level between B and D : for this
 purpose a vertical millimetre-scale was generally used, some
 times a cathetometer.
    C D is a barometer, the lower end of which just dips under
 the mercury at C. The air-trap at E is useful in preventing
 bubbles of air, which sometimes leak through the indiarubber
 tube, from passing back into the apparatus.
    By means of the three-way tap H the apparatus can be
 connected either with an air-pump" through F, or with a little
 vessel containing liquid aldehyde (G), which is ground to fit
 the lower limb of the tap. The apparatus having been
                              Fig. 7.
evacuated as completely as possible, the tap is turned so that
the aldehyde-vapour distils into it. By repeating this opera
tion several times, the air may be completely replaced by
aldehyde-vapour at any desired pressure up to 500-600 millim.
This having been done the tap H is closed, the apparatus put
in position in the water-bath, and the pressure of the aldehyde-
vapour observed. F is then connected with a tube delivering
pure oxygen dried over CaClj, which is allowed to flow

528           Dr. T. Ewan on the Rate of Oxidation
through FH until it is full of oxygen. The tap H is then
quickly opened, to admit the oxygen, closed again, and
the pressure read off. Further readings are then made
from time to time until the reaction is ended. The gases
take some time to diffuse into each other, so that the velocity
of the reaction was frequently rather small at the beginning.
    The calculation of the experiments required a knowledge
of the composition of the gas which remained in the apparatus
at the end of the experiment. As soon as the last reading of
the pressure had been made, therefore, a very dilute solution
 of caustic potash was allowed to flow into the apparatus from a
 weighed flask. The difference between the volume of the
 apparatus (determined by weighing it full of water) and the
 volume of the caustic-potash solution drawn into it, gave the
 volume of oxygen and nitrogen contained in the residue.
 Caustic potash was used in order to polymerize any aldehyde
 left.
    The mixture of oxygen and nitrogen was then transferred
to a graduated tube, and shaken with an alkaline solution of
pyrogallol. The part which was left unabsorbed was taken to
 be nitrogen. The transference of the residual gas from the
 bulb A to the graduated tube was effected by running water
 in through the capillary tube K after breaking off its sealed
end.
    In many of tho earlier experiments a comparatively large
 quantity of gas remained which was not absorbed by the
solution of pyrogallol and caustic potash. It was noticed,
however, finally that this gas was inflammable, and that its
formation was accompanied by some action of the mixture of
aldehyde and oxygen on the mercury in the manometer, a
white substance, which was insoluble in water, being formed.
    On protecting the mercury by placing a very small quantity
 of bromnaphthalene over its surface, no formation of the
 white substance occurred, and the gas which remained unacted
 upon by the pyrogallol was much smaller in quantity than
formerly, and no longer inflammable. It is probable also that
the reaction is accelerated by light. The following experi
ment may be quoted in support of this view. The temperature
 was 19°-98 to 20°-07.
    The constant K was calculated by means of equation (5),
 which was found to apply to this reaction. The value of the
constant appears to be influenced by the brightness of the
light. For this reason the experiments were finally made in
the dark. It appears also to be of some importance to keep
the apparatus as clean as possible. It was generally allowed

               of Phosphorus, Sulphur, and Aldehyde.                          529
to remain over night filled with a solution of potassium per
manganate and hydrochloric acid. The manganese dioxide
formed was removed by means of oxalic acid ; the apparatus
was then well washed with distilled water and dried by a
current of air.

   Another experiment at 21°"4 gave no reaction when the
pressure of the oxygen was 599 millim., and also when it was
reduced to 530 millim. the reaction did not begin.
   The calculation of the amount of change which had occurred
at any moment, from the change of pressure, is complicated
by the solvent action of the liquid acetic acid formed on the
aldehyde-vapour : owing to this the amount of change at any

            of Phosphorus, Sulphur, and Aldehyde.            531
given moment is not simply proportional to the diminution
of the pressure.
   Suppose that at the commencement of the experiment, the
partial pressure of the aldehyde were =a milliin., that of the
oxygen = b milliin., and that of the nitrogen = N millim.
And let P be the total pressure of the gas at any time, t
minutes after the beginning of the experiment. Suppose also
that at the same instant x millim. of oxygen have united with
2x millim. of aldehyde. At first the acetic acid formed
remains as vapour, and as its density at 20° is double the
normal value", we shall have 2 volumes of aldehyde-vapour
and 1 volume of oxygen condensing to form 1 volume of
acetic-acid vapour. That is, the acetic-acid vapour will
occupy the same volume and exert the same pressure as the
oxygen from which it is formed ; and the pressure of the
mixture will be
                  P=(a-2*) + (b-x) +*+N
                   =a + b— 2^+N.
   The pressure at the beginning of the experiment (P0) was
equal to a + i + N, so that we obtain
                           2#=P0-P.
   After a time the acetic-acid vapour will reach its maximum
pressure (say m), after which liquid acetic acid will be formed,
and its quantity will be proportional to (x—m), that is
= k(x—m). If we assume that the quantity of aldehyde
dissolved in the acetic acid follows Henry's law, it will be
proportional to the pressure of the gaseous aldehyde and to
the quantity of liquid acetic acid ; that is, to kf(x—m)p2, where
p3 is the pressure of the aldehyde-vapour.
   The pressure of the aldehyde-vapour at any moment is its
original pressure diminished by the part which has undergone
chemical reaction and by the . part dissolved in the acetic
acid ; that is
                    p3 = a — 2x— LJ(x— m)ps,
or                     __    a— 2x                             ...
                    Pa-l+kJ{x-m)                               ()
   It may be pointed out that even if the assumption that
aldehyde-vapour dissolved in acetic acid follows Henry's law
is not strictly accurate, no great error will be committed,
because the quantity dissolved is not large.
   We also have the equation expressing the total pressure P

532           Dr. T. Ewan on the Rate of Oxidation
as the sum of the pressures of oxygen (b—x), aldehyde ps,
acetic-acid vapour to, and nitrogen N, viz. :—
                       P = (b — x) +p3 + m + N.
   Substituting the value of p2 just found, we get
                F=(b-x)+            "~2*   ,+m + N.
   From this equation x (the diminution in the oxygen
pressure) may be obtained when k1 is known. The analysis
of the gas at the end of an experiment gives a direct deter
mination of x from which Id may be found. The expression
is unfortunately a quadratic in x, and is best solved by
 successive approximations, which, however, makes the calcu
lations somewhat laborious.
   The connexion between the velocity with which oxygen
and aldehyde-vapour unite to form acetic acid and the con
centration of the gases (or their partial pressures, which are
proportional to the concentrations) is expressed by the
equation
                        ~"Jr = K' Vft-.fr.                     (5)
Pj = the partial pressure of the oxygen, p2 that of the aldehyde.
 — ^~ is the rate at which the pressure of the oxygen
diminishes.

   The constant is obtained from the condition that x=0,
when < = 0.
   This form of the integrated equation can only be used when
(26 — a) is positive, because its square root occurs in the
expression. For the case that excess of aldehyde is present
at the commencement of the experiment, and (26— a) there
fore negative, the integrated equation may be brought into the
following form:—
 Kt= ^iL'v a ton"1 7^r> +k'(b-v)i + con8t • (56)
        2hr)                (—)
   The values of K in Table VI. are calculated by means of
equations (5a) and (56), and show that up to a pressure of
450 millim. these equations are in harmony with the experi
mental results.
   When the partial pressure of the oxygen is higher than
about 450 millim., however, the values of K decrease. This
points to the existence of an upper limit of pressure, above
which the reaction either stops altogether or goes forward
with a velocity very much smaller than that which would be
deduced from equation 5.
   As a matter of fact, in the two last experiments given in
Table VI. no reaction occurred when the pressure of the
 oxygen exceeded 530 millim. Further experiments are, how
 ever, needed in order to put this very interesting behaviour
 beyond doubt.
    We may say, therefore, that oxygen and aldehyde-vapour
 react with formation of acetic acid with a velocity which is
 proportional to the pressure of the aldehyde-vapour and to
 the square root of the pressure of the oxygen. It is possible
 that a pressure of oxygen exists above which this is no longer
 true. At 20° this pressure appears to be that due to about
 450 millim. of mercury.

  —-7-1 is the rate at which the system AiBi . . . changes into

 system, CA, CB, &c. the concentrations of the substances A, B . . .
    In cases in which the numbers of molecules taking part in
 a reaction are unknown, measurements of the velocity of the
 reaction may be made use of for their determination.
    Applying this to the reaction between aldehyde and oxygen,
 we have — -j? in equation 6 proportional to — -J- in
 equation 5. CA we may put proportional to the pressure of
 the aldehyde-vapour, and CB to the pressure of the oxygen
 gas. Making these substitutions in 6, we get
                      ~~dt =C00Bt-P?-Pl
 and comparing this with 5, we see that m= 1 and n=^. The
 reaction between aldehyde and oxygen may therefore be written
                      C8H40 + 0=C2H402.
 We must suppose that the reaction consists in the addition of
 an oxygen atom to a molecule of aldehyde.
    The assumption that a certain small number of oxygen atoms
 exist normally in oxygen gas, is in accordance with our present
 knowledge on the subject. Williamson was led by his studies
on the formation of ethers to propose the theory that the atoms
 of which the molecules of a gas are composed frequently
change partners. For this to be possible, a certain number
of atoms must be at any moment in the act of transition, that
is froe. The theory of Clausius, baaed on the phenomena of
electrolytic conductivity, and more recently that of Arrhenius,
supposes a similar condition to exist in solutions of electro
lytes. In 1884 J. J. Thomson * developed a mathematical
theory of chemical reactions between gases, based on the ideas
of Williamson and Clausius ; the results are in agreement with
those obtained experimentally with aldehyde and oxygen.
   The probability of the existence of free atoms in oxygen
gas may be shown in another way. There can be little doubt,
from analogy, that the oxygen molecule would, at a sufficiently
high temperature, be dissociated into its atoms. Equilibrium
will be established when the concentration of the atoms has
reached a certain value which is determined by the equation
                            (02)     ^(0)>
where C(0» is the concentration of the oxygen molecules and

              of Phosphorus, Sulphur, and Aldehyde.                   535
C(0) that of the atoms, k is a constant which depends on the
temperature*. As the heat of formation of the oxygen
molecule from its atoms is probably positive, the equilibrium
will change with falling temperature, in such a way that the
concentration of the ox}'gen atoms will diminish. It will,
however, probably never become nothing. If this be true at
ordinary temperatures, we shall have
                         C(0) = const. VC^,.
   As the concentration of the oxygen atoms is small, we can put
the concentration of the oxygen molecules proportional to the
pressure of the gas, and the concentration of the oxygen atoms
will then be proportional to the square root of the pressure of
oxygen. If we assume, therefore, that the atoms alone take
part in the oxidation of the aldehyde, we shall have the
velocity of the reaction always proportional to the square
root of the pressure of the oxygen.
    Although the results of the experiments with aldehyde admit
of such a simple interpretation, it is doubtful whether this is
also the case with those obtained with phosphorus and sulphur.
    We should expect the connexion between the velocity of
the reaction and the concentration of the oxygen to be less
simple than that actually found.
    Possibly in the case of sulphur and phosphorus with dry
oxygen the reaction takes place in stages ; for example,
                            P4+0 = P40t.
The velocity of the whole reaction would then be the sum of
the velocities of the part reactions, each one of which would
be proportional to the concentration of the oxygen atoms.
This view is also in agreement with the fact that when phos
phorus is burnt with a limited supply of oxygen, the lower
oxides, such as P406, are formed.
    The fact that the presence of moisture accelorates the oxi
dation of phosphorus J and sulphur is also in accordance with
the view that the oxidation is due to the presence of oxygen
atoms ; for Professor J. J. Thomson § has found that it is
   * See van't Hoff, Etudes, p. 127.
   t The existence of this oxide, discovered by Le Verrier, is rendered
probable by the work of Reinizer and Goldschmidt (Berl. Ber. xiii. p. 845,
 1880).
   X In very dry oxygen phosphorus apparently does not oxidize at all.
(H. B. Baker, Phil. Trans. 1888, p. 671.) Unfortunately Baker does not
mention particularly the pressure under which the oxygen stood. Sulphur
still burns in extremely dry oxygen, but with much greater difficulty
than when the gas is moist. (Baker ; and also Dewar, Froc. Roy. Soc.

536     Oxidation of Phospliorus, Sulphur, and Aldehyde.
much more easy to cause an electric discharge (without elec
trodes) to pass through moist oxygen than through the gas
when it is dry. The moisture apparently favours the forma
tion of the atoms which carry the discharge. It must be
confessed, however, that this view does not explain the
formation of ozone which accompanies the oxidation of phos
phorus, not only in moist oxygen but also, according to
Marchand*, in the dry gas.
   The complicated nature of the reaction which takes place
when phosphorus is oxidized in presence of water makes it
impossible to do more than guess at an interpretation of the
results obtained. Perhaps, however, the different nature of
the equation representing the connexion between the velocity
of the reaction and the pressure of the oxygen is due to the
water taking part in the reaction.
   The interesting fact that a pressure of oxygen exists at
which the oxidation has a maximum velocity in the case of
phosphorus, and perhaps also in that of aldehyde, requires
further investigation before any satisfactory attempt can be
made to account for it.
   In conclusion it is perhaps worth noticing that, in one or
two other cases which have been studied by other observers,
the results are in harmony with the theory of Williamson.
    Le Chatelier f has shown, using the results of Hautefeuille
and Margottet, that, at constant temperature, the equilibrium
which occurs when chlorine, hydrogen, and oxygen are
exploded together can be represented by the expression

 LXII. On tlie Expressibilily of a Determinant in Terms of its
             Coaxial Minors. By Thomas Muir, LL.D*
 1. T N a memoir on " A certain Class of Generating Func-
     -L tions in the Theory of Numbers," recently published
in the Philosophical Transactions t, Major MacMahon, F.R.S.,
establishes the following noteworthy theorem :—
    In the case of every determinant of even order greater than
 the second lliere are two special relations between its coaxial
minors, and each of tliese two relations can be thrown into a
form which ex/iibits the determinant as an irrational function
ofits coaxial minors : in the case of a determinant of odd order,
on the other hand, no such relations exist, and it is not possible
to express the determinant as a function of its coaxial minors.
    He deduces the theorem readily from another to the effect
that—
    Tliere are 2"— n' + n — 2 relations between tlie coaxial minors
of any determinant of the nth order.
    His proof of this latter theorem, however, is not by any
means simple, occupying as many as eight pages (pp. 133-14:0)
of the memoir. By reason of the importance of the theorem
a simpler proof is much to be desired, and part of my object
at present is to supply the want.
    2. I start from the familiar proposition, that if the rows of
a determinant of the n,h order be multiplied by xuxt, x3...,xK
respectively, and the columns be then divided by the same
quantities, the determinant is unaltered in value ; but I prefer
to include it in a more general but equally evident theorem,
viz. :—
   If tlie rows of a determinant of the nth order be multiplied
by x1; Xj, x3, . . . , xn respectively, and tlie columns be then divided
by Xi, Xj, x3, . . . , xn respectively, the determinant is unaltered in
value, and each of tlie minors of tlie transformed determinant is,
to a factor pres, equal to the corresponding minor of the original
determinant, (lie connecting multiplier being xi, x^ Xi . . ./xr x, xt . . .
if the minor belong to the hlh, kth, 1th, .. . rows, and r*, s"», t01, . . .
columns of the original.
   From this we have manifestly the corollary :—
   The connecting multiplier in tlie case of tlie coaxial minors,
as in the case of the whole determinant, is 1 : in other words,
the coaxial minors remain unaltered by the transformation.

   Next it is clear tliat
   Xj, xs, Xj, . . , x„ may be so chosen that all the elements of any
one of the rows or columns, except the diagonal element, shall
be I.
   For example, the first row,
                                     .fa-
may be made to take the form
by giving xu xt, x„...,xn the values 1, au, alt, ... , alm
respectively.
   It follows, therefore, that
   Any determinant of the n* order may be transformed so as
to liaxe 1 for n — 1 of its elements, and yet the determinant itself
and all its coaxial minors remain unaltered in value.
   3. This is the same as saying that 2" — 1 quantities, viz.
the determinant and its coaxial minors, can be expressed in
terms of n*— (n— 1) others, viz. the modified elements, which
are not equal to unity. Eliminating the latter, and we have
2" — li' + n— 2 relations connecting the former—and this is
Major MacMahon's auxiliary theorem.
   4. The proof leaves no doubt as to the existence of two rela
tions between any determinant, when of even order higher
than the second, and its coaxial minors : but it is worth while
to intensify the conviction by putting the relations actually
in evidence for a particular determinant. Perhaps the deter
minant which lends itself most easily to the end in view is

LXIII. A yfode of Calculating a Limit to the Direct Effect of
    Great Eccentricity of the Earth's Orbit on Terrestrial
    Temperatures, showing the Inadequacy of the Astronomical
    Theory of Ice Ages awl Genial Ages. By Edward P.
   Culverwell, M.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin*.
THE fundamental assumption made by Dr. James Croll
       in his well-known writings on the Glacial Periods, and
subsequently adopted by Sir Roberts. Ball in 'The Cause
of an Ice Age,' is that we may attain to some approxi
mate idea of tho lowering of terrestrial temperatures, due to
greater winter distance from the sun, by tho following con
siderations :—
   Were it not for solar heat the earth would sink to what
Ball calls its natural zero, which must be nearly the absolute
zero of temperature. Hence tho effect of the sun-heat is to
maintain it at its present excess above that temperature, and
any decrease in sun-heat will be accompanied by a more or
less proportionate decrease in the excess of the earth's tempera
ture above the natural zero. To be on the safe sido, however,
Croll takes this natural zero as a temperature of — 239° F.
 (Pouillet's temperature of space), and Ball as —300° F. Croll,
in chap. xix. of ' Climate and Time,' which he devotes to this
subject, supposes the midwinter temperature in an epoch of
great eccentricity to be proportional to the sun-heat received on
midwinter day—a supposition open to the obvious criticism
that the adjustment of temperature to sun-heat can hardly bo
instantaneous. This is probably the reason why Ball modified
the argument and takes the average winter temperature as
proportional to the average daily winter heat from equinox to
equinox.
   I shall show, by actual comparison with terrestrial tempera
 tures, that this assumption of the proportion between the

542       Mr. E. P. Culverwell on the Inadequacy of tlte
temperature at a place and the sun-heat received is utterly
wide of the mark ; hut first I will endeavour to trace
the origin of Croll's mistake. In 1830 Herschel wrote
a paper " On the Astronomical causes which may influence
Geological Phenomena," and in it he dealt with the possible
changes of terrestrial temperatnre dne to changes in the
earths minor axis, making use of the argument that a
small percentage alteration above the absolute zero (which he
says some place at —1000° F., some at — 5000° F., and some
lower still) due to a small percentage change in the annual
 quantity of sun-heat received would produce all the great
 change in temperature required by geologists. In such a case
the method is perfectly valid, except that terrestrial radiation
 should not be taken as simply proportional to absolute tem-
 f>erature. In the centuries during which the earth receives
  ess annual heat from the sun we may fairly suppose that a
 practically permanent state is reached in which the heat
 annually received by the globe as a whole is equal to that
radiated by the globe as a whole. In that case we cannot
complain of Herschel in 1830 treating the radiation as pro
portional to the temperature, and then treating the percentage
decrease in temperature of the globe as a whole as equal to the
[>ercentage decrease in sun-heat received. Had he taken the
  aw of cooling as at present stated—t. e. radiation varies as the
 fourth power of absolute temperature—the percentage decrease
 in temperature would (for small changes) only be one fourth
 of the percentage decrease in heat received. Subsequently
 Herschel, in a rather confused paragraph in his ' Outlines,'
 369 a, referred to by Croll (p. 37) as his authority, appears
 to apply the same method to calculating temperature differ
 ences between the northern and southern hemispheres in
 the period of great eccentricity. But he rejects the calcula
 tion immediately after on the ground that loss of heat in
 winter, through greater distance from the sun, is compensated
 for by greater duration of winter. Hence the paragraph does
 not really seem to justify Croll's application. For Croll applies
 the method to the temperature of limited portions of the
 earth's surface, in which, owing to the fact that heat is con
 tinually being transferred from one region to another, there
 is never a time at which the gain by sun-heat is equal to the
 loss by radiation.
    The statement just made shows that for Croll's argument
 to have any practical validity as a method of calculating the
winter temperatures in the epoch of great eccentricity, it is
necessary not only that the temperature adjustments shall bo
made with great rapidity but also that the direct effect of

     Astronomical Theory of Ice Ages and Genial Ages.        543
sun-heat on terrestrial temperatures in the latitudes with which
glaciation is concerned shall be great compared with that of
the heat transferred from latitude to latitude by air and ocean
currents. That this is not the case in regard to the changes
of temperature from summer to winter, we have a ready means
of showing ; indeed it appears that the direct effect of winter
sun-heat in northern latitudes is but a trifling factor in
keeping the temperature above the "natural zero" when
compared with the heat transferred from place to place. For
consider the equator : it receives nearly the same daily sun-
heat during winter and summer, and its temperature stands
continuously about 380° F. above Ball's " natural zero." Hence,
if we calculate and then plot on a diagram the average daily
summer and winter sun-heats for each latitude, on such a
scale that the equatorial sun-heat is represented by 380, then
the ordinates giving the summer and winter sun-heats for
the different latitudes should also, if Herschel's principle
were applicable, give the summer and winter excesses of their
temperatures above the natural zero. In fig. 1 this has been
done for latitudes 40° to 90°, the only ones we are concerned
with in dealing with the Glacial Period. I have also shown
by the dotted lines the mean of the ' Challenger's ' January
and July temperatures for the meridians 90° E. and 90° W.
passing through the middle of the great Asiatic and American
continents up to latitude 70°, beyond which reliable informa
tion cannot be obtained. The scale of sun-heat is shown at
the left side, and the scale of Fahrenheit temperatures at the
right of the centre line. By examining the figure we see
that even in the Continental areas, where the most extreme
variations are observed, the midwinter temperatures bear
no relation whatever to the very small amount of winter
sun-heat; so that we infer that the transference of heat
from one latitude to another is the chief factor in winter
temperatures.
   If we were to follow Croll's method, and take the mid
summer and midwinter sun-heats instead of the daily average,
the discrepancy shown in the figure between actual tempera
tures and sun-neats would be enormously increased.
   To complete the criticism, let us examine the most extreme
of all climates, that of Yakutsh in Siberia. Here the mid
summer temperature rises to about 370° over the " natural
zero" and the midwinter sinks to 260°. But the daily
average sun-heat in summer is to the daily average in winter
as 1300 is to 260, or as 370 is to 74. Hence if the mid
winter temperature be right, the midsummer ought to be
 1000° F., or if the midsummer be right, the midwinter ought

544      Mr. E. P. Oulverwell on the Inadequacy of the
to be — 226° F. If, following Croll's method, we calculate
the midsummer and midwinter sun-heats, we find the ratio
to be 7600 to 260, or 370 to 12*5. It is unnecessary to dwell on
the discrepancy between these figures and the temperatures.

     Astronomical Tlteory of Ice Ages and Genial Ages.       515
   When, therefore, there is such a complete absence of pro
portion between the summer and winter temperatures and the
summer and winter sun-heats, what ground can bo assigned
for the assumption of a rough proportion between the changes
in the summer or winter temperatures and the changes in the
corresponding sun-beats due to eccentricity? Even if the
temperatures themselves did show a certain rough proportion
to the sun-heats, we could not expect as near an approach to
the proportion in their changes, because the disturbing ele
ment might be large compared to the changes in the tempera
tures, though small compared to the temperatures themselves.
As it is, the argument breaks down completely ; and the
assumption on which the supporters of the Astronomical
theory of the Ice Ages and Genial Ages rely is found to be
nothing but a vague speculation, not only unsupported by
the physical evidence bearing on the subject, but in direct
opposition to it. The weakness of the foundation, however,
has not deterred the astronomical geologists from erecting
on it an edifice of vast proportions. They affirm that there
have been a number of successive glaciations, alternating
with genial ages at intervals of about 10,500 years, that
glaciation must have been simultaneous all round the pole,
that a glacial age in the northern hemisphere must have been
accompanied by a genial one in the southern, and vice versa.
And as M. Leverrier's calculations show that the last period
of considerable eccentricity was about 100,000 years ago, the
last Ice Age must have occurred about that date. Dr. Oroll
indeed fixes all the possible dates for three million years of
past and one million of future time ; but Sir Robert Ball
declines to fix the dates, not from any want of implicit con
 fidence in the theory, but merely from a probable want of
 accuracy in the determination of the astronomical constants
involved. I imagine, however, that Sir Robert Ball would
accept as fairly reliable Leverrier's calculations for this com
paratively short period, though he does not accept those of
 Croll for the longer period. Hence we may safely assume
 with Croll, that the last Ice Age must have terminated
 80,000 years ago, if his theory be correct.
    When Croll's theory was originally published, the general
 opinion of geologists was that the date of the Ice Age as
 fixed by the theory was far too recent. But the uniformi-
 tarian school of those days has now been replaced by the
 modern school, which, relying on calculations of tho rate of
 denudation, tends to fix the glaciation of North America as
 hardly more than ten or twenty thousand years ago. Hence
 geologists are now disposed to welcome any criticism of

 546      Mr. E. P. Culverwell on the Inadequacy of the
Croll's hypothesis which tends to leave more freedom to the
somewhat fluctuating demands of their science.
   Is there, then, any physical method of estimating the
changes in midwinter temperature due to eccentricity ? The
problem is of course far too complicated to be rigorously
solved ; but happily, in respect of the direct effect of sun-
heat, we have what seems a fair and rational method of
calculation. When, in the long winter of the supposed glacial
epoch, the earth was much farther from the sun than at present,
each parallel of latitude of course received less daily winter
heat than the same parallel now receives. But let us find
what parallels of latitude now receive the same sun-heat in
winter as the parallels 40°, 50°, 60°, 70°, 80°, and the pole,
 90°, which I will call the standard parallels, received in the
 long winter of great eccentricity. I take three bases of
comparison—
   First, following Croll's method, I find that latitudes 43°,
52°, 6 1°, 70°, 80 , and 90° receive on midwinter day at present
the same sun-heat as the standard latitudes received on their
midwinter day in the period of great eccentricity.
   Now as to the temperatures. I think it is evident that the
present midwinter temperatures of 43°, 52°, &c. must, so far
as direct sun-heat is concerned, be somewhat higher than those
of the standard latitudes in the former epoch. For though
the midwinter sun-heat is the same, the standard latitudes
have had a longer period of cooling, t. e. the radiation from
them in the earlier epoch has exceeded the sun-heat received
for a few days longer than in the case of latitudes 43°, 52°,
&c. at present.
   Second. I find that latitudes 43°'3, 52°-4, 610>7, 71°-3,
81°, and 90° now receive in their winter of 179 days just the
same daily average of sun-heat as the standard latitudes received
in their supposed glacial winter of 199 days.
   In this case, though the period over which the daily supply
is taken is shorter in the case of 43°'3, 520,4, &c. than for the
standard latitudes, yet the former receive appreciably more
midwinter sun-heat than the latter ; so that whatever differ
ence of temperature there is due to the first cause will be
more or less counterbalanced by the other, and we are probably
not far wrong in saying that, so far as direct sun-heat is con
cerned, the present midwinter temperatures of latitudes 430-3,
52°-4, 61°-7, 71°-3, 81°, and 90° must be about the same
as those of 40°, 50°, 60°, 70°, 80°, and 90° were in the epoch
of great eccentricity.
   Third. I find that latitudes 44°-2, 54°, 63°-5, 74°, and
84°'5 now receive the same total sun-heat in the 199 coldest days

     Astronomical Theory of Ice Ages and Genial Ages.            547
of our year as the corresponding standard latitudes received in
the 199 coldest days of their year in the epoch ofgreat eccentricity,
that is, of course, in their winter (of course 90° cannot be
brought into this comparison). In other words, the same
daily average of sun-heat is received during the 199 days by the
corresponding latitudes in the present and former epochs.
   But it is quite evident that the present midwinter tempe
ratures of 44°-2, 54°, &c. must, so far as the direct effect of
sun-heat is concerned, be lower than the midwinter tempera
tures of the standard latitudes in the epoch of great eccen
tricity. For if the actual daily sun-heat received by latitude
44°-2 at present were the same for each of the 199 days
as that received on the corresponding day by latitude 40°
in the former epoch, then we could affirm that, so far as
sun-heat alone was concerned, the temperatures of the two
latitudes ought to be equal. But since 44a2 receives far
more than this amount of daily heat in the beginning of the
199 days, its temperature will be higher at first, and there
fore, since the total heat received up to midwinter is the
same in both cases, the temperature of the 44°"2 must be
lower at midwinter—otherwise it would be higher all the time,
which is impossible. For if it were higher all the time, it
would be constantly losing more heat by radiation; wherefore,
as it only receives the same quantity of heat, its final tempe
 rature must be lower, not higher. Thus the supposition that
the midwinter temperature of 44°2, so far as direct sun-heat
is concerned, is higher than that of 40° in the epoch of great
 eccentricity, involves an absurdity.
    So far 1 have only dealt with the effect of the winter sun-
 heat. Consider now the annual sun-heat. First, the present
 summer sun-heat on lat. 44°"2 in the remaining 166 days of
 our year is far less (9 per cent, less) than the sun-heat received
 by lat. 40° in its summer of 166 days in the period of great
 eccentricity. Hence, so far as summer sun-heat is concerned,
 latitude 44°"2 now begins its 199 days at an appreciably
 lower temperature than 40° began its 199 days in the former
 epoch, and therefore, on this account as well, its present
 midwinter temperature should be lower than the midwinter
 temperature of 40° was in the supposed glacial winter.
    Of course all the foregoing applies equally to the other
 latitudes.
    Hence we conclude that, other things equal, the direct
 effect of the altered sun-heat in the epoch of great eccentricity
 was probably to place latitudes 40°, 50°, 60° 70°, and 80° in
 about tho samo conditions as to midwinter temperature as
 43°-3, 52°-4, 61°-7, 71°-3, and 81° arc at present, and that

 548      Mr. E. P. Culverwell on the Inadequacy of the
certainly the effect icas not to lower their midwinter tempe
rature to those of 44°"20, 54°, 63°-5, 74°, and 84°-5, at the
¦present time.
    Next as to the transference of heat. Consider the latitudes
from Cornwall to the Shetland Isles, i. e. 50° to 60°. In all
probability the daily winter transference of equatorial heat
to latitude 50° in the period of great eccentricity was greater
than that to latitude 54° at present. For there is no doubt
that the greater proportion of the transference is due to
ocean currents. Now the experiments of the Prince of
 Monaco on the rate of motion of the Gulf Stream show that
between the Azores and Ireland, and between Ireland and
 Norway, it is about 3"9 miles per day, or say 10 degrees in
the half year. Hence the winter heating of the British Isles
by means of the Gulf Stream must depend very largely on
 the daily summer heat at a point about 10 degrees off on the
path of the Gulf Stream, and this was much greater during
the period of greatest eccentricity than now. For it is easy to
see by an examination of fig. 2 that during the 166 days of
that short summer, latitude 50° received more heat than is
now received in an equal time by any latitude, even in the
 tropics, while 60° received as much as 52° now receives, 70°
as much as 59°, and 80° as much as 66° now receives. Thus
when we remember how important a factor in winter tempe
rature the heat transferred by ocean currents is, it might be
plausibly maintained that the winter temperatures of the
higher latitudes were probably higher in the supposed Glacial
epoch than they are at present. But as the data are in
sufficient for obtaining a quantitative result by such arguments,
it is better to be content with the extreme temperature limit, as
fixed by the third method. This is obtained as follows :—
   As we go northwards from latitude 50° to latitude 70°
along the meridian of Greenwich we get a fall of 15° Fahr.
in the midwinter temperature. Hence in that longitude
the midwinter temperatures of latitudes 54°, 63°-5, and 74°
are about 3° Fahr. lower than those of 50°, 60°, and 70°.
Hence the fall of temperature in the epoch of greatest eccen
tricity cannot have been as much as 3° Fahr. in Great Britain,
so far as the direct effect of sun-heat is concerned.
   In mid-America and mid-Asia the change is somewhat
greater. Taking the mean as we go northward from lat. 50°
to lat. 70° along the meridians 90° W. long, and 90° E. long.,
we find that the midwinter temperature falls by 1£° Fahr. for
each degree of latitude passed over to the northward. This
would give a lowering of midwinter temperature of about
5° Fahr. for the 4 degrees of latitude by which the iso-
thermals are shifted in the epoch of greatest eccentricity.

        Astronomical Theory of Ic* Ages and Genial Ages.      549
    If, instead of taking the epoch of greatest eccentricity, we
 take the epoch of considerable eccentricity which occurred
 about 100,000 years ago, as calculated by Leverrier, we must
 take off about one fourth part from the above results.
    Since the whole of ('roll's theory of the stoppage of tho
 Gulf Stream depends on a previous vast cooling of the northern
 hemisphere (accompanied by a heating of the southern hemi
 sphere), it is evident that, unless the temperature results here
 given be utterly erroneous, they dispose once and for all of
 the Astronomical theory of the Ice Age. I have, however,
 prepared a further examination of that theory for the ' Geo
 logical Magazine ' of January 1895.
    With regard to the Genial Age, the insignificance of the
 changes effected by the astronomical cause is still more re
 markable. When the eccentricity is at its maximum, and
 the winter occurs in perihelion, it will be seen from the figure
 that the winter isothermals are shifted 2£ or 3 degrees to the
 north and the summer ones about 5 degrees to the south.
 For instance, in our coldest 166 days lat. 57°-5 receives
just the same sun-heat as lat. 60° in the 166 days of tho
" genial " winter. To dwell on the inadequacy of this as the
cause of the prevalence of tropical vegetation in Greenland
and Spitzbergen would be mere loss of time. But Croll has
an additional cause to account for a really Genial Ago at the
pole, namely, increased obliquity of the ecliptic. The maxi
mum effect of this would be to increase by about ^-s part
tho summer sun-heat received at the Poles. Hence, having
said that ^ more ice would be melted annually at the Poles
than at present, Croll proceeds to state that " the effects of
eccentricity and obliquity thus combined " [i. e., the maximum
obliquity synchronizing with the " genial " conditions of the
orbit] " would probably completely remove the polar ice-cap
from off the latter hemisphere [that enjoying the "genial"
conditions] and forest trees might then grow at the Pole."—
' Climate and Time,' 2nd edition, pp. 402—403. It is as easy
to make such assertions as this as it is difficult to adduce any
shadow of a reason in support of them. That Croll should
have been the person to make the astounding statement that
the addition of ^s part of the summer heat at the Poles would
prevent ice forming there during the winter is the more
extraordinary, because in order to get over the difficulty that
the summer heat in the supposed glacial epoch was just as
much increased as the winter heat was diminished, it was
necessary for him, throughout the earlier portion of his book,
to insist on the absolute inefficiency of summer heat to molt
ice and snow or to mitigate the effects of winter cold (see pp.
58-66 and p. 324 of ' Climate and Time ') . So far, then, as

550      Mr. B. P. Culverwell on the Inadequacy of the
this suggestion of an additional cause of the Genial Age may
require an answer, I leave Dr. Oroll's earlier pages to answer
his later ones.
   The mode in which the calculations were made must now
be explained. Originally I had intended to evaluate the
integrals which give the winter sun-heat on each latitude, but
the calculations appeared so long that I thought of using a
graphic method by photographing a terrestrial globe in various
positions. But having met with Mr. Meech's paper in vol. ix.
of the ' Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge,' I used his
values for the daily heat on each 15th day of the year for
intervals of 10 degrees of latitude as sufficiently close approxi
mations to the quantities of sun-heat received on that day and
the seven preceding and succeeding days, except in a few
cases where the rate of change varied considerably, when I
used a graphic method of interpolation by plotting the curve
on millimetre-paper. Thus I was able to get the total quantity
of sun-heat received (a) for winter and summer, using the
words in their technical sense of the intervals between the
equinoxes ; (b) for our coldest 199 days ; and (c) for our
coldest 166 days, these being the lengths of the supposed
glacial and genial winters. Of course, since the total annual
sun-heat on any latitude is independent of the length of the
seasons, it was easy to get the summer sun-heats for our 166
and 199 hottest days from these figures.
    For the purposes of this paper I reduced the numerical
values I had obtained from Mr. Meech's tables, so that the
quantity of winter or summer sun-heat falling on the equator
should be represented by 380, that being the excess of tem
 perature of the equator above Ball's " natural zero." The
 numbers thus obtained are :—
   Latitudes                    40° 50°  60°    70°     80°   90°
   Summer sun-heat              399 379  347    329     317   300
   Winter sun-heat              199 138   79     32       7     0
           coldest 199 days ... 229 101  101     48      16     5
           coldest 166 days ... 179 121   66      23      3     0
    I have plotted these numbers to scale in fig. 2.
    The " summer " and " winter " sun-heats are of course the
 same whatever be the relative lengths of those seasons. Hence
 the shift of the isothermals is shown by lengths of the inter
 cepts made by the sun-heat curves in fig. 2 on a horizontal
 line. The actual amount of the shift of the winter isothermals
in the supposed Glacial epoch, as obtained from this figure, is,
40° to 44*2, 50° to 54°, 60° to 63°-5, 70° to 74°, and 80° to

          Astronomical Theory of Ice Ages and Genial Ages.                551

    larger figure I originally made.

   There is one, and, as far as I can see, only one, objection
that can be made to the results I have obtained. It might
be urged that the winter heat at present received by lat. 54°
from ocean currents is much in excess of that received in
the epoch of great eccentricity by lat. 50°, and that there
fore lat. 54° at present may be much warmer than lat. 50°
was in the earlier epoch. The observations already made on

552.     Astronomical Theory of Ice Ages and Genial Ages.
ocean currents seem a sufficient answer, but happily the
objection can be entirely disposed of. For the transference
of heat from ocean currents to lat. 54° at present depends on
 the excess of temperature of the ocean over what I may call
 the sun-heat temperature of 54°. Hence the objection sup
poses that the present midwinter excess of ocean temperature
at 54° over the sun-heat temperature at 54° is greater than
 the excess of ocean temperature at 50° over the sun-heat
 temperature at 507 was in the epoch of great eccentricity.
 But since the present midwinter sun-heat temperature at 54°
 is the same as that at 50° in the earlier epoch, this supposition
 requires the midwinter ocean temperature to be now higher
 at lat. 54° than it was at lat. 50° in the epoch of great eccen
 tricity. But since the sun-heat temperature of the ocean at
 lat. 50° at the earlier epoch was the same as that at lat. 54°
 now, there is nothing which could tend to make the winter
 temperature of the ocean at 50° in the earlier epoch lower than
 that at 54° now, while the far greater summer heating the
 water then underwent in the lower latitudes must have made
 its winter temperature higher than it is now. Hence the
 supposition that the winter temperature of the ocean would
 be lower is disposed of for Great Britain at least *.
    Of course the foregoing argument proceeds on the sup
 position that the configuration of the land, and with it the
 general character of the ocean currents and air currents was
 the same at the epoch of great eccentricity as it is now. It
 then supplies a satisfactory proof that there is nothing in the
 astronomical causes which would alter those currents, or at
 least nothing of the nature required by Croll's theory.
    If, instead of taking the radiation proportional to the
 absolute temperature, we take Stefan's law, published in
 1881, giving it as proportional to the 4th power of the
temperature, we should reduce Croll's result by one fourth.
 Thus his 45°"3 F. would come down to 11° F.; and if we further
consider that ocean and air currents are twice as effective as
 winter sun-heat in maintaining the temperature we should get
a lowering of about 4° F. at midwinter, about the same as
the amount I arrive at otherwise. This is not quite accurate,
 for we ought to take the 4th power from zero, not from
 — 239, and also we ought to take the percentage diminution,
not of the solar heat, but of the total heat. Still the calcula
tion may help in a rough way to show the reasonableness of
the results obtained in the paper.
   * Of course in 9trict accuracy we should use in the argument not 54°
but the somewhat lower latitude whose midwinter sun-heat temperature
at present is the same as that of 50° in the period of great eccentricity.

    Galvanometer, and some Methods of Galvanometer Con
   struction. By F. L. 0. Wadsworth*.
                               [Plate XIV.]
AS considerable interest has of late been manifested, parti
        cularly in Germany, in the construction of very sensitive
galvanometers, a brief description of one, which has recently
been constructed for the bolometric work of the Observatory,
may not be out of place in connexion with my last article
(p. 482). This galvanometer in question is of the Thomson
type of construction with four coils wound under my instruc
tions by Messrs. Elliot, Bros.
    Fig. 1, Plate XIV., is a section through one of the coils
showing the contour of the individual sections, of which there
are five, of about 4 ohms each, in each coil. The size of
wire, number of turns, and resistance in each section of one
of the coils, which is typical of all of them, is given in the
following table.

554              Mr. F. L. 0. Wadsworth on a very
    Each coil was cemented by means of melted shellac into
an open brass case, which left the windings on the face of the
 coil exposed, and enabled them to be brought as close to the
needle system as possible. These brass cases screwed into
 L-sbaped supports, which rested on three adjustable screws—
 a, b, c, Plate XIV. (placed at three corners of the foot-plate of
 the L), the points of which slide in V-grooves planed in the
 metal plate which forms the base of the galvanometer-case.
 They are clamped in any desired position by means of a
 screw, d, working in a slot in the plate, as shown. This
 means of support allows the coils to be accurately centred
 with respect to each other, and, in conjunction with "the
 levelling-screws on the case, to the needle system, indepen
 dently of the adjustments of the latter. It also enables the
 coils to be readily removed whenever it is necessary to get
 at the needle, and the distance between the coils to be varied
 to increase or decrease the delicacy, without altering the
 astaticism of the system by means of a directing magnet.
    The needle system itself is shown in fig. 4 (PI. XIV.).
 The central staff is about 150 millim. long, drawn from glass
 tubing, and weighs about 5 mgs. On account of the length
 and thinness of the staff, special means of drawing it were
 necessary in order to get a perfectly straight piece.
    A good method is to clamp a selected piece of tubing,
 about 5-10 millim. in diameter, in a retort-stand so it
 hangs vertical, and attach to the lower end a 4-5 lb. weight,
 which rests on some simple form of trap 4 or 5 feet above a
 box filled loosely with waste or shavings. The tube is heated
 uniformly by two good Bunsen burners until it begins to
 soften, then the burners are removed, the trap is immediately
 sprung, and the weight fails into the box placed to receive it,
 drawing out a thin tube' of glass, the diameter of which will
depend on the length of tube which has been softened. From
a few fibres thus drawn a piece can be selected which will
be satisfactory as regards straightness and lightness.
    The two members of the system are built up each of ten
small magnets, five on each side of the staff, the central one
about 3 millim. long, and the upper and lower ones each a
 little less than 2 millim. They are made from the smallest
size sewing-needles broken to the required length, but other
wise untreated *.         They were attached to the staff by first
   * This material is unsuited for the purpose, being too soft a grade of
steel for retaining a high permanent magnetization. Some bars of special
magnet steel were ordered, but have not yet been received, and pendino-
their arrival the above material was used as the best available for the
purpose. With steel of proper size, quality, and hardness, the magnetic
moment could, I am certain, have bjen more than doubled, without any
increase in weight.

            Sensitive Form of Thomson Galvanometer.          555
 cementing each set of five, in proper position, to a piece of
 thin tissue-paper, placing two sets face downward in the
 proper position, and at the proper distance apart, on a
 glass " flat," laying the glass staff on top of them, and
 cementing it to each by means of a very small drop of thick
 shellac. When dry enough to handle, the other two sets
 were attached to the other side of the staff, opposite the first
 two, in a similar manner. The mirror was then attached
 midway between the two members by means of a minute
 fragment of soft wax (" universal "), which touched the upper
 edge only of the mirror ; a method more satisfactory than
 any other I have tried for mounting small thin mirrors with
 out distortion.
    This mirror was 2J millim. in diameter and 1 millim. radius
 of curvature. It had an accurately worked surface (by
 Brashear) (rendered necessary by the fact that it is used
 for a photographic record), and had to be therefore quite
 thick and heavy for its size. The weight of the mirror was
 about 12 mgs., and the weight of the whole system about
40 mgs. It was magnetized and astaticized after being
completed by the method described in my last article.
The system was suspended by means of a fine quartz fibre,
about 40 centim. long, whose tension was negligible. The
mothod of supporting the fibre is in some respects novel, and
has proved very successful in eliminating vibration, which, on
account of the lightness of the system, at first proved very
troublesome. The glass tube, /, of about 1 centim. bore,
which carries at its upper end the adjustable head, h, to
which the fibre is directly attached, is not directly connected
with the galvanometer-case, but is supported by two thick
rings of soft rubber, m, n, very slightly compressed between
the glass tube and an outer heavy brass tube which is
screwed to the top of the galvanometer-case. There is con
sequently no metallic or solid connexion between the fibre-
support and the rest of the instrument, and the vibration
which is communicated to the latter from the pier is absorbed
by the rubber before it reaches the needle. It is also possible
with this arrangement to attach the directing magnet to the
outer brass tube without prejudicing the steadiness of the
image during adjustment.
   The damping of the needle is effected partly by a piece of
dragonfly's wing attached to the back of the mirror and
partly by four copper rods, which slide into the cores of the
coils.
   The coils on each side are connected in series, and the
terminals brought up and connected to two copper binding-
posts on the top of the case. The two sidos could therefore

be connected either in series (resistance 86 ohms) or in
parallel (resistance 21+ ohms); or by changing two con
nexions inside the case, all four coils could be put in parallel.
Total (5 ohms) as desired.
    The case was unusually large and heavy, with brass frame
and glass sides, with all joints as air-tight as it was possible
to make them. It had the usual doors and levelling-screws.
    The constant of the galvanometer with the magnet system,
already described *, was for all coils in series, 0 = 4 X 10~",
where C, as before, is the current in amperes required to
produce a deflexion of 1 millim. at a distance of 1 metre
for a time of single swing of 10 sec. This is about the
degree of delicacy recently attained by Snow t, the constant
of whose instrument reduced to the units above used was
0 = 4-5x 10-u for a somewhat higher resistance (140 ohms).
    More recently, Paschen % has attained a degree of delicacy
considerably exceeding this by the use of an excessively light
magnetic system, which did not appear to be stable enough
to be actually used with a 10 sec. period in measurement.
    The question of the influence of the mass of the system on
the delicacy is one of importance. It was first pointed out
by Boys, and later by Paschen, that if a fixed time of vibra
tion be considered, the sensitiveness of the galvanometer
(other things being equal) will increase as the mass of the
system decreases. This has been experimentally verified by
Du Bois and Rubens, who, by the use of light magnetic
systems, have recently produced commercial galvanometers
having a sensitiveness nearly equal to that of Snow's instru
ment §.
    But the assumption of a fixed time of vibration is unfair
to the heavier systems, for it conditions them to a degree of
more and more imperfect astaticism as the weight increases.
If, instead of the condition of a fixed time of vibration, we
impose that of a fixed degree of astaticism, viz., if we make
the residual magnetic moment of the systems as a whole
constant, then the sensitiveness of the galvanometer will
increase with the mass of the magnetic system, supposing
always that the coils of the instrument are suitably propor
tioned to the needle. A better understanding of these points
is afforded by their analytical expression. We will suppose
  * As has already been stated in a previous footnote, this system could
be very sensibly improved, but as the sensitiveness of the galvanometer
even with the present system is greater than necessary, and as my time
has been fully occupied with other work, this has not yet been done.

to a circular disk whose diameter, 2 r, is equal to the length
of the longest magnet of the system, and whose thickness, w,
is such that the mass of the disk is equal to the sum of the
masses of the individual magnets *. Then the mass of the
disk will be Ar*w and its moment of inertia Hr*w. The mass
and moment of inertia of the mirror will be AV02w0 and
B'r04v0 respectively.

    The moment of the force required to produce unit
deflexion, 9, of the system is FCm ; where C is the current
flowing in the coils, m the individual magnetic moment of
one member of the system, and F a constant involving the
constant of the coils, the intensity of magnetization, &c; and
it is also equal to MH0. Therefore
                       MH = F/0Cm=F'CW,
since the magnetic moment is, for the same intensity of
magnetization in different disks, proportional to the mass of
the disk, that is to wr2.

    Hence, if t is constant, C varies as »,a plus a constant ; that
is, the sensitiveness increases somewhat less rapidly than the
mass of the system diminishes. But if no limit is imposed
on the time of vibration, but only on the final degree of
astaticism, then MH = const., hence Cm = const., or the
sensitiveness varies directly as the magnetic mass. It is
true that the conditions of use impose the former rather than
the latter limit, but for an average time of single swing of
10 sec, which is not inconveniently long, I believe that a
system weighing from 40 to 60 mgs. will be found best, for
if very great sensitiveness is required, we can use a time of
swing of from three to four times this without as great
inconvenience as would result from the use of a system only
   • It is not of importance here to consider the most effective form or
arrangement of individual magnets, as we are only considering relations
between systems of the same form, but of varying dimensions.

one tenth as heavy with a 10 sec. period. With very light
systems the mirror is unduly heavy in proportion to the
weight of the magnet systems, and the difficulty of handling,
and especially of astaticizing, is much increased. Their
principal disadvantage, however, is their extreme sensitiveness
to vibration. A system weighing 25 mgs. was first used in
the galvanometer described above, but it was found abso
lutely unfit for photographic work because of the unsteadiness
of the image.
   Indeed, even with the heavier system, the complete elimin
ation of the effects of vibration proved a troublesome problem,
for the Observatory is in close proximity to several traffic-
laden streets, and the work had necessarily, because of its
nature, to be carried on during the busiest part of the day.
Very good results were finally obtained by use of the insulated
fibre support, already described, in conjunction with the use
of rubber blocks between the slab of stone on which the
galvanometer was mounted and the pier which supported the
whole. Under very favourable circumstances a somewhat
lighter system than the one here recommended could no
doubt be used ; but in the great majority of cases I believe
that the weight should not be less than 30 to 40 mgs., and
may with advantage be considerably more.

1. TyURPOSE.—Notwithstanding the varied use which
         has been made of the telephone in electrical measure
ment, I am only aware of isolated efforts f to replace the
galvanometer by the telephone in the zero methods for elec
tromotive force. Yet, according to the earlier observers, the
telephone ought to be more than sufficient for the purpose
(§ 2). The problem suggested itself to me in connexion with
thermoelectric pyrometry, where an avoidance of the galvano
meter would often facilitate the work. Recently 1 thought
of it again in relation to certain meteorological experiments,
in which temperatures are made to vary in rapid rhythm by
condensation, and the object is to find the thermal amplitude
and the character of the oscillation. It thus becomes neces
sary to vary the electric contacts in like rhythm and to find

 the temperatures for all differences of phase between the two
 pulsations therm oelectrically by a zero method. Here, there
 fore, the instantaneous telephonic registry would have advan
 tages over the galvanometer, aiding the ear something after
 the manner in which the stroboscope assists the eye.
    Contrary to my expectations, however, great difficulty was
 encountered in endeavouring to make the telephone sensitive
 enough ; and the work resulted in showing that the range of
 increments of the magnetic field on both sides of zero, within
 which the telephone does not respond, is out of proportion
 with the sensitiveness of the instrument. It is the aim of this
 paper to find the extent and character of this silent interval,
 in its relations to the method in question.
    2. Literature.—The earlier history of the subject is sum
marized in Wiedemann's Elektricitat* , vol. iv. p. 285 (1885),
and need not be repeated here. Recently a series of remark
 able researches have appeared, due respectively to Prof. C. B.
 Cross and his pupils f and to Lord RayleighJ.                  In the
former the excursions of the telephone diaphragm are mapped
out in their dependence both on the intensity of the magnetic
field and of the actuating line-current. The occurrence of a
marked maximum of sensitiveness for a certain intermediate
value of the magnetic field is clearly shown among other data
of value. The line-currents, however, are in magnitude above
those of the present paper.
    Lord Rayleigh's recent research covers much of the ground
of my own work §, and it leads to the same order of results,
in so far as data somewhat different in character (§ 5) are
comparable. My chief reason for publishing the present
paper is, therefore, the special point of view mentioned at the
end of § 1.

reference to the construction of the key, is given in fig. 1.

    Contact is made by aid of two flat springs A and B, on
moving the plate C between them by aid of the handle or

guide D. C being wider on one side than on the other, the
circuit aEBCsra is first closed ; after this the circuit
al e AC sr a is closed; and since the shorter side of the
key C is provided with a serrated edge, sounds will in general
be heard in the telephone, T, on pushing the plate C quite
past the springs A and B either from left to right or in the
opposite direction. If the resistances r and R, are large as
compared with the rest of the circuits, the telephone will
 cease to respond when e/E = r/(R + r), which is the adjust
 ment sought.
     As the telephone is less sensitive than -a good galvanometer,
 every precaution must be taken to use it to the best advantage.
 It is necessary to pass a bifurcated tube from the sound-
 chamber to the ears, and the key mechanism A C B D should
 be placed at a distance and operated either by a long
 stick or cord, or preferably by the pneumatic device so much
 used in photography. The plate C is best made of copper
  (like the circuits), and need not be more than 2 centim. long.
 The teeth should be coarse, say about 0"5 centim. from point
 to point, and the V-shaped very thin flat spring at the end of
 A should only just touch the ends of the teeth when C moves
 across the spring. In this way a minimum of noise is made
 in the air, the successive taps are sharply individualized, and
  the circuit is kept closed only during very short intervals of
  time (avoidance of polarization). Blunt teeth were tried
  without advantage, and merely to warrant the use of equa
  tion (1), § 4.
     The construction of the key* is a matter of great import
 ance, for the sensitiveness of the method depends on it.
  Indeed I have found different telephones behave quite differ
  ently relatively to each other when the method of making the
  contact was varied ; a result agreeing with the experience of
    • Regular rhythmic interruption like that produced by a tuning-fork
 would possibly increase the sensitiveness ; but the use of such cumber
 some apparatus is of course out of the question.

Lord Rayleigh (/. c. pp. 294-5). With the key given the
sound of each tap is wheezing, so that the overtones come
into play. The enormous advantages of notes of high pitch
over those of low pitch for purposes like the present has been
shown both by Ferraris and, more remarkably, by Lord
Rayleigh.
    In addition to the Bell telephone I made use of the duplex
form* shown in fig. 2. Here A A i3 an ordinary horse-shoe
magnet provided with two similar
U-shaped armatures of soft iron                    Fig. 2.
B, B'. These carry the telephone
coils a, a', the terminals of which
lead to four clamp-screws (not
shown), so that a current may be
passed through the coils either in
series, or in parallel, or differen
tially. Between the coils the dis
coid hollow sound-chamber C 0,
 the walls of which are thin (-016
centim.) circular plates of iron, is
 secured by clamping the wide tube
 D, which conveys the sound to the
 ears, to the flat-topped upright G.
 A side view of the sound-chamber
 with its efflux-tube is shown de
 tached at CD'.         The whole is
 soldered firmly together at the
 edges, these being spaced by a
 ring of copper wire.
     The armatures B, B' are adjust
 able, and may be moved as close
 to the disk CC as desirable (set screws not shown). The
 plates of C vibrate symmetrically, changing the form from
 biconvex to biconcave, and I obtained the best results with
 chambers 4 centim. in diameter and about 02 centim. deep.
  When the chamber is more shallow the magnetic field is
 strengthened, but the sound probably encounters too much
 resistance in passing out into the air.
     In view of the large resistances R and r (fig. 1), the coils
  of the telephone were made of O01 centim. wire, wound so
  that as many as 3000 turns could be brought to bear on each
  armature, with resistances as high as 300 ohms (see table
  below). The advantage of the double form is to be found in
  the ease with which the coils may be replaced by others, in

 the economic disposition of the wire relative to resistance,
 and in the strong field of induction normally through the
 diaphragms even when the magnet A is not remarkably strong.
The chief condition of sensitiveness is close approach of the
coil ends of the armature to the two walls of the sound-
chamber, respectively. Hence this adjustment must be made
with care and the diaphragms must not buckle. I usually
placed armature and diaphragm in actual contact on one side
and all but in contact on the other, and then tapped the
sound-chamber into position.
   Among other devices for increasing the sensitiveness of the
telephone I may mention the endeavour to follow the excur
sions of the Bell diaphragm by a microphonic contact*. My
best results were obtained by soldering a platinum stylus
axially to the centre of the diaphragm. The end of the stylus
just touched a little pellicle of carbon suspended by a delicate
 spring, the arrangement being in circuit with four Leclanche
cells and a second telephone. With this relay apparatus
sounds above a certain intensity were greatly increased,
while sounds of lower intensity were either left unchanged or
even extinguished, and the degree of sonsitiveness varied too
rapidly for convenience or certainty of measurement. Simi
larly ineffectual efforts were made in adapting transformers
and condensers for the purpose.
   4. Results.—The current i' passing through the telephone
during the time of contact, considered apart from self-
induction f, may be expressed under the form
                             e       r

where / is the resistance of the shunt containing the tele
phone and the electromotive force e, R the resistance of the
shunt containing the electromotive force E, and r the resist
ance of the remaining branch circuit. If, therefore, by any
independent means the ratio <>/E has been found, equation (1)
is available lor computing i'. The necessary data are obtain
able without auxiliary measurements of e/E by taking advan
tage of loth margins of the interval of silence already alluded
to in § 1, in the way presently to be shown.
   In the following table I shall therefore, in addition to the
  * Somewhat similar experiments were made by Messrs. Thomson and
Houston ; also by Hughes and others,

                Measurement of Electromotive Force.                         563
quantities just specified, give under hi' the smallest incre
ment of i' in microamperes just audible on either side of the
interval of silence, and under Ai' the extent of this interval.
In other words, if           «'/, —h', — U are two pairs of currents
just distinguishable in loudness, one pair at each margin of
the interval of silence, then
              Si'=i((t1'-»V) + (h'-h')), Ai'=tV+tv.
Sound therefore just ceases (marked ?) for currents i2' and »/
on either side of zero, and is just audible for currents 1/ and
«Y on either side of zero. Inasmuch as the values iy i3' and
i/ ii may be considered symmetrical with respect to i' = 0,
the value of e/E can be found by taking the mean of the
measurements for t/ and i3' with an accuracy of one half the
sensitiveness of the telephone at the margins of the silent
field. It is for this reason that the inertness of the telephone
is no serious drawback, apart from the time lost in making an
extra observation. Thus, for instance, the following four
values of e/E correspond to ij', i2', i3', i4',
                  e/E = 4990, 4996, 5028, 5034,
whence, by taking symmetrical terms, e/E = 5012.

                Measurement of Electromotive Force.                565
   5. Inferences.—The chief result in these series of data (and
more might be added) is the occurrence of the silent field,
whose extent, AH, is fully 5 to even 15 times the interval, S«',
within which change of sound-intensity is appreciable when
the limits of the field in question are exceeded. Thus the
phenomenon remained unchanged in character when different
resistances r and R were introduced, when the coils of the
double telephone were replaced by others, or when the sen
sitiveness was changed in marked degree. This was also the
case with the Bell telephone for different coils, diaphragms,
keys, &c. With allowances for the difficulty of estimating
faint sounds, the extent Az' of the silent interval decreases as
the sensitiveness of the telephone increases, a result to be
anticipated ; but the case is always one involving a true dis
continuity. Thus if the intensity of the current in the helix
bo laid off as abscissa and the sound-intensity as ordinate,
one would expect to find a curve like abc (fig. 3), where the
                                 Fig. 3.
equidistant points 1, 2, 3, . . . represent appreciable differences
of loudness, and the symmetrical branches converge at the
origin of coordinates. The curve actually fouud has the form
a'b'b"c'. Sound ceases before the otherwise .audible current
increments are quite expended, so that the part V dV of the
 converging curve is truncated.
    The sensitiveness of the telephones was found to be largely
 dependent on the construction of the contact-key, a statement
 already made in § 3. However, under my best conditions
 shades of intensity of less than 10"' ampere were acoustically
 indistinguishable, not to mention the much larger interval of
 silence which intervened. The results thus obtained are,
 therefore, less encouraging than the data given in experi
 ments of De La Rue, Brougb, Pellat, Ferraris, and others*,
    * I have stated that my experiments were made at the incentive of the
 earlier researches.

 566      Telephonic Measurement of Electromotive Force.
 in all of which a current at least as small as 10~8 amperes is
 pronounced audible, would indicate, not to mention the more
 striking results of Tait and Preece. They agree in order
 with the data of Lord Rayleigh for frequencies between 300
 and 500. Perhaps, however, it would be more fitting to
 regard the extent of the silent interval as the sensitiveness of
 the telephone, in which case my results are of the order of
 those found by Lord Rayleigh for the 4-foot octave.
    Throughout my work, it will be remembered, the telephone
 was excited by isolated taps, and pains were taken to assist
 the ears by aid of sounding-tubes. One therefore expects
 a difference of behaviour in the two cases.
    In relation to the measurement of electromotive force,
therefore, the telephone does not quite come up to the
requirements. By using the shades of audibility at the mar
 gins of the silent interval for the determination, it is possible
 to define electromotive forces of the order of one volt with an
 accuracy of one in one thousand. For thermoelectric forces
like those occurring in pyromotry, the telephonic method is
availablo only in rough work. Thus a single iridio-platinum
couple (20 per cent, iridium in the alloy), with its hot junc
tion kept at low red heat, showed the following values of
apparent electromotive force, e, at the margins of the silent
field :—

   Noise.     0170    „     ) volt.              702° !  1
    The temperatures corresponding to the two apparent values
of thermoelectromotive force on each side of the silent field
have been added. Hence the interval of silence corresponds
to about 40° Centigrade ; but the sensitiveness at the margins
of the interval is such that the mean temperature deduced
is in error only 2° or 3°. However, close measurement like
this can be made only under conditions of exceptional silence
in the surroundings. In a noisy room increments of less than
10° at 1000° will escape detection, though the results will be
more favourable in proportion as temperature increases.
   In endeavouring to account for the occurrence of the silent
interval, one may note first that the thickness of the dia
phragm has little influence within the limits of "015 centim.
to *030 centim. emploj'ed. The range of silence does decrease,
however, when the telephone is made more sensitive either by
modifications of the key or, again, by moving the armatures
and coils closer to the diaphragm when other things are left
unchanged. In such cases the forces actuating the plate are

increased. To invoke the inertia of tho plate seems inad
missible, seeing that telephones with diaphragms* fifteen (15)
centimetres thick have been made to respond (Breguet).
   I have therefore hazarded a straightforward supposition f,
that the interval of silence is to bo roferrod to a molecular
inertness of the plate of the telephone very similar in its
nature to quiescent friction. Tho diaphragm at rest seems
initially to resist further deformation, and this resistance must
first be overcome before the telephone will respond with
nicety to fine gradations of the actuating stress. In other
words, as soon as tho internal friction encountered in moving
the diaphragm has passed from the quiescent to the kinetic
stage, the instrument is ten or more times more sensitive than
it was before the critical stress value had been exceeded.

LXVI. Note on the Measurement of the Specific Inductive
    Capacities of Water, Alcohol, fyc. By Reginald A.
   Fkssesden, Professor of Electrical Engineering, Western
    University of Pennsylvania %.
IT appears to have been hitherto accepted that the high
      values for the specific inductive capacities for water,
alcohol, and some other similar fluids which have been ob
tained by various experimenters are correct. If this were
so, Maxwell's rule for the relation between specific inductive
capacity and the index of refraction would not hold in
these cases for wave-lengths of visible light, and the phe
nomena of dispersion &e. have been called in to explain this
anomaly. It may be well to point out that these high values
are not correct, but that the true values are in every one of
these substances very nearly equal to that called for by the
theory.
    This fact was first noticed by the writer in 1801. A sen
sitive electrometer had been constructed, with two fixed and
one movable cylinder, mounted on jewels, and provided with
a commutator, so as to act as an electrostatic wattmeter.
With a pressure of 1000 volts on tho fixed and 50 volts on
the movable part, it made 300 revolutions per minute. At

low speeds, however, the friction threw the readings out a
good deal. It then occurred to the writer to utilize the
suggestion made by Messrs. Swinburne and Kelly for electro
static voltmeters, i. e. to immerse the instrument in oil. This
was done with good results. It was reasoned, then, that since
pure water insulates as well as indiarubber, and has, accord
ing to the experimenters referred to above, a specific induc
tive capacity of over 70, or 35 times that of oil, all difficulties
would be removed by its use. Water distilled in vacuo to
remove foreign gases was then tried, but gave no better
results than oil. The commutator was then taken off and
the movable cylinder suspended by a bifilar suspension, with
the result that in the case of oil and the alcohols the specific
inductive capacity came out very nearly equal to the square
of the refractive index, thus showing plainly that all the high
determinations hitherto given were erroneous.
   The reason of these errors was not far to seek. It lay in
the fact, pointed out by Maxwell and others, that electrolysis
gives a capacity effect. A number of determinations made
by students in my laboratory show that, for 133 periods per
second, and a current-density of "01 ampere per square centim.,
each square centim. of electrode-surface has an apparent ca
pacity of 400 microfarads when the electrolyte is caustic soda
aud the plates nickel. It is for this reason that Kohlrausch's
method almost always gives erroneous results, as what is
measured is not the resistance of the electrolyte, but its im
pedance.
   Since Messrs. Oohn and Arons, for example, used an
induction-coil to charge the plates of the electrometer im
mersed in water, it follows that the voltage on the water-
immersed quadrants might easily have been 100 times that
on the other quadrant, and that the method is inapplicable.
All capacity measurements made by discharge are also in
correct ; and the only correct method consists in purifying
the fluid till it no longer conducts appreciably, and then
measuring the attractive force between the plates when these
are charged from a continuous current source of high voltage.
Either a torsion or chemical balance may be used. A certain
amount of leakage will always take place, but this must be
provided for by using a powerful source of current.
   It might also be mentioned that all the determinations of
specific capacity of substances such as sulphur &c. are in
correct. For the reasons of this, those writers who have
treated of the capacity of laminated dielectrics may be
consulted.

 LXV1I. The Influence of the Relative Volumes of Liquid and
     Vapour on the Vapour-Pressure of a Liquid at Constant
    Temperature. By Sydney Young, JD.Sc, F.R.S., Univer
    sity College, Bristol*.
 THE question whether the vapour-pressure of a liquid at a
        given temperature depends on the relative volumes of
 liquid and vapour has been frequently discussed, and has been
 the subject of many experimental investigations. Within
 recent years extended researches on the relations between the
 temperatures, pressures, and volumes of several liquids have
 been carried out by Prof. Battelli, and he arrives at the con
 clusion that when, in a tube containing a perfectly pure liquid
 and its vapour, the volume is diminished and the vapour
 caused to condense, the vapour-pressure rises : in other words,
 that the smaller the relative volume of vapour the higher is
 the vapour-pressure.
    These results are entirely opposed to those obtained by
 Dr. Puimsay and myself and, while referring to this question
in a letter to the ' Philosophical Magazine ' last February, we
ventured to characterize the conclusions of Prof. Battelli as
incorrect, and to suggest that the error was due to the pre
 sence of small quantities of air or other impurity in the liquid
 examined and to the employment of insufficiently purified
 substances for heating-purposes.
    In a letter published in the August number of the ' Philo
 sophical Magazine ' Prof. Battelli adheres to the conclusion
previously stated, and does not admit the existence of either
of the sources of error suggested. " I would rather observe,"
 he writes, " that, in order to observe such a phenomenon, an
apparatus is necessary which enables us—as in my case—
 slowly to compress the vapour, and to maintain it for a time
 under constant pressure."
    There can be no doubt, I think, that such an apparatus is
required in order to decido the question whether the pheno*
menon exists, but it seems hardly necessary to point out that
tho conditions described are fulfilled in the apparatus em
ployed by Dr. Kamsay and myself.
    During the present year 1 have been engaged in an inves
tigation of the thermal properties of isopentane—a liquid,
boiling at 28°, which can, by suitable treatment, be obtained
in a pure state f.

570         Prof. S. Young on the Vapour-Pressure
   A great number of determinations of the vapour-pressure
of the liquid were made at various temperatures, and in many
cases the volumes of liquid and vapour were read. The
results obtained prove conclusively that the vapour -press ares
of isopentane are independent of the relative volumes of liquid
and vapour; and it may be of interest to give all the observed
vapour-pressures at two temperatures, with the corresponding
volumes of vapour and liquid.
   The same apparatus was employed as in my previous work
on benzene and its derivatives, the esters, &c. : it is similar in
principle though it differs somewhat in detail from that made
use of by Bamsay and myself (Phil. Trans. 1887 A, p. 59).
   The tube containing the isopentane was heated by the
vapour from pure liquids (Trans. Chem. Soc. 1885, p. 640 ;
1889, p. 483) boiling under reduced pressure.
   The pressures are corrected for (1) the difference in height
of the columns of mercury in the tube containing the isopen
tane and in the air-gauge ; (2) the expansion of the heated
column of mercury ; (3) the pressure of the column of iso
pentane ; (4) the deviation of air (in the air-gauge) from
Boyle's Jaw, as determined by Amagat.
   Several series of determinations were made with different
quantities of liquid in the tube. As a rule four readings of
pressure were taken in each series at each temperature.
   It will be seen that although the relative volumes of vapour
and liquid vary within very wide limits, there is no such
corresponding variation in the vapour-pressures, the greatest
difference from the mean value at 140° being slightly less
than 0-l per cent., and at 90° slightly greater—in no case
outside the limit of experimental error.
   It has happened occasionally in the course of this or pre
vious investigations that a trace of air has entered the tube
or has been left in the liquid, and in a very few cases (ethyl
formate, propyl formate) a small quantity of permanent gas
has been formed by partial decomposition of the liquid by
prolonged heating at high temperatures. The presence of
permanent gas (or of very volatile impurity) is clearly indi
cated by the increase of pressure required for the complete
condensation of the vapour, and the following points have
been noticed in such cases:— (1) The pressure does rise as the
volume of vapour diminishes ; (2) the readings taken with
diminishing volumes are higher than with increasing volumes.
This may be readily explained; for when the whole of the
substance is in the state of vapour the air is diffused uni
formly through it, and when condensation is brought about

572    Vapour-Pressure of a Liquid at Constant Temperature.
by compression the air remains to a large extent in the vapour
above the liquid and dissolves but slowly in the liquid formed;
consequently, as the volume of vapour diminishes the undis
solved air becomes more and more compressed, and its pres
sure increases and becomes considerable when the vapour is
nearly all condensed. Similarly, with an impurity more
volatile than the pure substance, a partial " fractionation "
of the liquid takes place, the less volatile pure substance
condensing first, whilst the vapour becomes more and
more contaminated with the more volatile impurity.
   On the other hand, when the readings are taken with
increasing volume, the air or volatile impurity is at first
 uniformly distributed through the liquid, and it escapes but
slowly through the long column of liquid into the vapour
above. Thus when a reading is taken with a relatively small
volume of vapour, the air present has a much greater influenco
in the first case than the second, but when the volume of
 vapour is relatively large its influence is small in both
 cases. I have noticed repeatedly that the freer a liquid is
 from air or permanent gas, the more closely do the readings
 during compression and expansion agree.
    The presence of a small quantity of impurity less volatile
 than the pure substance may escape detection so long as the
 volume of liquid, relatively to that of the vapour, is fairly
 large ; but its influence becomes very marked when the
 quantity of liquid is relatively very small. Thus, on one
 occasion, the isopentane had come in contact for a moment
 with an indiarubber tube and had, no doubt, dissolved a
 minute quantity of it. It was noticed in this case that the
 mercury was slightly tarnished (owing in all probability to
 the sulphur in the indiarubber), but the vapour-pressures,
 when there was plenty of liquid present, agreed among them
 selves and with previous determinations. When, however,
 the volume was increased until nearly the whole of the liquid
 was evaporated, the observed vapour-pressures were far too
 low, and diminished rapidly as the volume was increased.
    In this case and in those in which the presence of any
 permanent gas was detected, the experimental results were
 rejected and the tube was refilled.

Isle of Skye." By Sir Archibald Geikie, LL.D., D.Sc, F.R.S., F.G.S.,
and J. J. H. Teall, Esq., M.A., F.B.S., Sec.G.S.
    After calling attention to the previous references to the pseudo-
bedding and banding of the gabbro-masses of the Inner Hebrides,
the authors describe the rocks which form the rugged ridge
of Druim-an-Eidhne, near tho head of Glen Sligachan. This
ridge i8 made up of parallel beds, sheets, or sills disposed in a
general N.N.W. direction with a prevalent easterly dip. Four
distinct types of gabbro occur :— (1) dark, fine-grained, granulitic
gabbros ; (2) well-banded gabbros ; (3) coarse-grained massive
gabbros ; and (4) pale veins of a highly felspathic gabbro. The
relative ages of the banded and granulitic gabbros have not been
definitely settled ; but the coarso, massive gabbros are certainly
intrusive in the banded series and the pale veins cut all tho other
varieties.
    The paper deals mainly with the banded gabbros. They occur
 in successive sheets or sills which vary from a few feet to many
 yards in thickness, and consist of parallel layers of lighter and
 darker material which correspond in direction with the trend of
 the sheets, and are usually inclined to the east or south-east at
 angles ranging from 20° to 30°. In some cases the bands can be
 seen to have been puckered or folded.
    The minerals entering into the composition of the banded, as also
 of the other varieties, are labradorite, pyroxene, olivine, and titani-
 ferous magnetite. The banding is due to a variation in the relative
 proportions of the different constituents and especially in the amount
 of magnetite. Somo narrow bands and lenticles are composed
 entirely of pyroxene and magnetite. The variations in chemical
  composition are illustrated by three analyses by Mr. Player. The
  microscopic characters of the rocks are described, and it is shown
  that the minerals of the banded gabbros have not been crushed or
  broken since they were formed.
     The authors conclude that the banding is the result of the intru
  sion of a heterogeneous magma and that similar banding in certain
  portions of the Lewisian gneiss may have been produced in the same
  way.

M.A., F.G.S.                                       •
    The paper deals with the petrography of the Toadstones or
 igneous rocks of Derbyshire. Brief reference is made to the work
 of previous petrographers, the age of the rocks, and the question as
to the number of beds. The outcrops mapped by the Geological
Survey, and several additional ones, have been' examined, and the
results given in a table for the purpose of the paper and for future
reference.
    The Toadstone is divided into massive rocks or lavas, and frag-
 mental rocks or tuffs. The former consist of olivine-dolerite, either
with granular or with ophitic augite, and olivine-basalt. The rock
 is often very fresh, but in some places is altered to a diabase. The
 principal constituent minerals are described. A pseudomorph of
 olivine, optically like biotite and somewhat like Iddingsite but
 differing from it chemically, is fully described.
    The latter portion of the paper deals with the tuffs, which are
much more extensive than has been hitherto supposed. Specimens
are described, taken from thirteen outcrops.
    3. ' On the Origin of the Permian Breccias of the Midlands, and
a Comparison of them with the Upper Carboniferous Glacial
Deposits of India and Australia.' By B. D. Oldham, Esq., F.G.S.
    The author first describes the Permian Breccias of the Midland
Counties of England, which he had the opportunity of examining at
Eastertide of the present year. He describes the characters of the
Breccias, and concludes that they were formed subaerially as gravel-
fans by rivers charged with a maximum load of sediment, and
therefore incapable of performing any appreciable amount of erosion,
An examination of many of the fragments at Abberley and somo at
Church Hill reveals the presence of scratches, which occur in such
a manner that the author believes they existed on the fragments
before they were transported, and discusses the evidence for their
production by ice or 6oil-cap movement, deciding in favour of the
former.
   A short description of the Upper Carboniforous deposits of India
follows, and it is pointed out that they differ markedly from tho
deposits of Britain. Amongst other things the separation of different
pebbles by considerable interspace of matrix, and the bending of
stratification-planes round a pebble as though the pebble had
dropped from above, is noted, and it is maintained that floating ice
alone will account for these pebbles being dropped into the Indian
deposits. Finally, it is remarked that the so-called Upper Car
boniferous deposits of India and the Permian deposits of the
Midlands of Britain may be practically contemporaneous, as main
tained by the late Mr. H. F. Blanford, indicating a possible
simultaneous existence of glaciers in England, India, and Australia.

    The interest of the Culford boring centres in its striking the
Palaeozoic floor at the small depth of 637 1 feet ; but the age of the
slaty rocks cannot be determined. Although only 20 miles east of
Ely, no Jurassic rocks exist and the Lower Cretaceous series is only
 about 32 feet thick, the beds differing greatly from those of Cam
bridgeshire but resembling those of the same age in the Richmond
 boring.
    The Winkfield boring (3| miles W.8.W. of Windsor) is remarkable
for having been successful in obtaining water from the Lower
 Greensand, and for the great depth (1243 feet) to which it was
 carried for this purpose, the Gault being unusually thick.
    The boring at Ware is now for the first time described in detail,
 and former accounts are corrected from specimens preserved by the
 New River Company. By this means, and with the assistance of
 Mr. W. Hill, the authors are able to give a fairly complete account
 of the rocks and to determine the limits of the divisions of the
 Upper Cretaceous Series. They deny the existence of Lower
 Greensand at this locality.
    Of the boring at Cheshunt a more complete account is now given,
 based on information and specimens supplied by Mr. J. Francis, the
 Engineer of the New River Company.
    The paper concludes with a tabular view of all the borings in the
East of England, showing the level below Ordnance datum at which
 the Palaeozoic floor occurs in each.

diabase-porphyrite is intrusive in the andesite, and the diabase in
tho Llandeilo Shales. The andesitic ash rests on the andesite, and
is overlain by the Llandeilo Shales. The author concludes that the
andesites, andesitic ash, rhyolites, and diabase-porphyrite are of
Lower Llandeilo age ; and that the diabases are post-Llandeilo and
pre-Llandovery.

similar.

evidence be found in favour of the alleged unconformity, and that

          ON THE ENERGY OF THE AMPERIAN MOLECULE.
              To the Editors of tin Philosophical Magazine.
       Gentlemen,
 \X7"ITH reference to the paper by Mr. Fawcett and myself
    "    published in your last issue, Prof. Oliver Lodge has kindly
sent me the following interesting considerations.
   If temperature is due solely to transnational and vibrational
motions of molecules, it is possible that an appreciable time may
be required before the sudden alteration of the rates of rotation
of the molecules of a piece of iron can cause an alteration in the
temperature of a neighbouring thermopile. It follows that, if this
be so, an inseparable connexion may still exist between molecular
spin and molecular magnetism, in spite of our negative result.
   It is true that our experiments lasted on the average from two
to three minutes, and in two cases for four minutes and a half,
 without any marked temperature effect appearing ; but an exami
 nation of our results in the light of Dr. Lodge's suggestion does
 certainly show that in every case (except curve /, where the tem
 perature was probably changing rather rapidly) there is a very
 slight upward tendency ot the curve after the first sudden bend is
 over, which is in the direction of the effect sought ; and this ten
 dency is also most conspicuous in the earlier readings (p. 477),
 where the time-interval was greatest.
    I confess that it had not occurred to me as possible that several
 minutes might elapse before an alteration in the rotations of a set
 of molecules could make itself felt in their translational velocities,
and for molecules consisting of more than one atom this still
 seems to me very unlikely ; but if the rotations dealt with are
 those of single atoms spinning about their own centres, between
 which it is perhaps not unreasonable to assume the absence of any
 marked tangential forces during collision [and I take this to be the
 case contemplated by Dr. Lodge], there seems to be no reason why

the time of adjustment or distribution of energy among the degrees
of freedom should not extend to long periods.
   The difficulties connected with auy considerable increase in the
duration of the experiments will undoubtedly be great, as it will
be necessary to maintain the temperature so very uniform ; but
we hope shortly to attack the problem again from this point of
view.

ON THE PROPAGATION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES IN ICE,
    AND ON THE DIELECTRIC TOWER OF THIS SUBSTANCE. BY
    M. BLONDLOT.
    In a previous note (Oomptes Eendns,J\ilj2o, 1892) 1 enunciated
 the following proposition :—The length of the waves which an
electromagnetic oscillation can emit is the same whatever be the
insulating medium in which the experiment is made; in other
words, the wave-length depends on the oscillator alone, just as in
acoustics the wave-length of a pipe depends only on the length of
the pipe.
     The confirmatory experiments described in the Note cited
 referred to oil of turpentine and to castor-oil ; the law holds
perfectly for both these substances, and everything leads to the
 belief that this will be the same for other dielectrics.
    There is, however, a doubt about ice, in consequence of the
exceptional properties ascribed to it. The experiments of M. Bouty
{Comptes Itendus, March 7, 1892) show in fact that ice has a di
electric power of 27, that is to say incomparably greater than that
of all other substances. Suspecting that the law relative to the
propagation of waves might not apply to a dielectric so different
from the others, I resolved to submit the question to experiment.
    For these investigations I availed myself of the intense and
prolonged frosts of the winter of 1892-93. M. M. Dufour has
helped me in carrying them out, which the rigour of the cold
rendered difficult and even painful. I thank him for his extreme
kindness on this occasion.
   The method which I adopted was the following, which, with
slight modifications necessitated by the solid character of the di
electric, is the same as that I used in the case of turpentine and
castor oil.
   Electromagnetic waves were transmitted along two tinned copper
wires 2*5 millim. in diameter, stretched horizontally and parallel
to each other at a distance of 0-8 metre. A resonator of gilt
copper is placed in a fixed position between the wires ; the portion
of the transmitting wires beyond the resonator is contained in a
wooden trough 4 metres in length. The trough being filled with
liquid, the position is sought at which a movable bridge must be
placed joining the wires beyond the resonator to cause the spark
to disappear ; the distance from the bridge to the resonator is then

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            579
a quarter of the specific wave-length of the resonator ; the position
of the bridge is accurately noted.
    That done, I surround the part of the resonator forming
the condenser with a watertight bag of parchment-paper which I
fill with distilled water, and then freeze this water ; the layer of
air is thus replaced by one of ice. Measuring the wave-length
afresh, it is found to be considerably greater than in the first
                              141
experiment, having become =-^- of what it was.
    The trough is then filled with water which is frozen, and then
the position of the bridge for disappearance of the spark is again
sought. For tliis purpose the ice at the distant end of the trough
is broken and progressively removed. I ascertained that this
position is exactly the same as in the first case, when the dielectric
was air.
    The experiment four times repeated, varying each time the
capacity of the condenser, always gave the same result. The pro
position relative to the wave-length is therefore true for ice as
well as for other dielectrics. Hence, as shown in my previous
Note, Maxwell's relation that the dielectric power is also equal to
the square of the refractive index also holds for electromagnetic
waves in the case given.
   The preceding results, partly unforeseen, led me to determine
the dielectric constant of ice, using electromagnetic undulations.
The experiment cited above gave all the data necessary for this
determination.
    For if X and X, are the wave-lengths corresponding to a given
resonator, working respectively in air and in a substance of dielec
tric power K, we have
    As stated above, I found
                              V = 141
                             X     100'
whence                K=2 in round numbers.
    The experiment repeated a dozen times always gave the same
result. I consider the relative error does not exceed -£$, for the
plate of ice was almost entirely free from air-bubbles. According
to this, ice docs not present exceptional dielectric properties.
    It remains to be explained how MM. Bouty and A. Perot
obtained values of a totally different order for the dielectric power
of ice. In the first place, in M. Bouty's method the charge and
discharge were enormously slower than in my experiments. Is it
not probable, then, that the physical magnitudes measured by
M. Bouty and myself were in themselves very different. In any
case we know at present too little about the dielectric properties
of bodies to be surprised at the divergences of numbers obtained
by two methods so dissimilar, however great they are.— Compter
